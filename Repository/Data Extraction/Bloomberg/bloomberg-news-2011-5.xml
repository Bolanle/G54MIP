&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett, who invested $5
billion in Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) at the depths of the
financial crisis, said he plans to retain warrants in the bank
in a bet its shares will increase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will keep them very close to their expiration,&#8221;
Buffett said yesterday at a press conference in Omaha, Nebraska,
where his Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) is based. &#8220;At some point,
we&#8217;re likely to exercise the warrants.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire holds warrants, expiring in 2013, to buy $5
billion in New York-based Goldman Sachs&#8217;s common stock at $115 a
share as a result of his 2008 preferred investment in the
company. The bank closed at $151.01 on April 29 on the New York
Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett&#8217;s support boosted Berkshire&#8217;s profit and buoyed New
York-based Goldman Sachs as the bank navigated the credit crunch
and was criticized by lawmakers. Goldman Sachs in March won
Federal Reserve approval to redeem the $5 billion in preferred
shares, which paid 10 percent annual interest to Berkshire.
Goldman also had to pay a $500 million fee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire&#8217;s warrants have generated a paper profit of more
than $1.5 billion based on the April 29 stock price. Goldman
Sachs has declined 10 percent this year, compared with the 8.4
percent advance of the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. First-
quarter profit slipped 21 percent to $2.74 billion, beating
analysts&#8217; estimates on gains in investments, Goldman Sachs said
April 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less Leverage &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;U.S. banking profitability will be considerably less in
my view in the period ahead than it was in the early part of
this century,&#8221; Buffett said April 30 at the annual meeting of
Berkshire shareholders in Omaha. &#8220;A very important reason is
that the leverage will be reduced&#8221; as regulators tighten
capital rules, he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s probably a good thing for
society. That may be a bad thing for banks who can use leverage
intelligently.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett, whose relationship with Goldman Sachs dates to his
childhood when he met with an executive of the company, defended
the firm and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein at
Berkshire&#8217;s annual meeting in 2010 after the bank was sued by
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs settled the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit in July by agreeing
to pay $550 million, and said it made a mistake in omitting
disclosure to investors. The SEC had said that Goldman Sachs
clients weren&#8217;t told when they invested in a collateralized debt
obligation from the bank that a hedge fund picked mortgages in
the investment and was betting on them to fail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett, who also makes derivative bets through Goldman
Sachs as Berkshire&#8217;s CEO, has said it makes no difference who is
on the other side of a trade and that it is an investor&#8217;s duty
to independently assess risk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the largest U.S.
oil company, flared gases at its Joliet refinery in Channahon,
Illinois, according to a filing with state regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The filing to the Illinois Emergency Management Agency said
malfunctioning equipment caused the flaring, which began at 2:45
a.m. yesterday and ended three minutes later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refinery outages can increase prices for refined products
as refiners turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts. Operational disruptions can also depress prices for
crude oil because less feedstock is needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery has a processing capacity of 248,000 barrels a
day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Citigroup Inc. (C)
and three other banks helped to push Thornburg Mortgage Inc.
into a &#8220;free-fall&#8221; bankruptcy, the insolvent firm&#8217;s trustee
said in a lawsuit seeking to recover $2 billion for creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After making &#8220;unjustified&#8221; margin calls, the banks
extracted more than $700 million of margin and interest payments
from Thornburg, then sold their collateral and left the company
to file for Chapter 11 protection during the credit crisis in
May 2009, trustee Joel Sher said in an April 30 filing in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Baltimore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sher, who is liquidating the firm, now called TMST Inc.,
accused the banks of using &#8220;market disruption as a
justification to initiate a collusive scheme to take control of
the debtors and eventually drive them into bankruptcy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the suit is without merit,&#8221; Danielle Romero- Apsilos, a Citigroup spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. Joseph Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are sometimes targeted by bankrupt companies that are
trying to recover money for creditors. Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. (LEHMQ) sued JPMorgan for $8.6 billion, saying the bank helped to
cause its downfall. The trustee liquidating Bernard Madoff&#8217;s
defunct firm is demanding $6.4 billion from the bank, accusing
it of assisting Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme. JPMorgan is fighting both
lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and UBS
AG, or their affiliates, also are defendants in the lawsuit.
JPMorgan was named because it bought assets from Bear Stearns
Cos., a lender to Thornburg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Geller, a Royal Bank of Scotland spokesman, and
Duncan King, a Credit Suisse spokesman, declined to comment, as
did Torie von Alt, a UBS spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trustee last year sued former Thornburg executives,
saying they conspired to start a new business using cash and
information taken from the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thornburg was organized as a real estate investment trust
and mainly invested in residential mortgage-backed securities.
Assets totaled $24.4 billion as of Jan. 31, 2009, according to
court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has a $386 million claim against Thornburg, and
Citigroup said it is owed more than $395 million, according to
Sher&#8217;s filing. Both banks are based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sher filed eight lawsuits from April 28 to April 30,
seeking money from Barclays Plc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank
of America Corp. and other companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy case is Thornburg Mortgage Inc., 09-17787,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Maryland (Baltimore). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American International Group Inc. (AIG)
should pay more than $1.5 billion to rivals to settle a lawsuit
alleging the insurer cheated industry-funded pools that cover
injured workers, Liberty Mutual Holding Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed damages are more than triple the $450 million
that AIG agreed to in a preliminary settlement advocated by
seven insurers, including Travelers Cos. (TRV) and Ace Ltd., in
January. The higher payout is justified because the settlement
didn&#8217;t account for the full scope of AIG&#8217;s underreporting of
premiums, Liberty Mutual&#8217;s Safeco and Ohio Casualty subsidiaries
said in federal court documents filed April 28 in Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement &#8220;is detrimental to the class of over 500
insurance companies victimized by AIG&#8217;s admitted wrongdoing,&#8221;
Boston-based Liberty Mutual said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;AIG is confident the settlement will go forward and be
approved despite Liberty&#8217;s repeated efforts to undo it,&#8221; Mark
Herr, a spokesman for New York-based AIG, said in an e-mail.
&#8220;Liberty&#8217;s opposition is the latest in a long line of desperate
attempts to derail a settlement supported by the 50 state
insurance departments and the other insurance companies in the
litigation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liberty Mutual filed a lawsuit in 2009 seeking $1 billion
and alleging that AIG shortchanged state insurers of last resort
by &#8220;long-term fraudulent underreporting&#8221; of premiums it made
selling workers&#8217; compensation coverage. The firm requested
class-action status for the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state pools, which cover injuries at employers that
pose unattractive risks, are funded by contributions from
carriers that offer the coverage and are based on their sales in
the private market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG agreed to pay $100 million in fines and $46.5 million
in taxes and assessments to resolve a 50-state probe into
cheating state workers&#8217; compensation funds, the Pennsylvania
insurance regulator said in December. The deal with the states,
mostly covering conduct before 1996, is contingent on AIG&#8217;s
settlement with rival insurers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Safeco Insurance Company of America v. American
International Group Inc. 1:09-cv-02026, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of Illinois (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Barclays to Make New Claim Against Lehman Brokerage &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc (BARC), which bought Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.&#8217;s
North American business, plans to pursue &#8220;new arguments&#8221;
claiming &#8220;several billion dollars&#8221; from the trustee
liquidating the remnants of the brokerage, the trustee said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays and trustee James Giddens are disputing $3.5
billion in assets after a judge&#8217;s ruling that failed to specify
how much Barclays was entitled to when it bought bankrupt
Lehman&#8217;s business in September 2008. In a court filing, Giddens
said the U.K. bank&#8217;s lawyers told him that Barclays in addition
will claim unspecified billions for closing out $6 billion of
so-called short positions in derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The claim will be &#8220;purportedly to compensate Barclays for
assuming some $6 billion in short derivative positions that
Barclays claims it was not otherwise required to cover,&#8221; he
said in the filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan April
28. Short positions are closed out by purchasing the securities
previously sold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays said the claim isn&#8217;t new, and is part of the
ongoing dispute. &#8220;To the contrary, we are trying to implement
the court&#8217;s decision in a way that is consistent with the law,&#8221;
Michael O&#8217;Looney, a Barclays spokesman, said in an e-mail April
29. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck directed Barclays and
Giddens to interpret a ruling he made in February granting the
London-based bank some assets and denying it some others,
including cash. The dispute resumed with court filings April 28,
in which Barclays asserted its right to assets claimed by the
trustee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays must deliver $1.8 billion in so-called margin
assets and pay interest at 9 percent, the trustee said as part
of his demands. Barclays, saying it was entitled to the $1.8
billion, accused the trustee of seeking a &#8220;windfall&#8221; of
interest payments for 2 1/2 years, at punitive rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The court should resist the trustee&#8217;s effort to reap such
a windfall,&#8221; Barclays said in the filing. &#8220;There is no
economic justification.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New Suits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Android Phone Users Sue Google Over Alleged Location Tracking &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Android phone users sued Google Inc. (GOOG) over claims their
phones secretly recorded and stored data about their movements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two residents of Oakland County in Michigan said in a
complaint filed April 27 in federal court in Detroit that their
HTC Inspire 4G phones, which use Google&#8217;s Android Operating
System, track their whereabouts &#8220;just as if by a tracking
device for which a court-ordered warrant would ordinarily be
required.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs seek to represent other Android phone users
in a class-action lawsuit, as well as at least $50 million in
damages and a court order requiring Google to stop tracking its
products&#8217; users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google and Apple Inc. (AAPL) are facing scrutiny from consumers
and lawmakers over the collection of data on smart phones. Both
companies have agreed to testify at a May 10 Senate hearing
about consumer privacy on mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Gaither, a spokesman for Mountain View, California-based Google, declined to comment on the lawsuit April 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We provide users with notice and control over the
collection, sharing and use of location&#8221; on Androids, Gaither
had said in an e-mail on April 27 regarding lawmakers&#8217; concern
over data collection. &#8220;Any location data that is sent back to
Google location servers is anonymized and is not tied or
traceable to a specific user.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Julie Brown v. Google, 11-11867, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of Michigan (Detroit). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Goldman, JPMorgan Among 16 Banks Targeted by EU in Swaps Probe &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), JPMorgan Chase  Co. and 14 other
investment banks face the first-ever European Union antitrust
probes into the swaps market, following investigations by U.S.
regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU is examining whether 16 banks, including Citigroup
Inc. (C) and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), colluded by giving market information
to Markit Group Ltd., a data provider majority-owned by Wall
Street&#8217;s largest banks. It will also check if nine of the firms
struck unfair deals with Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (ICE)&#8217;s
European derivatives clearinghouse, shutting out rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Lack of transparency in markets can lead to abusive
behavior and facilitate violations of competition rules,&#8221;
Joaquin Almunia, the EU&#8217;s competition commissioner, said in an
e-mailed statement. &#8220;I hope our investigation will contribute
to a better functioning of financial markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global regulators have sought to toughen regulation of the
$583 trillion credit-default swaps market, saying the trades
helped fuel the financial crisis. The EU&#8217;s probes add to
separate investigations in the U.K. and U.S. into whether banks
colluded to manipulate the London interbank offered rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The credit-default swap investigations are the first by
antitrust regulators in Europe. The U.S. Justice Department&#8217;s
probe of the credit derivatives clearing, trading and
information services industries is &#8220;ongoing,&#8221; spokeswoman
Alisa Finelli said April 29. The department first confirmed the
investigation in July 2009. She declined to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markit &#8220;does not believe it has engaged in any
inappropriate conduct,&#8221; Michael Gormley, a spokesman for the
company in New York, said in an e-mailed statement. Bloomberg
LP, the owner of Bloomberg News, competes with Markit in selling
information to the financial-services industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp., Barclays Plc, BNP Paribas SA (BNP),
Commerzbank AG (CBK), Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA),
Morgan Stanley (MS), Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS), UBS AG (UBSN), Wells
Fargo  Co. (WFC), Credit Agricole SA and Societe Generale SA will
also be investigated for possible collusion in giving &#8220;most of
the pricing, indices and other essential daily data only to
Markit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs declined to comment on the probe, said
Michael Duvally, a spokesman for the bank in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank, JPMorgan, Bank of America, BNP
Paribas, Morgan Stanley, Barclays, UBS, Credit Suisse, RBS,
Societe Generale, HSBC, Wells Fargo and Citigroup also declined
to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Rajaratnam Insider Jury to Resume Deliberations Next Week &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury in the insider-trading trial of Galleon Group LLC
co-founder Raj Rajaratnam finished deliberating for the week
without reaching a verdict and is set to return May 2 to resume
weighing evidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jurors in Manhattan federal court put in a half-day April
29 before leaving for the weekend. They submitted no notes to
the judge and haven&#8217;t asked to review evidence since April 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nine women and three men have deliberated for about 29
hours since U.S. District Judge Richard Holwell instructed them
on the law on April 25. In that time, they have asked to hear
about 15 wiretap recordings of Rajaratnam&#8217;s telephone calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, 53, was arrested in October 2009 in the largest
crackdown on hedge-fund insider trading in U.S. history.
Prosecutors said he gained $63.8 million from tips leaked by
corporate insiders and hedge-fund traders about 15 stocks,
including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Intel Corp. (INTC) and Clearwire
Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, who said he based the trades on research, is
charged with five counts of conspiracy and nine counts of
securities fraud. He faces as long as 20 years in prison if
convicted of the most serious charges. The trial began March 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-01184, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Malone&#8217;s Liberty Media Wins Judge&#8217;s Ruling on Starz Splitoff &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John C. Malone, the billionaire chairman of Liberty Media
Corp., won a ruling from Delaware Chancery Court Judge J. Travis
Laster that his splitoff of the Capital Group and Starz Group
won&#8217;t violate an agreement involving Bank of New York Mellon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liberty sued the bank as bond trustee in August asking the
Wilmington court to declare that the splitoff wouldn&#8217;t
constitute a disposition of assets upon which bondholders have
claims, Laster said in a 35-page ruling released April 29. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Liberty did not engage in an &#8216;overall scheme&#8217; to sell
substantially all its assets,&#8221; and &#8220;is entitled to a
declaration that the Capital splitoff does not violate&#8221; the
contract provision, Laster wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Englewood, Colorado-based Liberty said last June it planned
to separate the Liberty Capital and Liberty Starz tracking stock
groups from Liberty Interactive tracking stock group, in part as
an efficiency move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Liberty Media Corp. v. The Bank of New York
Mellon Trust Co., CA5702, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tobacco Industry Doesn&#8217;t Owe Missouri Hospitals, Jury Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tobacco companies aren&#8217;t liable to Missouri hospitals for
money spent on care of patients with smoking-related illnesses
who couldn&#8217;t pay their medical bills, a St. Louis jury said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 40 Missouri hospitals sued Altria Group Inc. (MO)&#8217;s Philip
Morris unit, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Lorillard Tobacco Co.
and other cigarette makers in 1998, claiming they manipulated
the nicotine content in cigarettes and misrepresented the health
effects of smoking. The hospitals were seeking more than $455
million in damages, ranging from about $300,000 for some to
$86.4 million for the Truman Medical Center in Kansas City. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry&#8217;s actions boosted the amount spent on
unreimbursed and uncompensated tobacco-related health care, the
hospitals claimed. The tobacco companies denied any
responsibility for patient-care costs at the hospitals or any
financial losses by the hospitals. The state-court jury in St.
Louis rejected April 29 the hospitals&#8217; claims on a 9-3 vote in
the seventh day of deliberations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is City of St. Louis v. American Tobacco Co., cv
982-09652-01, Circuit Court, City of St. Louis, Missouri. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Court Filings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Suit Alleging Banks Manipulated Libor Most Popular Docket &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawsuit that accused Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM), HSBC Holdings Plc, Barclays Bank Plc, Citibank NA
and Credit Suisse Group AG of conspiring to manipulate the
London interbank offered rate was the most-read litigation
docket on the Bloomberg Law system last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks sold Libor-based futures, options, swaps and
derivative instruments &#8220;at artificial prices that defendants
caused,&#8221; harming investors, FTC Capital GmbH of Vienna, FTC
Futures Fund SICAV of Luxembourg and FTC Futures Fund PCC Ltd.
of Gibraltar said in an April 15 complaint in New York federal
court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2006 to 2009, the banks &#8220;collectively agreed to
artificially suppress the Libor rate,&#8221; and in early 2008,
&#8220;during the most significant financial crisis since the Great
Depression,&#8221; the rate remained steady when it &#8220;should have
increased significantly,&#8221; the funds contend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is FTC Capital v. Credit Suisse, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Novell Inc. (NOVL)&#8217;s antitrust lawsuit
against Microsoft Corp., accusing the world&#8217;s largest software
maker of undermining Novell&#8217;s WordPerfect program, was revived
by a U.S. appeals court in Virginia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal appeals court in Richmond today said Novell
didn&#8217;t give up its right to pursue the lawsuit when it
transferred its claims related to its personal computer
operating system products to Caldera Inc. in 1996. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Although the underlying lawsuit involves complex issues
of antitrust law, the primary question before us is one of
contract interpretation: whether a 1996 contract between Novell
and a third company divested Novell of its right to bring the
present claim,&#8221; Judge Allyson Duncan wrote in the 2-1 decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Kutz, a spokesman for Microsoft, said the company
doesn&#8217;t think Novell&#8217;s case has any merit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are disappointed with the Fourth&#8217;s Circuit&#8217;s decision
to reverse in part the district court&#8217;s summary judgment ruling
which dismissed these very old claims, although we are pleased
that at this point only one part of one of Novell&#8217;s claims
remains,&#8221; said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ian Bruce, a spokesman for Novell, didn&#8217;t immediately
return a phone message and an e-mail message seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed in 2004, is a byproduct the U.S.
government&#8217;s landmark case against Microsoft that was settled
more than eight years ago after the Redmond, Washington-based
company was declared an illegal monopolist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novell, which briefly owned WordPerfect in the mid-1990s,
alleged Microsoft&#8217;s anticompetitive tactics undermined the
product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dissenting Appeals Judge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a dissent, Judge Clyde Hamilton said U.S. District Judge
J. Frederick Motz in Baltimore correctly dismissed the case last
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPerfect&#8217;s share of the word-processing market fell to
less than 10 percent in 1996 from almost 50 percent in 1990. Its
value dropped from $1.2 billion in May 1994 to $170 million in
1996 when it was sold to Ottawa-based Corel Corp., Novell said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novell, which was purchased by Seattle-based Attachmate
Corp. last month, is seeking three times its losses, or as much
as several billion dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novell settled separate antitrust claims against Microsoft
for $536 million in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Novell Inc. v. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), 10-1482, U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (Richmond). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Walt Disney Co. (DIS) unit sued Dish
Network Corp. (DISH), the second-largest U.S. satellite-TV provider,
for copyright violations in connection with the distribution of
movies on the Starz service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dish was accused of giving subscribers free access to the
Starz premium television service, including copyrighted movies
that were provided by Disney on the condition that Starz operate
as a premium channel such as HBO, Cinemax and Showtime, the suit
says. Starz, a unit of John Malone&#8217;s Liberty Media Corp., wasn&#8217;t
named in the suit filed yesterday in federal court in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Dish&#8217;s unlawful distribution, transmission, copying and
public display and/or performance of the Starz programming,
including Disney Enterprises&#8217; copyrighted movies, has already
resulted in the repeated and continuing infringement of
plaintiffs&#8217; copyright rights,&#8221; the suit says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dish, which agreed along with EchoStar Corp. (SATS) yesterday to
pay TiVo Inc. (TIVO) $500 million to settle patent litigation, said in
a statement that it pays &#8220;hundreds of millions of dollars&#8221; for
the right to distribute Starz content to its customers,
including the rights to several Disney movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Dish Network does not have visibility to the contract
between Starz and Disney, but we will vigorously defend our
rights against any attempt to drag customers into the middle of
their dispute,&#8221; Englewood, Colorado-based Dish Network said in
an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starz also filed a lawsuit today against Dish Network in
Colorado District Court in Douglas County, accusing it of
violating an agreement between the two companies that allows
Dish to offer Starz television channels to subscribers,
according to a copy of the complaint provided by Starz.
Eric Becker, a spokesman for Starz, declined additional comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Disney Enterprises Inc. vs. Dish Network LLC,
11-cv-2973, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chief Executive Officer
Ian Read said he is reviewing the possible sale or spinoff of
four divisions with $18.3 billion in annual revenue, led by the
company&#8217;s third-biggest unit, established products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results of the division reviews will be announced in the
second half this year and in early 2012, Read said today in a
telephone interview. The emerging-markets portion of New York-
based Pfizer&#8217;s established-products business is big enough to
stand on its own, with $915 million in sales in the first
quarter, he said. No decisions have been made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We need to fix the innovative core&#8221; of Pfizer, Read
said. &#8220;Part of that may be we become a smaller company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read, who took control of Pfizer in November, said in
February that he was reviewing each of the company&#8217;s units to
focus on product development. The shares have climbed 17 percent
this year as investors bet that Read may create a leaner, more-
profitable company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even though some of these businesses are growing, they&#8217;re
not growing fast enough and they&#8217;re not large enough to impact
the whole company,&#8221; said Linda Bannister, an analyst at Edward
Jones  Co. in Des Peres, Missouri, in a telephone interview
today. &#8220;With the core that&#8217;s left, good news in the pipeline
could really have an impact.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controversial Unit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read said he is reviewing veterinary products, over-the-
counter medicines, baby formula and established products to
determine whether the company should divest or increase
investment for each unit. The question of whether Read might
shed the established-products division, which sells generic
drugs and brands that have lost patent exclusivity, has
generated the most controversy, said Tony Butler, an analyst at
Barclays Capital in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Established products are a bit of a cash cow. You don&#8217;t
pay to market it,&#8221; Butler said today in a telephone interview.
&#8220;The real key is, if restructuring comes to fruition, what&#8217;s
the value of what&#8217;s left? That&#8217;s where things get a little
tricky.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer fell 58 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $20.44 at 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer today reported first-quarter profit excluding
certain items of 60 cents a share, beating the 58-cent average
estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Reduced costs and
higher sales of its Prevnar pneumonia vaccine offset declining
sales of Lipitor, the best-selling drug in the world with $10.7
billion in sales last year. The company lost patent exclusivity
for Lipitor in Spain and Canada in 2010 and faces competition
from cheaper generics in the U.S. in November. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department is reviewing a
report by a U.S. Senate panel that said Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
misled clients about the firm&#8217;s bets on securities tied to the
housing market, according to Attorney General Eric Holder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holder told the House Judiciary Committee at a hearing
today that the department is reviewing the April report by the
Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, led by Senator
Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat. Holder didn&#8217;t say which aspects
of the report, which probed the causes of 2008 financial crisis,
are under review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The department is looking right now at the report
prepared by Senator Levin&#8217;s subcommittee that deals with Goldman
Sachs,&#8221; Holder said in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time the report was released, Levin said he wanted
the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange
Commission to examine whether Goldman Sachs violated the law by
misleading clients who bought the complex securities known as
collateralized debt obligations without knowing the firm would
benefit if they fell in value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin also said federal prosecutors should review whether
to bring perjury charges against Goldman Sachs Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd Blankfein and other current and former employees
who testified to Congress last year. Levin said they denied
under oath that Goldman Sachs took a financial position against
the mortgage market solely for its own profit, statements the
senator said were untrue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Truthful and Accurate&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement when the report was released, New York-based
Goldman Sachs denied it had misled anyone about its activities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The testimony we gave was truthful and accurate and this
is confirmed by the subcommittee&#8217;s own report,&#8221; Goldman Sachs
spokesman Lucas van Praag said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Wells, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to 
make any additional comment today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the blame for the market collapse belongs to banks
that earned billions of dollars in profits creating and selling
financial products that imploded along with the housing market,
according to the report. The Senate panel levied its harshest
criticism at investment banks, in particular accusing Goldman
Sachs and Deutsche Bank AG (DB) of selling collateralized debt
obligations backed by risky loans that the banks&#8217; own traders
believed were likely to lose value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Divergent Views&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement at the time of the report, Deutsche Bank
spokeswoman Michele Allison said, &#8220;As the PSI report correctly
states, there were divergent views within the bank about the
U.S. housing market. Moreover, the bank&#8217;s views were fully
communicated to the market through research reports, industry
events, trading desk commentary and press coverage. Despite the
bearish views held by some, Deutsche Bank was long the housing
market and endured significant losses.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate panel&#8217;s report also examined the role of credit-
rating firms in the meltdown, lax oversight by Washington
regulators and the decline in lending standards that fueled the
mortgage bubble and ultimately led to hundreds of bank failures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The turmoil beginning in 2007 froze credit markets, took
down investment banks Bear Stearns Cos. and Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc., sent housing finance giants Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac into government conservatorship and caused the worst
economic collapse in the U.S. since the Great Depression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year Goldman Sachs paid $550 million to resolve SEC
claims that it failed to disclose that hedge fund Paulson  Co
was betting against, and influenced the selection of, CDOs the
company was packaging and selling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s Bing will be the
default search engine and map application on Research In Motion
Ltd. (RIM)&#8217;s BlackBerry smartphones, a boon for the software maker as
it seeks expand in mobile devices and catch up with Google Inc. (GOOG) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bing will be &#8220;deeply integrated&#8221; into the devices, creating
&#8220;unique experiences for millions of BlackBerry customers,&#8221;
Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said today in an
unbilled appearance at the annual BlackBerry World trade show in
Orlando, Florida. He said the partnership will be ready in time
for the holiday shopping season later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is trying to challenge Google, whose share of the
U.S. search market is more than four times larger than that of
Bing. The RIM partnership also advances Microsoft&#8217;s efforts to
expand in mobile devices, a campaign that includes a pact with
Nokia Oyj (NOK1V), the world&#8217;s largest mobile-phone maker by unit sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has added search features, stepped up the
marketing of Bing and teamed up with former rival Yahoo! Inc. to
increase its market share. Google had 65.4 percent of searches
in February, compared with Bing&#8217;s 13.6 percent, according to
Reston, Virginia-based research firm ComScore Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, fell 11 cents to
$25.55 on the Nasdaq Stock Market at 11:23 a.m. New York time.
Google, based in Mountain View, California, declined $1.21 to
$537.35. Waterloo, Ontario-based RIM added 17 cents to $48.27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook, Angry Birds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIM, the second-largest North American smartphone maker, is
trying to pack more features into its handsets and PlayBook
tablet to challenge larger rival Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Bing
announcement was one many that RIM made to generate buzz for the
PlayBook and a touch-screen edition of the BlackBerry Bold it
debuted at the show yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phone maker is looking to counter mixed reviews for the
PlayBook and a plunge in its share price caused by the company
cutting its sales and profit forecasts last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIM co-CEO Mike Lazaridis said that the popular game &#8220;Angry
Birds&#8221; will be available on the PlayBook soon. RIM executives
demonstrated a new PlayBook app for social-networking website
Facebook and the Android player, which allows BlackBerry users
to download apps originally built for Google&#8217;s Android platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Bold, which has a faster browser, is designed to
replace the current Bold and other aging models, which have lost
market share to Apple&#8217;s iPhone and devices using Android. RIM&#8217;s
forecast cut, which the company said came because new products
were taking longer to develop than originally anticipated,
triggered the stock&#8217;s biggest drop in 19 months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raj Rajaratnam, the Galleon Group LLC
co-founder, missed court after getting emergency surgery, and
the jury weighing insider-trading charges against him will take
today off for a juror&#8217;s medical procedure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam&#8217;s surgery May 1 was to treat a bacterial
infection of his foot, defense lawyer John Dowd said in a
written statement distributed to reporters yesterday after his
client didn&#8217;t show up at Manhattan federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is hoped that he will be recovered sufficiently to
return to the courthouse this week,&#8221; Dowd said in the
statement. He said Rajaratnam waived his right to be in court
during deliberations, which began April 25. &#8220;The court has
approved this absence,&#8221; Dowd said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, 53, was arrested in October 2009 in the largest
crackdown on hedge-fund insider trading in U.S. history.
Prosecutors said he gained $63.8 million from tips leaked by
corporate insiders and traders about 15 stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury finished its sixth day of deliberations yesterday
without reaching a verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Richard Holwell and his clerk, Bill
Donald, said yesterday that there will be no deliberations today
due to a juror&#8217;s medical procedure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No juror should feel any time pressure whatsoever,&#8221; he
said in a letter to the panel. &#8220;The jury will have all the time
it needs to reach its verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-01184, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrials &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lehman Seeks $500 Million From Barclays in Bonus Dispute &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. is claiming $500 million from
Barclays Plc (BARC) for allegedly failing to pay all of the bonuses the
U.K. bank agreed to when it bought the defunct investment firm&#8217;s
North American business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman wrote a letter to U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck
saying an opinion he wrote in February showed that Barclays
&#8216;&#8216;breached its bonus payment obligations.&#8217;&#8217; The letter was filed
in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan on April 29. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays has said it paid the full $2 billion it promised,
including non-bonus compensation. Peck issued the February
opinion in a lawsuit that Lehman lost seeking $11 billion from
Barclays over the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peck&#8217;s ruling, which followed a trial with more than 30
days of testimony, exonerated Barclays from having contrived to
make a &#8216;&#8216;windfall&#8217;&#8217; on the purchase as Lehman alleged. The
ruling left the two sides still fighting over what is owed to
whom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, the trustee for Lehman&#8217;s brokerage is in a
dispute with Barclays over $3.5 billion in assets after Peck
failed to specify how much Barclays was entitled to when it
bought the North American business in September 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael O&#8217;Looney, a spokesman for London-based Barclays,
didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.S. Joins Whistle-Blower Suit Against Education Management &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department joined an employee whistle-blower suit against Education Management Corp. (EDMC), intervening for
the first time in the student recruitment practices at for-profit colleges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit alleges that Pittsburgh-based Education
Management, 40 percent owned by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. funds,
illegally paid recruiters based on the number of students they
enrolled, the company said in a Securities and Exchange
Commission filing yesterday. The government, in most cases,
forbids such incentive compensation for colleges accepting
federal aid because of concern the practice will encourage
companies to enroll unqualified students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department action in federal court in
Pittsburgh follows scrutiny by Congress and the U.S. Education
Department of sales practices, student-loan defaults and job
placement claims at for-profit colleges, which can receive as
much as 90 percent of their revenue from federal financial aid.
Several states intend to join the Justice Department&#8217;s civil
action in federal court, Education Management said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;The design of the compensation plan was based on advice
of counsel that the plan complied with&#8221; exceptions to federal
law banning incentive compensation,&#8217;&#8217; the company said in its
filing. &#8220;The company intends to vigorously defend itself.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which enrolls more than 148,000 students,
operates the Art Institute chain, Argosy University, Brown
Mackie College and South University. Analysts project the
company will report revenue of $2.89 billion in the year ending
in June, according to the average of estimates compiled by
Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Education Management, 07-cv-00461, U.S.
District Court, Western District of Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New Suits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thornburg Mortgage Seeks $2 Billion From JPMorgan, Citigroup &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Citigroup Inc. (C) and three other banks
helped to push Thornburg Mortgage Inc. into a &#8220;free-fall&#8221;
bankruptcy, the firm&#8217;s trustee claimed in a lawsuit seeking to
recover $2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After making &#8220;unjustified&#8221; margin calls, the banks
extracted more than $700 million of margin and interest payments
from Thornburg, then sold their collateral and left the company
to file for Chapter 11 protection during the credit crisis in
May 2009, trustee Joel Sher said in the April 30 filing in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Baltimore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sher, who is liquidating the firm, now called TMST Inc.,
accused the five banks of using &#8220;market disruption as a
justification to initiate a collusive scheme to take control of
the debtors and eventually drive them into bankruptcy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and UBS
AG, or their affiliates, also are defendants in the lawsuit.
JPMorgan was named because it bought assets from Bear Stearns
Cos., a lender to Thornburg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trustee last year sued former Thornburg executives,
saying they conspired to start a new business using cash and
information taken from the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy case is Thornburg Mortgage Inc., 09-17787,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Maryland (Baltimore). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TCF Bank Seeks Appellate Order to Block Debit Card Fee Cap &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCF National Bank has asked a U.S. appeals court for an
order that would block federal regulations capping the amount of
money the biggest U.S. banks can charge retailers for processing
debit-card transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank, a TCF Financial Corp. (TCB) unit that sued Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke, is challenging U.S. District
Judge Lawrence L. Piersol&#8217;s April 4 decision denying its request
to halt implementation of the rule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lender challenges legislation appended to last year&#8217;s
Dodd-Frank financial regulation overhaul bill. The provision,
sponsored by U.S. Senator Richard Durbin, an Illinois Democrat,
and known as the Durbin Amendment, bars banks with more than $10
billion in assets from collecting from retailers more money for
debit-card transactions than the actual cost of providing that
service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are talking about the establishment of a confiscatory
rate regime fully 15 years after banks began their debit
businesses,&#8221; TCF&#8217;s attorneys argued in their brief filed
yesterday with the St. Louis-based U.S. Court of Appeals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt Miller, a Justice Department spokesman, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCF has argued that the proposed fee cap, which isn&#8217;t yet
in force, is unconstitutional. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower case is TCF National Bank v. Bernanke, 10-cv-04149, U.S. District Court, District of South Dakota (Sioux
Falls). The appellate case is TCF National Bank v. Bernanke,
11-1805, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (St.
Louis). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Massachusetts Court Hears Pivotal Mortgage-Transfer Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Massachusetts man should be allowed to keep property he
bought from U.S. Bancorp even though the bank didn&#8217;t have the
right to foreclose on the previous owner, a lawyer argued before
the state&#8217;s highest court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court heard oral
arguments yesterday in the appeal of a lower-court decision that
said the buyer of residential property in Haverhill,
Massachusetts, never owned it because U.S. Bancorp foreclosed
before it got the mortgage. If that decision is upheld it could
have wide implications in the foreclosure crisis in which banks
are accused of clouding home titles through sloppy transferring
of mortgages. The high court will rule at a later date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower court&#8217;s &#8220;statement that my client received
nothing is what we disagree with,&#8221; Jeffrey Loeb, a lawyer for
so-called third-party buyer Francis J. Bevilacqua III told the
panel yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state high court already ruled Jan. 7 in a different
case, U.S. Bank v. Ibanez, that banks can&#8217;t foreclose on a house
if they don&#8217;t own the mortgage. That case didn&#8217;t address the
status of those who buy property from someone after an invalid
foreclosure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the decision is upheld, and generally applied, it
likely will have adverse implications for hundreds or even
thousands of Massachusetts property owners if they find
themselves in Bevilacqua&#8217;s shoes,&#8221; the Mortgage Bankers
Association wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claims of wrongdoing by banks and loan servicers triggered
a 50-state investigation last year into whether thousands of
U.S. foreclosures were properly documented during the housing
collapse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bevilacqua&#8217;s case could affect trusts that bundled
mortgages and sold securities to investors. Like the Ibanez
case, the court&#8217;s decision may resonate with other states as
they grapple with the rights of new homebuyers who may hesitate
to complete a purchase for fear of uncertain title. That may be
especially so in states such as Massachusetts that don&#8217;t require
court action to seize a house. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bevilacqua v. Rodriguez, 10880, Supreme
Judicial Court of Massachusetts (Boston). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Companies Get U.S. High Court Review on Consumer Lending Suits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to decide whether companies
that promise to fix bad credit records can force dissatisfied
customers to take complaints to arbitration, rather than court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices yesterday said they will hear an appeal from
units of CompuCredit Holdings Corp. and Synovus Financial Corp., (SNV)
which are fighting a suit over credit cards marketed as a means
of rebuilding poor credit. Three customers say the cards&#8217; hefty
fees -- $257 in the first year alone -- were disclosed only in
the fine print of the promotional materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to take up the case comes days after the court
ruled 5-4 that companies can require customers and employees to
press complaints in arbitration as individuals, rather than a
group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest case turns on a 1996 law aimed at preventing so-called credit repair companies from ripping off unwary
customers. The measure, known as the Credit Repair Organizations
Act, says consumers have the &#8220;right to sue&#8221; companies that
violate the law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question for the Supreme Court is whether that language
means consumers can go to court even if the application they
signed says they must arbitrate all disputes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In letting the suit go forward, a San Francisco-based
federal appeals court said that &#8220;Congress meant what it said in
using the term &#8216;sue,&#8217; and that it did not mean &#8216;arbitrate.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CompuCredit Corp., which marketed and serviced the cards,
and Synovus Bank, which issued them, point in their appeal to
the Federal Arbitration Act. The companies said that law creates
&#8216;&#8216;the strong presumption than an arbitration agreement is
enforceable.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case, which the court will consider during its 2011-12
term, is CompuCredit v. Greenwood, 10-948, U.S. Supreme Court
(Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Actelion Drops on $547 Million Jury Award to Asahi Kasei &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actelion Ltd. (ATLN) fell the most in 14 months in Zurich trading
after a U.S. jury decided the Swiss biotechnology company should
pay Asahi Kasei Pharma Corp. (3407) as much as $547 million in a
dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Superior Court jury in San Mateo County, California,
will resume deliberations today regarding potential punitive
damages, Allschwil-based Actelion said in a statement. After
that, the drugmaker will decide on whether to appeal, according
to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The award may add to pressure on Actelion as shareholders
prepare to vote at the May 5 annual meeting on competing
proposals by the board and investor Elliott Advisors (UK) Ltd.
Elliott, the biggest shareholder with more than a 6 percent
stake, has proposed ousting board members after a series of
clinical trial setbacks. Elliott Advisors, which wants Actelion
to consider strategy options including a sale, said Actelion
should delay the investor meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;While we find ourselves in a very strong position to see
real change at Actelion by the election of our proposed slate of
nominees,&#8217;&#8217; Elliott Advisors said in a statement, &#8216;&#8216;we believe
our effort to refresh the board would be further strengthened if
the AGM were adjourned until later in May or June.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Verdicts/Settlement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Satyam Investors&#8217; U.S. Suit Settled by PwC for $25.5 Million &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors in Satyam Computer Services Ltd. settled a
lawsuit against PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for $25.5 million
related to its audit of the Indian firm that included a $1
billion overstatement of assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satyam, the software exporter embroiled in India&#8217;s biggest
corporate fraud probe, reached a $125 million settlement in
February in the class action in New York. Satyam agreed last
month to pay $10 million to settle a U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PricewaterhouseCoopers and four related entities audited or
played a role in the audits of Satyam&#8217;s financial statements,
according to the shareholders&#8217; complaint. The settlement, which
requires a judge&#8217;s approval, was disclosed in filings April 29
in federal court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;Plaintiffs and lead counsel believe that the proposed PwC
settlement represents an excellent result and is in the best
interests of the class,&#8221; lawyers for the investors wrote in
court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September, Satyam, based in Hyderabad, India, reported
its first annual earnings in two years. Former Chairman
Ramalinga Raju disclosed in January 2009 that he overstated
Satyam&#8217;s assets by $1 billion, triggering a stock plunge and
investor lawsuits in the U.S. Tech Mahindra Ltd. (TECHM), based in Pune,
India, acquired control of the software-services provider in May
2009. Satyam&#8217;s American depositary receipts traded on the New
York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Satyam Computer Services Ltd. Securities
Litigation, 09-md-2027, U.S. District Court, Southern District
of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Secret Cash in Wisconsin Court Race Makes Judges &#8216;Spectators&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Justice David T. Prosser Jr. and challenger JoAnne
Kloppenburg faced off in the April 5 Wisconsin Supreme Court
election, unidentified contributors spent almost six times more
than the candidates on the race. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five nonprofit groups with ties to business, labor, trial
lawyers and Tea Party organizations spent $4.4 million on behalf
of Prosser and Kloppenburg without disclosing the names of those
who funded them. The U.S. Supreme Court sanctioned the practice
in January 2010, and the effects can be seen in judicial races
in Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan and other states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funding of state Supreme Court campaigns is becoming
more opaque as judges interpret a wide array of laws contested
in legislatures. Many governing bodies are freshly empowered:
The Republican Party took full control of 25 legislatures in the
last election, up from 14. The issues before the bench include
restrictions on personal-injury lawsuits, taxation, curbs on
abortion and challenges to environmental regulations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The candidates have become spectators in their own
elections,&#8221; said Mike McCabe, executive director of the
Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, which tracks contributions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The trend has been toward more and more undisclosed
spending. It will reach a point where all the spending will come
from groups using anonymous sources,&#8221; McCabe said in a
telephone interview from Madison. &#8220;It&#8217;s been brought into sharp
focus in Wisconsin.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending for state Supreme Court elections doubled in the
past decade to more than $200 million, according to the Brennan
Center for Justice at New York University, which advocates for
impartial courts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Litigation Departments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Winston  Strawn Ex-Partner Pleads Guilty in Starr Fraud &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winston  Strawn LLP ex-partner Jonathan Bristol pleaded
guilty to charges that he helped launder almost $19 million in
financial adviser Kenneth I. Starr&#8217;s investment fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bristol admitted yesterday to a charge of conspiracy to
launder money before U.S. District Judge Deborah A. Batts, U.S.
Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan said in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starr, the New York money manager whose clients included
actors Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes, was sentenced to 7
1/2 years in prison March 2 after pleading guilty to defrauding
nine celebrities out of $33.3 million. Bristol admitted that he
allowed Starr to wire funds in and out of his escrow account,
knowing that the funds were proceeds of Starr&#8217;s fraud, Bharara
said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bristol &#8220;abused his position as a partner at a prominent
New York City law firm to break the law over and over again,&#8221;
Bharara said in the statement. &#8220;Bristol should have been a
gatekeeper; instead, he was an enabler to Kenneth Starr and his
multimillion-dollar fraud.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bristol faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison
and a fine of $250,000, and agreed to pay restitution of $18.9
million, according to the statement. His sentencing is scheduled
for Sept. 26. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bristol was in a &#8220;very tough position,&#8221; his lawyer, Susan
Kellman, said in a phone interview. &#8220;He should&#8217;ve known
something was wrong, and by the time he did he was paralyzed by
the predicament he was in,&#8221; Kellman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Bristol, 10-cr-1239, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding Co.,
China&#8217;s second-largest drug distributor, will sell new shares to
Temasek Holdings Pte and Pfizer Inc. (PFE) in an offering in Hong Kong
of as much as $2.2 billion of stock to fund acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Temasek, a Singapore state investment company, Pfizer,
Guoco Group and Bank of China Group Investment will buy a total
of $550 million shares for HK$21.80 to HK$26 apiece, according
to a marketing document sent to investors today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funds will enable Shanghai Pharma to buy manufacturing
assets in China, where demand for medicines is forecast by IMS
Health Inc. to expand at least 25 percent this year. A soon-to-
be-released government plan may push for the nation&#8217;s three
biggest drug companies to increase their share of the market to
30 percent to 35 percent by 2015 from 21 percent in 2009, the
21st Century Business Herald reported last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Shanghai Pharma should benefit from upcoming industry
consolidation, since it is already one of the biggest players,&#8221;
said Pan Lei, an analyst at Beijing-based Guodu Securities Co.,
who recommends buying the shares. &#8220;The company is seen as an
attractive investment because its drug distribution business
makes it stable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shanghai Pharma, the first drugmaker in China licensed to
make Roche Holding AG&#8217;s Tamiflu medicine, plans to sell a total
of 664.2 million shares in the Hong Kong offering. Temasek will
invest $300 million, Guoco Group will invest $150 million, and
Pfizer and Bank of China Group Investment will each buy $50
million of shares, according to the document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funding Acquisitions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shanghai Pharma, China&#8217;s third-largest drugmaker in 2009,
will use 30 percent of the proceeds from its Hong Kong offering
to buy other drug companies, and allocate 40 percent to expand
and strengthen its distribution networks, according to the
marketing document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company distributes medicines through 41 subsidiaries
and branches as well as 32 depots and warehouses across eastern,
southern and northern China, it said in a stock-exchange filing,
adding that only Sinopharm Group distributed more medicines in
2009. Shanghai Pharma&#8217;s 53 major products are sold through 1,682
pharmacies in nine provinces, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shanghai Pharma shares are halted from trading in Shanghai
until its Hong Kong shares begin trading on May 20, according to
the marketing document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Temasek spokesman Jeffrey Fang and Pfizer&#8217;s Singapore-based
spokeswoman Neena Moorjani said they weren&#8217;t currently able to
comment on the investment. Guoco and Bank of China Investment
Group didn&#8217;t immediately respond to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shanghai Pharma signed a memorandum of understanding with
New York-based Pfizer on April 21 to pursue potential business
opportunities in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China International Capital Corp., Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN),
Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) are managing the
sale. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. dropped its
recommendation for investors to bet against U.S. five-year
notes, citing Federal Reserve comments and the pace of
inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman, one of the 20 primary dealers authorized to trade
directly with the Fed, initiated the trade on March 18 at a
yield of 1.94 percent and a target of 2.30 percent, Francesco
Garzarelli, Goldman&#8217;s London-based chief interest-rate
strategist, wrote today a report to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are exiting the trade essentially flat,&#8221; the report
said. &#8220;The trade performed well through mid-April until a
combination of dovish Fed comments, slightly softer-than-
expected inflation prints, and ongoing concerns that high fuel
prices will hit consumer spending triggered a wave of short
covering.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke signaled April 27 the central
bank will maintain its record monetary stimulus after ending
large-scale bond purchases in June. The Fed said its preferred
gauge of inflation, the personal consumption expenditures price
index minus food and energy, will rise by 1.3 percent to 1.6
percent this year, up from its earlier estimate of 1.0 percent
to 1.3 percent and within its preferred range of 2 percent or a
bit lower. Oil rose to a 31-month high yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five-year yield was little changed today at 1.97
percent as of 1:16 p.m. in Singapore, declining from 2.35
percent on April 8, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
price of the 2 percent security maturing in April 2016 was 100
1/8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will look for opportunities to bet against,
or short, the note again, the report said. So-called short
covering is when investors reverse wagers on an asset declining. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa SAB, Latin America&#8217;s
largest Coke bottler, said it will build a $146 million bottling
plant in Brazil to meet surging soft-drink demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plant will be located in the state of Minas Gerais and
have annual production capacity of 2.1 billion liters by 2015,
the Mexico City-based company said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s soft-drink, water and flavored-water volume
increased 12 percent in Brazil last year as the economy rose 7.5
percent, the fastest pace since 1985. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hector Trevino, the company&#8217;s chief financial officer, said
on an April 27 conference call that a plan to build one plant in
Brazil and another in Colombia was presented to the board of
directors for approval. Trevino said capital expenditures will
likely increase by as much as $60 million from its original plan
to about $620 million this year. &lt;/p&gt;

Levin" date="May 04, 2011  5:35 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-04/defeating-slim-makes-maxcom-s-21-yields-a-buy-to-jpmorgan-mexico-credit.html"><headline>Defeating Slim Makes Maxcom&#8217;s 21% Yields a Buy to JPMorgan: Mexico Credit</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Maxcom Telecomunicaciones SAB&#8217;s bonds
are rebounding and yields are down from record levels in
overseas markets after JPMorgan Chase  Co. said the Mexican
phone company may win a battle to cut fees charged by
billionaire Carlos Slim&#8217;s America Movil SAB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on Maxcom&#8217;s dollar bonds due 2014 have declined 286
basis points, or 2.86 percentage points, to 19.219 percent from
a record 22.078 percent on April 28. Yields on Mexican corporate
dollar debt fell four basis points while those on Latin American
utility companies rose nine during the same period, according to
data compiled by JPMorgan and Credit Suisse Group AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maxcom, a Mexico City-based fixed-line company that has
posted five straight quarterly losses, is asking regulators to
reduce interconnection fees charged by America Movil, Latin
America&#8217;s largest wireless carrier. On May 2, regulators ruled
in favor of Grupo Televisa SAB in its bid to cut America Movil
fees, bolstering speculation that Maxcom will also win its case
as the government seeks to curb Slim&#8217;s dominance in the mobile-
phone and fixed-line markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We feel more positive about the credit now because of the
interconnectivity fees,&#8221; said Mary Austin, who manages $469
million in high-yield debt, including Maxcom bonds, at
Portsmouth, New Hampshire-based Pax World Management LLC.
&#8220;Believe me, we were worried about it for a while because of
the liquidity issues.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Cash Burn&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on Maxcom&#8217;s 11 percent bonds soared 438 basis points
in the first four months of the year as Standard  Poor&#8217;s
lowered the company&#8217;s credit rating to B-, or six levels below
investment grade, on March 3, citing a &#8220;high cash burn rate.&#8221;
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service rates Maxcom Caa1, or seven levels
below investment grade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bonds yield 1,729 basis points more than similar-
maturity Mexican government dollar bonds, up from 1,476 basis
points at the end of 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customer losses at Maxcom led to a net loss of 38 million
pesos ($3.3 million) in the January-to-March quarter, compared
with a 57 million-peso loss a year earlier. The company has
replaced its chairman, chief executive officer and chief
financial officer in the past eight months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Maxcom is waiting on the regulator&#8217;s ruling, it began
to pay the reduced connection fee of 39 centavos per call to
America Movil in January. America Movil, controlled by Slim,
whom Forbes magazine ranks as the world&#8217;s richest person,
charges 95 centavos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An official in the press office of the Federal
Telecommunications Commission declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America Movil may appeal the commission&#8217;s rulings in
Mexican courts, Chief Executive Officer Daniel Hajj said
yesterday on a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s &#8216;Overweight&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miguel Cabredo, Maxcom&#8217;s chief financial officer, told
investors on an April 29 conference call that the lower fees
will save the company about 200 million pesos this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan analysts raised Maxcom&#8217;s bonds to &#8220;overweight&#8221;
from &#8220;marketweight&#8221; on May 2, saying the securities may
generate returns of as much as 8 percent in the next two months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We assign a high probability of a ruling in Maxcom&#8217;s
favor,&#8221; wrote Jacob Steinfeld, an analyst at JPMorgan
Securities in New York. &#8220;The potential earnings are too high to
ignore.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to own Mexican dollar
bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries widened 3 basis points to 143,
according to JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alestra Victory &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost to protect Mexican debt against non-payment for
five years was little changed at 98, according to data provider
CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted
by dealers in the privately negotiated market. Credit-default
swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the underlying
securities or cash equivalent if the issuer fails to comply with
debt agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peso fell 0.6 percent to 11.6440 per U.S. dollar at 5
p.m. New York time. Yields on futures contracts for the 28-day
interbank rate due in October fell 8 basis points to 5.04
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP maintained a negative outlook on Maxcom debt after the
rating downgrade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The negative outlook reflects the company&#8217;s tight
liquidity and our expectations of continued weak financial
performance,&#8221; SP analysts Marcela Duenas and Fabiola Ortiz
wrote in a March 14 note in Mexico City. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maxcom is one of dozens of phone carriers disputing America
Movil&#8217;s fee to connect customers to its network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supreme Court Ruling &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Telecommunications Commission ruled in March
that fixed-line phone carrier Alestra SA should pay America
Movil a rate of 39 centavos a minute, less than half the rate
America Movil was seeking. This week, the regulator fixed the
same 39-centavo rate for calls from customers of Televisa and
NII Holdings Inc. to America Movil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maxcom expects an identical ruling for its own dispute with
America Movil this month, Cabredo said on the conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Supreme Court ruling yesterday made it more difficult for
America Movil to protect the prices it wants to charge
competitors. The company can no longer seek an injunction to
allow it to keep charging competitors a higher price while
appealing the decision on a fee cut, according to the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa, NII and other carriers have said America Movil is
hurting competition by keeping the interconnection fees too
high. Mexico&#8217;s antitrust agency fined America Movil $1 billion
last month, saying its market share allows it to control prices
on the connection fees. America Movil plans to appeal the
ruling, Hajj said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Threat to Investment &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the company has been lowering its fees, bigger cuts
could reduce investment in the industry, Hajj said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maxcom&#8217;s residential phone lines slid 1 percent to 223,648
last quarter, while Internet subscriptions climbed 38 percent to
89,219 and TV clients rose 27 percent to 49,598. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first-quarter results make it &#8220;more than ever
certain&#8221; that Maxcom will generate cash this year, Cabredo said
on the conference call. Manuel Perez, Maxcom&#8217;s investor
relations director, said in an interview yesterday that the
company will service its debt while declining to comment on the
dispute with America Movil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are really confident we&#8217;ll be able to cover our
liabilities,&#8221; Perez said in a phone interview from Mexico City.
&#8220;The company will make important improvements this year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netflix Inc. (NFLX), preparing to expand in
Latin America, is negotiating with entertainment companies for
rights to stream movies and television shows in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS), Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (LGF), Universal
Pictures and Viacom Inc. (VIA/B)&#8217;s Paramount Pictures are in discussions
with Netflix for Latin American rights, according to people with
knowledge of the talks. The rights being discussed with one
studio would exclude Mexico, said one of the people, who
declined to be named because the talks are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Latin America would become Netflix&#8217;s third market. The
company started a streaming-only subscription service in Canada
last year, expanding from the U.S., where it also offers DVDs by
mail. CBS Corp. (CBS) is in &#8220;serious talks&#8221; with Netflix for
Canadian and Latin American rights, the broadcaster&#8217;s chief
executive officer, Leslie Moonves, said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are always negotiating with virtually all the studios
and networks and independent filmmakers,&#8221; said Steve Swasey, a
spokesman for Los Gatos, California-based Netflix. &#8220;We are
looking at international expansion in a lot of places.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michelle Bergman, a spokeswoman for Burbank, California-
based Disney, declined to comment, as did Peter Wilkes, a
spokesman for Vancouver-based Lions Gate, and Cindy Gardner, a
spokeswoman for Universal. Dade Hayes, an outside spokesman for
Paramount, had no immediate comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix CEO Reed Hastings has said he&#8217;s looking to enter
new territories. He hasn&#8217;t said where, dropping hints at
appearances like the Wired magazine conference yesterday, where
he mentioned Brazil, India, Australia and Turkey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We haven&#8217;t announced our next market yet,&#8221; Hastings said
at yesterday&#8217;s event in New York. &#8220;Look for high broadband and
eager customers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older Titles &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movies being discussed for the Latin American service
are older titles, said one of the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix said on April 26 its push outside the U.S. will
lead to international operating losses of as much as $70 million
in the second half, up from a previous forecast of $50 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix fell $2.05 to $229.19 at 4:30 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have gained 30 percent
this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central and Latin America will have the fastest growth
through 2015 in broadband connections that are required for
online movie services such as Netflix&#8217;s, according to a November
2010 report by consulting firm Analysys Mason in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governments in countries including Brazil and India favor
upgrading Internet service over paving roads, Hastings said
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I was in Costa Rica on a surf trip, relatively isolated,
but there was DSL,&#8221; Hastings said. &#8220;I was surprised.
Government-laid fiber down the dirt road.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has shortlisted Morgan Stanley,
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) to manage an initial
public offering of OAO Sovcomflot, Russia&#8217;s biggest shipper,
this year, the Economy Ministry said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ministry approached 23 banks as possible advisers for a
three-year asset-sale program and plans to select winners for
most of the deals by early June, Alexei Uvarov, head of the
ministry&#8217;s property department, told reporters today in Moscow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government plans to raise $30 billion by 2015 from the
sales, helping to improve corporate governance and replenish
state coffers, Economy Minister Elvira Nabiullina said April 25.
President Dmitry Medvedev ordered the government in March to set
the final schedule of the program for the next three years,
saying it would bolster the investment climate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Economy Ministry has prepared a detailed timeline for
the sales and submitted it to the government, proposing to cap
banks&#8217; fees at 2 percent of a sale&#8217;s value, Uvarov said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holdings in Sovcomflot, OAO Sberbank, OAO Novorossiysk
Commercial Sea Port and Murmansk Commercial Seaport are slated
to be sold this year, Uvarov said. The government expects to
offer stakes in OAO RusHydro, VTB Group and Federal Grid Co.
next year before proceeding with the sale of OAO Rosneft, OAO
Russian Railways and Russian Agricultural Bank in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;23 Banks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS), JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank are among 23
foreign and domestic banks selected by the government last year
to help manage its asset sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was the third-biggest organizer of Russian equity
and bond sales last year, while Deutsche Bank was ranked 13th
and Morgan Stanley was 28th, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
VTB Capital, the investment-banking unit of VTB, led the
rankings, followed by Troika Dialog, which is being acquired by
Sberbank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government raised $3.3 billion in February by selling a
stake in VTB, the nation&#8217;s second-largest lender, in the biggest
offering of assets in almost four years. Bank of America Merrill
Lynch, Deutsche Bank and VTB Capital were joint bookrunners on
the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OAO TransContainer, a unit of Russia&#8217;s rail monopoly, was
the last state-owned company to hold an IPO, raising about $400
million in November 2010. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), accused of
misleading clients by a U.S. Senate inquiry, is likely to make
management changes in the &#8220;near-term,&#8221; said William Tanona, an
analyst at UBS AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Any turnover will concern investors despite the firm&#8217;s
deep bench,&#8221; Tanona, who worked at Goldman Sachs from 2005 to
2008, wrote today in a note to investors. &#8220;GS&#8217;s management team
is very strong; however, missteps on the public relations front
have further tarnished the firm&#8217;s reputation.&#8221; Managers will
remain under strain after lawmakers sent findings to the Justice
Department and Securities and Exchange Commission, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, the Democratic chairman of
the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, and Tom Coburn of
Oklahoma, the panel&#8217;s senior Republican, signed a letter asking
prosecutors and the SEC to examine findings of a two-year
inquiry on the financial crisis released last month. Levin said
he wants them to determine whether Goldman Sachs broke laws by
misleading clients who bought securities tied to the housing
market without knowing the firm would benefit if values fell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In making his prediction, Tanona didn&#8217;t identify any
managers who might leave or take new roles, according to a
summary of his note. Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for New York-
based Goldman Sachs, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tanona initiated coverage on Goldman Sachs in a note today
that rated the firm &#8220;buy.&#8221; His share-price estimate for the
firm is $200, 32 percent above yesterday&#8217;s closing price.
Goldman Sachs has fallen 9.7 percent this year, after dropping
0.4 percent in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, Citigroup &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tanona, who previously covered financial firms at Collins
Stewart Plc before joining Zurich-based UBS last year, also
placed initial &#8220;buy&#8221; recommendations on JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
and Citigroup Inc. (C), according to the note. He rated Morgan
Stanley (MS) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) &#8220;neutral.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sector of universal banks and brokers has &#8220;significant
long-term upside&#8221; while legal and regulatory issues may provide
&#8220;turbulence&#8221; in the short-term, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate report came less than a year after Goldman Sachs
paid $550 million to resolve SEC claims that it failed to
disclose that hedge fund Paulson  Co. was betting against, and
influenced the selection of, collateralized debt obligations the
company was packaging and selling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorney General Eric Holder, testifying before the House
Judiciary Committee yesterday, confirmed that his department is
scrutinizing the Senate report. Two people briefed on the matter
confirmed that the SEC enforcement division is also studying it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OAO EuroChem, Russia&#8217;s largest maker
of nitrogen fertilizer, hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to advise
the company on a possible acquisition of 80 percent of OAO
Minudobreniya that will value the rival at $1.3 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rossosh, as Minudobreniya is also known, is part-owned by

&lt;p&gt;UBS AG (UBS) is seeking to hire Eric Rosen
to head credit trading in the U.S. as Switzerland&#8217;s biggest
lender attempts to increase revenue at the investment bank that
trails those of its largest rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosen, 41, ran North American credit trading at JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) until January 2010. The bank informed employees in
its debt group about the potential hire last week, according to
three people with knowledge of the situation, who declined to be
identified because the situation hasn&#8217;t been publicly announced.
Torie Von Alt, a spokeswoman for Zurich-based UBS, and Rosen
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS Chief Executive Officer Oswald Gruebel, a former bond
trader, hired more than 1,700 bankers in the past two years to
rebuild the investment bank after more than $57 billion in
writedowns and credit losses during the financial crisis. The
Swiss bank had the lowest revenue from sales and trading of
fixed-income, currencies and commodities last year among the
nine biggest investment banks, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit revenue rose 33 percent to 988 million francs ($1.15
billion) in the first quarter from the year-earlier period, UBS
said last week. Credit trading, which includes underwriting,
sales and trading of bonds, derivatives, notes and loans, posted
revenue of 2.3 billion francs last year, more than double the
target that Gruebel set for the business in 2009 to achieve by
2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosen joined JPMorgan in 1997 from Bank of America and ran
loan trading until 2004 when he was promoted to also oversee
bonds and credit-default swaps. He decided &#8220;to pursue new
interests,&#8221; according to a November 2009 memo from the New
York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was ranked the most-active U.S. underwriter of
leveraged loans from 2000 to 2007 and has been the No. 1
arranger of corporate bonds globally since 2008, Bloomberg data
show. UBS is the eleventh most active company bond underwriter
for 2011, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Justice may
pursue claims against other lenders after suing Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)
for more than $1 billion, alleging the firm lied while arranging
federal insurance on faulty mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Housing and Urban Development Department is examining
loans insured through the Federal Housing Administration and may
refer additional cases to the Justice Department, HUD&#8217;s general
counsel, Helen Kanovsky, said yesterday in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We go where the evidence takes us, and if it takes us to
the larger players on Wall Street, so be it,&#8221; Kanovsky said.
U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said it wouldn&#8217;t be a &#8220;fantastical
stretch&#8221; for prosecutors to scrutinize other lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank&#8217;s MortgageIT unit falsely certified that it
was examining default risks while qualifying loans for FHA
insurance, according to the government&#8217;s complaint. HUD has
already borne $386 million in claims and costs, and has yet to
make payments on defaulted loans with principal balances of $888
million. Some mortgages stem from the housing boom, when the
industry eased lending standards, fueling more than $2 trillion
in credit losses and writedowns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nobody was doing any mortgage due diligence whatsoever,&#8221;
said Christopher Thornberg, principal at Beacon Economics LLC in
Los Angeles. He said the government may have brought the claim
against Deutsche Bank as a &#8220;test case&#8221; before targeting other
banks or seeking to force settlements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The only question is, &#8216;Who&#8217;s next?&#8217;&#8221; Thornberg said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kanovsky and Bharara declined to identify lenders that
might face claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We could see another potential big negative for the
industry out of this,&#8221; said Paul Miller, a former examiner for
the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and an analyst with FBR
Capital Markets in Arlington, Virginia. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a
continued earnings drag on the industry.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank said it will &#8220;vigorously&#8221; fight the
government&#8217;s allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the claims against MortgageIT and Deutsche
Bank are unreasonable and unfair,&#8221; Renee Calabro, a spokeswoman
for the Frankfurt-based company, said by e-mail. &#8220;Close to 90
percent of the activity covered by the DOJ allegations happened
prior to Deutsche Bank&#8217;s acquisition of MortgageIT.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank and MortgageIT concealed problem loans
through &#8220;egregious&#8221; violations of HUD rules for analyzing the
income and creditworthiness of borrowers, according to the
Justice Department&#8217;s complaint filed yesterday in Manhattan
federal court. MortgageIT endorsed more than 39,000 loans for
FHA insurance after 1999, making them &#8220;highly marketable for
resale,&#8221; the U.S. said. Of those, 12,500 defaulted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department didn&#8217;t file criminal charges or
identify employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Deutsche Bank AG, 11-cv-2976, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Savvis Sued by Investor Over $2.5 Billion CenturyLink Offer &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Savvis Inc. (SVVS), which provides online business data storage,
was sued in Delaware Chancery Court by an investor who contends
a $2.5 billion cash-and-stock buyout offer from phone company
CenturyLink Inc. (CTL) is inadequate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stockholder Hilary Kramer claims Savvis directors violated
their duties by failing to get the best possible price and seeks
an injunction to stop the deal, according to a complaint filed
yesterday in Wilmington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Defendants failed to explore strategic alternatives to a
buyout notwithstanding Savvis&#8217; bright prospects for growth and
profitability&#8221; in advanced &#8220;cloud&#8221; computer-data hosting
services, Kramer said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Town  Country, Missouri-based Savvis, 18 percent owned by
the Welsh Carson Anderson  Stowe venture capital firm of New
York, reported $933 million in revenue last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Savvis and Monroe, Louisiana-based CenturyLink announced
the buyout agreement April 27, with Savvis stockholders to
receive $30 in cash and $10 in CenturyLink shares for each of
their shares, an 11 percent premium at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt Benson, a spokesman for Savvis in San Francisco,
didn&#8217;t immediately return phone and e-mail messages seeking
comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Hilary Kramer v. James E. Ousley and Savvis
Inc., CA6438, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney Unit Sues Dish Network for Giving Away Starz Movies &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Walt Disney Co. (DIS) unit sued Dish Network Corp. (DISH), the second-
largest U.S. satellite-TV provider, for copyright violations in
connection with the distribution of movies on the Starz service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dish was accused of giving subscribers free access to the
Starz premium television service, including copyrighted movies
that were provided by Disney on the condition that Starz operate
as a premium channel such as HBO, Cinemax and Showtime, the suit
says. Starz, a unit of John Malone&#8217;s Liberty Media Corp., wasn&#8217;t
named in the suit filed May 2 in federal court in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Dish&#8217;s unlawful distribution, transmission, copying and
public display and/or performance of the Starz programming,
including Disney Enterprises&#8217; copyrighted movies, has already
resulted in the repeated and continuing infringement of
plaintiffs&#8217; copyright rights,&#8221; the suit says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A voice-mail message left with Dish Network&#8217;s media
relations office wasn&#8217;t immediately returned. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italy Consumer Group Challenges Lactalis&#8217;s Parmalat Offer &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groupe Lactalis&#8217;s planned bid for Parmalat SpA (PLT), Italy&#8217;s
biggest dairy company, is being challenged in an administrative
court by Italian consumer group Codacons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lactalis shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to make a tender offer
because the company doesn&#8217;t publicly disclose its accounts,
according to a statement published on Codacons website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A takeover by a company that doesn&#8217;t publish its accounts
violates the principle of transparency,&#8221; the consumer group
said. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t allow those involved to make an informed
choice: neither investors, nor Parmalat, nor the unions nor
consumers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Codacons, joined by other consumer groups, filed the appeal
with the administrative court in the region of Lazio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lactalis, the privately held maker of President cheese, on
April 26 offered to pay 3.38 billion euros ($4.9 billion) in an
unsolicited bid for the 71 percent of Parmalat it doesn&#8217;t own to
create the world&#8217;s largest dairy company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Goldman Programmer Aleynikov Denied Freedom During Appeal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) computer programmer Sergey
Aleynikov won&#8217;t be freed from jail while he appeals a 97-month
prison term for stealing the firm&#8217;s computer trading code, a
federal appeals court ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov was convicted by a jury in December of violating
the Economic Espionage Act and the Interstate Transportation of
Stolen Property Act. His lawyer, Kevin Marino, told a panel of
three appeals court judges for the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals that there was a substantial likelihood his client&#8217;s
conviction would be overturned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On his last day of work at New York-based Goldman Sachs in
June 2009, Aleynikov uploaded hundreds of thousands of lines of
source code from the firm&#8217;s trading system, the U.S. said. He
then circumvented Goldman Sachs&#8217;s security system, sent the code
to an outside server in Germany, compressed and encrypted it and
later took it with him to a meeting with new employers in
Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a substantial question as to whether stealing
computer source code violates either of these statutes,&#8221; Marino
said. &#8220;Goldman Sachs never intended to place its high-frequency
trading system into the stream of commerce.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marino argued during the trial that Aleynikov only took
open-source code he had written at Goldman Sachs and that
nothing he took was proprietary. U.S. District Judge Denise
Cote, who presided over the trial, rejected the argument, and in
March, ordered Aleynikov jailed pending his appeal, saying he
posed a risk of flight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Facciponti yesterday told
the appeals court that Aleynikov still posed a flight risk.
Facciponti said prosecutors were confident the conviction would
be upheld because the U.S. believes Aleynikov violated the
statutes by first taking the source code and then transporting
it across state lines when he traveled to Chicago with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Aleynikov, 1:10-cr-00096, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anadarko Prepared to &#8216;Come to the Table&#8217; With BP, CEO Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC), the Texas company that owns a
stake in BP Plc (BP/)&#8217;s damaged Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico,
said it&#8217;s &#8220;prepared to come to the table&#8221; to resolve disputed
costs from last year&#8217;s oil spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anadarko has filed a lawsuit blaming BP for the explosion
at Macondo on April 20, 2010, and the record offshore U.S. oil
spill that followed. BP is seeking billions of dollars from
Anadarko in spill-related costs for its interest in the project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t think that we owe anything, but we also realize
that our investors would like us to consider some sort of
approach that&#8217;s perhaps a compromise from that,&#8221; Chief
Executive Officer Jim Hackett said during a conference call with
investors and analysts. &#8220;We&#8217;re prepared to come to the table
under the right circumstances.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP asked a judge to put the lawsuits on hold, saying a
joint-operating agreement requires the parties to first attempt
dispute resolution through arbitration. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Novell Antitrust Lawsuit Against Microsoft Revived by Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novell Inc. (NOVL)&#8217;s antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft Corp. (MSFT),
accusing the world&#8217;s largest software maker of undermining
Novell&#8217;s WordPerfect program, was revived by a U.S. appeals
court in Virginia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal appeals court in Richmond yesterday said Novell
didn&#8217;t give up its right to pursue the lawsuit when it
transferred its claims related to its personal computer
operating system products to Caldera Inc. in 1996. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Although the underlying lawsuit involves complex issues
of antitrust law, the primary question before us is one of
contract interpretation: whether a 1996 contract between Novell
and a third company divested Novell of its right to bring the
present claim,&#8221; Judge Allyson Duncan wrote in the 2-1 decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Kutz, a spokesman for Microsoft, said the company
doesn&#8217;t think Novell&#8217;s case has any merit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are disappointed with the Fourth&#8217;s Circuit&#8217;s decision
to reverse in part the district court&#8217;s summary judgment ruling
which dismissed these very old claims, although we are pleased
that at this point only one part of one of Novell&#8217;s claims
remains,&#8221; Kutz said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ian Bruce, a spokesman for Novell, didn&#8217;t return a phone
message and an e-mail message seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed in 2004, is a byproduct of the U.S.
government&#8217;s landmark case against Microsoft that was settled
more than eight years ago after the Redmond, Washington-based
company was declared an illegal monopolist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Novell Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 10-1482, U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (Richmond). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UBS Unit Loses $10.6 Million Sex-Harassment Verdict &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS Financial Services Inc. lost a jury verdict of almost
$10.6 million in a case brought by a former sales assistant who
said she was sexually harassed by a supervisor in Missouri and
then fired for complaining about him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carla C. Ingraham, 51, who worked in the Kansas City,
Missouri, office of UBS Financial, said the company began
investigating her after she complained of harassment in December
2008 and fired her in July 2009. UBS Financial, a unit of
Zurich, Switzerland-based UBS AG (UBSN), denied the allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury in Kansas City, Missouri, yesterday awarded
Ingraham $10 million in punitive damages, $350,000 for sexual
harassment and $242,000 for retaliation. UBS Financial is
considering whether to appeal the verdict, said Karina Byrne, a
spokeswoman for the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The firm does not tolerate sexual harassment of any kind
against an employee,&#8221; Byrne said yesterday in an e-mailed
statement. The company &#8220;prohibits any form of retaliation
against an employee who may file a complaint under the UBS
sexual-harassment policy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Byrne said the punitive-damages verdict will be limited to
$500,000 by caps on such awards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ingraham will also be seeking future lost pay and
attorneys&#8217; fees to be added to the verdict, Dennis Egan, her
lawyer, said. These amounts will be determined by the court and
the punitive award will be capped at five times the final
judgment, under law, Egan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Ingraham v. UBS Financial Services Inc., 0916-
CV-36471, Circuit Court, Jackson County, Missouri (Kansas City) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glaxo Said to Pay $120 Million to Settle Denture-Cream Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) has paid at least $120 million to
resolve claims that some of its Poligrip products have caused
neurological disorders because the denture cream contains zinc,
two people familiar with the accords said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glaxo, the U.K.&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, resolved more than 100
lawsuits over the past nine months alleging it failed to warn
consumers about Poligrip&#8217;s zinc-related health risks, the people
said. The accords averaged more than $1 million apiece said the
people, who declined to be identified because they weren&#8217;t
authorized to speak publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;GSK has been dogged by litigation over a variety of its
products and has been moving aggressively to resolve those
cases,&#8221; Navid Malik, a London-based analyst with Matrix
Corporate Capital LLP, said in a phone interview. &#8220;I see these
settlements as part of that effort.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials of London-based Glaxo agreed in February to
remove zinc from its line of denture-cream products after
researchers linked some neurological problems, including nerve
damage, to heavy use of zinc-laden denture adhesives. The
company&#8217;s Super Poligrip Original, Ultra Fresh and Extra Care
products all contained the ingredient, which improves adhesive
power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bethany Burtyk, a U.S.-based spokeswoman for Glaxo, said
the company doesn&#8217;t comment on cases in litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glaxo, which said in July 2010 that it had resolved some
Poligrip suits, noted this year in a U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission filing it had &#8220;reached agreements in
principle to settle the vast majority of the current cases.&#8221;
Glaxo officials didn&#8217;t comment in the filing on the value of the
settlements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consolidated case is In Re Denture Cream Products
Liability Litigation, 09-02051, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of Florida (Miami.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actelion to Appeal Jury Verdict in Asahi Kasei Drug Dispute &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actelion Ltd. (ATLN) will appeal a California jury verdict
awarding Asahi Kasei Pharma Corp. about $577 million in a
dispute over development of a lung drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asahi Kasei yesterday won $30 million in punitive damages
from three executives of Allschwil, Switzerland-based Actelion,
on top of the $547 million in compensatory damages a state court
jury in San Mateo, California, last week determined that the
drugmaker must pay. No punitive damages were awarded against
Actelion or three other corporate defendants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The ruling is neither supported by the facts nor is it
correct as a matter of law,&#8221; Actelion said today in a
statement. The Swiss company said it filed a motion that may
lead to a &#8220;substantial reduction&#8221; in the compensatory figure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The award may add to pressure on Actelion as the drugmaker
battles a hedge fund that has proposed that shareholders oust
board members at the annual meeting tomorrow. The fund, Elliott
Advisors (UK) Ltd., has said Chief Executive Officer Jean-Paul
Clozel should leave Actelion&#8217;s board and the company should
consider options including a sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the earlier liability phase of the trial, Tokyo-based
drugmaker Asahi Kasei claimed Actelion acquired CoTherix Inc. to
halt work on the fasudil lung drug and protect profit margins
for its own competing product, Tracleer. Before the acquisition,
CoTherix was developing fasudil with Asahi Kasei. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Asahi Kasei Pharma Corp. v. Actelion Ltd., CIV
478533, Superior Court of California (San Mateo County). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BP Unit to Pay $25 Million to Settle Alaska Spill Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A BP Plc unit agreed to pay $25 million to settle a U.S.
lawsuit stemming from two oil spills in Alaska and other alleged
environmental violations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc., in filing yesterday in
federal court in Anchorage, Alaska, agreed to pay the civil
penalty and to make improvements on its pipelines. London-based
BP didn&#8217;t admit any liability, according to the proposed
agreement. The public will have 30 days to comment on the
settlement, which must be approved by a judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Defendant has started implementation and operation of
some corrective measures, including replacement of the Prudhoe
Bay oil transit lines, improved leak detection on the oil
transit lines, and improved operation and maintenance of the
Pipeline System,&#8221; the Justice Department said in the proposed
agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. sued BP in 2009 for violations of the Clean Air
Act, the Clean Water Act and federal pipeline-safety laws. The
violations arose from two spills of crude oil in Alaska in 2006
and improper removal of asbestos materials from its pipelines
that same year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A BP spokesman, Steve Rinehart, said in an e-mail that
&#8220;the terms of the agreement are fair.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc., 09-cv-
00064, U.S. District Court, District of Alaska (Anchorage). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mylan Lawsuit Over Ranbaxy&#8217;s Lipitor Copy Thrown Out by Judge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mylan Inc.&#8217;s lawsuit seeking to force the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration to act on Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. (RBXY)&#8217;s
application to sell a generic version of Lipitor was dismissed
by a federal judge in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge James Boasberg ruled that drugmakers
can&#8217;t sue over pending applications filed by their competitors,
according to an opinion filed May 2 in federal court in
Washington. He also said Mylan&#8217;s lawsuit is premature, since an
application from its Matrix Laboratories Ltd. subsidiary to sell
a copy of the cholesterol-lowering drug is still pending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nothing prevents Mylan from seeking judicial recourse if
and when FDA renders a final exclusivity decision that is not to
Mylan&#8217;s liking,&#8221; Boasberg said in the ruling, quoting an FDA
document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranbaxy plans to begin selling copies of the Pfizer Inc. (PFE)
drug in November, although it doesn&#8217;t yet have FDA clearance.
Mylan had sued the agency in March, claiming that it and other
generic-drug makers should be allowed to enter the market as
early as June because of manufacturing violations at two Ranbaxy
factories in India. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A call to Mylan&#8217;s corporate communications office after
regular business hours wasn&#8217;t immediately returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sandy Walsh, an FDA spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t immediately return
a voice-mail message left after regular business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. U.S. Food and
Drug Administration, 11-cv-00566, U.S. District Court, District
of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Coal Liable for $104.1 Million, Court Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Coal Group Inc. (ICO), the company that agreed May
2 to be bought by Arch Coal Inc. (ACI) for $3.4 billion, said a court
held that it&#8217;s liable for $104.1 million after it breached a
coal supply contract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wolf Run, a subsidiary of Scott Depot, West Virginia-based
International, breached a coal supply contract with Allegheny
Energy Supply and Monongahela Power Company when it declared
force majeure and temporarily idled a mine in the third quarter
of 2006, a trial court ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International said that it has enough cash on hand and
credit to appeal the case and that it doesn&#8217;t expect the ruling
to derail the merger with Arch, to be completed by June 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think a $100 million ruling is going to stop Arch
from going through with a multibillion-dollar merger,&#8221; said
Jeremy Sussman, an analyst at Brean Murray  Co. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Walt Disney Co. (DIS) unit sued Dish
Network Corp. (DISH), the second-largest U.S. satellite-TV provider,
for copyright violations in connection with the distribution of
movies on the Starz service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dish gave subscribers free access to the Starz premium
television service, including copyrighted movies that were
provided by Disney on the condition that Starz operate as a
premium channel such as HBO, Cinemax and Showtime, according to
the lawsuit. Starz, a unit of John Malone&#8217;s Liberty Media Corp.,
wasn&#8217;t named in the suit filed May 2 in federal court in New
York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Dish&#8217;s unlawful distribution, transmission, copying and
public display and/or performance of the Starz programming,
including Disney Enterprises&#8217; copyrighted movies, has already
resulted in the repeated and continuing infringement of
plaintiffs&#8217; copyright rights,&#8221; according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dish, which agreed along with EchoStar Corp. yesterday to
pay TiVo Inc. $500 million to settle patent litigation, said in
a statement that it pays &#8220;hundreds of millions of dollars&#8221; for
the right to distribute Starz content to its customers,
including the rights to several Disney movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Dish Network does not have visibility to the contract
between Starz and Disney, but we will vigorously defend our
rights against any attempt to drag customers into the middle of
their dispute,&#8221; Englewood, Colorado-based Dish said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Disney Enterprises Inc. v. Dish Network LLC,

(Manhattan) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DirecTV Sues 19 Defendants, Says Service Hijacked to Canada &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DirecTV Inc. (DTV), the largest satellite-television company in
the U.S., sued nine named and 10 unnamed defendants for
copyright infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Newnan, Georgia, on
May 2, accuses the defendants of hijacking DirecTV&#8217;s subscriber
accounts, creating fraudulent subscriber accounts and obtaining
and distributing DirectTV programming to Canadian businesses and
individuals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DirectTV isn&#8217;t authorized to sell its services in Canada,
the El Segundo, California-based company said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the ways in which the defendants are accused of
infringement is by adding unauthorized &#8220;mirrored&#8221; satellite
receiving equipment to legitimate accounts without the knowledge
of or authorization by DirectTV or its subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defendants also allegedly exported DirecTV receiving
equipment to Canada and activated the equipment without
authorization and in violation of U.S. laws, the company said in
its complaint. They have operated websites displaying the
DirecTV marks and used them to deceive the public into thinking
they were offering legitimate DirecTV services, according to
court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The satellite-television company said its investigators
initiated controlled purchases of DirecTV services through the
defendants that weren&#8217;t authorized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It asked the court to order the defendants to stop their
infringing activities and for awards of money damages, profits
derived from the alleged infringement, extra damages to punish
the defendants for their actions, and litigation costs and
attorney fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DirecTV is represented by Matthew Dexter Richardson and
Matthew D. Justus of Atlanta&#8217;s Alston  Bird LLP and Scott T.
Wilsdon and John H. Jamnback of Seattle&#8217;s Yarmuth Wilsdon Calfo
PLLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is DirecTV, v. Gabor Milisic, 11-cv-00066, U.S.

&lt;h2&gt;Royal Orchid Barred From Using &#8216;Orchid&#8217; for Any New Hotels &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Orchid Hotels Ltd., (ROHL) the Bangalore-based hotel chain,
cannot use the world &#8220;orchid&#8221; or a symbol of the flower in any
new hotels or other businesses, the Times of India reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s High Court acted in response to oppositions from
Kamat Hotels India Ltd. (KHI) of Mumbai, which registered &#8220;orchid&#8221;
as a trademark in October 2007, according to the Times of India. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamat has operated a five-star hotel in Mumbai under the
Orchid name since 1997, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court didn&#8217;t bar the use of the Orchid name for Royal
Orchid&#8217;s 11 existing hotels in India, saying the court can make
a distinction between already-operating businesses and those
which haven&#8217;t opened, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony to Use &#8216;Brand Ambassadors&#8217; for Next James Bond Film. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony Corp. (6758) and the MGM studio agreed that $45 million of
the next James Bond film&#8217;s production costs will be raised
through product placement, the Australian newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That amount is twice what Bulgari SpA, Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)&#8217;s
Lexus unit and American Express Co. (AXP) paid to appear in Steven
Spielberg&#8217;s 2002 &#8220;Minority Report,&#8221; the previous record holder
for product-placement dollars, according to the Australian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony is using &#8220;brand ambassadors&#8221; to connect with
potential sponsors, including Chinese technology companies,
according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film, presently code-named &#8220;Bond21,&#8221; is scheduled to
be released in November 2012, the Australian reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Alibaba Welcomes U.S. Praise of Intellectual-Property Efforts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. said it will &#8220;further enhance
the level of trust and integrity&#8221; in its online marketplaces
after the U.S. Trade Representative urged other Chinese e-commerce operators to follow the company&#8217;s lead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taobao, Alibaba&#8217;s online marketplace, started examining
vendors&#8217; advertising and sales to provide leads to Chinese law
enforcement on infringing activities, the USTR said in its
annual review of the global state of intellectual-property
rights protection and enforcement, released May 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We appreciate the USTR&#8217;s acknowledgment of our ongoing
efforts to work with brand owners in protecting their
intellectual-property rights,&#8221; Alibaba, the owner of China&#8217;s
biggest online retailer, Taobao.com, said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alibaba started an anti-piracy campaign in March after the
U.S. Trade Representative identified Taobao and an online
marketplace operated by Baidu Inc. as &#8220;notorious,&#8221; along with
the Silk Market in Beijing and the Ladies&#8217; Market in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other online platforms, especially those cited as
&#8220;notorious markets&#8221; in the earlier report, should follow
Taobao&#8217;s lead in increasing cooperation with Chinese police and
U.S. rights holders, the U.S. trade office said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The U.S. also encourages Chinese enforcement agencies to
reach out not only to the larger foreign enterprises, but also
to small and medium enterprises that are also being injured by
counterfeit goods,&#8221; the USTR said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Osama Bin Laden&#8217;s Death Commemorated on CafePress Products &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CafePress.com, the San Mateo, California-based company that
prints user-designed T-shirts and other items on demand, now has
more than 3,000 designs related to Osama bin Laden, many
submitted after the al-Qaeda leader was killed by U.S. forces on
May 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a public figure, under trademark law, bin Laden wouldn&#8217;t
have been able to halt such use of his name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the products addresses the &#8220;birther&#8221; controversy
about the president&#8217;s birth certificate. It&#8217;s a bumper sticker
with a photo of the president and the text &#8220;Hey birthers, sorry
it took so long to get you my birth certificate. I was busy
killing Osama bin Laden.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another sticker reads &#8220;Excuse me Mr. bin Laden, Some U.S.
Navy SEALS are here to see you.&#8221; Along that same line is a t-shirt printed with the text &#8220;Navy Seals 1, Bin Laden 0.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mugs and T-shirts can be ordered with the text &#8220;Obama got
Osama.&#8221; One design is related to potential Republican
presidential candidate Donald Trump&#8217;s doubts about the
president&#8217;s birth certificate. The mug features a caricature of
Trump and the text, &#8220;I refuse to believe that Osama bin Laden
is dead until I get his official original death certificate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;FTC&#8217;s Leibowitz Denounces Patent Accords That Delay Generics &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drug company deals to delay the introduction of generic
drugs rose 63 percent last year, Chairman Jon Leibowitz of the
Federal Trade Commission said, calling such arrangements
&#8220;collusive&#8221; and costly to consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of such agreements among makers of brand-name
and generic medicines rose to 31 in fiscal year 2010 from 19 the
year before, Leibowitz said yesterday in an interview at the
Bloomberg News office in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These are sweetheart deals,&#8221; Leibowitz said. &#8220;They are
outrageous, and they harm consumers. Either the courts or
Congress needs to stop them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices of generic drugs are generally 20 percent to 30
percent less than those of brand-name drugs and in some cases as
much as 90 percent cheaper, the FTC said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency has challenged such settlements in court,
contending that they are anticompetitive and violate U.S.
antitrust law. The FTC has supported legislation in Congress
that would prohibit settlements increasing the cost of
prescription drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlements are known as reverse-payment or pay-for-delay deals because the brand-name company compensates the
generic-drug maker in return for dropping challenges to patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court challenges haven&#8217;t always been successful. In
September, a federal appeals court refused to reconsider whether
a Bayer AG (BAYN) settlement of a challenge to its patent on the
anthrax treatment Cipro was appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic are
focusing on how settlements between companies that make branded
medicines and generics might harm consumers. Bayer was among
drugmakers told by European Union officials in January to submit
details of patent-settlement deals that may delay the
introduction of generics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) in 2006 tried to protect its heart
pill Plavix, the company&#8217;s best-seller, from generic competition
in a transaction that resulted in the firing of former Chief
Executive Officer Peter R. Dolan. Dolan made a deal to delay
sales of cheaper Plavix copies by Apotex Inc., violating terms
of a deferred prosecution agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cephalon Inc. and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) face
an EU investigation of a deal that delayed generic versions of
Cephalon&#8217;s biggest product, Provigil, a treatment for excessive
sleepiness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cephalon last year lost an attempt to dismiss U.S.
antitrust suits, including one by the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission, over patent-infringement settlements it reached
regarding generic versions of Provigil. It also lost a U.K. bid
in November that aimed to block Mylan Inc. and Orchid Chemicals
 Pharmaceuticals Ltd. from selling generic versions of the drug
in Britain before a patent trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;University Seeks Patent on Lobster-Shell Golf Ball Invention &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of Maine applied for a patent on a invention
that uses ground-up lobster shells to make biodegradable golf
balls, the school said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shells are a byproduct of the lobster canning industry.
They are ground up and mixed with a biodegradable binder and
coating, the school says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market for such golf balls would be cruise ships.
Golfers could hit the balls off the ship and into the water
without adding to pollution of the ocean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a 2007 story in the New York Times, the
practice of hitting golf balls into the ocean from cruise ships
was ended in 1990 when the International Maritime Commission
banned the dumping of plastic into the ocean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of ingredients to make a single golf ball would be
about 19 cents, the school said. The balls, which will be white
and dimpled, can be used with both wood and iron clubs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another possible use for the invention would be surveying
stakes or plant pots that decompose when placed in the ground. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application isn&#8217;t yet published in the database of the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;N.C. State Licenses Biofuel Technology to Avjet&#8217;s Red Wolf &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AvJet Biotech Inc.&#8217;s Red Wolf Refining unit took a license
to technology developed at North Carolina State University for
producing biofuels from fats and for producing products from
genetically modified marine microalgae, the Pinehurst, North
Carolina-based company said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has an exclusive license to the invention, and
will reimburse the school for its investment in patent
applications. To date, patent applications have been filed in 22
foreign countries in addition to the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said it will sell stock and used the funds to
reimburse the university and for development capital to create a
production model for the biofuel-refining system. The ultimate
aim is the production of aviation biofuels. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The death of al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin
Laden may weaken al-Shabaab, the group of Islamic insurgents
fighting for control of Somalia, Ethiopia&#8217;s National Security
Adviser said, according to Walta Information Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Al-Shabaab receives &#8220;financial and technical assistance&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;Somalia has been mired in a civil war for two decades and
hasn&#8217;t had a functioning central government since the 1991
ouster of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre. Most of southern and

Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed&#8217;s government controls only parts of
Mogadishu, the capital, backed by African Union peacekeepers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. are dropping bets against Treasuries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic growth is falling short of forecasts and market
participants may need to reduce their yield predictions, Jim Caron, the New York-based global head of interest-rate strategy
at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a report yesterday. Goldman Sachs
cited Federal Reserve comments and a slower-than-forecast pace
of inflation in a report the same day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rally in Treasuries is confounding traders and economists
who predicted yields would rise as the economy improved. The
opposite has happened as data showed gross domestic product
growth slowed and housing market is struggling to rebound. Bill Gross, who runs the world&#8217;s biggest bond fund at Pacific
Investment Management Co., said he is sticking to his bearish
view on U.S. debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have recently turned neutral from bearish on bonds,&#8221;
Caron wrote. &#8220;We are also tactically looking to buy bonds if
yields rise. Consensus forecasts for yields are at risk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasuries returned 1.2 percent in April, the most since
August, based on Bank of America Merrill Lynch data. Ten-year
yields fell to a six-week low of 3.23 percent today, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The notes yielded 3.24 percent as
of 7:35 a.m. in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, two of the 20 primary
dealers authorized to trade directly with the Federal Reserve,
both said in their reports they may turn more bearish later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprise Index &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields slid last month as the Commerce Department said on
April 28 that GDP growth slowed to an annual rate of 1.8 percent
in the first quarter, from 3.1 percent in the previous three
months. Residential real-estate prices dropped 3.3 in the 12
months to February, the most in more than a year, SP/Case-
Shiller data showed April 26. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Citigroup U.S. Economic Surprise Index fell to negative
6.7 yesterday, the lowest level since December, indicating that
economic data are falling short of forecasts by the steepest
degree this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks and securities companies surveyed by Bloomberg
predict Treasury yields will keep rising. The 10-year rate may
climb to 3.59 by June 30 and 3.91 percent by year-end, the
companies said, with the most recent forecasts given the
heaviest weightings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pimco&#8217;s Gross said a federal funds target at virtually zero
posed a threat to bondholders amid quickening inflation and
negative real yields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real Yield &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There should be little doubt that simply holding
Treasuries at these yield levels for an extended period of time
represents an abdication of responsibility,&#8221; Gross wrote in his
monthly outlook on Pimco&#8217;s website yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross, 67, bet against U.S. government-related debt in
March and boosted cash to be the largest of the company&#8217;s $241
billion Total Return Fund holdings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed has kept its target rate for overnight lending in a
range of zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real yield, or the difference between the consumer
price index and the 10-year Treasury rate, declined to 0.55
percent yesterday, the least since 2008. Based on two-year
Treasuries, the real yield is negative 2.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs dropped its recommendation for investors to
bet against five-year notes, Francesco Garzarelli, the London-
based chief interest-rate strategist, wrote in his report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fuel Prices &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The trade performed well through mid-April until a
combination of dovish Fed comments, slightly softer-than-
expected inflation prints, and ongoing concerns that high fuel
prices will hit consumer spending&#8221; triggered demand for bonds,
Garzarelli wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed Bank of New York President William C. Dudley said on
April 1 the recovery is &#8220;tenuous.&#8221; Janet Yellen, vice chairman
of the Fed&#8217;s Board of Governors, said April 11 the increase in
food and fuel costs will have only a temporary impact on prices
and consumer spending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consumer-price index excluding food and energy rose 0.1
percent in March, less than the 0.2 percent increase projected
in a Bloomberg survey, the Labor Department said April 15. Oil
rose to a 31-month high this week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gerdau SA (GGBR4), the largest steel producer
in the Americas, chose three Brazilian banks to manage a $3.5
billion share sale last month. U.S. firms JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
and Citigroup Inc. (C), which led previous deals for the company,
weren&#8217;t in the mix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Magazine Luiza SA, an electronics and furniture
retailer, held an initial public offering in April that raised
$586.7 million, it asked Banco Itau BBA SA, the investment-
banking unit of Brazil&#8217;s largest lender, to lead the deal.
Foreign banks weren&#8217;t invited. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a sign of the times,&#8221; Jean-Marc Etlin, vice
president for investment banking at Itau BBA, which also worked
on the Gerdau share sale, said April 19 in an interview in Sao
Paulo. &#8220;Brazilian companies and entrepreneurs are learning that
they don&#8217;t need a foreign bank to help them with their financing
needs. Local banks have got what it takes to do even the most
sophisticated deal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign firms pursuing investment-banking fees in Brazil,
where an emerging middle class and rising commodity prices are
propelling one of the world&#8217;s fastest-growing economies, face
stiff competition. Local players have a greater capacity to
finance deals, improved relationships with investors,
experienced executives and the ability to provide services once
offered only by large global banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Entrenched Competitors&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strength of Brazilian lenders in investment banking is
unusual for emerging markets, said Christopher Harland, head of
Latin America for Morgan Stanley (MS), which has 300 people in Sao
Paulo, Brazil&#8217;s financial hub. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You don&#8217;t find many markets where you have those kinds of
strong, well-capitalized, entrenched competitors,&#8221; said
Harland, who is based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil, which has experienced boom-and-bust cycles of
inflation, currency devaluations and interest-rate swings since
the end of military government in 1985, is surging again. Gross
domestic product expanded 7.5 percent last year, the most in two
decades, compared with 2.8 percent in the U.S. and 1.3 percent
in the U.K., according to the International Monetary Fund.
Unemployment is at record lows and credit at all-time highs, as
inflation in April likely exceeded 6.5 percent, central bank
President Alexandre Tombini has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower Fees &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian issuers sold a record 290.7 billion reais ($180
billion) in stocks and fixed-income instruments in 2010,
compared with 107.2 billion reais the previous year, according
to investment-banking association Anbima. Last year&#8217;s offerings
included the $70 billion sale of shares in state-owned oil
company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4), the largest equity sale ever,
for which Itau acted as joint global coordinator. Brazil had 143
mergers and acquisitions totaling $84.8 billion in 2010, the
most since 2006, according to Anbima. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment-banking fees are lower than in the U.S. --
typically 2.5 percent for equity offerings, said Andre Fernandes Berenguer, head of global banking and markets at Banco Santander
Brasil SA, the Brazilian unit of Banco Santander SA (SAN), Spain&#8217;s
biggest lender. Average fees for U.S. equity deals were 3.3
percent in 2010 and 3.4 percent so far this year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Banks in Brazil also split the money
more ways because companies hire more firms to manage deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, investment-banking fees in Brazil were about $1
billion last year, according to two dealmakers who asked not to
be identified because they&#8217;re not authorized to speak publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTG, Itau &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment banks based in Brazil, including Itau, Banco BTG
Pactual SA and Banco Bradesco BBI SA -- the firms that managed
the Gerdau share sale -- maintain a grip on equity and debt
offerings, even as foreign firms poach employees and ramp up
operations in Latin America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTG, the Sao Paulo-based investment bank owned by Brazilian
billionaire Andre Esteves, who bought it back from UBS AG (UBSN) for
$2.5 billion in 2009, ranked No. 1 last year in advising on
mergers and acquisitions, up from seventh place in 2009,
according to Anbima. A spokeswoman for BTG said bank executives
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Itau BBA, a unit of Sao Paulo-based Itau Unibanco Holding
SA (ITUB4), was the top underwriter of equity and debt offers in the
first two months of the year, according to Anbima. It was first
in debt and second in equity offerings last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Itau&#8217;s shares rose 1.1 percent to 35.75 reais as of 5:09
p.m. in Sao Paulo, while the benchmark Bovespa index slid 0.3
percent to 63,407.01. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Takes Experience&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), ranked second in advisory work on
MA deals announced last year, was more frequently among the top
five managers in equity sales and MA over the past five years
than any foreign bank, according to Anbima. The Zurich-based
bank, which gained a foothold in Brazil in 1998 when it acquired
Banco de Investimentos Garantia, the biggest investment bank at
the time, led five of this year&#8217;s seven IPOs in Brazil,
according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Selling a well-known, traded Brazilian company like
Gerdau to global investors isn&#8217;t that difficult,&#8221; Jose Olympio Pereira, 48, head of investment banking at Credit Suisse&#8217;s
Brazilian unit, said in an April 15 interview in Sao Paulo. &#8220;It
takes experience and talent to sell new ideas to the market at a
price that investors and the company will be happy with.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gerdau said in a regulatory filing today it raised
approximately 5 billion reais from the share sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Brazilian banks held the top five positions in debt
offerings last year and the first three spots in equity sales,
foreign firms made a stronger showing in MA advisory, capturing
four of the top five slots, according to Anbima. JPMorgan was
No. 3, followed by Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Itau BBA fell to ninth place in MA from fifth in 2009 and
second in 2008. Bradesco BBI, which was third in 2009, didn&#8217;t
make the top 10 last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;All Their Power&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), whose chief economist, Jim O&#8217;Neill, coined the term BRIC for emerging markets Brazil,
Russia, India and China, hasn&#8217;t made the top 10 in any category
since 2008, after a run as the top merger adviser in Brazil for
the three years through 2005, according to Anbima. Andrea Rachman, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in New York, declined
to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs today named Alejandro Vollbrechthausen to
replace Valentino Carlotti as president of the Brazilian unit,
according to an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg.
Vollbrechthausen previously managed Goldman Sachs&#8217;s emerging-
market sales desk in New York, the memo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross-Border Deals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claudio Berquo, 50, senior country officer for JPMorgan in
Brazil, said the New York-based lender wasn&#8217;t trying to compete
with Itau in all businesses. Instead it&#8217;s focusing on investment
banking, especially cross-border deals, and private wealth
management for high-net-worth Brazilians. The bank wants to be
&#8220;more local than the global banks and more global than the
local banks,&#8221; he said in an interview at JPMorgan&#8217;s
headquarters in New York last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to go head-to-head with Itau where they
have all their power,&#8221; Berquo said. &#8220;What JPMorgan is in the
U.S., they are in Brazil.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which has had a presence in Brazil for more than
40 years, has seen the size of its workforce there fluctuate
with the health of the economy. It doesn&#8217;t issue credit cards or
have retail branches, compared with Itau, which has about 3,000
in Brazil. JPMorgan has 630 employees in Brazil and plans to
expand to more than 1,000 by late 2013, said Berquo, who has
worked at JPMorgan since 1994. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lan Airlines &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank was the lead adviser to Chile&#8217;s Lan Airlines SA (LAN) in
its $3.7 billion takeover of Brazil&#8217;s Tam SA (TAMM4) to create Latin
America&#8217;s largest, and the world&#8217;s 11th biggest, passenger
carrier. The deal, announced in August, is pending an antitrust
review in Chile. JPMorgan also advised Gerdau on its $1.6
billion deal in August to complete the purchase of Tampa,
Florida-based Gerdau Ameristeel Corp., the second-largest mini-
mill steel producer in North America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gerdau, based in Porto Alegre, Brazil, bypassed JPMorgan
for its share sale in April because the Brazilian banks it
selected &#8220;had their abilities tested in other deals,&#8221; Chief
Financial Officer Osvaldo Burgos Schirmer said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The chosen banks have a strong presence in Brazil,
knowledge of the steel sector, market intelligence, presence in
the main financial centers of the world and a long relationship
with the company,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign banks such as JPMorgan, Bank of America and Credit
Suisse see opportunity as more family-run businesses like Gerdau
search for investors and deals outside Brazil, bankers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asian Clients &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;One of the things we do well is cross-border deals,&#8221;
said Hans Lin, senior investment banker for Bank of America in
Brazil. &#8220;We have the power to connect the client in Brazil to a
target in Asia or the client in Asia to a target in Brazil.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan acquired a majority stake in Rio de Janeiro hedge
fund Gavea Investimentos Ltda for an undisclosed sum in October
to expand its asset-management division. The fund, run by former
Brazilian central banker Arminio Fraga, 53, manages about $6
billion for high-net-worth investors. Credit Suisse made a
similar acquisition in 2006, buying a controlling stake in
Brazilian asset manager Hedging-Griffo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Private banking is a great source of investment-banking
business,&#8221; JPMorgan&#8217;s Berquo said. &#8220;If you have a private-
banking relationship, there&#8217;s always an opportunity to offer
services selling the company or taking the company public.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real&#8217;s 47 percent appreciation against the dollar since
December 2008 and the rise in the volume of deals involving
Brazilian firms has made the country one of the most expensive
in the world to staff, bankers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Lack of Talent&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a lack of talent in Brazil because everybody
wants to be in Brazil,&#8221; Berquo said. &#8220;Now it&#8217;s becoming the
new private-equity Mecca. Everybody is doing private equity in
Brazil. Blackstone is there, KKR is there, Carlyle is there,
plus the local players who&#8217;ve been there forever. So the
competition for people is tough.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup in March hired Andre Kok from Itau BBA, where he
had worked for the past six years, to head corporate and
investment banking in Brazil. About 75 percent of the New York-
based lender&#8217;s senior investment bankers in Latin America are
new to the company or the job, said Eduardo Cruz, Citigroup&#8217;s
head of banking for Latin America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You have to hire senior talent in the region, and the
best places to have found some of that has been competitors,&#8221;
said Cruz, who was hired from Goldman Sachs in 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley&#8217;s Harland said the firm is recruiting
students from local universities. Bank of America&#8217;s Lin said the
Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender is adding corporate
bankers, risk managers and administrative staff to accommodate a
new corporate bank in Brazil that will offer deposit accounts
and cash services to local companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bradesco BBI, the investment-banking unit of Osasco,
Brazil-based Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4), the country&#8217;s second-biggest
bank by market value, has been hiring from outside, an exception
to its policy of cultivating executives internally, said Renato Ejnisman, director of the division. The unit was created in late
2006, shortly before Ejnisman, who has a doctorate in physics
from the University of Rochester, joined Bradesco from Bank of
America, where he had worked for eight years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We want to expand our client base and improve
relationships with the advantage of the strong presence Bradesco
has among corporate clients in Brazil,&#8221; Ejnisman said. &#8220;We
don&#8217;t have the history that our global competitors have in the
investment-banking market, but we have equipped ourselves to
fight shoulder-to-shoulder for business in Brazil and abroad.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sompo Japan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bradesco has the biggest team of bankers in Brazil to
distribute Brazilian assets globally and to identify demand from
foreign clients for deals involving Brazilian companies,
Ejnisman said. He cited the bank&#8217;s role advising Sompo Japan
Insurance Inc., the country&#8217;s second-largest non-life insurer,
when it bought a 50 percent stake in Brazilian insurance company
Maritima Seguros SA in 2009 for 328 million reais. Maritima
hired JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When the deal was announced, everyone thought we were
working for Maritima,&#8221; Ejnisman said. &#8220;But it was the other
way around. The Japanese client hired us. This story that only
global banks can distribute Brazilian products or do cross-
border deals has definitely become a myth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One bank that considers itself both global and local is
Santander, which expanded in Latin America in the 1990s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABN Amro Unit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Madrid-based bank bought regional lender Banco do
Estado de Sao Paulo SA, known as Banespa, for $4.8 billion in
2001, paying three times the price offered by the next-highest
bidder. Its 2007 purchase of ABN Amro Holding NV&#8217;s Brazil unit
for 11 billion euros ($16 billion) vaulted Santander into the
top three non-state-owned banks in Latin America&#8217;s biggest
economy, with 376 billion reais in assets, 54,000 employees and
2,395 branches as of December, according to data from Brazil&#8217;s
central bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Santander is the most global Brazilian bank and the most
Brazilian of international banks,&#8221; Roberto Barbuti, 42, head of
the equities division at Banco Santander Brasil SA&#8217;s global
banking unit, said in an April 14 interview in Sao Paulo. &#8220;We
have a strong ability to lend to clients here in Brazil and
abroad, and that is an advantage we have over banks that have a
small presence outside of Brazil.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santander&#8217;s purchase of ABN Amro&#8217;s Brazilian unit led to
consolidation among rivals. In November 2008, Itau announced it
was buying Uniao de Bancos Brasileiros SA, or Unibanco, for
$12.5 billion to create Brazil&#8217;s biggest bank and the 12th
largest in the world by market value. The deal was in part
spurred by Santander, which had become a &#8220;new kind of player,&#8221;
Itau Chief Executive Officer Roberto Egydio Setubal said at a
press conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petrobras Shares &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, Itau has won mandates to coordinate Brazil&#8217;s
biggest deals, such as last year&#8217;s Petrobras share offer and the
IPO of highway and ports operator EcoRodovias Infraestrutura
Logistica SA in March 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Itau has built a formidable investment bank,
Santander has an edge in some businesses, because of its larger
market valuation, and in certain markets, including Europe,
where it has more experience, Barbuti said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Any advantage is temporary,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You have to keep
working. It used to be more of an advantage a few years ago. Now
it&#8217;s shrinking.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Etlin, 48, Itau BBA&#8217;s investment-banking vice president who
joined from UBS in 2005 after starting his career at JPMorgan a
decade earlier, doesn&#8217;t plan on easing the pressure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Working in investment banking in Brazil is like running a
marathon,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But at sprinting speed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A U.S. judge granted JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM)&#8217;s request to decide whether the trustee liquidating Bernard Madoff&#8217;s firm has the right to sue the bank for $6.4 billion,
alleging it aided the confidence man&#8217;s fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in New York set a
briefing schedule for JPMorgan&#8217;s argument that the case should
be dismissed, saying she will write an opinion explaining her
decision, according to a court filing yesterday. The bank will
ask her to dismiss the case next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McMahon&#8217;s decision is the latest challenge to trustee
Irving Picard, who has filed more than 1,000 suits claiming $100
billion for investors in the Ponzi scheme. HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)
this week asked U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan to
dismiss a $9 billion lawsuit against it and so-called feeder
funds, saying Picard isn&#8217;t allowed by law to bring such suits on
behalf of Madoff customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the HSBC case temporarily, Rakoff agreed with the
U.K. bank that Picard&#8217;s lawsuit raised issues beyond the
jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court where Picard filed the
suit. He said he would decide whether Picard can bring common-
law claims such as unjust enrichment and can sue on behalf of
customers, since his job is to liquidate the Madoff firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bankruptcy Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard, whose firm has sought $175 million for work since
Madoff&#8217;s 2008 arrest, has fought to keep his cases in bankruptcy
court. JPMorgan &#8220;no doubt hopes to distance itself both from
the thousands of victims of that scheme and from other alleged
wrongdoers&#8221; by going to district court, Picard said in a March
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The issue of JPMC&#8217;s misconduct belongs before the
bankruptcy court as the court most versed in the nuances of the
Ponzi scheme and the roles of other, related wrongdoers in that
scheme,&#8221; he told Rakoff in the filing in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan. &#8220;JPMC seeks refuge in this court to escape the
scrutiny of the bankruptcy court.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, a lawyer for Picard, Deborah Renner, said, &#8220;We are
confident in the strength of our claims and pleased with the
district court&#8217;s decision&#8221; to examine the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Judge Colleen McMahon&#8217;s decision means that the trustee&#8217;s
case will move forward on a fast timetable, which will
ultimately help speed recoveries for the victims of the Madoff
fraud,&#8221; she said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard sued JPMorgan in December, claiming the bank, as
Madoff&#8217;s main lender, aided the fraud and should pay for
investors&#8217; losses in specified years. Denying wrongdoing, New
York-based JPMorgan said it had a right to a jury trial in the
district court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard&#8217;s suit raised &#8220;unsettled questions&#8221; of law beyond
the expertise of a bankruptcy court, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Frivolous&#8217; Argument &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan accused Picard of fighting a &#8220;backdoor&#8221; class-
action suit and said a bankruptcy trustee generally can&#8217;t sue
third parties on behalf of creditors. Calling the argument
&#8220;frivolous,&#8221; Picard disagreed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Chip Bowles, a bankruptcy lawyer at Greenebaum
Doll  McDonald PLLC in Louisville, Kentucky, the U.S. Congress
has said district courts should hear cases that involve
&#8220;unsettled questions of non-bankruptcy law.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 72, pleaded guilty to orchestrating the biggest
Ponzi scheme in history. He&#8217;s serving a 150-year sentence in
federal prison in North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. JPMorgan Chase  Co., 1:11-cv-00913,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V), the world&#8217;s biggest bank-
card network, said fiscal second-quarter profit rose 24 percent,
beating analysts&#8217; estimates, on a pickup in consumer spending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income for the three months ended March 31 climbed to
$881 million, or $1.23 a share, from $713 million, or 96 cents,
in the same period a year earlier, the San Francisco-based
company said today in a statement. The average estimate of 29
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was $1.21 a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Joseph W. Saunders, 65, is buying
back shares as more people pay with plastic and U.S. consumer
spending rebounds. Household purchases, which account for about
70 percent of the economy, rose at a 2.7 percent pace in the
first quarter, the Commerce Department said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company posted &#8220;double-digit growth in payments
volume, cross-border volume and Visa-processed transactions from
across the globe,&#8221; Saunders said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa fell $1.07 to $78.70 today on the New York Stock
Exchange and slid 1.5 percent at 5:08 p.m. in extended trading.
The shares have declined 8.9 percent in the past year, lagging a
15 percent gain for No. 2 network MasterCard Inc. (MA), based in
Purchase, New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12 Billion Transactions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide spending on Visa debit and credit cards climbed
13 percent to $861 billion, the company said. Cross-border
volume, a measure of spending by cardholders outside their home
countries, advanced 13 percent. Processed transactions rose 13
percent to 12 billion, compared with the same period a year
earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net revenue increased 15 percent to $2.25 billion, while
operating expenses rose 3 percent to $862 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saunders is facing investor concern that U.S. caps on
debit-card &#8220;swipe&#8221; fees, or interchange, may lead to more
regulation and damage Visa&#8217;s business model. Visa and MasterCard
set the fees and pass the money to card-issuing banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve has proposed capping the fees at 12
cents a transaction, replacing a formula that costs merchants an
average of 1.14 percent of the purchase price, or about 44
cents. The curbs may reduce annual revenue by $12 billion at
U.S. banks that issue Visa and MasterCard debit cards, including
Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) and JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule may be delayed or modified. Senator Jon Tester, a
Montana Democrat, has introduced a measure that would delay the
Fed&#8217;s rulemaking. Anticipation of such action is pushing Visa&#8217;s
shares higher, Tien-tsin Huang, a JPMorgan analyst, wrote in a
May 2 note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company bought back about 8.7 million shares in the
quarter valued at $630 million and authorized a new $1 billion
repurchase program, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National Stock Exchange of India Ltd.,
the nation&#8217;s largest bourse, will seek to collaborate with other
exchanges on joint products rather than merge or acquire to
drive growth, the chief executive officer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NSE plans to introduce rupee-denominated derivatives 
based on the U.K.&#8217;s benchmark FTSE 100 Index, the 
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average
and is seeking an &#8220;exciting Far Eastern product,&#8221; Ravi Narain 
said in an interview at the World Federation of Exchanges
IOMA/IOCA conference in Mumbai. The exchange will also expand
in currency and interest-rate derivatives, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are busy focusing on internal organic growth,&#8221;
Narain, 55, said. &#8220;Broader alliances outside India work well
for us. The moment you do a merger with one exchange you lock
out all other exchanges -- we are more interested in looking at
product by product alliances to see what are the gaps and needs
in the Indian financial firmament that we can fill.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exchanges have announced takeovers totaling about $20
billion since October as competition forces chief executive
officers to seek to cut costs by expanding into new markets.
Indian government rules mean shareholders in Mumbai-based NSE,
which include Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Temasek Holdings Pte,
can only take a 5 percent stake in the privately held company
that has 77 percent of equity trading in the world&#8217;s second-
fastest growing major economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Markets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Boerse AG agreed a $9.5 billion purchase of NYSE
Euronext that would create the world&#8217;s largest exchange
operator. London Stock Exchange Group Plc said it will acquire
Canada&#8217;s TMX Group Inc., owner of the Toronto bourse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. and IntercontinentalExchange Inc.
announced a rival offer for NYSE Euronext, which the company&#8217;s
board has twice rejected. The current wave of consolidation
started in Asia when Singapore Exchange Ltd. (SGX) bid for ASX Ltd.,
the Australian stock exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As the developed-market consolidation game plays out,
there&#8217;s an equally large chunk of the world that is watching
these developments with huge interest but with an understandable
amount of caution,&#8221; Narain said. &#8220;The big-ticket
consolidations are new and still underway and only time will
tell. The jury is still out.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SGX deal, unanimously recommended by the companies&#8217;
boards, was blocked by Australian regulators who cited national
interest, leading SGX President Muthukrishnan Ramaswami to say
earlier this week that the exchange now thinks collaboration
ventures in Asia are likelier than mergers. Narain said he was
&#8220;stunned&#8221; at the Australian decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring to India &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NSE said in July it&#8217;s in discussions with the Tokyo Stock
Exchange for companies in both countries to list shares in each
other&#8217;s markets. NSE&#8217;s customers are increasingly looking to
diversify their holdings to include more non-Indian assets, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are going to understand and analyze what are the
assets people are looking at and bring them to India to trade as
a rupee-denominated asset on the NSE,&#8221; said Narain, who studied
at the Cambridge University in the U.K. and the U.S. Wharton
School of Business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average daily turnover on the NSE over the past year is
140 billion rupees as compared with 42 billion rupees on the
Bombay Stock Exchange, Asia&#8217;s oldest bourse, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s economic growth and corporate earnings lured
foreign investors to buy a record $29.4 billion of local
equities last year and made the local benchmark index the best
performer and most expensive among the world&#8217;s 10 biggest
markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign funds invested a net 72.1 billion rupees in April
and 69 billion rupees in March, after withdrawing 94 billion
rupees in the first two months of 2011, according to data on the
website of the Securities and Exchange Board of India. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When everyone else is rushing into India why would I go
rushing out?&#8221; said Narain, who helped set up the NSE and has
been involved in it since its incorporation in 1992. &#8220;If there
are six exchanges that are in fierce competition to each other
on a global platform, we can happily tie up with each of them
without ruffling any feathers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) lost at least
its fourth senior U.S. energy investment banker in a year, as
Adam Peakes in Houston quit to join former colleagues at Tudor,
Pickering, Holt  Co., said a person with knowledge of the move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peakes, a managing director at New York-based Goldman
Sachs, will have the same title at Tudor, Pickering when he
joins later this year, said the person, who requested anonymity
because Peakes hasn&#8217;t started at his new job yet. Tudor,
Pickering is an energy-focused investment bank based in Houston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has lost energy bankers to competitors as a
boom in mergers and acquisitions among oil and gas companies
puts the professionals in demand. Energy deals jumped 57 percent
to $357 billion in 2010 from $227 billion the previous year,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brady Parish, a Goldman Sachs managing director in Houston,
left last year and opened an office for Moelis  Co. this year.
William Montgomery, a partner in Houston, is retiring and plans
to join a local private-equity firm. Raymond Strong, a managing
director in New York, quit for Evercore Partners Inc. this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrea Rachman, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peakes was part of the Goldman Sachs team that is advising
offshore driller Pride International Inc. (PDE) on its proposed $7
billion sale to Ensco Plc. He advised Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI) on its
$5.5 billion purchase of BJ Services Co. last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tudor, Pickering was formed in 2007 by Bobby Tudor, a
former Goldman Sachs partner, and Dan Pickering. Maynard Holt,
the co-president, is also a former Goldman Sachs banker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Byron Trott&#8217;s BDT Capital Partners LLC and ex-Murphy Oil
Corp. Chief Executive Officer Claiborne Deming agreed last month
to provide $110 million to Tudor, Pickering. Trott founded his
Chicago-based firm in 2009 after leaving Goldman Sachs, where he
was a vice chairman and arranged some of the biggest purchases
by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign purchases of emerging-market
debt issued in local currency may fall about 39 percent this
year as measures to stem capital inflows curb investors,
according to analysts at JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign purchases may fall to $107 billion this year from a
record $174 billion last year, analysts including Joyce Chang,
JPMorgan&#8217;s New York-based global head of emerging-markets
research, wrote in a report. Flows to Latin America will tumble
to $15 billion from $38 billion, partly due to a tax on foreign-
bond purchases, the analysts wrote. Flows to Asia may fall to
$62 billion from $82 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing-nation &#8220;local markets are unlikely to see a
repeat of the record foreign buying that occurred in 2010,&#8221; the
analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging-market countries including Brazil and South Korea
have implemented capital controls in an effort to limit upward
pressure on their currencies from investors attracted by their
relatively high economic growth and low debt ratios. Brazil
imposed a 6 percent tax on foreign purchases of local bonds, and
South Korea introduced a levy on non-deposit foreign-currency
liabilities held by domestic and foreign banks to reduce the
won&#8217;s volatility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The supply of emerging-market debt is growing as developing
nations&#8217; governments turn to funding themselves in their own
currencies in order to limit risk from exchange rate volatility,
JPMorgan said. Local currency-denominated debt markets will grow
between 10 percent and 15 percent a year for &#8220;at least the next
decade,&#8221; they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 82 percent of emerging-market government debt, worth
$5.5 trillion, is locally denominated, the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, named Alejandro Vollbrechthausen to
replace Valentino Carlotti as president of the Brazilian unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlotti, who has led Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Brazil business since
April 2007, will remain in the region &#8220;over the next several
months to effect a smooth transition&#8221; before relocating to New

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the biggest U.S. securities firm before
converting to a bank holding company in September 2008, is
expanding in economies in emerging markets including China,
Russia and India, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign investment banks have faced increased competition
from local companies in Brazil as they seek wealth-management
and advisory business in Latin America&#8217;s biggest economy.
Brazil&#8217;s gross domestic product expanded 7.5 percent last year,
the most in two decades. Unemployment is at all-time lows and
credit has expanded to record highs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vollbrechthausen previously managed the emerging market
sales desk in New York, according to the memo, which was
confirmed by Michael DuVally, a spokesman in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Carlotti&#8217;s management, Goldman hired bankers to start
a local private-banking business and asset-management division
in 2009, which completed the firm&#8217;s strategy to establish a
full-service bank in the region after two failed attempts to buy
local lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Carlotti&#8217;s arrival in Brazil, the Wall Street firm
increased its Brazil-based staff to about 300 people from about
10 bankers and traders who advise on mergers, underwrite
securities, trade derivatives and commodities and analyze
companies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa SAB (KOFL), Latin America&#8217;s
largest soft-drink company, plans to build a $160 million
bottling plant in Colombia, said Jose Castro, director of
investor relations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plant will be located in the northern area of Bogota
and will begin operations in three to five years, he said in a
telephone interview today. The company yesterday announced it
will build a $146 million bottling plant in Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Colombia, shipments of carbonated drinks, flavored water
and water rose 5.2 percent in 2010 to 244.3 million unit cases
from 232.2 million in 2009, according to company&#8217;s financial
reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plant in Brazil will be located in the state of Minas
Gerais and have annual production capacity of 2.1 billion liters
by 2015, the company said yesterday in a statement. Castro
declined to provide the production capacity of the Colombian
plant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the investment in the two plants, Chief Financial
Officer Hector Trevino said that the company will boost its
original capital expenditure plan by $60 million to $620 million
this year. He spoke during a conference call April 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa rose 44 centavos to 92.7 pesos in Mexico
City trading today. The shares have declined 9.3 percent this
year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerging-markets funds managed by
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Franklin Resources Inc. (BEN) were among
the U.S.-registered mutual funds that fell the most in this
week&#8217;s commodities selloff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $831 million Goldman Sachs BRIC Fund (GBRAX) and the $825
million Templeton BRIC Fund (TABRX), which focus on Brazil, China, India
and Russia, both dropped 5.7 percent in the week ended
yesterday. The funds, from New York-based Goldman Sachs and
Franklin Resources in San Mateo, California, were the biggest
losers among diversified equity funds with more than $500
million in assets and at least 20 percent in energy or basic
materials stocks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities plunged yesterday as investors accelerated
sales following year-to-date gains through April of more than 23
percent for silver, oil, gasoline and coffee. The Standard 
Poor&#8217;s GSCI index of 24 commodities sank 6.5 percent in the
biggest one-day drop since January 2009, bringing its loss this
week to 9.9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was a train wreck waiting to happen,&#8221; Michael Mullaney, portfolio manager at Boston-based Fiduciary Trust,
said in a telephone interview. Speculation drove commodity
prices well above reasonable levels, &#8220;and we are going to see
it shake out some more before we get back to normal prices,&#8221;
said Mullaney, who helps manage $9.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil tumbled 8.6 percent yesterday, the most in two years,
to $99.80 a barrel. Silver dropped 8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones BRIC 50 Index declined 5.1 percent from April
28 through yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil fell 2.6 percent today to $97.18 a barrel, the lowest
close since March 15. Silver dropped 2.6 percent to $35.29,
capping the week&#8217;s plunge at 27 percent, the biggest since at
least 1975. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;New Risks&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leaders of the four countries plus South Africa, a
group known as the BRICS, said last month that excessively
volatile commodity prices pose &#8220;new risks for the ongoing
recovery of the world economy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $726 million DWS Latin America Equity Fund, managed by
the funds unit of Frankfurt&#8217;s Deutsche Bank AG, fell 5.4 percent
in the past week. Boston-based Fidelity Investments&#8217; $5.46
billion Canada Fund lost 5.3 percent, and the $1.4 billion FPA
Capital Fund, run by Los Angeles-based First Pacific Advisors
LLC, dropped 4.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds dedicated to
commodities, including index-based products, suffered steeper
declines. The ProShares Ultra Silver (AGQ) ETF, designed to return
twice the daily performance of silver, plummeted 51 percent in
the week. Non-leveraged silver ETFs fell about 30 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Miller, manager of the $3.94 billion Legg Mason
Capital Management Value Trust (LMVTX), said in an April 19 letter to
investors that he saw little value in commodities. He pointed to
research from Stifel, Nicolaus  Co. showing that commodity
returns relative to stock returns were at a 200-year high on a
rolling 10-year basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Cyclical&#8217; Returns &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;One thing is clear from the analysis of long-term
commodity returns: they are cyclical,&#8221; Miller wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open interest in silver futures has tumbled about 15
percent since the Comex exchange in New York began raising
margin requirements on April 25. Futures on Brent crude, crude
oil, heating oil, gasoline and natural gas plunged more than 6.9
percent yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude oil dropped below $100 a barrel for the first time
since March 17. Copper futures slumped 3.3 percent, falling
below $4 a pound for the first time in five months. Among
agricultural commodities, cocoa, cotton, corn and weak retreated
more than 2.3 percent in futures trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack Ablin, chief investment officer for Chicago-based
Harris Private Bank, said commodity prices would eventually
resume their climb. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we have lost the tail wind,&#8221; Harris, who
helps manage $55 billion, said in a phone interview. &#8220;They may
have moved up too far too fast, but the long-term underpinnings
for higher prices are still in place.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shareholder approval for Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s 2010 compensation plan, which doubled pay for
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, tumbled
to 73 percent from 96 percent a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Counsel Gregory K. Palm announced the vote tally at
the end of today&#8217;s annual meeting, held for the first time at
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s building in Jersey City, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s significant when you&#8217;ve got a quarter of all shares
voting against,&#8221; said Julie Tanner, assistant director of
social responsibility at Christian Brothers Investment Services
Inc., which manages $4 billion and owns about 67,000 shares of
New York-based Goldman Sachs. &#8220;What is the board going to do to
show that it&#8217;s responsive to shareholder concerns?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which set a record for Wall Street bonuses
in 2007, has given shareholders a non-binding advisory vote on
compensation, known as &#8220;say on pay,&#8221; for the past two years.
Shareholders at today&#8217;s meeting approved a measure that will
give them such a vote every year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for the bank, declined to
comment on the voting results. Shares of the company fell 31
cents, or 0.2 percent, to $150.10 in composite trading on the
New York Stock Exchange at 4:15 p.m. They are down 11 percent
this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay &#8216;Disconnect&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein&#8217;s $19 million compensation for 2010, which
included a $5.4 million cash bonus, was almost double the prior
year&#8217;s award even as profits fell and the share price was little
changed. Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. recommended
stockholders vote against the compensation plan, citing a &#8220;pay-
for-performance disconnect.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All six shareholder proposals were defeated at today&#8217;s
meeting, including two relating to pay. One would have required
named executive officers including Blankfein to retain 75
percent of their stock for at least three years after leaving
the company. The other would compel the board&#8217;s compensation
committee to review the firm&#8217;s policies and submit a report to
shareholders by Oct. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s an apparent lack of any serious commitment to pay
for performance,&#8221; said Lance E. Lindblom, president and CEO of
the Nathan Cummings Foundation, which submitted the proposal
requesting a report on compensation policies. Goldman Sachs is
&#8220;taking money from the company&#8217;s owners, its shareholders, to
reward executives presiding over its decline.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All 11 members of the company&#8217;s board of directors won re-
election with more than 90 percent of the vote, Palm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman, Buffett &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was the most-profitable securities firm when
Blankfein, 56, took the helm almost five years ago. While the
company survived the financial crisis that bankrupted smaller
rival Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and repaid U.S. rescue funds
and Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., its practices
before the crisis have remained under scrutiny. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At last year&#8217;s meeting, Blankfein created a business-
standards committee to study the firm&#8217;s practices and recommend
ways they could be improved. The committee, which issued a
report in January, was formed in part as a response to an April
2010 Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit alleging the
firm misled clients about a mortgage-linked investment. Goldman
Sachs paid $550 million in July to settle the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the self-examination that went into the business
standards committee report, Goldman Sachs learned &#8220;that not
every element of the firm was always operating in a way that was
of the highest order,&#8221; Blankfein said. &#8220;Not everybody will be
happy all the time. We do the best we can do.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legal Fees &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to shareholder questions at today&#8217;s meeting,
Palm disclosed that the firm spent $726 million on legal fees
last year and employs 286 full-time lawyers, up from 252 a year
ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month the U.S. Senate&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations issued a report on the causes of the financial
crisis that accused Goldman Sachs of misleading clients in its
sales of mortgage securities, a charge the firm denies. The
report was referred to the Justice Department and the SEC, which
have said they are looking into it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations issued a
report and we take into account all of it and we disagree with
some of it,&#8221; Blankfein said at today&#8217;s meeting. He added that
the company is trying to learn from the report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Coca-Cola Co. (KO) trademark-infringement
lawsuit against PepsiCo Inc. over fruit-juice packaging was
dismissed after the companies reached a settlement. Terms of the
settlement weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Sim Lake signed an order dismissing the
case after the world&#8217;s two biggest soft-drink makers submitted a
joint motion seeking to terminate it, according to a filing
yesterday in federal court in Houston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All matters in dispute in this case have been fully and
finally resolved by the parties,&#8221; both sides said in court
papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola, based in Atlanta, sued its smaller rival in
October claiming that the packaging for PepsiCo&#8217;s low-calorie
Trop50 fruit juice line would &#8220;likely deceive consumers and
dilute the quality&#8221; of Coca-Cola&#8217;s Simply brand of premium
juices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trial had been set for June. Lake told lawyers for Coca-
Cola and Purchase, New York-based PepsiCo in December that they
should try to settle out of court to avoid the expense of trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased we were able to amicably resolve this
dispute,&#8221; Dan Schafer, a Coca-Cola spokesman, said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;We will continue to diligently protect the
Simply brand&#8217;s iconic and distinctive packaging against
imitators and copycats.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Confidentiality Agreement&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citing a confidentiality agreement, Schafer declined to say
whether PepsiCo must alter its packaging design as a result of
the settlement. Timothy Durst, an attorney for PepsiCo, declined
to comment, citing the confidentially agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply and Trop50 juices are both packaged in clear plastic
carafes with oversized green screw caps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola introduced the Simply line in 2001, according to
court papers. PepsiCo began selling Trop50 juices in paper
cartons in 2009 and repackaged the product in the clear plastic
carafes last year, according to court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Coca-Cola Co. v. PepsiCo Inc., 10-04184, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston.) &lt;/p&gt;

director in the technology, media and telecommunications banking
group, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eisenberg will cover information services, publishing and

will be based in New York starting in August and report to Aryeh Bourkoff, head of investment banking for the Americas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS Chief Executive Officer Oswald Gruebel has hired more
than 1,700 bankers in the past two years to rebuild the
investment bank after more than $57 billion in writedowns and

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the only Wall
Street bank to remain profitable throughout the financial
crisis, is in &#8220;advanced&#8221; negotiations to resolve its piece of
a broader U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation
into how mortgage-linked securities were packaged and sold as
the housing market unraveled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s securities unit has been cooperating with agency
officials and &#8220;is currently in advanced discussions with the
staff concerning a potential resolution of that investigation,&#8221;
the New York-based bank said in a quarterly financial report
filed with the SEC today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC is working to wrap up investigations into how banks
bundled and sold investments tied to risky mortgages, after
years of being faulted by lawmakers and investors for failing to
hold Wall Street accountable for misconduct that may have fueled
the financial crisis. JPMorgan has been probed by the SEC for
its role in designing and selling a $1.1 billion collateralized
debt obligation known as &#8220;Squared&#8221; in 2007, according to a
person briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There can be no assurance that any such resolution will
be finalized or approved,&#8221; JPMorgan said in today&#8217;s filing. The
bank didn&#8217;t specify which CDOs were the subject of the SEC
talks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-
largest U.S. bank by assets, joined Bank of America Corp. (BAC) in
reporting a perfect trading period in the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s revenue linked to market risk was higher than
$160 million on seven of the period&#8217;s 64 trading days, the New
York-based lender said today in a filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. The average daily revenue
was $112 million, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm, led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 55, had $6.64 billion in sales and trading revenue in the
first quarter, second only to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) among the
biggest U.S. banks. JPMorgan posted perfect trading periods in
three of four quarters last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets were affected during the first quarter by Japan&#8217;s
worst earthquake on record and a resulting tsunami and nuclear
crisis, which triggered the biggest three-day climb in the
Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index since May 2010
and an 18 percent drop in the Nikkei 225 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the bank had eight days of trading losses, a
feat that Jes Staley, 54, CEO of the investment bank, said in
February he didn&#8217;t expect to repeat. Including other market-
related risks, the bank had 13 days of losses in 2010, according
to its annual report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s figures may not be directly comparable with
other banks&#8217; because they also include market risk besides
trading, such as principal transactions in its chief investment
office and some mortgage fees and hedges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America&#8217;s trading-related revenue was positive
every day and exceeded $25 million on 98 percent of days during
the year&#8217;s first three months, according to a filing yesterday
by the Charlotte, North Carolina-based firm. In 2010, it had
gains on 90 percent of trading days, with perfect records in
that year&#8217;s first and third quarters, according to previous
filings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Siemens AG (SIE) picked Deutsche Bank AG (DBK),
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and UBS AG (UBSN) as global coordinators for
the initial public offering of its Osram GmbH lighting unit
later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The selection is &#8220;an important foundation for the success
of the IPO,&#8221; Chief Financial Officer Joe Kaeser said in a
statement. The banks were chosen from &#8220;a strong group,&#8221; and
Munich-based Siemens will select more institutions to help with
the offering scheduled for fall 2011 later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winning the mandate for Osram bolsters the standing of
Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs in the lucrative market to
arrange stock listings, after the two banks were announced
yesterday as coordinators on Evonik Industries AG&#8217;s IPO this
year, slated to be Germany&#8217;s biggest offering in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has underwritten global equity offerings
worth $22.4 billion so far this year, making it the top
investment bank in this market, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank, which tops the ranking for
international bond sales this year, is fourth, while UBS ranks
ninth, according to the data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siemens said March 28 it planned to cede control of Osram
as Chief Executive Officer Peter Loescher focuses the company
around energy, industry, infrastructure and health care,
shifting away from consumer-based products. Siemens has exited
industries including phones and consumer electronics, and
Loescher has taken the company deeper into areas such as
renewable energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintain Stake &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siemens plans to maintain a minority stake in Osram, which
it says will benefit from growth in the global lighting
industry. Osram is a leader in energy-efficient light-emitting
diodes, together with companies such as Cree Inc. in the U.S.
and Japan&#8217;s Nichia Corp., Kaeser has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Osram is the world&#8217;s second-largest lighting company,
behind Amsterdam-based Royal Philips Electronics NV. Siemens,
which announced earnings on May 4, has started treating the
subsidiary as a discontinued operation. Wolfgang Dehen, who
previously ran the energy division, took over as head of Osram. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Osram, which will maintain its headquarter in Munich, has
an enterprise value of 5 billion euros ($7.3 billion) to 7
billion euros, according to analyst estimates. The initial
public offering stands to be among the biggest listings in
Germany in the past decade, when the country&#8217;s average IPO had a
value of about 120 million euros, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Osram has about 40,000 employees globally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evonik, the German specialty chemicals company partly owned
by buyout firm CVC Capital Partners Ltd., yesterday said it
chose Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs to coordinate its IPO,
which the company aims to undertake later this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s Gavea
Investimentos Ltda., the investment company founded by former
Brazil central banker Arminio Fraga, is setting up a $2 billion
fund to buy stakes in Brazilian companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gavea, which manages $2.5 billion in three private-equity
funds, will return proceeds from two of them to investors this
year as it starts the new one as early as this month, Gavea
partner Amaury Bier said in an interview at his office in Rio de
Janeiro yesterday. Consumer goods are among the industries Gavea
identified as the best opportunities for stake purchases, though
its funds don&#8217;t focus on specific sectors, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The consumer story in Brazil&#8221; is being boosted by income
growth, said Bier, a former deputy finance minister who runs
Gavea with Fraga. &#8220;This is very powerful and will continue.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackstone Group LP (BX), Carlyle Group and KKR  Co. are among
global firms buying stakes in Brazilian businesses to tap family
consumption that jumped 7.5 percent in the fourth quarter from a
year earlier. Private-equity funds have as much as $8 billion
ready to buy stakes in the country, Piero Minardi, a partner at
Gavea, said at the Bloomberg Brazil Economic Forum in Sao Paulo
on March 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raia SA (RAIA3), the Brazilian drugstore chain that raised 655
million reais ($404 million) in an initial public offering last
year, is among family-owned consumer goods businesses that Gavea
invested in and helped sell shares. It has gained 5.4 percent in
Sao Paulo trading since the IPO in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highbridge Capital &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s Highbridge Capital Management agreed to buy 55
percent of Gavea last year and may acquire a further 45 percent
within five years. The sale to JPMorgan gives Gavea access to a
&#8220;fantastic distribution network outside Brazil&#8221; while helping
the New York-based bank increase its presence in the country as
other global securities firms build up their local teams, Bier
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS AG&#8217;s Brazil unit plans to more than double its
workforce as it seeks to reach 5 billion Swiss francs ($5.7
billion) of private-banking assets under management in five
years, country manager Lywal Salles said in an interview last
week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4) and Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4), Brazil&#8217;s
two largest banks by market value, and Spain&#8217;s Banco Santander
SA have also set up private-equity funds in Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;

Harrington and Karen Freifeld" date="May 06, 2011  8:49 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-06/jpmorgan-chase-said-to-be-subpoenaed-by-sec-over-mortgage-debt-documents.html"><headline>JPMorgan Said to Face SEC Subpoena Along With Credit Suisse</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) received a
subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over
failed mortgages, a person familiar with the investigation said,
as the agency probes banks including Credit Suisse Group AG (CS) for
allegedly failing to share refunds from sellers of faulty debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse received a subpoena from the SEC last week,
bond insurer MBIA Insurance Corp. said in a filing yesterday in
a lawsuit against three of that Zurich-based bank&#8217;s units. The
agency asked New York-based JPMorgan for information after a
court in January unsealed allegations made about Bear Stearns
Cos.&#8217; practices in another suit, said the person, who declined
to be identified because the matter isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. investigators have been scrutinizing companies
involved in the mortgage business after the worst collapse in
home prices since the Great Depression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bond insurers MBIA and Ambac Assurance Corp. have said
Credit Suisse and Bear Stearns, which JPMorgan bought in 2008,
demanded refunds from originators that sold the banks the loans
that they packaged into bonds, and then failed to use those
settlement amounts to fulfill their own contractual promises on
the debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re really starting to finally get into evidence that
suggests blatant fraud,&#8221; said Isaac Gradman, a San Francisco-
based litigation consultant and formerly a lawyer at Howard Rice
Nemerovski Canady Falk  Rabkin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking Documents &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer R. Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan, declined to comment. Steven Vames, a Credit Suisse
spokesman in New York, declined to comment on MBIA&#8217;s statement
about an SEC investigation. John Nester, an SEC spokesman,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Brown, a spokesman for MBIA, said that Patterson
Belknap Webb  Tyler LLP as counsel for the bond insurer was
also subpoenaed by the SEC, seeking documents related to the
Credit Suisse matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. agencies have been seeking evidence of wrongdoing
across the mortgage industry from before the market collapsed in
2007. JPMorgan said in a regulatory filing today it&#8217;s in
&#8220;advanced discussions&#8221; with the SEC to resolve an investigation
into collateralized debt obligations, which package assets such
as mortgage bonds into new securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department sued Deutsche Bank AG this week for
more than $1 billion, saying the firm lied about its process for
checking the quality of loans granted federal insurance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlotte Stripper &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse knowingly packaged bad loans into bonds, MBIA
said in a court filing. The insurer included an exhibit in its
suit composed of e-mails related to a &#8220;stated income&#8221; loan
sought by a stripper in Charlotte, North Carolina, whose
reported monthly pay of $12,000 was questioned by some bank
employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MBIA Insurance Corp., the bond insurance unit of Armonk,
New York-based MBIA Inc. (MBI), disclosed Credit Suisse&#8217;s SEC subpoena
and the exhibit in a filing in New York State Supreme Court. The
document, dated April 29, was filed yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Credit Suisse is now the subject of an investigation by
the Securities and Exchange Commission, which issued a subpoena
this week seeking the same types of documents as MBIA seeks,&#8221;
the insurer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MBIA alleges in its lawsuit that Credit Suisse failed to
repurchase soured mortgages out of a 2007 securitization as it
was contractually obligated to do. Earlier, the bank made
demands similar to MBIA&#8217;s to recover funds from the originators
of the loans -- money it didn&#8217;t share with the securities&#8217;
buyers, MBIA said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambac Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The allegations echo claims made in January in a suit
brought by Ambac Assurance against the defunct investment bank
Bear Stearns and JPMorgan. Ambac first sued in 2008 in federal
court in Manhattan. The insurer filed a separate lawsuit over
the issues in New York State Supreme court in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ambac is a large, sophisticated insurance company that is
trying to blame others for risks it knowingly took and was paid
for taking,&#8221; Zuccarelli said earlier this year. &#8220;We do not
believe Ambac&#8217;s claims are meritorious and intend to defend Bear
vigorously.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse, in a filing in MBIA&#8217;s case on April 29, said
contracts for its mortgage-bond transaction didn&#8217;t call for the
bank to repurchase loans simply because they became delinquent
within a few months or involved borrower fraud. That differed
from contracts between mortgage originators and Credit Suisse,
the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originators&#8217; Commitments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse cited e-mails between its employees and MBIA
officials before the deal closed, which the bank argued had
stated explicitly that those so-called representations and
warranties wouldn&#8217;t be made. Representations and warranties are
contractual promises that loans meet certain characteristics or
will perform in certain ways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loan originators&#8217; commitments to Credit Suisse &#8220;are
different from -- and materially broader than -- Credit Suisse&#8217;s
representations and warranties&#8221; tied to the securitization
transaction, the bank said in court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;MBIA is entitled to what its contracts with CS provide,
and not more,&#8221; Vames, the Credit Suisse spokesman, said
yesterday in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MBIA said in yesterday&#8217;s court filing that Credit Suisse in
some cases cited the same issues as it later did to reach
settlements with lenders, and that any early loan defaults
should have been seen as &#8220;red flags&#8221; for further reviews of
its obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early Defaults &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A review by Credit Suisse in 2006 showed that 60 percent of
loans with early defaults failed to meet promised underwriting
guidelines, MBIA said, citing an e-mail between the banks&#8217;
employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;External auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP advised Bear
Stearns in August 2006 that it needed to review loans that were
defaulting or defective to see if their quality breached its
obligations and begin the &#8220;immediate processing of the buy-out
if there is a clear breach in order to match common industry
practices, the expectation of investors and to comply&#8221; with its
mortgage bonds&#8217; contracts, according to Ambac&#8217;s filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its own lawyers by early 2007 were making similar
suggestions, according to the insurer&#8217;s amended complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MBIA is seeking access to a database that contains
information about Credit Suisse&#8217;s &#8220;quality control and
repurchase processes&#8221; and shows how much the bank recovered
from loan originators, according to its suit. Before MBIA found
references to the database through the lawsuit, Credit Suisse
denied its existence, the insurer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Previously Securitized&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insurer&#8217;s filing said that it has also discovered &#8220;in
the last few weeks&#8221; that the securitization at issue in the
case, HEMT 2007-2, included home loans that &#8220;were previously
securitized by Credit Suisse and then repurchased by Credit
Suisse as defective, just months before Credit Suisse pumped
them&#8221; into the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;MBIA is unable to determine what Credit Suisse knew about
the defects associated with these recycled loans that required
their repurchase from other securitizations,&#8221; the insurer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MBIA filed hundreds of pages of records and e-mails between
Credit Suisse employees, loan originators and brokers that the
insurer says show the bank knew of -- and received recoveries on
-- loans on which borrowers misrepresented income or otherwise
failed to comply with underwriting guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They show Credit Suisse&#8217;s motivation and scienter for
fraudulently inducing MBIA to participate in&#8221; the bond deal,
the insurer said in court filings. The bank did so, &#8220;in part,
to obtain double-recoveries on the defective loans by shoveling
them into the trust, profiting from their securitization, and
then recovering again when it demanded that the originators of
those loans repurchase them, even though Credit Suisse no longer
owned the loans.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adult Entertainer &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the e-mails involving the North Carolina stripper&#8217;s loan
application, Credit Suisse employees questioned whether her
income was accurately reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have an adult entertainer that is stating $142,800 per
year,&#8221; Ron Szukala, a Credit Suisse underwriting manager in
Florida wrote in a January 2007 e-mail to another bank employee.
&#8220;While I know this profession can make decent money, we feel
that $142K is overstated in NC.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe she is making $12K per month,&#8221; Robert
Sacco, a director at the bank, wrote in a separate e-mail,
saying that of all the so-called Alt-A loans the bank bought in
2006, 1 percent of those with fully documented incomes had gone
delinquent for 60 days or more, compared with 5.56 percent for
loans with stated incomes. &#8220;5 1/2 times worse because they are
overstating their income on their application,&#8221; Sacco wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One case is MBIA Insurance Corp. v. Credit Suisse
Securities (USA) LLC, 603751/2009, New York State Supreme Court
(Manhattan). Another is Ambac Assurance Corp. v EMC Mortgage
Corp., 650421/2011, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan).

&lt;p&gt;A U.S. judge granted JPMorgan Chase 
Co.&#8217;s request to decide whether the trustee liquidating Bernard
Madoff&#8217;s firm has the right to sue the bank for $6.4 billion,
alleging it aided the confidence man&#8217;s fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in New York set a
briefing schedule for JPMorgan&#8217;s argument that the case should
be dismissed, saying she will write an opinion explaining her
decision, according to a court filing May 4. The bank will ask
her to dismiss the case next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McMahon&#8217;s decision is the latest challenge to trustee
Irving Picard, who has filed more than 1,000 suits claiming $100
billion for investors in the Ponzi scheme. HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)
this week asked U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan to
dismiss a $9 billion lawsuit against it and so-called feeder
funds, saying Picard isn&#8217;t allowed by law to bring such suits on
behalf of Madoff customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the HSBC case temporarily, Rakoff agreed with the
U.K. bank that Picard&#8217;s lawsuit raised issues beyond the
jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court where Picard filed the
suit. He said he would decide whether Picard can bring common-
law claims such as unjust enrichment and can sue on behalf of
customers, since his job is to liquidate the Madoff firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanda Remus, a Picard spokeswoman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard, whose firm has sought $175 million for work since
Madoff&#8217;s 2008 arrest, is fighting to keep his cases in
bankruptcy court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The issue of JPMC&#8217;s misconduct belongs before the
bankruptcy court as the court most versed in the nuances of the
Ponzi scheme and the roles of other, related wrongdoers in that
scheme,&#8221; he told Rakoff in the filing in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan. &#8220;JPMC seeks refuge in this court to escape the
scrutiny of the bankruptcy court.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard sued JPMorgan in December, claiming the bank, as
Madoff&#8217;s main lender, aided the fraud and should pay all of
investors&#8217; losses in specified years. Denying wrongdoing, New
York-based JPMorgan said it had a right to a jury trial in the
district court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 72, pleaded guilty to orchestrating the biggest
Ponzi scheme in history. He is serving a 150-year sentence in
federal prison in North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. JPMorgan Chase  Co., 1:11-cv-00913,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Altria Should Face Ill Smoker&#8217;s Suit, California Court Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altria Group Inc. (MO)&#8217;s Philip Morris USA Inc. should face
claims by a smoker who sued the cigarette maker for lung cancer
years after becoming ill, the California Supreme Court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plaintiff Nikki Pooshs smoked from 1953 through 1987 and
was diagnosed with pulmonary disease in 1989 and periodontal
disease in 1990 or 1991. She knew that both illnesses were
caused by smoking and didn&#8217;t file a lawsuit until she was
diagnosed with lung cancer in 2003, according to the advisory
opinion. Philip Morris won a lower court ruling that Pooshs
waited too long to file the claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The California Supreme Court, based in San Francisco, ruled
yesterday that the two earlier illnesses were &#8220;qualitatively
different&#8221; from cancer and didn&#8217;t trigger the statute of
limitations for suing for misrepresentation, concealment,
product liability and failure to warn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judges ruled after a federal appeals court in San
Francisco considering Pooshs&#8217;s case asked for an opinion on the
treatment of statute of limitations under California law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Although we are disappointed with the decision, the
California Supreme Court made it clear that it was not
addressing the merits of this case or any case,&#8221; Steve
Callahan, an Altria spokesman, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Pooshs v. Philip Morris USA Inc., S172023,
California Supreme Court (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BDO USA Settles Suit With Former Client Banco Espirito Santo &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BDO USA, the accounting firm formerly known as BDO Seidman
LLP, agreed to settle a lawsuit that accused it of failing to
detect a fraud in a joint venture of former client Banco
Espirito Santo SA. (BES) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BDO won reversal of a $521.7 million jury verdict in the
case last year when a Florida appeals court ordered a new trial.
The terms of the settlement are confidential, Jerry Walsh, a BDO
spokesman, said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;BDO USA LLP has entered into confidential settlement
agreements with Banco Espirito Santo and Barry Mukamal, the
bankruptcy trustee of E.S. Bankest LC, pursuant to which the
lawsuits against BDO have been resolved,&#8221; Walsh said in an e-
mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banco Espirito Santo, based in Lisbon, sued in 2004
claiming it suffered losses when New York-based BDO certified as
real accounts receivable at E.S. Bankest that were fake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1998, the bank formed E.S. Bankest, which bought
receivables and collected the debt, as a joint venture with
Bankest Capital. E.S. Bankest officials faked millions of
dollars in receivables, and four executives were later convicted
of crimes. Banco Espirito Santo sold its interest in 2002 for
$10 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florida&#8217;s Third District Court of Appeal in Miami ruled in
June that a 2007 jury award in the case should be reversed
because a decision to split a trial in three parts possibly
prejudiced jurors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge A. Jay Cristol in Miami, who is
overseeing E.S. Bankest&#8217;s bankruptcy case, ordered the
settlement papers sealed and will hold a private hearing in
chambers about the accord on May 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Banco Espirito Santo International Ltd. v. BDO
Seidman LLP, 04-14009-CA-01, 11th Judicial Circuit of Florida
(Miami-Dade County). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fannie Mae Loses Bid to Dismiss Ex-Contractor&#8217;s Lawsuit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fannie Mae lost its bid to dismiss a lawsuit filed by a
former contractor who alleges she was fired and blocked from a
Treasury Department job after complaining about the company&#8217;s
work on a program to modify home loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer in Washington
yesterday ordered Fannie Mae to turn over documents to help
determine whether the government-owned mortgage finance company
was a private employer or a federal entity when Caroline Herron
claims she was improperly fired and &#8220;blackballed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The outstanding issue that will govern this case and that
cannot be decided without a fact record is whether Fannie Mae
is, or was at the relevant time period, a &#8216;private&#8217; actor or a
&#8216;federal&#8217; actor,&#8221; Collyer said in her ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herron sued Fannie Mae and three current and former
executives last year, claiming they ruined her reputation in the
industry because she told Treasury officials that Fannie Mae
wasn&#8217;t pursuing loan-modification projects requested by the
department, such as the Making Home Affordable Program. Herron
seeks more than $1.2 million in damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amy Bonitatibus, a spokeswoman for Fannie Mae, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Herron v. Fannie Mae, 10-cv-00943, U.S.
District Court, District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barclays Must Return $2.1 Billion, Lehman Brokerage Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc (BARC), which bought Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.&#8217;s
North American business, must return $2.1 billion in margin
assets to the trustee liquidating the remnants of the brokerage,
the trustee said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trustee James Giddens raised his demand for margin assets
from $1.8 billion on April 28, as he and Barclays step up their
dispute over about $3.5 billion in assets after a judge&#8217;s ruling
failed to specify how much Barclays was entitled to take in
September 2008. He wants interest at 9 percent on the $2.1
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Giddens agreed to pay Barclays $869
million in damages plus 9 percent interest for failing to
deliver trading assets after the purchase. The so-called
clearance box assets were held to clear trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London-based Barclays is claiming $1.5 billion of the
disputed margin assets, saying it was entitled to take non-cash
margin in the deal. In a court filing May 4, it said the judge
&#8220;should clarify&#8221; his February order, spelling out the bank&#8217;s
right to margin and other assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays said it was entitled to $134.8 million owed to
futures exchanges, plus other sums for liabilities it took on
with the purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael O&#8217;Looney, a Barclays spokesman, didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The filings by Barclays and the Lehman brokerage come ahead
of a court conference scheduled for next week by U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge James Peck. The judge had directed Barclays and Giddens to
interpret the ruling he made in February granting the London-
based bank some assets and denying it some others, including
cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ), 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allen Stanford Indicted Again With 7 of 21 Charges Dropped &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R. Allen Stanford, the Texas financier accused by U.S.
prosecutors of leading a $7 billion investor fraud scheme, was
indicted again and accused of seven fewer counts than
previously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors filed a revised charging document May 4 in U.S.
District Court in Houston. Stanford, who has denied all
allegations of wrongdoing, has been in federal custody since
June 2009 awaiting trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford is accused of defrauding investors who bought
certificates of deposit issued by his Antigua-based Antigua-
based Stanford International Bank Ltd. by misleading them about
the nature of the investments and their regulatory oversight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original indictment contained 21 criminal counts. The
new one contains 14, including conspiracy to commit money
laundering, obstruction of a U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission investigation, wire fraud and mail fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two wire-fraud counts were dropped and five of mail fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The original indictment was such a mess, I think
prosecutors were just trying to clean up the charges,&#8221; Ali
Fazel, one of Stanford&#8217;s criminal-defense lawyers, said in a
telephone interview today. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think anything of relevance
has been dropped right now.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Stanford, 09-cr-00342, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ICP Founder Priore Challenged by SEC Over Home Transfers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICP Asset Management LLC founder Thomas Priore was accused
by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of illegally
selling two homes into trusts controlled by himself, his wife
and a friend after he was told the agency planned to sue him for
fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC yesterday asked a federal court in New York to let
it amend a complaint filed in June against Priore, ICP and two
related companies to include allegations that Priore
fraudulently transferred the homes, located on Martha&#8217;s Vineyard
in Massachusetts and in Chappaqua, New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the original complaint, the SEC claimed Priore and New
York-based ICP fraudulently directed more than $1 billion of
trades at artificially high prices on behalf of collateralized
debt obligations they managed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his lawyer was told the agency intended to sue,
Priore sold the Martha&#8217;s Vineyard property, for $1, and the
Chappaqua home, for $10, to the trusts &#8220;to hinder the
commission&#8217;s ability to collect disgorgement, penalties and
prejudgment interest from him,&#8221; the SEC said in its proposed
amended complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dane Butswinkas, a lawyer representing Priore and ICP,
declined to comment. The defendants have denied wrongdoing and
are fighting the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. ICP Asset Management LLC, 10-CV-4791,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam Jury Hears Replay of Chiesi Wiretaps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jurors in the Raj Rajaratnam insider-trading case listened
to replays of wiretapped recordings of the Galleon Group LLC co-
founder&#8217;s conversations with former trader Danielle Chiesi as
they continued to deliberate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury yesterday asked to hear six recordings played
during the trial in federal court in Manhattan. On one of them,
Chiesi, a former analyst at New Castle Funds LLC who has pleaded
guilty in the case, asked Rajaratnam whether she should &#8220;show a
pattern of trading.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You should buy and sell, and buy and sell,&#8221; Rajaratnam
said, according to a recording that prosecutors say is evidence
that the two tried to hide their illegal trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alleged Rajaratnam-Chiesi conspiracy is the fifth of
five separate insider-trading conspiracies on the list of
charges against Rajaratnam, who is also accused of making nine
specific illegal trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s anybody&#8217;s guess, but I think they&#8217;re close&#8221; to
reaching a verdict, said Anthony Sabino, who teaches law at the
Tobin School of Business at St. John&#8217;s University in New York.
He isn&#8217;t involved in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deliberations were restarted May 4, after U.S. District
Judge Richard Holwell replaced a juror who was dismissed for
medical reasons. Some of the Rajaratnam-Kumar recordings were
re-played May 4 for the new juror. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, 53, is on trial as part of the largest
crackdown on hedge-fund insider trading in U.S. history.
Prosecutors said he gained $63.8 million from tips leaked by
corporate insiders and hedge-fund traders about stocks including
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Intel Corp. (INTC) and Clearwire Corp.
Rajaratnam, who said he based the trades on research, faces as
long as 20 years in prison if convicted of the most serious
counts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 09-cr-01184, U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Says It Didn&#8217;t Discriminate Against Injured Banker &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-largest U.S. bank by
assets, said it didn&#8217;t discriminate against a London banker who
had his bonus cut and was fired after he reduced his hours
because of a skiing injury. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank is seeking to overturn a 2008 ruling that it
discriminated against Russell Chweidan, an executive director
for the bank&#8217;s hedge-fund sales credit team, on the grounds of
disability, JPMorgan lawyer Emma Smith said at a hearing
yesterday at the Court of Appeal in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chweidan seriously injured his back while skiing with a
client in March 2007, according to court documents. After the
injury he had to wear a back brace and work fewer hours. In
January 2008 he was given a bonus of $450,000, 44 percent less
than the previous year. Then in July 2008 he was fired. Later
that year, a London employment tribunal ruled he had been
discriminated against. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith said yesterday that, while the banker was disabled,
he lost his job after he couldn&#8217;t build up his narrow client
base because he couldn&#8217;t entertain prospective clients in the
evening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The reason why was a lack of a broad client base and the
reason for a lack of a broad client base was his hours,&#8221; she
said, adding an employee without a disability who was unable to
expand their client list would be treated exactly the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chweidan&#8217;s lawyer, Anna Beale, said the employment tribunal
was right to find he was discriminated against based on
disability. Chweidan was one of the strongest performers in his
team, yet he had &#8220;the greatest proportionate drop in bonus,&#8221;
she said. The bank may have chosen to pay him less because they
knew he would find it difficult to find another job. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawson Sued Over $2 Billion Offer From Golden Gate, Infor &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawson Software Inc. (LWSN), a global provider of business
software, was sued by an investor who said he will be
shortchanged in a proposed $2 billion takeover bid from Golden
Gate Capital Corp. and Infor Global Solutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanjay Israni, a Lawson stockholder, sued the company,
certain executives and the Golden Gate and Infor affiliate that
will be used for the acquisition on May 3 in Delaware Chancery
Court in Wilmington. Israni, who seeks to represent outside
investors as a group in the lawsuit, says the offer undervalues
the company and management failed to negotiate a better deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Rather than permitting the company&#8217;s shares to trade
freely and continue to benefit from Lawson&#8217;s opportunities for
long-term profitable growth,&#8221; the executives acted to benefit
themselves to the &#8220;detriment of the company&#8217;s shareholders,&#8221;
the investor said in the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terry Blake, a spokesman for Lawson, said in an e-mail that
the company doesn&#8217;t comment on pending litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The St. Paul, Minnesota-based company announced its
acceptance of the offer that pays stockholders $11.25 a share in
cash, in an April 26 statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At all relevant times, Lawson disclosed all material
information consistent with its duties under Delaware law,&#8221; and
&#8220;acted in good faith,&#8221; Lawson said in response to the
complaint, in court papers filed May 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Israni v. Lawson Software Inc., CA6443,
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Arcandor CEO Ordered to Pay Investor Over Thomas Cook Stake &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Middelhoff, the former Arcandor AG (ARO) chief executive
officer, was ordered to cover the losses an investor had on
Thomas Cook Group Plc (TCG) shares bought in 2008 after Arcandor
denied it was looking to sell its stake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Middelhoff intentionally damaged investors when he didn&#8217;t
prevent a company spokesman from telling the media that Arcandor
would keep shares of the travel company, while management was
secretly weighing selling them, an Essen, Germany, court ruled
yesterday. The suit was brought by Jan-Eric Peters, the editor
in chief of newspaper Die Welt, court spokesman Wolfgang Schmidt
said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arcandor, the former parent of German department-store
chain Karstadt, filed for insolvency in June 2009. Middelhoff&#8217;s
home and office were searched in October as part of a probe into
the company&#8217;s demise and any related misconduct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arcandor said on Sept. 24, 2009, that it had to &#8220;clarify&#8221;
an earlier statement that it wouldn&#8217;t give away part of its
majority stake in Thomas Cook to guarantee loans. The shares
fell 30 percent the next day. After several refinancing efforts
faltered, Arcandor announced that it would sell 23 million new
shares to Bank Sal Oppenheim Jr.  Cie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peters claimed he lost more than 50,000 euros ($73,000)
because he bought Arcandor shares relying on the information. He
limited his suit to 5,000 euros to avoid cost risks and was
awarded 2,575 euros yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Middelhoff&#8217;s attorney Hartmut Fromm said he will appeal
yesterday&#8217;s ruling. The court improperly declined to call
witnesses who would have backed Middelhoff&#8217;s position, Fromm
said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s case is LG Essen, 4 O 244/09. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sheryl Cwele, the wife of South
African Security Minister Siyabonga Cwele, was sentenced to 12
years in jail for trafficking cocaine, National Prosecuting
Authority spokeswoman Natasha Ramkisson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheryl Cwele and Nigerian co-accused Frank Nabolisa, who
was given the same sentence, will appeal their convictions,
Ramkisson said in a phone interview from Pietermaritzburg in
KwaZulu-Natal province, where the trial took place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors alleged that Cwele was involved in an attempt
to smuggle 9 kilograms (19.8 pounds) of cocaine from South
America in May and June 2008. Siyabonga Cwele has declined to
comment on the case and remains in his post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The minister is of the view that comment on this matter
might be premature because it is still a matter of the court
processes,&#8221; Brian Dube, the minister&#8217;s spokesman, said by phone
from Pretoria. &#8220;There is still an appeal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cwele&#8217;s bail was extended for the duration of her appeal,
Ramkisson said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) plans to boost
debt capital markets staff in the Asia-Pacific region by 30
percent to help Chinese companies sell bonds as measures to curb
inflation make borrowing in China more expensive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bulk of new hires will be in Hong Kong, while others
will join the Beijing operations of the bank&#8217;s joint venture
with First Capital Securities Co., Murlidhar Maiya, head of debt
capital markets for Asia ex-Japan, said in a phone interview
from Hong Kong. He declined to provide further details on staff
numbers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My team covers all 12 countries in non-Japan Asia but 100
percent of the new hires are focused on China, or the greater
China market,&#8221; said Maiya. &#8220;Domestic interest rates in China
are shooting up and the government is trying to curb credit. You
talk to any Chinese company and they&#8217;re looking at what they can
do offshore.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China has raised interest rates four times since September
to help curb inflation that reached a 32-month high in March.
Chinese companies may help sales of yuan-denominated bonds in
Hong Kong rise to as much as 150 billion yuan ($23 billion) this
year, according to HSBC Holdings Plc. Sales in dollars, euros or
yen this year from these issuers have increased almost six-fold
to $20.5 billion compared to the same period in 2010, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dim Sum Bonds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the No. 3 arranger of so-called Dim Sum bond
sales this year after organizing no issues of yuan-denominated
bonds in Hong Kong in 2010, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The New York-based company&#8217;s share in the so-called
G3-currency bond market involving Chinese issuers is 3 percent,
down from 9 percent the same period last year, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to China, the bank is focused on bond markets,
including local-currency issuance, in other parts of Asia such
as Korea and India, Maiya said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The number of bankers who are familiar with the offshore
Chinese debt capital markets is by definition very small because
until recently, most Chinese companies had no need to look at
dollar financing,&#8221; Maiya said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as searching for talent within the region, Maiya
said the bank is also &#8220;reaching out to find people in Europe
and the U.S. who are familiar with the language and the culture
and who are looking to come back home.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Christine Harper" date="May 06, 2011 12:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-06/goldman-s-blankfein-faces-investors-amid-lingering-problems-.html"><headline>Goldman&#8217;s Blankfein Faces Investors Amid &#8216;Lingering Problems&#8217;</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Lloyd C. Blankfein, chief executive
officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), has sought to quell
shareholder concerns about its bonuses and business practices at
the past two annual meetings. Today, he will try again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets hosts investors
for the first time at its building in Jersey City, New Jersey,
shareholders are still questioning Goldman Sachs&#8217;s actions
during the financial crisis, executive pay and business model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They really do have to reshape the firm and get the
message out there that &#8216;Look, here&#8217;s what we&#8217;re going to look
like going forward,&#8217;&#8221; said Peter Sorrentino, a senior portfolio
manager at Huntington Asset Advisors in Cincinnati, which
manages $14.8 billion, including almost 135,000 Goldman Sachs
shares. &#8220;I still think we&#8217;re one headline away from this stock
getting clobbered.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was the most-profitable securities firm when
Blankfein, 56, took the helm almost five years ago. While the
company survived the financial crisis that bankrupted smaller
rival Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and repaid U.S. rescue funds
and Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., its practices
before the crisis have remained under scrutiny. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs fell $1.11 to $150.41 yesterday on the New
York Stock Exchange and has dropped 10.6 percent this year,
compared with a 0.6 percent gain for the 82-member Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 Financials Index and a 6.2 percent advance for the
SP 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$550 Million Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At last year&#8217;s meeting, Blankfein created a business-
standards committee to study the firm&#8217;s practices and recommend
ways they could be improved. The committee, which issued a
report in January, was formed in part as a response to an April
2010 Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit alleging the
firm misled clients about a mortgage-linked investment. Goldman
Sachs paid $550 million in July to settle the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The questions didn&#8217;t end there. Last month the U.S.
Senate&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations issued a
report on the causes of the financial crisis that accused New
York-based Goldman Sachs of misleading clients in its sales of
mortgage securities, a charge the firm denies. The report was
referred to the Justice Department and the SEC, which have said
they are looking into it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are still lingering problems&#8221; for Goldman Sachs,
said Benjamin B. Wallace, an analyst at Westborough,
Massachusetts-based Grimes  Co., which manages about $1 billion
and doesn&#8217;t own Goldman Sachs stock. &#8220;If the Senate and the SEC
and the Department of Justice would stop investigating them they
could probably put it behind them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Sins of the Past&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The business-standards committee was a good idea for public
relations and a useful guide for future conduct, &#8220;but the
problem is that does not absolve you from the sins of the
past,&#8221; said Huntington&#8217;s Sorrentino. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would not at this moment say that any financial
services firm, especially Goldman, who was preeminent during
that whole time, is out of the woods on this,&#8221; he said. &#8220;At
this juncture, given the magnitude of what happened, I don&#8217;t
know what the time window is.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the meeting two years ago, as public outrage over Wall
Street bonuses swelled following the government bailouts of
financial institutions, Blankfein read shareholders a
description of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s compensation principles. The
principles included an emphasis on tying pay to long-term firm
performance and avoiding multiyear guarantees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cash Bonuses &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, who&#8217;s also Goldman Sachs&#8217;s chairman, and top
deputies including Gary D. Cohn, president and chief operating
officer, and David A. Viniar, chief financial officer, received
no bonuses for 2008 and no cash bonuses for 2009. Earlier this
year, Goldman Sachs disclosed that it was increasing salaries
for Blankfein and his deputies and paid Blankfein $19 million
for 2010, including a $5.4 million cash bonus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. recommended that
stockholders cast a non-binding vote against the awards for
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s executive officers. The ISS report cites a
&#8220;pay-for-performance disconnect&#8221; after Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
executives&#8217; compensation increased even as profits fell last
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glass Lewis  Co., another proxy advisory service,
expressed concern about Goldman Sachs&#8217;s &#8220;opaque program&#8221; for
determining compensation, even though it recommended that
shareholders vote in favor of the awards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social Responsibility &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian Brothers Investment Services Inc., which manages
$4 billion and owns about 68,000 Goldman Sachs shares, is voting
against the pay awards this year, said Julie Tanner, the firm&#8217;s
assistant director of social responsibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that the pay level is justified,&#8221; Tanner
said in an interview. &#8220;There&#8217;s a level beyond which pay is not
appropriate and needs to be reined in, and I think this company
is one of those examples.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For investors like Sorrentino, a bigger concern is how the
company plans to drive revenue and profit growth going forward.
Although the firm rebounded from the crisis to achieve record
profit in 2009, earnings sagged last year and in the first
quarter of 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s return on equity, a measure of how well the
firm reinvests shareholder capital, dropped to 11.5 percent in
2010 from 32.7 percent three years earlier. While it still beats
competitors including Morgan Stanley, whose 2010 return on
equity from continuing operations was 8.5 percent, investors
question whether the firm can achieve its former profitability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a more competitive framework out there and they
do have to scrape for business,&#8221; Sorrentino said. &#8220;In the
regulatory environment we find ourselves in, where does Goldman
sit in all this? How should we set our expectations for success
going forward?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two More Years &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein&#8217;s future at the firm continues to be subject to
speculation. Earlier this week, the New York Post, citing people
it didn&#8217;t identify, reported that Blankfein is likely to stay
for at least two more years. The company has said he has no
plans to leave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Probably starting about now is when he could safely leave
and say he got Goldman through everything,&#8221; said Grimes  Co.&#8217;s
Wallace. &#8220;But maybe with all the PR stuff, you want to stay on
because one thing you want to do when you turn it over to new
leadership is have a clean slate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

climbed to $881 million, or $1.23 a share, from $713 million, or
96 cents, in the same period a year earlier, the San Francisco-
based company said yesterday in a statement. The average
estimate of 29 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was $1.21 a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Joseph W. Saunders, 65, is buying
back shares as more people pay with plastic and consumer
spending rebounds. U.S. household purchases, which account for
about 70 percent of the economy, rose at a 2.7 percent pace in
the first quarter, the Commerce Department said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to have a huge opportunity almost everywhere
in the world,&#8221; Saunders said in a conference call with
analysts. &#8220;I think our numbers would suggest we are doing quite
well in Asia, other parts of Latin America and other regions
outside the U.S. I&#8217;m bullish on where we&#8217;ll be in the next few
years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa fell $1.07 to $78.70 yesterday in New York Stock
Exchange trading, before the results were announced. The shares
have declined 8.9 percent in the past year, lagging a 15 percent
gain for No. 2 network MasterCard Inc. (MA), based in Purchase, New
York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12 Billion Transactions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide spending on Visa debit and credit cards advanced
13 percent to $861 billion, the company said. Purchases climbed
12 percent to $230 billion in the Asia-Pacific region, and 26
percent to $77 billion in Latin America and the Caribbean. Card
spending in the U.S. climbed 12 percent to $477 billion,
according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross-border volume, a measure of spending by cardholders
outside their home countries, advanced 13 percent. Processed
transactions rose 13 percent to 12 billion, compared with the
same period a year earlier. Net revenue increased 15 percent to
$2.25 billion, while operating expenses rose 3 percent to $862
million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saunders is facing investor concern that U.S. caps on
debit-card &#8220;swipe&#8221; fees, or interchange, may lead to more
regulation and damage Visa&#8217;s business model. Visa and MasterCard
set the fees and pass the money to card-issuing banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve has proposed capping the fees at 12
cents a transaction, replacing a formula that costs merchants an
average of 1.14 percent of the purchase price, or about 44
cents. The curbs may reduce annual revenue by $12 billion at
U.S. banks that issue Visa and MasterCard debit cards, including
Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) and JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed Rulemaking &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule may be delayed or modified. Senator Jon Tester, a
Montana Democrat, has introduced a measure that would postpone
the Fed&#8217;s rulemaking. Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee
Republican, also is helping lead efforts to craft a bipartisan
bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saunders said he expects the Senate to consider Tester&#8217;s
measure in the &#8220;near future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa bought back about 8.7 million shares in the quarter
valued at $630 million and authorized a new $1 billion
repurchase program, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) raised its oil-
price forecasts because OPEC and other producers aren&#8217;t matching
rising demand and consumers will take time to react to higher
prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank boosted its 2011 Brent crude forecast to $120 a
barrel from $110, and changed its estimate for West Texas
Intermediate crude to $109.50 from $99. Forecasts for 2012
prices were raised to $120 and $114, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While financial bushfires or perhaps a rapid resolution
to the Libyan civil war could radically alter market dynamics,
the balance of both risks and fundamentals still points to a
supply-constrained world,&#8221; JPMorgan analysts led by New York-
based Lawrence Eagles wrote in a report yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil futures posted their biggest weekly decline since
December 2008 last week amid concern about the pace of the
economic recovery, with London-traded Brent plunging 13 percent
to $109.13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan forecasts supply to fall short of demand by
600,000 barrels a day during the third quarter, even with the
assumption that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries increases output by 1.2 million barrels a day in
coming months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gap could narrow to 300,000 barrels a day by the fourth
quarter, assuming Saudi Arabia increases production to 9.5
million barrels a day, Angola to 1.7 million and Iraq to 3
million, though &#8220;that may prove a stretch,&#8221; the bank said.
Output from those three OPEC countries in March was 8.66
million, 1.56 million and 2.69 million barrels a day,
respectively, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supply Gap &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers draw on stockpiles when production fails to match
demand. Still, &#8220;with inventories already below the five-year
average, any supply gap will have to be balanced by lower demand
growth, rationed by higher prices,&#8221; the New York-based bank
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next quarter there&#8217;s a risk oil may move toward record
levels near $150 set in 2008, unless there&#8217;s a surprise increase
in OPEC output beyond 29.4 million barrels a day or slower
economic growth, the bank said. JPMorgan forecast Brent to
average $130 and WTI $116 during the July-to-September period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the bank lowered its estimate of world demand by
100,000 barrels a day, in part because of the earthquake-led
disruptions in Japan, it raised its forecast for Chinese
consumption, saying data implies China&#8217;s crude-oil inventories
have been &#8220;drawn heavily&#8221; in the past six months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have observed a parallel destocking activity in the
copper market,&#8221; JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is returning
to Australia&#8217;s bond market for the first time since 2006 to take
advantage of relative yields on financial debt hovering at about
the lowest level in three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets sold A$1.25 billion
($1.35 billion) of 5 1/2-year notes yesterday, including A$500
million of floating-rate bonds priced to yield 205 basis points
more than the bank bill swap rate, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The extra yield investors demand to own Australian
dollar bank bonds instead of government debt has shrunk 37 basis
points this year to 157, compared with a drop of 31 on U.S.
financial securities to 175, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
indexes show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank follows JPMorgan Chase  Co. and
Bank of America Corp. (BAC) in returning to the so-called kangaroo
bond market, which shut to financial issuers in 2008 after the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. spurred investors to
shun all but the safest debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is a sign of market health that Goldman can consider
issuing in Australia,&#8221; said John Sorrell, head of credit at
Tyndall Investment Management Australia Ltd. in Sydney, who
helps manage about A$14 billion of fixed-income assets. &#8220;I
expect more financial kangaroo sales.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basis Swaps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Australia&#8217;s benchmark interest rate of 4.75 percent
compares with near zero in the U.S., the currency swaps market
is offering discounts to borrowers as they switch the proceeds
into U.S. dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five-year Australian dollar basis swap, which measures
the cost of switching interest based on the London interbank
offered rate, or Libor, for payments linked to Australia&#8217;s bank
bill swap rate, was at 20.3 basis points in Sydney today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It peaked at 48 basis points in November 2009, and has
averaged 21.7 this month, compared with an average 8.6 for the
five years to 2007. The higher the level, the greater the
discount for overseas borrowers selling debt in Australia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spread paid by Goldman Sachs, rated A by Standard 
Poor&#8217;s, compares with the 113 basis points that Australia  New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) and Westpac Banking Corp. each paid
on five-year bonds last week, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Both Australian companies are ranked AA, three rungs higher than
Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous Sale &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs paid a 51-basis-point spread over swap rates
when it issued A$200 million of 10-year 6.35 percent kangaroo
notes in March 2006, part of an offering that totaled A$1.65
billion and was the lender&#8217;s last sale of the securities, the
data show. The notes were last quoted at a spread of 182 basis
points, ANZ prices show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kangaroo bond sales surged to a record A$37.3 billion last
year as the swaps market cut funding costs for issuers once
proceeds were exchanged into U.S. dollars. The World Bank and
Germany&#8217;s Landwirtschaftliche Rentenbank were among the top
borrowers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Bank&#8217;s International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development sold A$600 million of 5.5 percent October 2014 notes
on Jan. 18. The securities were priced to yield 49.25 basis
points more than similar-maturity government debt, Bloomberg
data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That rate equated to about 10 basis points less than Libor,
once swapped into U.S. dollars, the data show. In June, the IBRD
priced $2 billion of floating-rate bonds due July 2011 to yield
5 basis points more than Libor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hayley Morris, a Sydney-based spokeswoman for Goldman
Sachs, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to two telephone requests for
comment on yesterday&#8217;s sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth Forecast &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Reserve Bank of Australia, which kept its target rate
at 4.75 percent last week, expects the economy to expand 4.25
percent this year, the fastest pace since 1999. It&#8217;s banking on
a rising currency to help curb inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan will release the
government&#8217;s budget later today amid promises of &#8220;substantial&#8221;
spending cuts. Swan, who delivers the budget to Parliament
beginning at 7:30 p.m. local time, said earlier this week that
the deficit in the government&#8217;s finances will widen in the
fiscal year ending June 30 before increased mining revenue and
an improving economy help bring about a surplus in 2012-13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia&#8217;s dollar climbed 20 percent over the past year to
$1.0786 at 8:18 a.m. in Sydney today, and touched $1.1012 on May
2, the highest since exchange controls were scrapped in 1983. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer Prices &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer prices may rise an annual 3.11 percent in the next
five years, according to the gap between yields on government
bonds and inflation-indexed notes. The RBA aims to hold
inflation between 2 and 3 percent on average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond dropped
1 basis point to 5.42 percent yesterday, or 225 basis points
more than similar-maturity Treasuries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to hold Australian-dollar
bank bonds instead of government debt fell to 154 basis points
in March, the lowest since January 2008, Bank of America Merrill
Lynch indexes show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kangaroo bond sales, which total A$16.2 billion this year,
slowed from a record start after Australia&#8217;s banking regulator
ruled that notes sold by top-rated borrowers such as the World
Bank don&#8217;t qualify as assets lenders need to hold under Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBC Capital Markets leads underwriter rankings with an 18
percent market share, followed by Commonwealth Bank of Australia
with 11 percent, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan paid 135 basis points more than swap rates when it
sold A$600 million of five-year kangaroo bonds in March,
Bloomberg data show. It&#8217;s rated A+ by SP, the fifth-highest
investment grade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand for the Goldman Sachs notes was &#8220;very strong&#8221; and
the spread was fair, said Mark Mitchell, a portfolio manager and
head of credit at Sydney-based Kapstream Capital, which manages
about A$3.9 billion and bought the bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We would classify Goldman Sachs as being too big to fail
in terms of their systemic importance in the U.S.,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;We&#8217;re pretty comfortable having exposure to it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Maria Kolesnikova and Yi Tian" date="May 09, 2011  5:11 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-09/goldman-sees-commodities-recovery-as-week-long-rout-wipes-out-99-billion.html"><headline>Goldman Sees Commodity Recovery as Slump Erases $99 Billion</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The commodities rout that knocked off
$99 billion of market value last week is driving out speculators
and leading Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which forecast the plunge,
to predict a possible recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of slower growth in U.S. service industries
and fewer German manufacturing orders helped drive the Standard
 Poor&#8217;s GSCI Index of 24 commodities down 11 percent in five
days, the most since December 2008, and erased all the gains
since mid-March. Wheat, zinc and gold rebounded at the end of
the week as U.S. payrolls exceeded economists&#8217; forecasts,
reducing concern that demand will weaken. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given the magnitude of the pullback, it does create an
opportunity for more upside potential, particularly in the
second half of this year, when fundamentals are expected to
tighten,&#8221; Jeffrey Currie, the London-based head of commodity
research at Goldman, said in a May 6 interview. A month ago,
Currie told investors they should be &#8220;underweight&#8221; in
commodities. &#8220;In the very near-term, we&#8217;d be a little
cautious,&#8221; he says now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of all 24 commodities tracked by the SP GSCI
index was about $805 billion on May 6, compared with $891
billion on April 29, according to data compiled by Bloomberg on
the number of outstanding contracts and prices of futures
closest to delivery. Combined holdings of exchange-traded
products backed by precious metals fell to $119 billion from
$132 billion, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment Funds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculators retreated after investment funds had made near-
record bets on price gains last month and the SP GSCI reached
the highest since August 2008. Commodities beat stocks, bonds
and the dollar for five consecutive months through the end of
April, the longest in at least 14 years, on forecasts for demand
exceeding output in everything from oil to copper to corn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most influential analysts and fund managers are divided
on where prices are headed. The last time the SP GSCI fell this
much, the index rebounded 12 percent the following week, and by
the end of last month, it had more than doubled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulls say the expanding global economy, led by growth in
China, India and Brazil, is boosting demand at a time when
producers from BHP Billiton Ltd., the largest mining company, to
BP Plc, Europe&#8217;s second-biggest oil producer, can&#8217;t keep up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selling would be &#8220;premature,&#8221; and the rally will resume,
said Hussein Allidina, the head of commodity research at Morgan
Stanley in New York, reiterating comments made before the rout.
&#8220;The decline we are seeing is not being driven by any
meaningful change in fundamentals,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Not Turning Point&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is not a turning point,&#8221; said Kevin Norrish, a
London-based managing director at Barclays Capital, whose
commodities research team is ranked by Bloomberg in the top
three for copper and gold. &#8220;We&#8217;d expect to see a pretty good
recovery from these levels before too long.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP GSCI climbed 3.6 percent today, as silver futures
jumped 5.2 percent and crude oil in New York added 5.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent crude should rebound about 3 percent to $115 a barrel
in coming weeks because violence in northern Africa and the
Middle East continues, Christin Tuxen, an analyst at Danske Bank
A/S in Copenhagen and the most-accurate oil forecaster tracked
by Bloomberg over eight quarters, said on May 6. The fighting
already curbed supply from Libya and increased concern that it
may spread to regional producers including Saudi Arabia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. raised its oil-price forecasts for
this year and next on May 6 because it expects production to
fall short of demand. Brent crude will average $120 in 2011 and
2012, from previous estimates of $110 and $114, the bank said.
Oil prices should match or top their recent highs by next year,
Goldman said in a note to clients on the same day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global Recession &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bears say that even if the economy grows, speculation
is so excessive that prices no longer reflect supply and demand.
The SP GSCI Index is 39 percent higher than a year ago and more
than twice where it was in February 2009, when economies were
recovering from the global recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities are at the start of a bear market that may last
as long as five to 10 years, said Michael Aronstein, the
president of Marketfield Asset Management in New York who
correctly predicted the 2008 slump that drove the benchmark
index down 66 percent in seven months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scale of investment means &#8220;supply and demand is almost
meaningless,&#8221; Aronstein said in an interview May 6. &#8220;It&#8217;s
almost like the last days of the tech bubble.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil, which lost 15 percent last week in New York and 13
percent in London, became &#8220;detached from fundamentals,&#8221; said
Oswald Clint, London-based head oil analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein, the joint-most-accurate oil forecaster tracked by
Bloomberg in 2010. Brent could drop below $100 a barrel, he
said. That&#8217;s about 14 percent lower than now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodity Funds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About $9.61 billion went into commodity funds in the first
quarter, more than triple the $2.77 billion a year earlier, EPFR
Global, a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based research firm, said in
a report in April. Energy funds attracted $10.9 billion,
compared with a year-earlier outflow of $367 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rebound in the dollar also dimmed the appeal for
commodities that are priced in the U.S. currency. The Dollar
Index, a measure against six counterparts, rose 2.6 percent last
week, the most since August. The index has a negative
correlation of 0.89 to the SP GSCI Index. A figure of 1 would
mean they move in lockstep. The currency gauge may drop to the
lowest since July 2008 by the end of the year, estimates
compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five-Day Slump &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is probably the beginning of a bear phase, even if
it&#8217;s temporary, where the dollar and bonds will be more popular
than commodities,&#8221; said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist
at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in New York. &#8220;It&#8217;s fitting
hand in glove with the U.S. slowdown story.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP GSCI&#8217;s five-day slump, the longest since August,
began on May 2 and accelerated on May 5 by plunging 6.5 percent,
the most since January 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silver led the rout after CME Group Inc., the owner of the
Comex exchange, increased the cost of making new speculative
positions by 84 percent in two weeks. Prices that advanced as
much as 61 percent to $49.845 an ounce this year tumbled 27
percent last week to $35.287 on May 6. The metal may drop as low
as $30 toward the end of the year before rebounding as gold
rallies, said Dan Smith, the London-based analyst at Standard
Chartered Plc, which predicted a decline in prices last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold, Soros &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold also fell, declining 4.2 percent to $1,491.60 an ounce
last week, after the Wall Street Journal reported May 4 that
Soros Fund Management LLC, the hedge fund chaired by billionaire
investor George Soros, sold some of its precious-metal holdings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullion will advance to a record $1,650 by year-end, partly
fueled by central banks buying to diversify their reserves, said
Andrew Kaleel, chief executive officer of Sydney-based H3 Global
Advisors Pty Ltd., which has a commodity hedge fund managing
about A$600 million ($642 million). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico, Russia and Thailand bought about a combined $6
billion of bullion in February and March, International Monetary
Fund data show. Since the end of 2009, countries including
India, Sri Lanka, Mauritius and Bangladesh have bought metal.
Central banks are expanding their gold reserves for the first
time in a generation as bullion rises for an 11th consecutive
year, the longest winning streak since at least 1920. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The killing of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden may have
been the catalyst for this week&#8217;s slide in oil, the biggest
exchange-traded commodity by value. Crude had surged as much as
25 percent this year as violence swept through northern Africa
and the Middle East, disrupting 1.3 million barrels a day from
Libya and raising concerns of shortages from the Persian Gulf.
Since bin Laden&#8217;s death was announced, traders shifted their
focus to prospects of weaker demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Service Industries &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Service industries in the U.S. expanded in April at the
slowest pace in eight months, the Institute for Supply
Management said May 4. Applications for jobless benefits jumped
the most since August in the week ended April 30, the Labor
Department said May 5. That was tempered by a report from the
department a day later showing payrolls increased last month by
the most since May 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Factory orders in Germany, Europe&#8217;s largest economy,
unexpectedly dropped 4 percent in March, the Economy Ministry
said May 5. The country&#8217;s industrial production rose for a third
time the same month, the ministry said the next day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central bankers also helped drive commodities lower last
week by indicating their intention to cool growth to combat
inflation. Rates rose in more than two-dozen countries this
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Extremely Alert&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said
May 6 that policy makers are &#8220;extremely alert&#8221; on inflation
after they raised interest rates on April 7, joining China,
India, Poland and Sweden in seeking to control consumer prices
with tighter monetary policy. Trichet said he may take further
decisions on rates after new economic projections in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While every commodity tracked by the SP GSCI fell last
week, some rebounded May 6. Wheat futures rose 2 percent on the
Kansas City Board of Trade as drought and flooding threatened
crops in North America, Europe and Asia. Cocoa, cattle, zinc,
gold, copper, nickel and soybeans also gained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower prices also may spur more demand. Barclays, which
told investors in a report May 6 to use the slump to buy, is
forecasting shortfalls in production this year for copper,
nickel, tin, lead, platinum and palladium. Rabobank expects
demand to exceed output in corn and cotton, according to a
report last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Strong&#8217; Demand &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ultimately, supply remains weak, and demand remains
strong, and that&#8217;s why they will eventually go higher,&#8221; said
John Stephenson, who helps manage $2.6 billion at First Asset
Investment Management Inc. in Toronto. &#8220;Commodities, in the
worst case, will start firming by late August, but in the
meantime, I would see this as a buying opportunity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil demand will exceed supply this year, the U.S. Energy
Department said in a report April 12. Billionaire hedge-fund
manager T. Boone Pickens said May 3 that prices will rise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you look at the fourth-quarter projection for oil,
that&#8217;s 90 million barrels a day globally, and I don&#8217;t think the
world can produce more than 88 million,&#8221; Pickens said in an
interview from Los Angeles with Willow Bay and Lisa Murphy on
Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;Fast Forward.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, funds are probably still trimming bets on higher
commodity prices. Net-long positions held by managed-money funds
fell 2.4 percent to 1.45 million futures and options in the week
ended May 3, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show.
They reached a record 1.56 million contracts in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open interest in 17 of 19 commodities tracked by the
Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index dropped 0.6 percent to 8.15
million contracts, data from the CFTC show. That compares with
an all-time high of 8.6 million on Feb. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the commodities boom is over,&#8221; said
Robbert Van Batenburg, an analyst at Louis Capital Markets in
New York, who correctly predicted a 2007 rebound in oil. &#8220;We
may see a pause in the rally, and that&#8217;s OK. Past the summer
doldrums, I think the rally picks up where we left off.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. (BAC) hired Alan Todd
from JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) to head commercial-mortgage bond
research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Todd, 38, who will be based in New York, will report to
Chris Flanagan, the head of U.S. mortgages and structured
finance research, Bank of America said today in a statement
distributed by Business Wire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Todd had headed U.S. commercial mortgage-backed-securities
research at JPMorgan since 2005, according to the statement. Ed
Reardon, who has been with JPMorgan since 2000, will take the
role of lead CMBS strategist, according to bank spokeswoman
Sarah Stipicevic. He previously focused on non-agency mortgage-
backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s pneumonia vaccine, the
company&#8217;s fastest-growing drug by sales, was found effective in
two studies of adults over the age of 50, supporting the
company&#8217;s regulatory application to expand the product&#8217;s use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vaccine, Prevnar 13, produced a stronger immune
response against pneumococcal bacteria than an older vaccine
from Merck  Co. that&#8217;s currently recommended for adults 65 and
older, according to Emilio Emini, New York-based Pfizer&#8217;s head
of vaccine research. The results are being presented this week
at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious
Diseases in Milan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s Prevnar is cleared for use in children up to 6
years of age. Sales of the vaccine, which includes Prevnar 13
and an older version called Prevnar 7, jumped 43 percent in the
first quarter to $1.15 billion from a year earlier. Pfizer, the
world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, applied in December for U.S. approval
for older adults based on data from the two studies, and expects
a decision from U.S. regulators in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve got the data to show that this gives rise to a very
good immune response,&#8221; Emini said in a telephone interview.
&#8220;The argument is that every adult, as they get older, needs to
get this vaccine.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer rose 5 cents to $20.60 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The stock has gained 25 percent in
the past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 50,000 people in the U.S. die from pneumonia in the
lungs and invasive infections of pneumococcal bacteria in the
bloodstream each year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Sales of Prevnar will exceed
$5.5 billion by 2015, according to the average estimate of four
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;30-Year-old Vaccine &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A different form of pneumonia shot, called a polyvalent
polysaccharide vaccine, was first approved more than 30 years
ago and is now sold by Whitehouse Station, New Jersey-based
Merck as Pneumovax, with $376 million in sales last year. That
type of vaccine, which trains the immune system to fight 23
strains of pneumococcal bacteria, isn&#8217;t recommended for most
children because their immune systems don&#8217;t respond to it. In
adults, its protection wanes with time, and booster shots become
increasingly less effective, Emini said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prevnar attaches immune-boosting antigens to protein
carriers designed to trigger a stronger and longer-lasting
response than previous vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer compared Prevnar 13 to Pneumovax in a study of 938
patients ages 70 and older who had received a pneumonia shot
five years previously. Patients who were given a follow-up shot
of Prevnar 13 had significantly higher levels of antibodies in
their blood for 11 strains of pneumococcal bacteria and similar
levels for 2 strains. Prevnar 13 doesn&#8217;t protect against 10
additional rare strains that are covered by Pneumovax. A second
shot of Prevnar 13 a year later showed a similar immune system
response. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pneumonia Susceptibility &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At age 50, people become more susceptible to pneumonia.
However, Merck&#8217;s shot isn&#8217;t approved for the age group. Because
its effectiveness fades with time, doctors reserve it for people
over age 65, who are most vulnerable to infection. Pfizer aims
to target adults beginning at age 50, because patients respond
to each booster of Prevnar 13 as well as if it were their first
shot, Emini said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second study, Prevnar 13 successfully created
antibodies in 404 patients ages 50 to 59 who had never received
a pneumonia vaccine. The company is now studying how often
adults would need booster shots to maintain protection, Emini
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never Vaccinated &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate arm of that study, Prevnar 13 was compared
with Merck&#8217;s shot in 835 patients ages 60 through 64 who had
never been vaccinated. Prevnar 13 was more effective at mounting
a response to 9 types of the bacteria and at least as good as
Pneumovax with the four remaining strains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s studies measure bacteria-fighting antibodies in the
blood. Pfizer is also conducting a test in 85,000 adults in the
Netherlands to prove the drug reduces cases of pneumonia.
Results of that study may not be available for several years,
Emini said. The company earlier agreed with regulators that the
antibody studies being presented in Milan may be sufficient to
gain initial approval while the company awaits results from the
larger study of pneumonia cases. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copper rose, rebounding from a five-
month low, after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said commodities may
recover from an 11 percent slump last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials rose
as much as 4.1 percent. &#8220;Given the magnitude of the pullback,
it does create an opportunity for more upside potential,&#8221;
Goldman Sachs said. A month ago, the bank told investors they
should be &#8220;underweight&#8221; in commodities. Copper fell 4.9
percent last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People look at the sell-off as a little bit overdone,&#8221;
said Matthew Zeman, a strategist at Kingsview Financial in
Chicago. &#8220;There&#8217;s some buying based on the Goldman comments as
well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper futures for delivery in July rose 4.1 cents, or 1
percent, to close at $4.0165 a pound at 1:13 p.m. on the Comex
in New York. On May 6, the price touched $3.928, the lowest for
a most-active contract Dec. 1. The metal reached a record
$4.6575 on Feb. 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices also got &#8220;a shot in the arm confidence-wise&#8221; after
a May 6 report showed U.S. payrolls exceeded economists&#8217;
forecasts last month, Zeman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The markets were due for correction, but not of that
magnitude,&#8221; said Robin Bhar, an analyst at Credit Agricole SA
in London. &#8220;We&#8217;re getting some bargain-hunting from end-users
because it is the second quarter, which is a seasonally stronger
period.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months rose $60, or 0.7 percent, to $8,890 a metric ton ($4.03 a
pound). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aluminum, zinc, lead and tin rose in London. Nickel fell. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computer-based trading in India&#8217;s
$1.5 trillion stock market may double to half of all orders
within three years as demand for speedier execution surges,
according to the Bombay Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automated programs carry out about 25 percent of Indian
orders currently, Sayee Srinivasan, head of product strategy at
Asia&#8217;s oldest bourse, said in an interview yesterday. About 60
percent of U.S. stock trades daily come from firms that rely on
fast-paced executions, according to Tabb Group LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Algorithmic trading is coming up in a big way and will
grow rapidly as more firms adopt the technology,&#8221; said
Srinivasan, who is based in Mumbai. &#8220;Automated trading is huge
internationally. In developed markets, algo trading is the major
contributor to turnover.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While brokers increasingly seek to exploit short-lived
market opportunities by transacting thousands of shares a
second, exchanges worldwide are building faster networks to fend
off competition from alternative platforms that allow firms to
trade anonymously and with lower transaction costs. Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) and Nomura Holdings
Inc. (8604) say a mix of tight buy and sell spreads, a large volume of
smaller orders and no midday break make India ideally suited for
growth in algorithmic trading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks were little changed
following the biggest weekly drop for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
Index since March as concern over Greece&#8217;s debt crisis offset a
rebound in commodity prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ConocoPhillips (COP) and Freeport-McMoRan Copper  Gold Inc. (FCX)
paced gains in commodity producers as oil halted a five-day
slump and metal prices advanced. Financial shares were the
biggest drag on the SP 500 after Standard  Poor&#8217;s lowered
Greece&#8217;s debt rating. Citigroup Inc. (C) slumped 2 percent following
a 1-for-10 reverse stock split. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 fell less than 0.1 percent to 1,339.79 at 10:21
a.m. in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was little
changed at 12,638.43. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Greece&#8217;s downgrade put some pressure as it&#8217;s a
confirmation of the rumors that had been floating out there,&#8221;
said Peter Jankovskis, who helps manage about $2.8 billion at
Oakbrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois. &#8220;For some people,
that&#8217;s kind of their last straw.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock-index futures reversed early gains before the open of
U.S. exchanges after Greece&#8217;s credit rating was cut two levels
to B from BB- by SP, which said further reductions are
possible, with private investors at risk if maturities are
extended on the nation&#8217;s emergency-aid package. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 fell 1.7 percent last week, its biggest decline
since March, following a rout in raw materials that knocked off
$99 billion of market value from commodities. The SP 500 is
still up 6.6 this year through May 6 amid government stimulus
measures and higher-than-estimated corporate profits. Earnings-
per-share have beaten estimates at 72 percent of the 420 SP 500
companies that have reported results since April 11, Bloomberg
data show. &lt;/p&gt;

Power, Helsinki: Compliance</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;An Australian Senate committee says
the nation&#8217;s banking industry is &#8220;highly concentrated&#8221; and
wants more fee transparency, a broader inquiry, and the
scrapping of some taxes to encourage foreign competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate Economics Committee published 38 recommendations
in a report May 6, saying the Reserve Bank of Australia should
publish more regularly on banks&#8217; interest margins and returns to
determine whether competition is adequate. It also wants the
Australian Office of Financial Management&#8217;s borrowing program
expanded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasurer Wayne Swan on March 24 introduced laws to stop
banks from signaling future mortgage rate increases to each
other following public anger after the nation&#8217;s banks raised
rates by more than the central bank in November 2010. The Senate
committee report&#8217;s release follows earnings reports this week
from National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB), Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) and
Australia  New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government has not said when it will respond to the
committee&#8217;s report and doesn&#8217;t have to accept the
recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia&#8217;s banks have rejected claims of price signaling
as &#8220;unfounded&#8221; and have urged the government against the move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Is in &#8216;Advanced&#8217; Negotiations to Resolve CDO Probe &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the only Wall Street bank to remain
profitable throughout the financial crisis, is in &#8220;advanced&#8221;
negotiations to resolve its piece of a broader U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission investigation into how mortgage-linked
securities were packaged and sold as the housing market
unraveled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s securities unit has been cooperating with agency
officials and &#8220;is currently in advanced discussions with the
staff concerning a potential resolution of that investigation,&#8221;
the New York-based bank said in a quarterly financial report
filed with the SEC May 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC is working to wrap up investigations into how banks
bundled and sold investments tied to risky mortgages, after
years of being faulted by lawmakers and investors for failing to
hold Wall Street accountable for misconduct that may have fueled
the financial crisis. JPMorgan has been probed by the SEC for
its role in designing and selling a $1.1 billion collateralized
debt obligation known as &#8220;Squared&#8221; in 2007, according to a
person briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There can be no assurance that any such resolution will
be finalized or approved,&#8221; JPMorgan said in the May 6 filing.
The bank didn&#8217;t specify which CDOs were the subject of the SEC
talks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, also
received a subpoena from the SEC over failed mortgages as part
of a separate investigation into whether some banks failed to
share refunds from sellers of faulty debt, a person familiar
with the investigation said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;N.Z. Regulator Says Wholesale Power Price Jump Undesirable &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand&#8217;s electricity market regulator ruled that an
undesirable trading situation developed in the wholesale market
on March 26 when prices surged as much as 190 times normal
levels over about seven hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a preliminary ruling, the Electricity Authority said May
6 the prices should be reset at lower levels. It said the
conduct of Genesis Power Ltd., which benefitted from the higher
prices, wasn&#8217;t unlawful and didn&#8217;t constitute manipulative
trading activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users complained after wholesale prices for regions in the
north of the North Island, including the city of Auckland, rose
as high as NZ$19,000 ($15,000) a megawatt-hour after a scheduled
outage on transmission lines that bring power from southern New
Zealand. Prices are usually as low as NZ$100 a megawatt-hour
when transmission is normal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The events &#8220;threaten to undermine confidence in and
threaten to damage the integrity and reputation of the wholesale
market,&#8221; the authority said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty-five parties lodged a claim, saying they faced
unacceptable losses and there had been an undesirable trading
situation, initiating the review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s Says Europe Insurers Capital Exceeds Solvency II Needs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most European insurers will be able to move to the new
Solvency II capital regime without raising more capital, Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service said in a report published May 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report examines the results of the fifth Quantitative
Impact Study, or QIS5, according to a statement issued by
Moody&#8217;s. The results were announced by the European Insurance
and Occupational Pensions Authority, or EIOPA, in March,
according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost seventy percent &#8220;of all European insurance and
reinsurance companies under the scope of Solvency II
participated in QIS5,&#8221; Moody&#8217;s said in the statement. The
participation rate for the previous study was thirty-three
percent, &#8220;which gives greater weight to the QIS5 results,&#8221;
according to the Moody&#8217;s report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;QIS5 did not test risk-management requirements which for
smaller, less sophisticated companies could prove a greater
stumbling block than meeting capital requirements,&#8221; Dominic
Simpson, a Vice President and Senior Credit Officer at Moody&#8217;s
Financial Institutions Group, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAC&#8217;s &#8216;Cohen Account&#8217; Probed in U.S. Insider-Trading Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. prosecutors are investigating accounts at SAC Capital
Advisors LP, including one run by founder Steven A. Cohen, tied
to portfolio managers who pleaded guilty in a nationwide probe
of insider trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a March 24 letter filed in Manhattan federal court,
prosecutors said they had recovered records from the hedge fund,
and listed documents tied to the &#8220;Cohen Account&#8221; that they
made available to defense lawyers. The files are among a growing
amount of data, wiretap-recordings and e-mails involving hedge
funds, companies and individuals accumulated as part of the
government&#8217;s investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;Cohen Account&#8221; consists of the best trading ideas
unearthed by the 100 teams at Stamford, Connecticut-based SAC.
The portfolio managers and analysts submit their stock picks to
Cohen and his team, and if he uses them in his account -- and
they make money -- they get paid for their idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAC, a hedge fund with $13 billion under management, has
come under scrutiny as part of the U.S. crackdown on illegal
stock-tipping at hedge funds, banks, technology companies and
expert networking firms, according to court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February, prosecutors charged two former SAC portfolio
managers with insider trading while working at the fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donald Longueuil pleaded guilty April 28 in Manhattan
federal court, telling a judge he &#8220;obtained material, non-
public information&#8221; from an accomplice in 2008 about Marvell
Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL) He isn&#8217;t cooperating with prosecutors.
Noah Freeman, who worked at SAC from June 2008 to January 2010,
pleaded guilty Feb. 7 as part of a cooperation deal with
prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longueuil said during his plea hearing that he was part of
a conspiracy that encompassed his time at SAC. Other alleged
members of the conspiracy charged in the case included Samir
Barai, the founder of Barai Capital Management LP in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barai&#8217;s assistant, Jason Pflaum, pleaded guilty in
December. Barai hasn&#8217;t entered a plea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for SAC, declined to
comment on the investigation. He previously said the firm was
cooperating with prosecutors and was &#8220;outraged&#8221; at the actions
of two former employees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Courts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switzerland Is Sued at Human Rights Court Over UBS Data &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switzerland was sued at the European Court of Human Rights
by UBS AG (UBSN) clients for allegedly violating their privacy rights
in an agreement with the U.S. that allowed the disclosure of
their account data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court &#8220;received a number of applications concerning
the administrative assistance agreement between Switzerland and
the&#8221; U.S., the Strasbourg, France-based tribunal said in an e-
mailed statement May 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switzerland agreed in 2009 to process account data for the
U.S. to help UBS, Switzerland&#8217;s biggest bank, settle a lawsuit
that sought information on as many as 52,000 clients suspected
of evading taxes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An American UBS client, whose account data was disclosed to
U.S. authorities, sued Switzerland this week, Handelszeitung
reported May 5. The suit said there were violations of his right
to privacy, equal treatment and the presumption of innocence,
the Zurich newspaper said without identifying the plaintiff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Folco Galli, spokesman for Switzerland&#8217;s Federal Office of
Justice, didn&#8217;t immediately answer calls to his office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should the court find a violation of the European
Convention of Human Rights, it could order Switzerland to
compensate the claimant, said John Temple Lang, a consultant at
Cleary Gottlieb Steen  Hamilton LLP in Brussels, who
specializes in European law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC, Barclays to Pay $2 Billion for Insurance Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) and Barclays Plc (BARC) will set aside more than
$2 billion for customers improperly sold personal-loan insurance
after British banks abandoned a lawsuit to avoid paying
compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays will set aside 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion) in
the second quarter, the London-based lender said in a statement
today. HSBC, Europe&#8217;s largest bank by market value, made a $440
million provision in the first quarter, the bank said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The British Bankers&#8217; Association today abandoned legal
attempts to overturn a court ruling that may force the industry
to pay more than 8 billion pounds. Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY), the
biggest provider of payment protection insurance, last week
broke ranks with competitors and earmarked 3.2 billion pounds to
settle claims with clients who bought the insurance, which
covers payments on credit cards and mortgages in case of illness
or unemployment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clients who bought the insurance rarely compared prices and
terms or switched providers, and usually weren&#8217;t aware they
could have purchased it elsewhere, according to the Competition
Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t always get things right for our customers,&#8221;
Barclays Chief Executive Officer Robert Diamond said in the
statement. &#8220;When we get them wrong, we apologize and put them
right.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) may have to set aside 1
billion pounds, Deutsche Bank AG analyst Jason Napier said in a
report to clients last week. RBS said in a statement today it
was in talks with the Financial Services Authority, the
country&#8217;s financial watchdog, to clarify the requirements and
ensure &#8220;redress is offered in line with the standards the FSA
now requires.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBS said last week that the cost of following Lloyds and
paying compensation &#8220;could prove to be material.&#8221; It didn&#8217;t
provide a figure. The lender&#8217;s share of the PPI market was about
a third of Lloyds&#8217;s, according to Chief Executive Officer
Stephen Hester. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambac, Bankrupt Bond Insurer, Settles Subprime Assets Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambac Financial Group Inc. (ABK), the bankrupt holding company
for a failed bond insurer, agreed to set aside $27.1 million to
resolve a 2008 lawsuit claiming it misled shareholders about
risks linked to subprime securities, according to a court
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors alleged that Ambac issued misleading statements
about its financial results related to insurance for
collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, according to a class-
action, or group, complaint, filed in January 2008 in federal
court in Manhattan. Ambac issued insurance on CDOs including
those backed by subprime mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no admission of wrongdoing in the settlement,
according to a court filing May 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs include Public School Teachers&#8217; Pension 
Retirement Fund of Chicago, Arkansas Teacher Retirement System,
Public Employees&#8217; Retirement System of Mississippi and Painting
Industry Insurance and Annuity Funds, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among Ambac&#8217;s codefendants are underwriters of the
syndication of Ambac&#8217;s debt, including Citigroup Global Markets
Inc., UBS Securities LLC, Goldman, Sachs  Co., J.P. Morgan
Securities Inc., HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner,  Smith Inc. and Wachovia Capital Markets LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambac previously paid $2.5 million into an escrow account
under a related agreement, according to court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambac, reorganizing under Chapter 11 in U.S. Bankruptcy
court, has yet to file a plan of how it intends to restructure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Ambac Financial Group Inc. Securities
Litigation, 08-cv-00411, U.S. District Court, Southern District
of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special Section: Helsinki Conference &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King, Ingves, Others Speak at Helsinki Banking Conference &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of England Governor Mervyn King said officials must
focus more on lenders&#8217; structure to improve both financial
stability and the operation of monetary policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He made the remarks at a banking conference in Helsinki May
6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In Europe we must pay more attention to the structure of
our banks and the state of their balance sheets not only for
financial stability but also for the conduct of monetary
policy,&#8221; King said in a speech in Helsinki May 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
should bear in mind banks&#8217; tendency to &#8220;be over-optimistic as
to their future liquidity&#8221; as they decide on new capital
requirements, King said, citing former Bank of Finland Governor
Klaus Waris. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also called on global authorities to cooperate as they
work to solve the problems caused by the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, European Central Bank Governing Council member
Nout Wellink said while the global economy has recovered
&#8220;strongly&#8221; and is improving further, the &#8220;financial system is
still fragile&#8221; and uncertainty remains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It remains critical to strengthen resilience of the
global financial system,&#8221; by building up &#8220;buffers,&#8221; of
capital and liquidity in the banking system, Wellink said at
panel discussion in Helsinki May 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also said a &#8220;timely implementation&#8221; of the Basel III
banking rules is &#8220;critical.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, capital requirements set by the Basel Committee
on Banking Supervision represent a compromise and tougher
minimum standards would be more appropriate for a number of
countries, Swedish central bank Governor Stefan Ingves said at
the conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure that it&#8217;s proper for all countries to
adhere to those minimums,&#8221; Ingves said in a speech at the
conference. &#8220;In some instances it pays to go higher.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweden wants its financial industry to follow stricter
standards than those set out by Basel, and to push the changes
through earlier. The Swedish Bankers Association has said it
will fight rules that undermine competitiveness, while Nordea
Bank AB (NDA) Chief Executive Office Christian Clausen has called the
plan &#8220;not realistic.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital adequacy levels must ultimately be decided on the
national level, Ingves said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are in a situation where it&#8217;s still the nation state
that is backing up the central bank,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It must be the
right of the nation state to decide on what the capital adequacy
should be.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEC&#8217;s Schapiro Urges More Scrutiny of High-Frequency Traders &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-frequency traders should face greater scrutiny from
U.S. regulators over practices like those that exacerbated a
stock-market plunge a year ago, U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro said May 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;High-frequency traders turned what was a very down day
for many investors into a very profitable one for themselves by
taking liquidity rather than providing it,&#8221; Schapiro said at an
Investment Company Institute conference in Washington, citing
the so-called flash crash of May 6, 2010, that temporarily
erased $862 billion in stock value. &#8220;Their activity that day
should cause us to thoroughly examine their current role.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC is making progress on changes spurred by the stock
plunge, Schapiro said. The agency must consider whether high-
frequency traders should have &#8220;the obligations of market
makers&#8221; in addition to responsibilities relating to the impact
of their technology and trading strategies on the markets, she
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pacific Crest Securities, an
investment bank focused on technology deals, is close to an
agreement to buy China research firm Pacific Epoch from
investors including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), two people
familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people, who declined to provide financial terms of the
deal, asked not to be identified because the discussions are
private. Pacific Crest is interested in acquiring all of
Shanghai-based Pacific Epoch, which also has offices in New York
and Hong Kong, said one of the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pacific Crest, which helped manage last week&#8217;s $855 million
initial public offering of Beijing-based Renren Inc., is
expanding in China to win business from companies in the world&#8217;s
biggest Internet market. In 2008, a research arm of Goldman
Sachs called Hudson Street acquired a stake in Pacific Epoch, a
researcher covering industries including technology, retail and
alternative energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jen McBee, an assistant of Pacific Crest Chief Executive
Officer Scott Sandbo, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to messages on
her office phone and e-mail seeking comment. Connie Ling, a
spokeswoman at Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong, declined to comment,
as did Pacific Epoch's head of research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pacific Epoch received a $7 million investment from Goldman
Sachs in 2008. The closely held Chinese firm employs more than
90 people in China, the United States and Hong Kong, according
to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Internet Deals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renren&#8217;s IPO saw the owner of China&#8217;s biggest social-
networking site by page views raise funds at a valuation more
than twice that of Facebook Inc. Pacific Crest also co-managed
the listing of Youku.com Inc. (YOKU), the operator of China&#8217;s most-
popular video website, in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundraising by Chinese Internet companies is expected to
climb to a record this year as investors aim to benefit from the
growth of Web services in the country, Lee Kai-fu, the former
head of China at Google Inc. (GOOG), said last month. Lee now runs a
venture fund that invests in technology startups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pacific Crest said last month it plans to hire more bankers
and analysts in China as part of expectations that it will win
more business this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A) said it expects a $1.25 billion pretax gain in the second
quarter and lower investment income in future periods after its
$5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) was redeemed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire was paid $5.5 billion for the securities on April
18, the Omaha, Nebraska-based company said late on May 6 in its
first-quarter earnings report. The payment by Goldman Sachs
includes the $5 billion Berkshire invested in 2008 and a 10
percent premium. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We anticipate our investment income for the second
quarter of 2011, and likely beyond, will decline compared with
2010, given the relatively low yields currently available from
new investment opportunities,&#8221; Berkshire said. Goldman Sachs
paid dividends of 10 percent before the redemption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett, 80, Berkshire&#8217;s chairman and chief executive
officer, is accumulating cash and seeking acquisitions as almost
record-low interest rates limit fixed-income returns. The firm&#8217;s
cash rose to $41.2 billion on March 31, the highest quarter-
ending total since 2007. That balance may gain with the Goldman
Sachs redemption and the expected repayment by General Electric
Co. (GE) of a $3 billion investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That money is earning virtually nothing now,&#8221; Buffett,
speaking at Berkshire&#8217;s April 30 annual meeting, said of the
cash received from New York-based Goldman Sachs. &#8220;We have lost
or are losing at least three very-high-yield investments that we
cannot replace.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$1 Billion Dividend &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire collected about $3.9 billion from Swiss
Reinsurance Co. on Jan. 10, according to the earnings report.
The payment ended a 2009 investment that garnered Buffett&#8217;s firm
dividends of 12 percent. Berkshire, which holds cash and
securities to support liabilities at the company&#8217;s insurance
subsidiaries, made the Goldman Sachs, GE and Swiss Re
investments during the credit crisis when traditional sources of
financing retreated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire is taking a $1 billion dividend this month from
its Burlington Northern Santa Fe subsidiary, the railroad unit
said in a separate May 6 filing. Fort Worth, Texas-based
Burlington Northern, which Berkshire bought in a $26.5 billion
deal last year, paid $1 billion in dividends to its parent in
the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The cash is just coming in like gangbusters, and that&#8217;s a
high-class problem to have,&#8221; said Paul Howard, director of
research at Solstice Investment Research in Glastonbury,
Connecticut. Buffett &#8220;is setting expectations low on the
upcoming quarter and coming quarters for the investment-income
number.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underwriting Loss &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net investment income at Berkshire&#8217;s insurance businesses
fell 3.6 percent to $952 million in the first quarter, the
company said. Berkshire announced detailed results for the
period in the filing after issuing a preliminary report on April
30. Net income dropped to $1.51 billion from $3.63 billion a
year earlier as the insurance segment posted an underwriting
loss of $821 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Over time, if we&#8217;re going to keep your money, we are
going to need to get a better-than-average return,&#8221; Buffett,
who doesn&#8217;t pay dividends to Berkshire shareholders, said at the
company&#8217;s annual meeting. &#8220;So far we&#8217;ve done OK on that, but
the job gets tougher every year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on two-year U.S. Treasuries slid for seven
consecutive trading days through May 6 to 0.549 percent. The
yield hit a record low of 0.31 percent on Nov. 4. The two-year
note&#8217;s average yield over the past 10 years was more than 2.5
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire paid about $1.5 billion in cash in the first
quarter to raise its stake in Marmon Holdings Inc. to 80 percent
from about 64 percent. The company plans to spend about $9
billion in cash in the third quarter to acquire Lubrizol Corp.,
the Wickliffe, Ohio-based maker of engine additives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo, Kraft &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First quarter profit was reduced by $506 million on charges
tied to declines in the value of stakes in San Francisco-based
Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) and Kraft Foods Inc. (KFT), based in Northfield,
Illinois. The Securities and Exchange Commission questioned
Berkshire in December about its equity holdings. The firm told
the regulator in February that it didn&#8217;t write down those
holdings last year because it expected both stocks to recover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charges were required by accounting rules and produced
an &#8220;odd result&#8221; in erasing Berkshire&#8217;s unrealized losses on
the Wells Fargo shares and leaving the company with an
unrealized gain of $3.7 billion on the stake, the firm said. The
unrealized gains are the difference between market price and the
value ascribed by Berkshire. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world&#8217;s biggest
theme-park operator, said second-quarter profit fell 1.2
percent, missing estimates, as a shrinking box-office, a park
shortfall and the Japanese tsunami overshadowed gains in TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income decreased to $942 million, or 49 cents a share,
in the quarter ended April 2, from $953 million, or 48 cents, a
year earlier, Burbank, California-based Disney said today in a
statement. Profit missed the 58-cent average of 14 analysts&#8217;
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit at Disney&#8217;s theme-park unit, which collects
licensing revenue from the resort in Tokyo, fell by 3.3 percent
following the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. U.S. parks were
hurt by this year&#8217;s later Easter break. The Disney film studio
failed to match last year&#8217;s results from &#8220;Alice in
Wonderland,&#8221; with income down 65 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The noisy elements, the studio and Japan, clearly were
the problem and they are hard to predict,&#8221; said Matthew
Harrigan, a Wunderlich Securities analyst in Denver who
recommends investors buy Disney shares. &#8220;The good news is that
the core of this company, ESPN and its TV business, still
performed very well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advance bookings at Disney parks are down 2.5 percent from
a year earlier, Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said on a
conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Room rates have increased by a double-digit percentage,
reflecting Disney&#8217;s decision to phase out discounts as the
economy improves, Rasulo said. Excluding the impact of the
timing of the Easter holiday, domestic theme park attendance
increased by 2 percent from a year earlier, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Mars Needs Moms&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney fell $1.23, or 2.8 percent, to $42.68 in extended
trading. The shares rose 81 cents to $43.91 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading and have added 17 percent
this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The March 11 release &#8220;Mars Needs Moms&#8221; weighed on the
studio. The film cost $150 million to make and generated $20.9
million in U.S. ticket sales, according to Harrigan. Last year,
DVD sales benefited from Pixar&#8217;s film &#8220;Up.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s total sales rose 5.8 percent to $9.08 billion,
trailing the $9.19 billion average of 20 analysts&#8217; estimates.
Revenue was $8.58 billion a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our revenue was up nicely but we had $170 million of
factors, basically, that had an impact on where we were and
where the Street thought we would be in terms of our earnings,&#8221;
Robert Iger, Disney&#8217;s president and chief executive officer,
said in an interview on CNBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Network Revenue &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue at Disney&#8217;s media networks increased 12 percent to
$4.32 billion, buoyed by advertising and affiliate revenue at
cable networks such as ESPN. Profit rose 17 percent to $1.52
billion, with cable earnings up 15 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABC broadcasting posted a 4.5 percent increase in revenue
to $1.5 billion on advertising growth and higher affiliate fees.
Profit gained 36 percent to $167 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit in consumer products increased 6.8 percent to $142
million as sales expanded 5 percent to $626 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s Interactive unit saw its loss more than double to
$115 million on a 2.6 percent gain in revenue. Results included
a $34 million cost linked to how the company accounts for the
purchase of Playdom, Iger said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will continue to take charges for the 2010
acquisition of the social game startup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That was unexpected and we&#8217;d like to hear more about
that,&#8221; said Robin Diedrich, an analyst with St. Louis-based
Edward Jones  Co., who recommends investors buy Disney. &#8220;But
it&#8217;s a small segment of the company. The main segments --
advertising and its parks -- are doing well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), responding to
privacy concerns raised against makers of smartphone software,
said it will stop logging and storing location data that can be
traced back to specific handsets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which today announced an $8.5 billion
acquisition of Web-calling service Skype Technologies SA, said
in a blog post yesterday that it&#8217;s taking steps to eliminate the
use and storage of the so-called unique device identifier from
smartphones using its Windows 7 operating system. The number
serves as an ID for the gadget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Without a unique identifier or some other significant
change to our operating system or practices, we cannot track an
individual device,&#8221; Andy Lees, president of Microsoft&#8217;s mobile
communications business, said in yesterday&#8217;s post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. lawmakers have increased scrutiny of how consumer data
is collected from smartphones and tablet computers. Apple Inc. (AAPL)
and Google Inc. (GOOG) defended how they gather location data from
mobile devices today at a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing
on the topic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, like Apple and Google, said it doesn&#8217;t collect
location information unless a user consents. The data are used
for services such as maps, directions or to deliver targeted
advertising. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) may have a tougher
time convincing wireless operators to support mobile phones with
Windows software after its $8.5 billion purchase of Skype
Technologies SA, analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skype&#8217;s Internet-calling service will be on Windows phones,
as well as Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox and Kinect game consoles, the
Redmond, Washington-based company said today. Skype lets members
make free voice and video calls to each other, and calls to most
outsiders for 2.3 cents a minute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s backing of Skype may be seen as a threat by
wireless carriers such as ATT Inc. (T) and Verizon Wireless because
it could cut into voice revenue, said Craig Moffett, an analyst
at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is kind of a head scratcher to me how Microsoft is
going to navigate the complicated relationships that it has to
have with carriers at the same time as it is repositioning
itself as a potentially major threat to their wireless voice
business,&#8221; Moffett said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is trying to expand in mobile devices as it faces
slower growth in personal computers, the traditional market for
its Windows and Office software. The company, which has lost
ground in the smartphone market to Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPhone and
Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Android devices, introduced the Windows Phone 7
operating system last year and struck a partnership this year to
have Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) use Windows as its primary handset software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia, the world&#8217;s largest mobile-phone maker by unit
sales, said last month it plans to introduce devices running
Windows Phone in volume next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft fell 16 cents to $25.67 in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading at 4 p.m. New York time. It has lost 8 percent this
year. Luxembourg-based Skype is privately held. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Bandwidth Arbitrage&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software such as Skype&#8217;s may cut into revenue for wireless
operators because it allows users to make calls with data
services, just like they do when surfing the Internet, rather
than using traditional voice minutes. Carriers typically charge
customers for voice plans and data plans separately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a data plan for voice or video calls can make them
much cheaper for customers, Moffett said. Google and Apple offer
similar products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s certainly a threat,&#8221; said Moffett, who has an
&#8220;outperform&#8221; rating on ATT and an &#8220;underperform&#8221; on Verizon
Communications Inc. (VZ), majority owner of Verizon Wireless. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
broadly characterized it under the title of bandwidth arbitrage.
Wireless operators make the vast majority of their profits from
low-bandwidth services like voice and text, but those services
are easily arbitraged by doing them over the data network, where
the price per megabyte is a tiny fraction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Good Relationships&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors may see the Microsoft-Skype combination as a
threat to carriers&#8217; revenue, said Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst
with Credit Suisse Group AG. Still, Microsoft is unlikely to
push Skype services so aggressively that it threatens carrier
relationships, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company &#8220;needs good relationships with carriers to
drive the adoption of Windows Mobile,&#8221; New York-based Chaplin
said in a note to investors. &#8220;This will discourage Microsoft
from pushing a disruptive business model with Skype.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melissa Havel, a spokeswoman for Microsoft, declined to
comment. Brenda Raney, a Verizon Wireless spokeswoman, and
Fletcher Cook, an ATT spokesman, also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is likely to integrate Skype into software for
tablet computers as well as mobile phones, said Colin Gillis, an
analyst with BGC Partners LP in New York. Skype, with 170
million active users, will help boost the popularity of Windows-
powered devices, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big Knock &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What&#8217;s the big knock on Microsoft right now? PCs are
going to be displaced, tablets are going to take over the
world,&#8221; Gillis said in an interview. &#8220;Throw Skype into this,
that&#8217;s going to give them a unique edge.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Internet-calling technologies gain in popularity on
mobile devices, wireless operators may respond by changing
prices. Carriers may raise the price of using their networks by
boosting the cost of data plans, Moffett said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The simplest thing will be new pricing plans where they
will shift more of the price burden onto data plans to insulate
them,&#8221; Moffett said. &#8220;There&#8217;s a clear vision in the technology
community that voice and text aren&#8217;t businesses, they&#8217;re
applications.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, cut its estimated losses from legal
claims by 21 percent in the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s &#8220;reasonably possible&#8221; losses from lawsuits
dropped to $2.7 billion as of March 31 from $3.4 billion at the
end of 2010, according to its quarterly filing today with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estimate, the second of its kind disclosed by the firm,
is the &#8220;upper end&#8221; of losses in matters where the risk is
&#8220;more than remote but less than likely,&#8221; New York-based
Goldman Sachs said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks started releasing estimates of possible losses after
the SEC told corporate finance chiefs in October that they
should disclose such costs &#8220;when there is at least a reasonable
possibility&#8221; that they may be incurred, even if the risk is too
low to require reserves. Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the biggest U.S.
lender, has said legal and regulatory matters may cost $150
million to $1.6 billion beyond what it has reserved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staff at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission advised
Goldman Sachs Execution  Clearing LP, known as GSEC, that they
intend to recommend legal action against the unit related to its
role as clearing broker for a broker-dealer, the company
disclosed in today&#8217;s filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CFTC staff alleges that GSEC &#8220;knew or should have
known&#8221; that the client&#8217;s sub-accounts maintained at GSEC were
accounts belonging to customers of the broker-dealer and not the
broker-dealer&#8217;s own accounts, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subpoenas Omitted &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The filing also included a reference to subpoenas that
Goldman Sachs and certain affiliates received from regulators
regarding sales of collateralized debt obligations, including
the firm&#8217;s Abacus 2007-AC1 deal. The company&#8217;s last quarterly
filing, its annual report on March 1, disclosed that it received
requests for information, omitting mention of the subpoenas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, Goldman Sachs paid $550 million to settle a
lawsuit filed by the SEC that accused the firm of misleading
investors in the Abacus CDO. A U.S. Senate subcommittee report
on the financial crisis that used Goldman Sachs as a case study
accused the firm of misleading investors about some CDOs. The
report was referred to the Department of Justice and the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington Mutual &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was among underwriters of securities
offerings by Washington Mutual Inc. (WAMUQ) that were accused in an Aug.
5, 2008, lawsuit of failing to accurately describe Washington
Mutual&#8217;s exposure to mortgage-related activities. Federal
regulators seized Washington Mutual on Sept. 25, 2008. The
parties reached a &#8220;settlement in principle&#8221; on March 30 that
would require Goldman Sachs to contribute to a settlement fund,
the firm disclosed today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said it has reserved the full amount of its
proposed contribution, without disclosing how much that is.
Goldman Sachs underwrote about $520 million of Washington Mutual
securities that are subject to the complaint, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Goldman Sachs&#8217;s annual shareholder meeting on May 6,
General Counsel Gregory K. Palm said that the firm spent $726
million on legal fees last year and that it employs 286 full-
time lawyers, up from 252 a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cogentrix Energy LLC, a unit of
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), received a $90.6 million conditional
loan guarantee from the U.S. Energy Department to build a solar
plant in Colorado. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 30-megawatt Alamosa Solar Generating Project will use
concentrating photovoltaic technology that focuses the sun&#8217;s
rays to increase output, according to a statement today from the
Energy Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concentrating solar plant near the city of Alamosa will
have optical equipment and multijunction solar cells from Amonix
Inc. that boost conversion efficiency to about 40 percent, or
nearly double that of conventional photovoltaic panels, the
agency said. It will also use a dual-axis tracking system to
follow the sun&#8217;s movement throughout the day and maximize power
production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public Service Co. of Colorado, an Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL)
utility, will purchase all of the generated electricity, which
is expected to be enough to power more than 6,500 homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cogentrix operates 17 power plants in the U.S. and one in
Turkey, fueled mainly by natural gas and coal. It expanded into
solar with the February 2009 purchase of two solar-thermal
facilities in Daggett, California, that have 43 megawatts of
capacity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Energy Department&#8217;s loan guarantee program has
committed more than $7.5 billion in loan guarantees for solar
energy projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA), Europe&#8217;s biggest
bank, allocates 64 percent of its capital to operations that
fail to meet the lender&#8217;s return targets, according to analysts
at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profitability could be boosted by using more capital in
private banking and investment banking in Asia, the Middle East
and Latin America, while reducing capital provided to parts of
Europe and the U.S., analysts including Frederik Thomasen wrote
in a note to investors today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect HSBC&#8217;s strategy day to focus heavily on capital
allocation and returns,&#8221; said Goldman Sachs before the bank&#8217;s
meeting with investors and analysts in London tomorrow. The bank
may take &#8220;a more proactive approach to capital allocation
including a diminished willingness to subsidize underperforming
operations as well as increased capital allocation to businesses
offering high risk-adjusted returns.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC Chief Executive Officer Stuart Gulliver will address
tomorrow&#8217;s meeting, describing how the bank will reach its
return on equity target for profitability of between 12 percent
and 15 percent. HSBC operates consumer banks in 39 countries
with fewer than 10 branches, and these may be restructured,
Goldman Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The London-based bank&#8217;s units in Greece, Poland, Germany,
Kazakhstan, Ireland, Japan, Pakistan, New Zealand, Iraq, Bahrain,
Oman, Lebanon, Armenia, Qatar, Jordan, Peru, Columbia, Uruguay,

of reallocating capital, the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food inflation in emerging markets
may peak as early as June or July, which could ease investors&#8217;
concerns about &#8220;aggressive&#8221; monetary tightening and boost
bonds and equities in local markets, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Food prices may become a source of headline disinflation
in many emerging markets by the end of 2011,&#8221; Themistoklis
Fiotakis, a London-based analyst at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a
report today. After a recent slide in agricultural commodities,
&#8220;food-inflation relief may come sooner and it may be sharper
than we initially thought.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP GS Agricultural Commodity Index has dropped 11
percent since April 6, while Goldman had forecast a 13 percent
rise between April and June, according to Fiotakis. Overall
emerging-market inflation could slide by more than 100 basis
points between June and December if international food prices
stay at current levels, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world food-price index tracked by the United Nations&#8217;
Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization rose to 232.1
points in April from 231 points in March, having fallen from a
record 237.2 in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs previously expected emerging-market food
inflation to peak around September, with food prices becoming a
source of disinflation by late 2011 or early 2012. A reduction
in inflation stemming from food prices could &#8220;ease market fears
for aggressive tightening&#8221; of monetary policies in some
emerging markets and help local bond markets rally, Goldman
Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long Exposure &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the event that yields start to decline in certain
emerging markets, equities are bound to benefit as well,&#8221;
Fiotakis said, adding the bank &#8220;continues to recommend a broad
long exposure&#8221; to equities in such markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food is the most important factor in emerging-market
inflation, according to Goldman Sachs. The SP GS Agricultural
Commodity Index rose more than 90 percent between June 2010 and
February 2011, making it &#8220;easy to understand&#8221; the price
pressure from farm goods, Fiotakis wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given the massive increase that has already occurred, one
would need global food prices to continue to grow at these
extreme rates to maintain current headline inflation rates,&#8221;
Fiotakis said. &#8220;Even under a scenario of more adverse weather
conditions, the contribution from food inflation to general
inflation would eventually subside.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the U.S.
bank that makes more than half its revenue from trading, lost
money in that business on one day during the first quarter, its
best record since posting zero days of losses a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After losing money on 13 days in the fourth quarter,
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s traders lost between $25 million and $50 million
on one occasion in the first quarter, according to the New York-
based firm&#8217;s quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. They generated more than $100 million on 32 days out
of 62 total days, the filing showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s performance beats Morgan Stanley (MS), whose
traders lost money on three days and made more than $100 million
on 10 days, according to a filing yesterday. It falls short of
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC), which both
reported zero days of losses in the quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, said
last month that revenue from securities trading fell 22 percent
from a year earlier to $6.65 billion, although it climbed 83
percent from the fourth quarter. Last year, President and Chief
Operating Officer Gary D. Cohn said infrequent daily trading
losses are evidence that the firm doesn&#8217;t rely on making bets
with its own money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs reported zero days of trading losses during
the first quarter of last year, the first such perfect quarter
in the firm&#8217;s history. It reported 10 such days in the second
quarter and two for the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During 2010, Bank of America, the biggest U.S. bank by
assets, had perfect quarters in the first and third quarters,
while JPMorgan, the second-biggest, had three perfect quarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s figures may not be directly comparable with
other banks&#8217; because they also include market risk besides
trading, such as principal transactions in its chief investment
office and some mortgage fees and hedges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said its trading risks didn&#8217;t exceed the
firm&#8217;s value-at-risk limit, a measure of how much the company
could lose in the securities markets in one day, during the
quarter. Average value-at-risk was $113 million in the quarter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is paying a dot-com
era price for Skype Technologies SA, almost 40 percent more than
the world&#8217;s most popular Internet calling service itself says
the business is worth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software company, agreed to
pay $8.5 billion for Luxembourg-based Skype, which lost money in
four of the past five years even as it quadrupled sales. The
takeover, the largest for an Internet company since May 2000, is
32 times Skype&#8217;s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That&#8217;s 39 percent more than the multiple Skype used
to value its own equity in an April regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer is betting
the biggest acquisition since the company was founded in 1975
will help reverse past failures and enrich owners who lost out
as shares of Google Inc. (GOOG) and Apple Inc. (AAPL) quadrupled Microsoft&#8217;s
gain in the past five years. By buying Skype, Microsoft may lure
more users to its mobile-phone platform and narrow Google&#8217;s lead
in Internet advertising after reporting its worst two-year
stretch of sales growth. Shareholder Hank Smith of Haverford
Trust Co. says the investment isn&#8217;t worth the price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I just thought, &#8216;You&#8217;ve got to be kidding me,&#8217;&#8221; said
Smith, chief investment officer at Haverford Trust, which
oversees $6.5 billion in Radnor, Pennsylvania, and owns about
1.96 million Microsoft shares. &#8220;They don&#8217;t have a great track
record of &#8216;investments.&#8217; It almost brings you back to those
crazy valuation metrics in the late &#8216;90s.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Frittered Away&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can make a case that Microsoft has &#8220;frittered away
capital,&#8221; said Smith, who wants Microsoft to use its $50.2
billion cash pile on dividends and buybacks. &#8220;It&#8217;s definitely
because of the competition with Apple and with Google.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not low for sure,&#8221; Ballmer, 55, said of Skype&#8217;s
acquisition price in a telephone interview yesterday. &#8220;It
requires we do good work both within the Skype division and in
creating value elsewhere in the company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ballmer added that Microsoft didn&#8217;t overpay and the
transaction values Skype at &#8220;not a lot higher&#8221; than some
publicly traded companies. He expects the deal will add to
Microsoft&#8217;s profit in the year after it closes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Caukin, a spokeswoman at Skype, didn&#8217;t respond to
an e-mail requesting comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s reserves give it the ability to pay for what it
needs and Skype offers a way for Microsoft to diversify its
products to compete with Apple and Google, according to Matt McCormick, a money manager at Cincinnati-based Bahl  Gaynor
Inc., which oversees $3.6 billion including Microsoft shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Another Hamburger&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;$8.5 billion in cash for a Microsoft is like you and I
paying five bucks for another hamburger,&#8221; McCormick said.
&#8220;Microsoft right now is trying to do things to keep up with
other faster growing technology companies. This is the way to do
it. I will give them the benefit of doubt.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, is buying Skype
from investors including private-equity firm Silver Lake and the
Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, which took a controlling
stake in November 2009 that valued the company at $2.75 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s offer is more than twice that amount and
includes the assumption of Skype&#8217;s debt. Skype had about $725
million in borrowings and a revolving credit line of $30
million, a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in April
showed. Skype had planned to raise money in a U.S. initial
public offering this year, according to the prospectus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fair Value &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acquisition values Skype at about 32 times its $264
million in adjusted Ebitda in 2010, a 39 percent markup to the
company&#8217;s own assumptions. At the start of the year, Skype used
a trailing 12-month Ebitda multiple of 23.2 times to determine
the &#8220;fair value&#8221; of its common stock, its filing showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Skype had a total of 663 million users, it has only
converted 8.8 million users of its free PC-to-PC phone services
into paying customers, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skype reported a net loss of $6.9 million last year, its
fourth money-losing year since 2006, its filing showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Well it&#8217;s certainly an amazing amount of money for a
strategy that looks like a long shot,&#8221; said Eric Johnson, a
professor at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College in
Hanover, New Hampshire. &#8220;Microsoft is desperate to become
relevant. They&#8217;re so far behind that they need something
significant to jumpstart themselves.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Skype&#8217;s a cool company, but putting this together into
something that&#8217;s actually going to be generating significant
revenue is going to take work on their part,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takeover Price &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skype&#8217;s owners refused to entertain offers of less than $7
billion, the value they expected to get from the planned IPO,
according to people with knowledge of the discussions, who asked
not to be identified because the talks were private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft paid a premium in part because it expected Skype
to increase in value after going public, meaning a deal would
cost more down the road, two of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ballmer offered more than $7 billion to cover Skype&#8217;s debt
and keep a competitor from gaining a business that would add
calling features to games, e-mail and software on computers and
mobile phones. While Google expressed interest, neither it nor
other bidders made formal offers, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The size of the deal surpasses Microsoft&#8217;s $5.5 billion
takeover of AQuantive Inc. including net cash in May 2007 as the
company&#8217;s largest. In May 2008, Microsoft abandoned an effort to
buy Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo! Inc. for $47.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet Acquisitions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skype would also be the biggest Internet takeover since the
height of the dot-com bubble 11 years ago, when Spain&#8217;s Terra
Networks SA agreed to buy Internet search service Lycos Inc. for
$13.8 billion in May 2000, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The all-cash agreement for Skype, which Ballmer sealed
after his initial overture to New York-based Silver Lake just
over a month ago, comes after Microsoft was unseated by Apple as
the world&#8217;s most valuable technology company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past five years through yesterday, shares of
Microsoft have gained 8 percent, versus a 395 percent surge for
Apple of Cupertino, California. Google, based in Mountain View,
California, has advanced 35 percent. Today, Microsoft fell 1.2
percent to $25.36. Apple slipped 0.6 percent, while Google
dropped 1.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue growth at Microsoft, which dominates the personal
computer operating system and office applications software
markets, has also lagged behind its competitors. Sales increased
6.9 percent last year after dropping 3.3 percent in 2009, the
worst two-year span since at least 1987, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Apple&#8217;s sales jumped 52 percent in its last
fiscal year, while Google reported a 24 percent increase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deal Rationale &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s clearly the laggard,&#8221; said Philip Orlando, the New
York-based chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors
Inc., which oversees $358.2 billion. &#8220;One of the reasons that
the stock has lagged in this rally that we&#8217;ve seen over the last
couple of years is the fact that you don&#8217;t have the underlying
organic growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is buying Skype, which has 170 million active
users, to connect the service to its Outlook e-mail, Xbox game
console, Windows mobile phone and corporate-phone software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ballmer is aiming to revive Microsoft&#8217;s Internet
advertising revenue. The company&#8217;s online services division had
an operating loss of almost $2.6 billion in the 12 months ended
March. Losses at the unit have widened in each of its past four
fiscal years, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft plans to add Skype to its Windows-based mobile
phones to lure more customers after losing ground to Apple&#8217;s
iPhone and Google&#8217;s Android devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Product Appeal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skype can help boost the popularity of Windows-powered
devices such as tablet computers, according to Colin Gillis, an
analyst with BGC Partners LP in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple has increased its share of the global phone market
and is the biggest seller of tablets. Last quarter, Apple&#8217;s net
income surpassed Microsoft&#8217;s for the first time in 20 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Apple, for the last five or 10 years, has had the sexiest
new product development story in technology,&#8221; said Federated&#8217;s
Orlando. &#8220;You look at Google, which has some cache in the
Internet space. Then, you look at someone like Microsoft. They
are post the rapid growth phase of their development.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also trails Google in Web search and related
advertising, while Skype, which has a lead on late-entrant
Google Voice, announced in March that it would start showcasing
advertising on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google had 66 percent of the U.S. online-search market in
March, according to Reston, Virginia-based researcher ComScore
Inc. Microsoft&#8217;s Bing search engine had about 14 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Squandered Opportunities &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all of Microsoft&#8217;s acquisitions have propelled growth
as much as it forecast. In 2001 and 2002, Microsoft spent more
than $2 billion to acquire small-business software makers Great
Plains Software Inc. and Navision A/S, predicting the businesses
would generate $10 billion a year in revenue by 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of last year, the efforts were bringing more
than $1 billion in sales a year, still short of Microsoft&#8217;s
initial estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Skype deal is &#8220;just a continuation of basically
squandering a lot of opportunities with the cash and not doing
very good things with it,&#8221; said Donald Yacktman, president of
Yacktman Asset Management Co., which manages about $10 billion
in Austin, Texas, and owns more than 21 million Microsoft
shares. &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe he can continue to strike out every
time he goes to the plate,&#8221; he said, referring to Ballmer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, Microsoft should focus on returning more money to
its shareholders, according to Yacktman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;&#8216;Expensive&#8217; is putting it mildly,&#8221; Yacktman said of
Skype. &#8220;This is a very poor use of cash. The kingdom&#8217;s bigger,
but the residents are poorer. It just kind of boggles my mind.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy Apple Inc. (AAPL)
options to bet on volatility in the shares before the company&#8217;s
June 6 developers conference, which moves the stock more than
earnings reports, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference sends Apple shares down an average of 5.4
percent in five trading days, and Apple volatility is currently
&#8220;inexpensive,&#8221; wrote Katherine Fogertey and John Marshall,
equity-derivatives strategists at the New York-based bank. They
recommended buying a June $350 call and a June $350 put in a
strategy known as a straddle, which is a bet that a security&#8217;s
volatility will rise. Earnings reports have moved Apple an
average of 3 percent in the past eight quarters, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We view implied volatility in June options as
attractive,&#8221; the strategists said. &#8220;We see the average move of
minus 5 percent around the developers conference, combined with
our analyst&#8217;s strong upside view on shares, as a key catalyst to
buy volatility.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Shope, the Goldman Sachs analyst covering Apple, rates
the shares a &#8220;buy,&#8221; and raised his 12-month price estimate to
$470 on April 21. Shares of the Cupertino, California-based
company, which has the second-biggest market value in the world
behind Exxon Mobil Corp., fell 0.6 percent to $347.23 as of 4
p.m. in New York. Apple is rated the equivalent of &#8220;buy&#8221; by 48
analysts, with five &#8220;holds&#8221; and no &#8220;sell&#8221; recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Showcasing Technology &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Apple Worldwide Developers Conference is an annual
event where Apple showcases its latest technology. Shope expects
Apple to focus on &#8220;upcoming cloud services&#8221; at the conference,
&#8220;which should further propel the company&#8217;s iOS platform ahead
of the leading tablet and smartphone competition,&#8221; the note
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shope believes supply-chain disruptions &#8220;generally offer
the best opportunities for Apple&#8217;s stock,&#8221; and it&#8217;s &#8220;no
different&#8221; now, after iPad 2 sales were below estimates last
quarter and shipment of a new iPhone was pushed back to
September, Fogertey and Marshall wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buyers of the June $350 straddles profit if shares close up
5.7 percent to $369.40 or down 5.4 percent to $330.60 on June
expiration, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Dowling, a spokesman for Apple, didn&#8217;t respond to a
voicemail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world&#8217;s biggest
theme-park operator, fell the most in two years after second-
quarter profit missed estimates, as a shrinking box-office, a
park shortfall and the Japanese tsunami overshadowed TV gains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, dropped $2.39, or 5.4
percent, to $41.52 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading, the biggest decline since March 2009. The
stock has gained 11 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit at Disney&#8217;s theme-park unit, which collects
licensing fees from the Tokyo resort, fell 3.3 percent in the
wake of the March 11 disaster. U.S. parks were hurt by this
year&#8217;s later Easter break. The film studio failed to match last
year&#8217;s results from &#8220;Alice in Wonderland,&#8221; with income down 65
percent on box-office letdowns such as &#8220;Mars Needs Moms.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The noisy elements, the studio and Japan, clearly were
the problem and they are hard to predict,&#8221; said Matthew Harrigan, a Wunderlich Securities analyst in Denver who
recommends investors buy Disney shares. &#8220;The good news is that
the core of this company, ESPN and its TV business, still
performed very well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income decreased 1.2 percent to $942 million, or 49
cents a share, in the quarter ended April 2, from $953 million,
or 48 cents, a year earlier, Disney said yesterday in a
statement. Earnings missed the 58-cent average of 14 analysts&#8217;
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The rise in earnings per share
reflects stock buybacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Park Bookings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advance bookings at Disney parks are down 2.5 percent from
a year earlier, Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said on a
conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Room rates have increased by a double-digit percentage,
reflecting the decision to phase out discounts as the economy
improves, Rasulo said. Excluding the impact of the timing of the
Easter holiday, domestic theme park attendance increased by 2
percent from a year earlier, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The March 11 film release &#8220;Mars Needs Moms&#8221; cost $150
million to make and generated $20.9 million in U.S. ticket
sales, according to Harrigan. Last year, Disney&#8217;s home
entertainment sales benefited from Pixar&#8217;s movie &#8220;Up.&#8221; So far
this year, industry DVD sales are down at least 20 percent,
according to an industry group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s total sales rose 5.8 percent to $9.08 billion,
trailing the $9.19 billion average of 20 analysts&#8217; estimates.
Revenue was $8.58 billion a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Factors&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our revenue was up nicely but we had $170 million of
factors, basically, that had an impact on where we were and
where the Street thought we would be in terms of our earnings,&#8221;
Robert Iger, Disney&#8217;s president and chief executive officer,
said in an interview on CNBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue at Disney&#8217;s media networks increased 12 percent to
$4.32 billion, buoyed by advertising and affiliate revenue at
cable networks such as ESPN. Profit rose 17 percent to $1.52
billion, with cable earnings up 15 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABC broadcasting posted a 4.5 percent increase in revenue
to $1.5 billion on advertising growth and higher affiliate fees.
Profit gained 36 percent to $167 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit in consumer products increased 6.8 percent to $142
million as sales expanded 5 percent to $626 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s Interactive unit saw its loss more than double to
$115 million on a 2.6 percent gain in revenue. Results included
a $34 million cost linked to how the company accounts for the
purchase of Playdom, Iger said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will continue to take charges for the 2010
acquisition of the social game startup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That was unexpected and we&#8217;d like to hear more about
that,&#8221; said Robin Diedrich, an analyst with St. Louis-based
Edward Jones  Co., who recommends investors buy Disney. &#8220;But
it&#8217;s a small segment of the company. The main segments --
advertising and its parks -- are doing well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EBay Inc. (EBAY) said it will reap more than
a 50 percent return from the company&#8217;s $2.6 billion investment
in Skype Technologies SA six years ago, following Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s agreement yesterday to buy the Web calling service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With this sale, we have realized a total return of $1.4
billion on our original investment in Skype,&#8221; John Pluhowski, a
spokesman for San Jose, California-based EBay, said in an e-
mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft agreed to buy Skype, the world&#8217;s most popular
Web-calling service, for $8.5 billion from investors led by
private equity firm Silver Lake to attract users and narrow
Google Inc.&#8217;s lead in Web advertising. Before the offer, Skype
had announced plans to pursue an initial public offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This marks the second time that Skype, founded in Estonia
in 2003, will be part of a corporate parent. EBay in 2005 outbid
Google and Yahoo! Inc. for the money-losing startup. EBay, the
world&#8217;s largest online marketplace, had said then that Skype
could spur sales by letting buyers and sellers on its main
auction site talk for free with a mouse click. That never panned
out and two years later EBay wrote down the value of Skype by
$900 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EBay Chief Executive Officer John Donahoe in 2009 sold 70
percent of the calling service to investors in a deal that
valued Skype at $2.75 billion. Silver Lake, Skype&#8217;s largest
owner, then brokered the deal with Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Federal Trade Commission said
Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC, Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI) and Synthon
Holding BV illegally failed to inform the agency about patent
agreements on the insomnia drug Ambien CR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FTC let the companies off with a warning as its staff
told them it decided not to recommend penalties because the lack
of a filing didn&#8217;t harm rivals or consumers, according to a
statement on the agency&#8217;s website. Also, the companies didn&#8217;t
appear to be trying to evade reporting requirements, the agency
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FTC said it decided to issue letters to the companies
to guide them on complying with a 2003 health-care law. Future
violations could mean fines of as much as $11,000 a day, the
agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will consider enforcement recommendations, including
appropriate penalties&#8221; if the companies fail to tell the FTC of
future settlements, said Richard Feinstein, head of the FTC&#8217;s
Bureau of Competition, in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanofi-Aventis &#8220;acted in good faith, and no party appears
to have benefited from the failure to file,&#8221; Jack Cox, a
spokesman for the Paris-based company, said in an e-mail.
&#8220;However, the company takes note of the FTC&#8217;s position.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz has criticized some drug
settlements between brand-name and generic-drug makers as
delaying the introduction of less-expensive medicines. The
number of such deals increased to 31 in 2010 from 19 in the
previous year, according to the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these settlements &#8220;are outrageous, and they harm
consumers,&#8221; Leibowitz said on May 3 in an interview at the
Bloomberg News office in New York. &#8220;Either the courts or
Congress needs to stop them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanofi-Aventis sued Corona, California-based Watson and
Nijmegen, Netherlands-based Synthon in 2007 for patent
infringement by seeking to make a generic version of Sanofi&#8217;s
Ambien CR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Settlements in patent cases often are called reverse-
payment or pay-for-delay deals because the brand-name company
compensates the generic-drug maker with cash or marketing or
sales deals in return for dropping challenges to patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices of generic drugs are generally 20 percent to 30
percent below those of brand-name drugs and in some cases as
much as 90 percent cheaper, the FTC has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drug-company lobbyists have defended the patent settlements
as alternatives to long and costly court battles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokespeople for Watson and Synthon didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to phone calls and e-mails seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huawei Wins Trademark Court Order Against ZTE in Hamburg Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei Technologies Co., China&#8217;s largest phone-network-
equipment maker, won a preliminary injunction against a German
unit of its closest competitor, ZTE Corp. (763), over an alleged
trademark infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The order, dated May 2, prohibits ZTE from using a mark on
USB modem sticks or selling USB sticks which have a certain
legally protected design, according to a copy of the court
judgment obtained by Bloomberg News. The ruling was issued in a
fast-track proceeding without hearing arguments from ZTE, which
can seek to have the judgment overturned by filing an objection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZTE and Huawei, both based in Shenzen, have expanded beyond
China into Asia and Africa, and are now looking to boost sales
in Europe and the U.S. Huawei is the world&#8217;s second-largest
maker of equipment for mobile-phone networks behind Ericsson AB,
according to April estimates from research firm Gartner Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Susanne Baumann, a spokeswoman for ZTE&#8217;s German unit,
couldn&#8217;t be reached by phone and didn&#8217;t immediately reply to an
e-mail seeking comment. Huawei&#8217;s German company spokeswoman,
Brenda Hao, didn&#8217;t immediately return a call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei said April 28 that it filed lawsuits in Germany,
France and Hungary over a series of patents and trademarks
related to data-card and high-speed mobile Internet technology.
A day later ZTE said it filed a patent lawsuit over fourth-
generation mobile-network technology against Huawei in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is LG Hamburg, 315 O 205/11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koch Industries&#8217; Parody-Website Infringement Case Dismissed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koch Industries Inc., the closely held energy and chemical
company based in Wichita, Kansas controlled by billionaire
brothers David and Charles Koch, cannot sue the creators of a
parody website for trademark infringement, a federal court in
Utah ruled May 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wichita, Kansas-based holding company sued 25 unnamed
defendants for trademark infringement in December 2010, claiming
its rights were infringed by a parody website -- www.koch-
inc.com -- that criticized the company&#8217;s environmental record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unnamed defendants had identified themselves as Youth
for Climate Truth, according to court papers. They also sent out
a faux press release that included a link to their website, Koch
said in its pleadings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Dale A. Kimball said that Koch failed
to make a case for infringement. The company&#8217;s legal theories
around trademark infringement &#8220;are not factually plausible,&#8221;
he said. He also refused Koch&#8217;s request that the 25 unnamed
defendants be identified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koch was represented by Michael W. Young and Juliette P.
White of Salt Lake City&#8217;s Parsons Behle  Latimer. The
defendants were represented by Deepak Gupta of Washington&#8217;s
Public Citizen Litigation Group and Lester A. Perry of Hoole 
King LC of Salt Lake City. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Koch Industries v. John Does 1-15, 2:10-cv-
01275-DAK-SA, U.S. District Court, District of Utah (Salt Lake
City). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashok Leland Wins Appeal Over Rights to &#8216;Luxura&#8217; Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashok Leland Ltd., the Chennai, India-based manufacturer of
buses and trucks, persuaded the Madras High Court to bar a
transportation company&#8217;s use of the &#8220;Luxura&#8221; mark, according
to The Hindu newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue Hill Logistics Ltd. of Bengaluru, India, and Dilip
Chhabria Design Private Ltd. of Mumbai had asked the High Court
to reverse a trial judge&#8217;s ruling barring their use of the term,
according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two companies claimed that &#8220;Luxura&#8221; was a variation
of the word &#8220;luxury&#8221; and not protectable under Indian
trademark law, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court said that because Askok Leland was the registered
owner of the &#8220;Luxura&#8221; mark, its rights had to be protected,
according to The Hindu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Sued in U.K. Over &#8216;Relentless&#8217; for Energy Drink &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO) was targeted in a trademark action brought in
the U.K. by a music company, Music Week reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Media Village Entertainment Ltd. objected to the Atlanta-
based beverage company&#8217;s use of &#8220;Relentless&#8221; for its energy
drink brand, according to Music Week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Media Village Entertainment&#8217;s Relentless Records earlier
engaged in failed mediation with Coca-Cola over the use of the
mark, Music Week reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier, Coca-Cola withdrew its application to register
&#8220;No Half Measures&#8221; as a U.K. trademark following an objection
by No Half Measures Ltd. of Glasgow, according to Music Week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HP&#8217;s Cloud Computing Service May Use &#8216;Scalene&#8217; as Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) is going to a triangular cloud, if a
recent filing with the U.S. Patent and Trademark office is any
indication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Patent Office database, HP is seeking to
register the term &#8220;scalene&#8221; for computer hardware, software
and services related to cloud computing. The term, when used in
geometry, refers to a triangle in which each side is of a
different length. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Palo Alto, California-based company filed a parallel
application to register &#8220;Scalene&#8221; for use with cloud computing
in the nations of the European Union. Both were filed in late
March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That same month, Chief Executive Officer Leo Apotheker said
that the company was starting a cloud-computing service that
will let developers create applications for consumers and
businesses using HP tools and run on HP servers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quebecor Unit Sued for Infringing Horoscope Column Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quebecor Inc. (QBR/B)&#8217;s Sun Media unit was sued for copyright
infringement by a company that produces syndicated material, the
Canadian Press reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative Artists Syndicate Inc., in a lawsuit filed in
Canadian Federal Court, accused Sun Media of running horoscope
columns without authorization, CP said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Sun Media contract to run the content expired in January
2010 and it continued to publish the content without
compensating the creators, Creative Artists claimed, according
to CP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative Artists is seeking damages from Quebecor, which
declined to comment to CP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Righthaven Tells Court Its Suits Take Aim at &#8216;Parasitic&#8217; Model &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Righthaven LLC, the Las Vegas-based company that filed more
than 200 lawsuits involving copyrights of Stephens Media Group&#8217;s
newspapers, told a federal court it was only responding to &#8220;a
parasitic business model employed by many website operators.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newspapers are struggling for survival in the era of digital
media, Righthaven said in its May 9 filing in the infringement
case it brought against the Democratic Underground, and
criticism it has received from the court presents &#8220;a blemished
portrait of Stephens.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Righthaven referred to an April 14 court order in which it
was accused of working with closely held Stephens Media &#8220;to
create a cottage industry of filing copyright claims.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, Righthaven argued that the frequency of the suits
it filed is &#8220;directly attributable to the frequency of
infringing conduct on the Internet.&#8221; Rather than creating a
cottage industry, Righthaven said Stephens Media&#8217;s hope is that
the suits it is filing &#8220;will reduce the amount of infringing
conduct to a level where such litigation becomes altogether
unnecessary.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a different front, Righthaven hired New York-based
copyright specialist Dale Cendali -- a partner in Chicago&#8217;s
Kirkland  Ellis LLP -- to replace its in-house counsel in at
least one infringement case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case against the Democratic Underground is Righthaven
LLC v. Democratic Underground LLC, 2:10-cv-01356-RLH-GWF, U.S.
District Court, District of Nevada (Las Vegas). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Copyright on Situation-Room Photo; Apology for Alteration &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Di Tzeitung, the Yiddish-language newspaper that airbrushed
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton from a government-issued
photo of the White House situation room, hasn&#8217;t violated any
copyright law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brooklyn, New York-based newspaper, which serves a
segment of the Orthodox Jewish community, doesn&#8217;t publish any
photos of women. According to a statement issued by the
newspaper, &#8220;laws of modesty&#8221; bar using photos of women and as
&#8220;an expression of respect for women.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photo, shot March 1, shows Clinton, together with the
president, vice president and a number of other government
officials clustered in the situation room, awaiting word that
Osama bin Laden had been captured or killed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the copyright policy posted on the White House
website, materials published on the website aren&#8217;t copyright-
protected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its statement, Di Tzeitung said that its photo editor
didn&#8217;t read the &#8220;fine print&#8221; that accompanied the photo,
forbidding any changes, and went ahead per newspaper policy and
edited Clinton and a second woman out of the photo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The publication noted that Clinton &#8220;won overwhelming
majorities in the orthodox Jewish communities&#8221; during her two
campaigns for U.S. Senate in 2000 and 2006. It sent the White
House an apology for using the photo outside of its terms of
use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotland Convicts First Person for Sharing Music on Internet &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 58-year-old woman became the first person in Scotland to
be convicted of illegally sharing music over the Internet,
prosecutors said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defendant pleaded guilty at Ayr Sheriff Court last
month to breaking a 1988 copyright law after distributing 54,000
pounds ($88,000) of music through file-sharing software, the
Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service said in an e-mailed
statement. Sentencing will take place on May 31. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. soybean inventories will be in a
&#8220;slight surplus&#8221; in the 2010-11 crop year on weaker Chinese
imports of the oilseed, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said as it
raised stockpile estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased competition from South America will &#8220;limit the
U.S. inventory drawdown,&#8221; analysts Damien Courvalin and Allison Nathan said in a report today. Brazil is the world&#8217;s second-
biggest soybean exporter after the U.S., and Argentina ranks
third. The analysts also said the acreage planted with the
oilseed will shrink this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We acknowledge, however, that a longer slowdown in
Chinese imports than we expect and corn-to-soybean acreage
shifts present downside risk to our forecast,&#8221; they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soybeans will trade at $15 a bushel in three months&#8217; time,
Goldman Sachs said. The oilseed for July delivery was at $13.385
at 9:03 a.m. London time on the Chicago Board of Trade. The bank
forecast a price of $15.75 in both six and 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ecuadoreans whose $18 billion verdict
against Chevron Corp. (CVX) in their country was put on hold by a U.S.
judge won an appeals court ruling they say will allow them to
raise money to enforce the judgment at a later date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A three-judge panel in New York today granted a request to
partially lift a lower-court order that restrained the
Ecuadorean residents&#8217; efforts to enforce the Feb. 14 judgment
over environmental damage to the Amazon River basin. The court
refused the Ecuadorean plaintiffs&#8217; request to put on hold a
lawsuit Chevron filed against them now pending in federal court
in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel also said it would expedite the schedule for
hearing the appeal of the restraining order, which blocked the
Ecuadoreans from trying to collect the judgment in a U.S. or
foreign court anywhere in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court said the plaintiffs aren&#8217;t restrained by
the lower-court order &#8220;other than commencing, prosecuting or
receiving benefit from recognition, enforcement, or prejudgment
seizure or attachment proceedings.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court&#8217;s decision allows the Ecuadoreans to meet
with their American lawyers and raise money to enforce the
judgment in the oil-cleanup lawsuit at a later date, Karen Hinton, a spokeswoman for the plaintiffs, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;All Key Respects&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin Higgs, a Chevron spokesman, said the company is
pleased with today&#8217;s ruling, which he said keeps the lower
court&#8217;s order &#8220;in place in all key respects, and rejects the
defendants&#8217; efforts to derail the November 2011 trial on the
enforceability of the fraudulent Ecuadorean judgment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This injunction was never about whether denying the
defendants the right to communicate with their clients or
fundraise,&#8221; Higgs said in an e-mail. &#8220;It was about preventing
them from furthering enforcement proceedings and financially
benefiting from them, which the Second Circuit has now affirmed
they cannot do.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court case is Chevron Corp. v. Hugo Gerardo
Camacho Naranjo, 11-1150, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit (New York). The case in Ecuador is Maria Aquinda v.
Chevron, 002-2003, Superior Court of Nueva Loja, Lago Agrio,
Ecuador. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) closed at
its lowest level in more than eight months after an analyst told
investors to sell the stock on concern that the Department of
Justice faces growing pressure to bring claims against the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank dropped $5.13, or 3.5 percent, to $142.75 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading, the biggest decline since
a 4.7 percent decrease on Jan. 19. The last time the stock
closed lower was Sept. 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, was
one of three banks singled out last month in a report on the
financial crisis by the U.S. Senate&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations. The panel, whose findings were referred to the
Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission,
said Goldman Sachs misled clients about its bets on mortgage-
related investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It now appears that the pressure on the Justice
Department to bring a criminal lawsuit against Goldman is
building to a high pitch,&#8221; Richard X. Bove, an analyst at
Rochdale Securities LLC, said in a note today to investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Cohen, a spokesman at New York-based Goldman Sachs,
declined to comment on Bove&#8217;s note and the stock price decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bove, who is based in Lutz, Florida, is one of two analysts
with a negative rating on Goldman Sachs, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The other is Christopher Wheeler, a
London-based analyst for Mediobanca SpA. Of 28 analysts
surveyed, 17 recommend that investors buy the stock and nine
call for holding it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Vampire Squid&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bove cited a new article by writer Matt Taibbi in Rolling
Stone magazine that says the Justice Department should
criminally charge Goldman Sachs based on the subcommittee&#8217;s
report. In a 2009 story for Rolling Stone, Taibbi wrote an
article about Goldman Sachs that labeled the firm &#8220;a great
vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The new Matt Taibbi article in Rolling Stone magazine is
another all-out attack on the company,&#8221; Bove wrote in today&#8217;s
note. &#8220;However, this time the attack is backed by a 650-page
report signed by both a Democrat and a Republican.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s Cohen also declined to comment on Taibbi&#8217;s
article. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorney General Eric H. Holder, testifying before the
House Judiciary Committee on May 3, confirmed that his
department is reviewing the Senate&#8217;s report, which was led by
Michigan Democrat Carl M. Levin and Oklahoma Republican Thomas A. Coburn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Not Losing Sleep&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The department is looking right now at the report
prepared by Senator Levin&#8217;s subcommittee that deals with Goldman
Sachs,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the report was released, Goldman Sachs said it never
misled anyone about its behavior. &#8220;The testimony we gave was
truthful and accurate and this is confirmed by the
subcommittee&#8217;s own report,&#8221; a Goldman Sachs spokesman, Lucas van Praag, said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein who
recommends that investors buy Goldman Sachs stock, said he
doesn&#8217;t share Bove&#8217;s concerns about the political risk to
Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At this point, I&#8217;m not losing sleep over more theater
from within the Beltway,&#8221; Hintz said in an e-mailed reply to
questions. &#8220;GS remains the leading investment bank in the
world.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greece had 13 off-market derivative
contracts with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), most of which swapped
Japanese yen into euros in a 2001 transaction aimed at
concealing the true size of the nation&#8217;s debt, according to the
European Union&#8217;s statistics office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount borrowed through the swaps was due to be repaid
with an interest-rate swap that would have spread payments
through 2019, Eurostat said in a report on its website today. In
2005, the maturity was extended to 2037, the report said.
Restructuring the swaps spread the cost over a longer period,
leading to an increase in liabilities and debt, Eurostat said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repeated revisions of Greece&#8217;s figures, beginning in 2009,
spurred a surge in borrowing costs that pushed the country to
the brink of default and triggered a region-wide debt crisis.
The use of off-market swaps, which Greece hadn&#8217;t previously
disclosed as debt, let the country increase borrowings by 5.3
billion euros ($7.5 billion), Eurostat said in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s report provides details of Eurostat&#8217;s analysis of
data obtained by its inspectors in Greece last year. Eurostat
said most issues surrounding the swaps were resolved in
September, when Greece agreed to correct its debt figures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A phone call and an e-mail to a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman
in London weren&#8217;t immediately returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greece agreed in September with Eurostat to treat other
swaps from 2005 as debt. Those contracts had &#8220;very short
maturity, with a quick amortization of the loan component,&#8221;
Eurostat said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs deal originally amounted to a loan of 2.8
billion euros, according to Eurostat. National Bank of Greece
SA (ETE), the country&#8217;s biggest lender, in 2005 took over the swap
from New York-based Goldman Sachs. Four years later, National
Bank securitized the swap, Eurostat said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-
largest U.S. bank by assets, won a challenge at the European
Union&#8217;s highest court to have a collateralized-debt obligation
dispute over $112 million heard by U.K. courts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contractual disputes are mainly about a contract&#8217;s validity
and don&#8217;t need to be heard in the country where the party
challenging the validity of the deal is based, the EU Court of
Justice in Luxembourg ruled today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling relates to two cases at the Luxembourg-based EU
court over whether disputes between JPMorgan and the city of
Berlin&#8217;s transportation provider BVG about a 2007 derivatives
transaction should be heard in the U.K. or Germany. JPMorgan in
2008 sued BVG in the U.K., arguing the contract said any dispute
would be handled in British courts. In 2009, BVG sued JPMorgan
in Berlin seeking to annul what it called an invalid deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision may influence dozens of lawsuits over losses
on swap agreements between local governments and community-owned
utilities in the U.K., Germany and Italy on one hand, and banks
including UBS AG (UBSN), Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Depfa Bank Plc on
the other. While municipalities are increasingly filing suits at
home claiming they weren&#8217;t properly advised of risks or that
swaps were unlawfully settled, the banks are turning to U.K.
courts where they expect to get swifter rulings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Enforceability&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision &#8220;underpins the framework of the commercial
system, though it&#8217;s certainly not helpful to those public bodies
that are trying to have their cases heard in their home courts&#8221;
after agreeing to other jurisdictions in the contracts, said
Laurence Harris, a lawyer at Edwards Angell Palmer  Dodge LLP
in London. &#8220;The ruling identifies what the dispute is really
about, which is the enforceability of the contract.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be &#8220;contrary to the sound administration of
justice to confer exclusive jurisdiction for such disputes upon
the courts of the&#8221; EU nation &#8220;in which one of the contracting
companies has its seat,&#8221; the court said in a 12-page ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the agreement that prompted today&#8217;s case, JPMorgan
was insured by BVG against default on debt tied to 150
companies, including Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) In 2008,
following Lehman&#8217;s collapse and the financial market turmoil it
spurred, New York-based JPMorgan enforced the agreement and is
seeking $112 million from BVG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BVG sought a decision that it doesn&#8217;t have to pay JPMorgan,
in light of what it called incorrect advice about the deal from
the bank. The U.K. and Berlin courts both asked for the EU
tribunal&#8217;s guidance on which held jurisdiction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haugesund, Narvik &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Klaus Wazlak, a spokesman for BVG said in an e-mail the
company will analyze the ruling and may comment later. JPMorgan
spokesman Axel Luedeke declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate case involving losses on swaps, a London
court in 2009 ruled that while the Norwegian towns of Haugesund
and Narvik didn&#8217;t have the legal right to enter into swap
agreements, they were still obliged to pay 425 million kroner
($77.4 million) to a Depfa unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS last year won a London court ruling that a dispute over
a CDO deal with a German municipal utility should be heard in
the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italian municipalities from across the country are being
sued by banks in London over swaps and, emboldened by a criminal
trial in Milan of Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Depfa, JPMorgan and UBS,
increasingly more municipalities are filing complaints in their
hometown courts to avoid losses on the derivatives deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is C-144/10, Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG),
Anstalt des oeffentlichen Rechts v JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A.,
Frankfurt Branch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shinsei Bank Ltd. (8303), the Japanese
lender partly owned by J. Christopher Flowers, named Jun Makihara, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) executive, as an
outside director. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appointment is subject to approval by shareholders at
the Tokyo-based lender&#8217;s annual general meeting scheduled for
June 22, it said in a statement filed to the Tokyo Stock
Exchange today. Makihara currently is chairman of Neoteny Co., a
Japanese Internet investment firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Makihara, 53, had worked at Goldman Sachs in New York and
Tokyo for almost two decades and was once a managing director
and branch manager of the U.S. company&#8217;s Tokyo office. He is a
graduate from Harvard Business School. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After two years of losses, Shinsei today posted net income
of 42.7 billion yen in the year ended March. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) plans to set
up a yuan-denominated private equity fund in China, according to
two people with knowledge of the matter, while Morgan Stanley (MS)
said it would announce a similar fund next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein attended a
ceremony for Goldman Sachs in Beijing today, the people said,
declining to be identified before an announcement. The bank and
its Chinese partner will seek to raise 5 billion yuan ($769
million), another person said. Morgan Stanley plans to hold an
event on May 18 to mark the start of its first yuan fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. banks would follow Blackstone (BX) Group LP and Carlyle
Group in raising funds to compete with local rivals including
Hony Capital Ltd. as China steps up efforts to develop its own
buyout firms and strengthen capital markets. Private-equity
investments in China jumped 40 percent to $19.7 billion last
year, according to the Asian Venture Capital Journal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Regulatory-wise, it is still a bit cumbersome for the
foreign players,&#8221; Johnson Chng, head of financial services at
Bain  Co. in Shanghai, said by telephone today. For &#8220;some of
the industries, the foreign names may be deemed to be too
sensitive, such as in strategically important industries.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will set up the Broad Street (Beijing) RMB
Fund, its first single-country pool of investment capital, with
Beijing State-Owned Capital Operation and Management Center, a
person said. Richard Friedman, head of merchant banking for
Goldman Sachs, was also at today&#8217;s ceremony, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angela Yu, a Beijing-based spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.S. Limitations &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackstone, the world&#8217;s largest private-equity manager, in
2009 became the first global buyout firm to announce plans for a
local-currency fund in China, followed by TPG Inc. and Carlyle.
The three firms have announced plans to raise a combined 20
billion yuan ($3.1 billion) for such funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, who is approaching his fifth anniversary as
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s chairman and CEO, is grappling with limits on
proprietary trading and investments in hedge funds and private-equity funds imposed by the U.S.&#8217;s Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul
law. The bank&#8217;s biggest businesses, trading and investing, are
also the ones most affected by new global capital requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In China, Asia&#8217;s biggest private-equity market over the
past three years, foreign buyout firms are facing stiffer
competition from local rivals as former executives at Goldman
Sachs and Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. set up their own funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Local Rivals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDB Capital, a unit of China Development Bank Corp., said
in December it plans to raise about 60 billion yuan from
domestic financial institutions for investment in private equity
funds. China International Capital Corp., Citic Securities Co.
and Haitong Securities Co. won approval to raise yuan-denominated funds for their private-equity units, the Securities
Times said in February, citing an unidentified person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign private-equity investors face restrictions on
buying assets in China, such as capital controls and limited
access to industries designated by the government as
strategically important. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington-based Carlyle Group, the world&#8217;s second-biggest
private-equity firm, formed an investment management venture
with Beijing State-owned Capital Operation and Management
Center, it said in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley and Hangzhou Industrial  Commercial Trust
Co. plan to hold an opening ceremony next week for their
private-equity venture in Hangzhou, according to an e-mailed
invitation for the event that was confirmed by Noel Cheung, a
spokeswoman for the New York-based bank. Hangzhou Industrial
executives couldn&#8217;t immediately be reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL), Australia&#8217;s
second-largest oil and natural gas producer, named Peter Coleman,
a 27-year Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) veteran, as the new chief executive
officer to replace Don Voelte. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 51-year-old Australian will start May 30, the Perth-
based company said in a statement today. Coleman was previously
vice president of Exxon Mobil Development Co., where he led work
on more than $40 billion of projects worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He takes control of a company that&#8217;s been the subject of
takeover speculation since its biggest shareholder, Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA), sold part of its stake last year. Coleman&#8217;s challenge
will be to drive development of Woodside&#8217;s liquefied natural gas
ventures, including the A$30 billion ($32 billion) Browse
project, as industry costs rise and LNG demand soars in Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voelte &#8220;was quite aggressive -- that was probably needed
by Woodside to jolt them into activity,&#8221; said Peter Rudd,
mining and resources research manager at Armytage Private Ltd.,
a Melbourne-based investment firm that oversees A$420 million in
assets and owns Woodside shares. &#8220;Now they need a man who has a
good production background to bring projects on stream and
manage costs. Coleman has the appropriate background.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim O&#8217;Neill, chairman of Goldman
Sachs Asset Management, said China&#8217;s inflation &#8220;won&#8217;t be a
problem&#8221; in the second half of this year and the government
will stop tightening policies as price gains moderate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;China&#8217;s economy is probably slowing down more than people
realize,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill, who oversees $677 billion of assets and
coined the acronym BRIC for the economies of Brazil, Russia,
India and China, told reporters in Hong Kong today. Chinese
stocks may have a &#8220;big rally&#8221; in the second half if his
assessment is correct, he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflation stayed above 5 percent for a second month in
April, exceeding Premier Wen Jiabao&#8217;s 4 percent target, a
government report showed yesterday. Daiwa Capital Markets says
policy makers face a &#8220;dilemma&#8221; because of the risk that
measures to curb prices will lead to a slowdown in the world&#8217;s
fastest-growing major economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s expansion may slow to about 8 percent in June
through December, O&#8217;Neill said. The economy grew 9.7 percent in
the first quarter from a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The People&#8217;s Bank of China has raised interest rates four
times since mid-October and reined in credit growth that surged
to a record in 2009. Inflation was an annual 5.3 percent in
April, while industrial production expanded 13.4 percent, the
least since November, yesterday&#8217;s report showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not surprising at all, given the importance of China,
that commodities prices are under some pressure,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said.
Copper dropped to a five-month low today on concern that the
nation&#8217;s monetary tightening may continue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s nine-year-old
antitrust agreement with the U.S. Justice Department, set to
expire today, permanently changed the software marketplace,
making it more open, fair and innovative, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final judgment in the Microsoft case, in effect since
2002, prevented the company from using its monopoly Windows
operating system for personal computing to quash competition,
the department said yesterday in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court&#8217;s decree &#8220;helped create competitive conditions
that enabled new kinds of products, such as cloud computing
services and mobile devices, to develop as potential platform
threats to the Windows desktop operating system,&#8221; the
department said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department, joined by 19 states and the
District of Columbia, sued Microsoft in 1998, alleging the
company unlawfully protected its Windows monopoly by keeping
computer makers from promoting browsers that competed with
Microsoft&#8217;s Internet Explorer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government contended Microsoft hindered access to the
Netscape Navigator browser because its Java programming language
let programmers write applications that ran on any operating
system, not just Windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft got into antitrust trouble because it fell
behind as an innovator and then tried to catch up by flexing its
Windows monopoly rather than competing on the merits,&#8221; said
Andy Gavil, an antitrust professor at Howard University Law
School in Washington. &#8220;It did that most extremely with Internet
browsers and media players.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Software &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement protected development and distribution of
new software and barred Microsoft from continuing the behavior
that triggered the antitrust lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our experience has changed us and shaped how we view our
responsibility to the industry,&#8221; Microsoft spokesman Kevin Kutz
said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We are pleased to bring this
matter to successful resolution.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft submitted to court oversight of its practices
under a decree issued by U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar- Kotelly. The supervision included periodic reviews to ensure the
company complied with terms of the settlement to give computer
makers freedom to promote rival products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harry First, a professor at New York University School of
Law in Manhattan, said he questions how much was accomplished. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market Share &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Everything that was done didn&#8217;t really disrupt
Microsoft&#8217;s position,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s still a Windows world
and Internet Explorer still has a major share of the browser
market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet Explorer has 55 percent of the browser market,
while Mozilla&#8217;s Firefox has 22 percent, according to research
firm Netmarketshare&#8217;s website. Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Chrome has 12
percent and Apple Inc.&#8217;s Safari has 7 percent, Netmarketshare
reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Kollar-Kotelly said at the last oversight hearing on
April 27 that the compliance committee had worked well and could
be used as a model for cases in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission accused Microsoft in 2004 of
abusing its dominant position by deliberately restricting the
ability of non-Microsoft software on larger computers to work
with its Windows operating system. Microsoft&#8217;s bundling of the
media player with Windows was also deemed unfair by the
Commission, which fined the company a record 497 million euros
($706 million), ordered it to share secret programming data with
competitors and offer a version of Windows without a music and
video player. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The most important thing about the case was that it put
Microsoft under incredible scrutiny for how it was going to
treat firms coming to life around the browser,&#8221; said Timothy Wu, an information industries scholar from Columbia University
who is on leave to advise the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wu said the antitrust case helped Internet companies such
as Google and Facebook Inc. flourish, while products such as
WordPerfect and Lotus 1-2-3 software lost momentum due to
Microsoft&#8217;s dominance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Microsoft, 98-cv-01232, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Morgan
Stanley (MS), which led investment banks on General Motors Co. (GM)&#8217;s
initial public offering, probably will handle the next sale of
the automaker&#8217;s shares, said a person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Treasury Department, the Detroit-based automaker&#8217;s
biggest shareholder, won&#8217;t sell more shares until at least
August to wait for the stock price to climb, two people familiar
with the decision have said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Treasury, which owns 33 percent of GM, can file
for a secondary offering as soon as May 22 using the same form
as for an IPO, which requires a lengthy regulatory review. At
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s suggestion, the department decided to wait
until July 1, when it can file a simpler document and have more
flexibility on timing, said the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You need a megabank to underwrite a deal that is the size
of what the U.S. Treasury will be selling,&#8221; said Peter Bible,
GM&#8217;s former chief accounting officer who now heads the public
companies group for New York-based accounting firm EisnerAmper
LLP. &#8220;Those two make the most sense given their size. They did
a tremendous job on the IPO.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S., which invested $49.5 billion in GM during its
2009 bankruptcy and restructuring, still is talking with other
investment banks about underwriting roles, and a final decision
won&#8217;t be made until closer to a stock sale, said the person, who
asked not to be identified revealing private plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM fell 35 cents to $31.07 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings Results &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasury officials put off deciding on the timing of a GM
secondary offering because the stock has mostly traded below the
$33 per-share IPO price. While the company beat earnings
expectations on May 5, the stock fell 3.1 percent that day. The
lower price affirmed the Treasury&#8217;s decision that it would be
better to wait until the second-quarter profit is announced, the
people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The longer they wait, the better the return for the
Treasury will be and for the taxpayer,&#8221; Dennis Virag, president
of Automotive Consulting Group in Ann Arbor, Michigan, said in a
telephone interview yesterday. &#8220;The auto market in the U.S. is
recovering, and it&#8217;s a fairly consistent recovery.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Treasury doesn&#8217;t expect to sell its remaining 33
percent stake in a single secondary offering, one of the people
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sale Options &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Treasury opted to file an S-1 registration statement,
the kind of document used for an IPO, the offering would have to
go through a rigorous review that could last a month or longer,
similar to an initial stock sale, Bible said in an interview
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the simpler S-3 filing, the SEC can review GM
documents it already has, so the registration could be done in
days, Bible said. That would allow the government to better time
a sale to a higher price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM&#8217;s management and President Barack Obama&#8217;s administration
want to end the almost two-year period of government ownership,
the people said. The Treasury doesn&#8217;t expect to get the $44
average share price needed to break even on the $49.5 billion
investment, they said. Further share sales need to average $53 a
share to make up for the $33 per-share IPO price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re going to lose money in the auto industry on net,
but we did this for the jobs we were going to save, not to
maximize return,&#8221; Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said
at a Detroit Economic Club event on April 28. &#8220;We&#8217;re not a
private investor. Our job was to protect the country.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasury Bailout &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Treasury provided $85 billion of commitments to the
auto industry, which included $64 billion to GM and Chrysler
Group LLC, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The
remaining assistance was provided to auto-parts suppliers and to
finance arms Chrysler Financial Corp. and GMAC Inc., which is
now known as Ally Financial Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Treasury aims to get at least the $33 IPO price and
would prefer to sell shares in the high $30s or into the $40
range, where most analysts have set their target price, the
people said. The department also wants to begin selling shares
this year, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM raised more than $23 billion, mostly for U.S. and

of America Corp. (BAC) and Citigroup Inc. (C) were also listed among

&lt;p&gt;Second-Quarter Profit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Treasury plans to wait for GM to announce a second-
quarter profit before selling any more shares, which could be in
August or September, or it may wait until November, after third-
quarter results, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What Treasury does with their GM shares is entirely up to
them,&#8221; Jim Cain, a GM spokesman, said yesterday. &#8220;We&#8217;re
focused on growing profitably around the world, further
strengthening our balance sheet and fully funding our pension
plan.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government ownership is weighing down GM shares, said David Whiston, an analyst with Chicago-based Morningstar Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A portfolio manager who believes the GM story may stay on
the sidelines because when Treasury files to sell, the stock
could sink,&#8221; he said in a telephone interview yesterday.
&#8220;Other investors don&#8217;t want to invest simply because there is
government ownership.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson bought $939,900 in
shares of the automaker, GM disclosed today in a regulatory
filing. The purchase of 30,000 shares at $31.33 apiece was a
personal investment by Akerson, said Jim Cain, a GM spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Total SA (FP),
Europe&#8217;s third-largest oil company, have signed a partnership
for exploration of shale gas in Poland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the agreement announced today, Exxon will have 51
percent and operate the Chelm and Werbkowice exploration
concessions in the Lublin Basin of southeastern Poland,
according to a statement from Paris-based Total. The French
company will have a 49 percent stake in the concessions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The entry into these concessions reflects Total&#8217;s
commitment to expanding activities in unconventional gas,
notably in Europe,&#8221; Total said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move into Poland to explore for unconventional gas
follows passage this week by the French National Assembly of a
bill that would ban the use of hydraulic fracturing in France, a
technique used to explore for hydrocarbons locked in shale rock.
The French government and environmental groups have said use of
the technology can harm the environment by contaminating land
and water tables. The bill still needs approval in the Senate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poland&#8217;s reserves of shale and so-called tight gas may be
as much as 3 trillion cubic meters, according to estimates by
consultant Advanced Resources International Inc. Shale
formations consist of dense rock that can be broken apart using
water, sand and chemicals to release oil or gas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon has already started using seismic data to explore the
Chelm concession and has drilled an exploratory well, according
to today&#8217;s statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Shale &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total entered the U.S. shale-gas business last year
agreeing to pay $800 million for 25 percent of Chesapeake Energy
Corp. (CHK)&#8217;s assets in the Barnett Shale field in Texas. In addition
to the U.S., Total plans to develop unconventional gas in
Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Canada, China and Denmark, Total
has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total&#8217;s five-year Montelimar permit in France allowed the
company to search for shale gas in an area that spans 4,327
square kilometers (1,671 square miles) from south of Valence to
areas around Montpellier. The company won&#8217;t use hydraulic
fracturing on the permit, although it&#8217;s not clear whether the
license will be revoked, de Margerie said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unconventional resources are part of the company&#8217;s strategy
to lift production by an average of 2 percent annually through
2015, a target reiterated today by de Margerie. Output will be
&#8220;relatively stable&#8221; this year amid a gap in new projects
starting and a halt in output from Libya. Total will add to its
production this year from its acquisition of a 12 percent stake
in Russia&#8217;s OAO Novatek. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The oil market is &#8220;structurally
bullish&#8221; and prices are likely to be higher in 12 months,
according to a senior analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market will get into &#8220;critical shortages&#8221; in 2012,
Jeffrey Currie, head of commodity research at the bank, said
today in an interview in London. &#8220;Long-term and medium-term
we&#8217;re still structurally bullish.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent crude has risen 20 percent this year and West Texas
Intermediate oil, the U.S. benchmark, is up 8.2 percent amid
concern that unrest in North Africa and the Middle East will
disrupt supplies as the global economy recovers. Crude last week
had its biggest weekly decline in more than two years as U.S.
economic indicators and a strengthening dollar triggered a five-
day rout in commodity prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volatility in oil prices will begin to stabilize next month
as the market gets clearer signs on U.S. growth and the pace of
monetary policy tightening in China, Currie said. The
commodities market is currently going through &#8220;a rough patch&#8221;
on weakness in macroeconomic data, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Clearer Position&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Once these fears exhibit some signs of stability you&#8217;ll
be in a clearer position,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil demand will continue to expand even if the U.S. ends
bond-buying efforts to support the economy, known as
quantitative easing, or QE, Currie said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If there is real sustainable growth that was generated
off the back of this QE, when you take it away, you may see a
slowing in the growth rate, but growth should still be
underlying intact,&#8221; he said today at the Platts Crude Oil
Markets conference in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Energy Agency yesterday trimmed its 2011
global oil demand forecast for the first time as this year&#8217;s
price rally begins to weigh on consumers. Consumption will
expand 1.5 percent worldwide this year, the Paris-based agency
said in its monthly report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s Currie said inflation pressures on policy makers
in emerging economies will ease in the second half of the year,
creating &#8220;a more positive environment for risky assets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabian production capacity is in the &#8220;vicinity&#8221; of
2008 levels, the Goldman Sachs analyst said at the London
conference. Spare capacity isn&#8217;t expected to reach 2008 levels
for another six to 12 months, Goldman said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;

the world&#8217;s second-biggest Coke drinks bottler, said it got a

&lt;p&gt;The five-year multi-currency credit line replaces existing

&lt;p&gt;Jim O&#8217;Neill, chairman of Goldman
Sachs Asset Management, said investors should shed their
pessimism and stop hoarding cash amid prospects for a global
stock rally that could start in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The view that &#8220;the West is in trouble&#8221; is wrong when
nations including Germany, Sweden, Australia and Canada are
performing strongly, O&#8217;Neill said in an interview with Bloomberg
Television in Hong Kong, recorded yesterday and broadcast today.
Investors should &#8220;stop worrying so much,&#8221; said O&#8217;Neill, known
for coining the BRIC acronym for Brazil, Russia, India and China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global investors have tempered their optimism about the U.S.
and world economies and plan to put more of their money in cash
and less in commodities over the next six months, a quarterly
survey of Bloomberg subscribers showed yesterday. The poll,
conducted May 9-10, also found that investors&#8217; enthusiasm for
stocks is cooling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Neill, 54, said his strongest hunch is that China&#8217;s
inflation may be close to easing, meaning the Chinese stock
market may &#8220;go crazy&#8221; in the second half of the year. The
central bank yesterday raised banks&#8217; reserve requirements by
half a percentage point to lock up cash that threatens to fuel
gains in consumer prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index rose 1 percent today,
the biggest gain in a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Every Little Problem&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, investors
are overly concerned at the possibility of so-called black swan
events, said O&#8217;Neill, using a term sometimes used to describe
unlikely occurrences with severe consequences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Every little problem that crops up somewhere in the world
is not going to create another black swan,&#8221; he said, adding
that &#8220;there&#8217;s far too much conservatism,&#8221; in terms of
investors holding cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Neill reaffirmed his view that Russian stocks are cheap,
on the same day the nation&#8217;s Micex Index (INDEXCF) slid to a five-month
low on falling commodity prices. He also said that a global
stock rally &#8220;could start in China.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His positive comments on the outlook for China came as two
people with knowledge of the matter said Goldman Sachs plans to
set up a yuan-denominated private equity fund in the nation.
Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein attended a ceremony
for Goldman Sachs in Beijing yesterday, the people said,
declining to be identified before an announcement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), which has settled a
third of the pending cases over its Prempro menopause drug, said
it set aside $772 million to resolve claims the medicine causes
breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials of New York-based Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission yesterday that the reserve provides &#8220;the
minimum expected costs to resolve all of the other outstanding&#8221;
lawsuits over its hormone-replacement drugs. The company didn&#8217;t
say how many cases would be settled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I see this as an effort to clean up a long-standing
litigation so they can go forward with their business plan,&#8221;
Les Funtleyder, a New York-based fund manager at Miller Tabak 
Co. in New York who holds Pfizer shares, said yesterday in a
phone interview. &#8220;This is probably a good thing for the
stock.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 6 million women took Prempro and related
menopause drugs to treat symptoms including hot flashes and mood
swings before a 2002 study highlighted their links to cancer.
Wyeth&#8217;s sales of the medicines, which are still on the market,
exceeded $2 billion before the release of the Women&#8217;s Health
Initiative, a study sponsored by the National Institutes of
Health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Premarin,
Wyeth&#8217;s estrogen-based drug, with progestin-laden Provera, made
by Pfizer&#8217;s Upjohn unit, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth
combined the two hormones in its Prempro pill. Pfizer completed
its $68 billion purchase of Wyeth in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10,000 Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the height of the litigation, Pfizer faced more than
10,000 claims that its menopause drugs caused breast cancer,
according to lawyers for former users. Those cases included more
than 8,000 cases consolidated in federal court in Arkansas and
other cases in state courts in Pennsylvania, Nevada and
Minnesota. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s announcement that it had resolved a third of
the cases over its menopause drugs means Pfizer has settled more
than 3,300 cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The decision to settle cases reflects a business decision
by the company to avoid the cost and distraction of prolonged
litigation,&#8221; Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said in an
e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased to see Pfizer finally accept
responsibility for the injuries this drug caused to women and
hope the company will compensate each woman fairly and
reasonably,&#8221; Zoe Littlepage, a Houston, Texas-based lawyer who
serves as lead counsel for ex-Prempro users in the consolidated
Arkansas cases, said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News reported in February that Pfizer had agreed
to pay about $330 million to resolve 2,200 cases over the
menopause drugs, according to people familiar with the accords.
Those settlements provided average payouts of about $150,000 per
woman, the people said. Pfizer officials disputed those numbers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Litigation Record &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth and Upjohn units have lost eight of the 15
Prempro cases decided by juries since trials began in 2006. The
drugmaker got some of the verdicts thrown out after trial or had
the awards cut. The company has appealed its losses. Wyeth also
has won dismissals of more than 3,000 cases prior to trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, a jury in Puerto Rico ordered Wyeth to pay
$1.5 million in damages to a pharmacist who developed breast
cancer after taking Prempro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s regulatory filing was reported earlier by the Wall
Street Journal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consolidated case in Arkansas is In Re Prempro
Products, 03-CV-015070-WRW, U.S. District Court, Eastern
District of Arkansas (Little Rock). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) expects global
energy demand to increase 35 percent by 2030 compared with 2005
and demand in the Middle East to climb 85 percent during the
period as electricity needs rise to match population gains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Oil, natural gas and coal will continue to meet most of
the world&#8217;s needs during this period because no other energy
sources can match their availability, versatility, affordability
and scale,&#8221; said Rob Gardner, manager for the energy and
economics division of Exxon Mobil&#8217;s Corporate Strategic Planning
department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power generation will represent 55 percent of the total
growth in demand and in 2030 will account for about 40 percent
of total primary energy consumption, Gardner said today at a
seminar in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The key role oil and natural gas plays in the global
energy outlook for decades to come underlines the importance of
the Middle East region as a major supplier in meeting the
world&#8217;s needs,&#8221; Gardner said, while discussing his company&#8217;s
outlook for energy to the year 2030. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Exxon&#8217;s outlook, efforts to secure reliable
and affordable energy, while limiting greenhouse gas pollution,
will lead to many countries putting a cost on carbon dioxide
emissions. As a result, natural gas will become increasingly
competitive as a source of power generation as its use results
in less CO2 releases than other energy sources, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of producing one metric ton of carbon dioxide will
reach about $60 in Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development nations over the coming years if strict policies
were applied, said Gardner, who is responsible of producing the
company&#8217;s thirty years outlook. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) shut dock
operations at its refinery in Baton Rouge as the Mississippi
River rose, Kevin Allexon, a company spokesman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery, located on the banks of the river, continues
to operate and produce products, Allexon, who is based in
Fairfax, Virginia said in an e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have no plans to shut down the complex at this time,&#8221;
Allexon said. &#8220;We will, of course, continue monitoring river
conditions and will make operational adjustments as conditions
require.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For weeks, the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, swollen by
heavy rain and melted snow, have been inundating cities and
towns, flooding cropland and disrupting shipping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Baton Rouge plant, second-largest in the U.S. after
Exxon&#8217;s refinery in Baytown, Texas, can process 525,000 barrels
of oil a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Baton Rouge refinery processes domestic crudes from
Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi and Alaska, according to the
company&#8217;s website. It also imports crude from Mexico, the North
Sea, West Africa, South America, Central America and the Arabian

&lt;p&gt;Azentus Capital Management Ltd., a
hedge fund run by a former global head of Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS)&#8217;s principal strategies proprietary trading, may manage
about $1.8 billion by June 1, said three people with knowledge
of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azentus started trading on April 1 after raising $1.06
billion, the most by an Asia-based hedge fund startup since at
least 2007, said the people, who declined to be identified
because the information is private. The Hong Kong-based fund,
which oversees almost $1.4 billion currently, returned 0.3
percent last month, two of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors are singling out proprietary traders like Morgan
Sze, Azentus&#8217;s chief investment officer, who left banks to start
their own hedge funds as the U.S. brought in the Dodd-Frank Act,
which restricts banks from making bets with their own money, in
the wake of the worst financial crisis since the 1930s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estimate for the fund&#8217;s June assets takes into account
subscription requests received or expected and performance, said
the people. Roger Denby-Jones, Azentus chief operating officer,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a decent level of demand for Asian hedge funds
from western investors,&#8221; said Frederick Ingham, Neuberger
Berman Group LLC&#8217;s Hong Kong-based head of hedge-fund
investments in the Asia-Pacific region. &#8220;As many of these
investors do not have due diligence staff on the ground in Asia,
they tend to feel more comfortable investing in larger funds run
by managers from globally recognized backgrounds.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GSPS Investments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ingham, which declined to comment on Azentus specifically,
said the limited number of large funds in Asia has exacerbated
this effect. Twenty-nine Asia-based hedge funds started in 2010
with on average $15 million at the end of March, according
Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Principal Strategies, known as GSPS, at its
peak oversaw $3 billion of investments in Asia, people with
knowledge of the matter said in March. It ran strategies
including event-driven, capital structure and convertible bond
arbitrage, distressed assets, volatility trading, private
securities and equity long/short, they added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azentus, a global hedge fund, would be 75 percent invested
in Asia, two people with knowledge of the matter said in
December. It employs similar strategies to GSPS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 1,055 Asia-focused hedge funds at the end of
March managing $88.2 billion of assets, or less than $84 million
each, according to data from Hedge Fund Research. That compared
with industry assets of $2 trillion in the hands of 7,285 funds,
or $277 million each. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sze, Flamand &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sze, 45, was jointly responsible for the GSPS team with
Pierre-Henri Flamand from 2008, focusing on Asian investments,
the people said. He led the group alone when the latter left in
March 2010 to start his own hedge fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flamand&#8217;s Edoma Partners LLP has raised almost $2 billion
from investors, two people with knowledge of the firm told
Bloomberg last month. The London-based event-driven hedge fund
investing in companies going through mergers, bankruptcies and
other corporate events gained about 0.2 percent in the first
three months of this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sze&#8217;s GSPS team returned 19 percent a year since 2002, his
first full year with the proprietary trading desk, the two
people said in March. It dropped 8 percent in 2008, its only
annual loss, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dinakar Singh, a former head of the principal strategies
group, co-founded TPG-Axon in 2004. Eric Mindich started New
York-based Eton Park Capital Management LP with $3 billion with
former principal-strategies department co-head Erland Karlsson
the same year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highfields Capital Management LP, the
$12 billion hedge fund started by Richard Grubman and Jonathon Jacobson, cut its stake in JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) 30 percent in
the first quarter and boosted its holdings in Citigroup Inc. by
16 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highfields held 9.9 million shares of New York-based
JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. bank, as of March 31, compared
with 14.3 million at the end of last year, the Boston-based firm
said today in a regulatory filing. Highfields increased its
stake in New York-based Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank,
to 25.6 million shares in the first quarter from 22 million at
year-end, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the quarter, the investment firm added a stake
valued, as of March 31, at $27.3 million in New York-based
Morgan Stanley (MS) and $4.9 million in Hudson City Bancorp Inc. (HCBK), the
lender based in Paramus, New Jersey, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerging-market stocks fell, sending
the benchmark index to an eight-week low, as concern over
Greece&#8217;s debt crisis deepened, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lowered
its rating on South Korean shares, and oil dropped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Emerging Markets Index retreated 0.7 percent to
1,136.66 as of 5:17 p.m. New York time, the lowest close since
March 24. South Korea&#8217;s Kospi Index (KOSPI) slipped 0.8 percent to its
lowest since April 12 and the Shanghai Composite Index dropped
0.8 percent. Russia&#8217;s Micex Index slid 0.6 percent as oil fell
in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging-market stocks dropped for a fourth day on concern
the European debt crisis and China&#8217;s efforts to curb inflation
will slow global growth. European finance chiefs endorsed a 78
billion-euro ($111 billion) bailout for Portugal in Brussels
today as they stepped up pressure on Greece to do more to win
improved aid terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As far as the peripheral European debt issue is
concerned, it&#8217;s a lot more challenging to resolve because it
involves politics as well as economics,&#8221; said Khiem Do, Hong
Kong-based head of Asian multi-asset strategy at Baring Asset
Management (Asia) Ltd., which oversees about $10 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Finance ministers said the role of International
Monetary Fund as the contributor of a third of the bailout money
for Greece, Ireland and Portugal won&#8217;t be hampered by the arrest
of the IMF&#8217;s Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn May 14 on
sexual-assault charges in New York. Europe&#8217;s donor countries
tied extra money for Greece to pledges that it deepen spending
cuts and reap more revenue from asset sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil Slides &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concern over aid for Greece, coupled with speculation U.S.
fuel demand may be slowing, sent oil falling for the first time
in three days. It lost 2.3 percent to $96.37 a barrel on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. OAO Gazprom, the world&#8217;s biggest
natural gas exporter, slid for the fourth day in a row, losing
1.6 percent in Moscow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4), Brazil&#8217;s state-controlled oil
company, overcame the drop in oil and advanced 1.8 percent after
posting first-quarter profit of 10.99 billion reais ($6.72
billion), beating analysts&#8217; estimates. Brazil&#8217;s Bovespa index
declined 0.6 percent as most stocks fell on speculation policy
makers will lift interest rates for longer than expected to curb
inflation, offsetting an increase in first-quarter earnings.
Mexico&#8217;s IPC index advanced 0.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper for three-month delivery added 0.2 percent in New
York. Grupo Mexico SAB, the country&#8217;s largest mining company,
climbed 1.3 percent. The real strengthened the most among Latin
American currencies tracked by Bloomberg, rising 0.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korean Stocks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korean stocks were downgraded at Goldman Sachs amid
concern inflation isn&#8217;t abating and the global economy is
slowing. The brokerage also reduced its recommendation for
Japanese stocks to &#8220;underweight,&#8221; citing &#8220;greater
cautiousness on U.S. growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dongkuk Steel Mill Co., South Korea&#8217;s third-largest
steelmaker, plunged 9.4 percent, the steepest decline since Jan.
15, 2009. The company was cut to &#8220;sell&#8221; from &#8220;neutral&#8221; at
Goldman Sachs, which said its earnings growth may slow. Samsung
Electronics Co. retreated 1.6 percent after a U.S. trade panel
ruled Whirlpool Corp., the world&#8217;s largest appliance maker, is
being harmed by low-cost refrigerators from Mexico and South
Korea, paving the way for tariffs on those imports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money-Market Rates &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Shanghai, Industrial  Commercial Bank of China (601398) Ltd.,
the world&#8217;s biggest bank by market value, dropped 1.5 percent
after money-market rates jumped the most in three months.
China&#8217;s money-market rate rose on speculation a surge in banks&#8217;
reserve ratios to a record will lead to a cash squeeze in the
financial system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
decreased 1 percent after the commerce ministry reported that
the wholesale-price index rose 8.66 percent in April, exceeding
the 8.5 percent median forecast in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to own emerging-market
debt over U.S. Treasuries was little changed at 3.02 percentage
points, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s EMBI Global Index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is rolling out an
expansion to features on its Bing search engine that display
data from Facebook Inc., such as restaurants, brands and links
friends have recommended, aiming to make results more social. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is broadening the scope of a tool that lets
users who are searching for a restaurant, movie or news story
see if their friends have &#8220;liked&#8221; it on Facebook, the world&#8217;s
most popular social network. Searches for places will list
friends who live nearby, while looking for www.amazon.com shows
Amazon items &#8220;liked&#8221; by friends, as well as popular items
among the Facebook community, said Sean Suchter, general manager
of Microsoft&#8217;s Search Technology Center in Silicon Valley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since overhauling its search engine and releasing Bing in
June 2009, Microsoft has built the product into a credible
alternative to Google. Including traffic from a search agreement
with Yahoo! Inc., Bing now underpins about 30 percent of
searches in the U.S., according to ComScore Inc. With Google
still dominating, Microsoft is pushing forward with improvements
like social search as a way to gain more share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not going to be something that overnight changes
people to Bing,&#8221; said Danny Sullivan, who runs the search-
analysis website Search Engine Land. He said Microsoft has
already rolled out some social features since signing an
agreement with Facebook in October. &#8220;The social evolution is
important and it is growing. It&#8217;s going to be an interesting
thing, but it&#8217;s not going to blow the doors off.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft fell 46 cents to $24.57 at 4 p.m. New York time
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares have declined 12 percent
this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare With Friends &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bing&#8217;s travel site will add features to let customers
compare trips with Facebook friends and get their suggestions.
If a user likes a city on Bing Travel, Bing will send flight
deals to the user&#8217;s Facebook feed. The Bing search tool bar will
now include a &#8220;like&#8221; button to let users recommend any site
they visit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft already lets users
&#8220;friend&#8221; someone on Facebook from within search results and
shows searchers things their friends have liked. The company
this week is boosting how much Facebook data Bing scans, meaning
users will see more of these kinds of social results. The
features won&#8217;t show users information from friends who have set
up their Facebook accounts to be private, Suchter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To promote the social options, Microsoft will sponsor the
Los Angeles and New York premieres of the movie &#8220;Hangover 2.&#8221;
The company announced the expansion in a blog post today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online &#8216;Packs&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information on friends&#8217; recommendations can make searches
more useful and help get customers comfortable with researching
and purchasing online, said Chad Stoller, executive vice
president of digital strategy at advertising agency BBDO North
America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a reason teenage girls shop in packs in the
mall,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Anything that can give people greater
confidence shopping online is a good thing, and social search
can give people that level of confidence.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having the Facebook data gives Microsoft an advantage over
Google, Stoller said. If search engines don&#8217;t combine social
data, they could lose one to three searches a day per customer,
because users who are spending more time on social networks like
Facebook will get links and references there and have less need
for search engines, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is going to be the next big thing,&#8221; said Suchter,
who previously ran Yahoo&#8217;s search technology team before joining
Microsoft in December 2008. &#8220;This is one of those big sea
changes. We can make it where really your friends are always
with you.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, Twitter &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suchter declined to say whether the deal with Facebook is
exclusive. He said he expects Google to try to match the
Microsoft offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, based in Mountain View, California, uses Twitter
data to provide searchers information on what their friends have
shared. That feature is only available to people who use
Google&#8217;s Social Circles product, while Microsoft is showing
these search results more broadly, Search Engine Land&#8217;s Sullivan
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suchter, who has worked in the Internet search area since
1998, oversees a team of about 130 search experts housed at
Microsoft&#8217;s Mountain View campus. The team has largely been
drawn from rivals over the past two years -- when Suchter
started at Microsoft, he was the only one, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To build the product, Suchter said his team worked long
hours with Facebook engineers. Suchter said he&#8217;s done late night
software-coding sessions at their offices, and Facebook co-
founder Mark Zuckerberg did the same at Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suchter also has to make Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates
happy. Search is one of a handful of areas Gates continues to
work on since leaving his day-to-day role, and Suchter had his
first review of the social features with Gates several weeks
ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is an agenda for us,&#8221; Suchter said. &#8220;It&#8217;s much
bigger than what we are doing here.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
plans to open 10 new offices in Africa, bringing its total
locations on the continent to 35 by 2015 as it starts operations
in Senegal, Tanzania and Angola. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Africa today is the new market for IBM,&#8221; said Mamadou
Ndiaye, director general of IBM Senegal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has invested $300 million in new Africa
operations since 2006, he said in an interview in Dakar May 13.
By 2015, the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider expects
to operate in at least 23 countries on the continent, said Gary
Carroll, IBM&#8217;s general manager of Africa Geo-Expansion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, based in Armonk, New York, also wants to tap into
Africa&#8217;s growing mobile-banking market by working with
telecommunications companies on the continent, as it expects
spending on information technology to expand 47 percent to $12.5
billion by 2015, according to a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Senegal, IBM is vying for contracts to improve
management of the nation&#8217;s energy grid, said Ndiaye. It
currently runs a customs-collection monitoring system at
Senegal&#8217;s borders, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM fell 64 cents to $169.28 at 2:21 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares had climbed 16 percent
this year before today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) bolstered
the leadership of its investment-banking and merger-advisory
divisions after the company fell to third place among takeover
advisers this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard J. Gnodde, a 51-year-old South African based in
London, will become co-head of investment banking with David M. Solomon and John S. Weinberg, the division&#8217;s two New York-based
leaders, according to an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg.
Gordon E. Dyal, 49, will give up his role as global head of
mergers and acquisitions to become co-chairman of investment
banking with Christopher A. Cole, the memo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment banking, which includes mergers and acquisitions
and stock and bond underwriting, generated $1.27 billion in
first-quarter revenue, less than 11 percent of the New York-
based firm&#8217;s total. The bank lagged behind JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
and Morgan Stanley in advisory revenue during the quarter, the
first time in a decade that Goldman Sachs&#8217;s earnings press
release didn&#8217;t mention the company&#8217;s ranking among MA advisers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s just an effort to refocus on the business,&#8221; said
Benjamin B. Wallace, an analyst at Westborough, Massachusetts-
based Grimes  Co., which manages about $1 billion and doesn&#8217;t
own Goldman Sachs stock. &#8220;They fell in the rankings and they&#8217;re
going to have to get more out of that business because their
other divisions are becoming less lucrative.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading Revenue &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from trading, the firm&#8217;s biggest source of profit,
dropped 22 percent in the first quarter compared with a year
earlier, after sliding 33 percent last year from 2009. Goldman
Sachs, the top adviser on announced MA transactions from 2001
through 2008, dropped to third place this year after coming in
second to Morgan Stanley in 2009 and 2010, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dyal will turn over his global MA responsibilities to
London-based Yoel Zaoui and Gene T. Sykes, based in Los Angeles,
according to a separate memo. Andrea Rachman, a spokeswoman for
the New York-based firm, confirmed the memos&#8217; contents and
declined to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gnodde will continue to serve as co-chief executive officer
of Goldman Sachs International, the firm&#8217;s business in Europe,
the Middle East and Africa, along with Michael S. Sherwood.
Gnodde, who joined Goldman Sachs in 1987, moved to London in
2005 after serving as co-head of investment banking in Japan and
working in Hong Kong as president of Goldman Sachs Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These important changes reflect the continued importance
and growth of the firm&#8217;s global client franchise,&#8221; said the
memo, which was signed by Chairman and CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein,
56, and by President and Chief Operating Officer Gary D. Cohn,
50. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European MA &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank, hired Dyal from
Morgan Stanley as a partner in 1998. He was co-head of European
mergers and acquisitions from 1999 to 2001. In 2001 he became
co-head of investment banking in Europe, and in 2004 assumed his
role as global head of MA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zaoui, 50, and Sykes, 53, will be global co-heads of
mergers and acquisitions, where they will work closely with
Timothy J. Ingrassia and Jack Levy, the MA division&#8217;s co-
chairmen, the memo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zaoui, who joined in New York in 1988 before moving to
London in 1989, became co-head of European MA in 1999 and rose
to head of European investment banking in 2004, the memo said.
Zaoui became a managing director in 1997 and a partner in 1998.
Zaoui, like Gnodde, Solomon, Weinberg, Dyal and Cole, is a
member of the firm&#8217;s management committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Media, Telecommunications &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sykes, who joined the MA department in New York in 1984
and moved to Los Angeles in 1987, was co-chairman of global MA
and continues to serve as chairman of global technology, media
and telecommunications investment banking. He became a partner
in 1992 and is a member of the client and business standards
committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Yoel and Gene bring international experience, strong
sector knowledge and deep client relationships to the mergers
leadership team,&#8221; said the memo, signed by Gnodde, Solomon and
Weinberg. They will &#8220;position the firm to continue to provide
seamless coverage to clients who increasingly operate as cross-
border institutions, seeking advice and execution expertise in
every region.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is leading banks
marketing $2.9 billion of bonds backed by commercial mortgages
as relative yields narrow amid investor demand for debt tied to
skyscrapers, offices and shopping centers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan deal consists of 42 loans on 84 properties,
said a person with knowledge of the transaction who declined to
be identified because terms aren&#8217;t public. Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) and
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) are also selling $1.45 billion
of bonds linked to office, mall and hotel loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The securities, which may be sold as soon as next week, are
being offered as issuance in the $700 billion market
accelerates. Banks have arranged $8.6 billion of commercial-
mortgage bonds this year, compared with $11.5 billion in all of
2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales may reach
$45 billion in 2011, according to JPMorgan, as investors seek
out higher-yielding assets with the Federal Reserve holding its
benchmark interest rate at record lows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect demand to remain strong, and upcoming deals to
be generally well-received,&#8221; New York-based JPMorgan analysts
led by Ed Reardon wrote in a May 13 report. About $4.5 billion
of new offerings are in the pipeline for the next two weeks, the
analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to hold top-rated
securities linked to commercial real estate has declined to 187
basis points, or 1.87 percentage points, more than Treasuries,
from 228 basis points at yearend, according to a Barclays Plc
index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Largest Loan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money managers are turning to commercial mortgage debt as
relative yields on investment-grade corporate debt declined 17
basis points to 149 basis points since Dec. 31, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. Spreads last month
declined to 145 basis points, the smallest gap since October
2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;New issue CMBS offer attractive all-in-returns when
compared to similarly-rated, duration-matched alternatives,&#8221;
the JPMorgan analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest loan in the JPMorgan deal is a $199.8 million
mortgage on the Newport Centre, a 1.5 million square-foot mall
in Jersey City, New Jersey. Macy&#8217;s is the largest tenant,
occupying 229,889 square-feet. Retail properties account for
41.1 percent of the pool, while office buildings make up 35.6
percent, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riskiest Slice &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offering by San Francisco-based Wells Fargo and
Edinburgh-based RBS consists of 73 loans on 144 properties, said
a separate person, who also declined to be identified because
the sale isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Torchlight Investors purchased the riskiest slice of the
JPMorgan pool, according to deal documents. Selling the so-
called B-pieces is a prerequisite for marketing the rest of the
deal. The pool of B-piece buyers is growing amid surging sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock Inc., Rialto Capital Management LLC and H/2
Capital Partners dominated the market for so-called B-pieces in
2010. Investors in this portion of commercial-mortgage backed
securities can kick out certain loans from the pool if they deem
them too risky, thereby policing underwriting standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of commercial mortgage-backed securities are a boon
for property owners that have struggled to refinance maturing
loans amid a dearth of new lending. Sales plummeted to $3.4
billion in 2009, choking off funding to borrowers with maturing
loans, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A record $234
billion of the debt was issued in 2007, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard Gnodde, co-chief executive
officer of Goldman Sachs International, comments on competition
in financial markets. He spoke at a Cass Business School panel
discussion in London today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is very clear that we are all trying to get to the
same place. Our view of the liberalized markets is really based
on the idea of free competition and not on deregulation. I think
it&#8217;s very important to reinforce this message, and it has been
well covered this morning.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The openness of financial markets globally will clearly
go into reverse if the view becomes entrenched that opening your
market for financial services implies weaker supervision. It
clearly doesn&#8217;t.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Clearly, there has been a huge discussion over the last
number of years and the debate about the role of government and
regulation in the markets. It is critical we learn the right
lessons from the banking crisis and most importantly we
establish a framework which ensures that the cost of a future
crisis will fall where it belongs and that is on the
institutions who fail, their shareholders and not on the
taxpayer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rambus Inc. (RMBS) fell the most since 2009
on May 13 after a U.S. appeals court agreed that the company
destroyed documents relevant to separate patent infringement
trials with Micron Technology Inc. and Hynix Semiconductor Inc. (000660)
and sent the cases back to a lower court to determine
appropriate sanctions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A five-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit in Washington vacated lower court rulings in the
two cases, which centered on whether Sunnyvale, California-based
Rambus should be allowed to enforce patents on computer-memory
chips although it destroyed potential evidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision prolongs legal disputes that date back to 2000
for Rambus, a chip designer that has been suing companies that
refuse to license its technology. The appeals court decision
forces the judge in the Micron trial to reconsider the degree to
which Rambus acted in bad faith and it throws out a $397 million
judgment against Hynix so the court in that case can also
revisit the document-destruction issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Vacating awards or being convicted of spoliation is not
anything anyone wants put out in the financial press,&#8221; said
Jeff Schreiner, a Capstone Investments Inc. analyst in San
Diego. &#8220;In the end, though, nothing has taken Rambus off the
patent train express, nothing has derailed Rambus&#8217;s ability to
collect on these patents.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rambus fell $3.44, or 18 percent, to $15.83 at 4:05 p.m.
New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading May 13, the biggest
percentage drop at the close since January 2009. Schreiner has a
$45 target and a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on the shares and doesn&#8217;t own
them. Micron fell 2.4 percent to $10.40. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are very disappointed with the decisions in these
cases,&#8221; Thomas Lavelle, Rambus&#8217;s general counsel, said in an e-
mailed statement. &#8220;We are hopeful when the district courts
reconsider these decisions, they will find, as we believe, there
was no bad faith and no prejudice.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our view is that the district court truly believed that
Rambus acted in bad faith and with sufficient prejudice,&#8221; Matt Powers, a lawyer at Weil, Gotshal  Manges LLP who represents
Boise, Idaho-based Micron, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;That
is the result that should happen and will happen.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives from Ichon, South Korea-based Hynix
declined to immediately comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals are Micron Technology v. Rambus, 2009-1263, and
Hynix Semiconductor v. Rambus, 2009-1299, U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit (Washington). The lower-court cases are
Micron Technology Inc. (MU) v. Rambus Inc., 00-cv-00792, U.S.
District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington) and Hynix
Semiconductor Inc. v. Rambus Inc., 00-cv-20905, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of California (San Jose). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jury Orders SAP to Pay $345 million for Patent Infringement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAP AG (SAP), the world&#8217;s largest maker of business-applications
software, was told by a jury on May 13 to pay $345 million for
infringing a Versata Software Inc. patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal jury in Marshall, Texas, found that SAP owed
closely held Versata compensation for sales of certain SAP
enterprise and customer relationship-management software sold
prior to May 2010. The jury awarded $260 million for lost
profits and $85 million as a reasonable royalty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The damages are more than the $138.6 million SAP was
ordered to pay Austin, Texas-based Versata in a 2009 verdict
that was thrown out. U.S. Magistrate Judge Charles Everingham
had ordered a new trial because of rulings by an appeals court
specializing in patent law that set new rules on how financial
penalties should be calculated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent covers software that can help sales staff
determine the most recent price for products and services.
Walldorf, Germany-based SAP told jurors that customers weren&#8217;t
buying its software for that feature, so any patent royalties
should be low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Versata will seek an injunction to stop the infringement,
Scott Cole, a lawyer with McKool Smith who represented the
Austin, Texas-based company, said following the verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This has been four hard fought years, and the evidence
clearly shows that SAP&#8217;s use of our intellectual property caused
harm,&#8221; Cole said. &#8220;It was a valuable invention.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAP said it&#8217;s disappointed with the judgment and is
considering whether to appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have said all along this is a very complex case,&#8221;
Andy Kendzie, a company spokesman, said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;Our attorneys are reviewing today&#8217;s filing and we
will consider all legal options.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAP argued in court papers before the trial that Versata
shouldn&#8217;t have been able to claim that it lost profit because
the company hadn&#8217;t sold any of the software, called Pricer.
Versata claimed it was undercut by SAP and pushed out of the
market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Versata Software Inc. v. SAP America Inc.,
07cv153, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas
(Marshall). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva, Mylan, Anchen Win Patent Ruling Over Amrix Infringement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA), Mylan Inc. and Anchen
Pharmaceuticals Inc. won a case involving their planned generic
version of the muscle-relaxant Amrix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cephalon Inc. (CEPH) and Eurand NV (EURX) sued for patent-infringement in
2008 in federal court in Delaware. U.S. District Judge Sue
Robinson on May 11 decided that the patents aren&#8217;t valid because
the technology would be obvious to a skilled chemist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Cephalon is reviewing the court&#8217;s opinion and is
evaluating its options, including an appeal,&#8221; the company said
May 13 in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva, the world&#8217;s largest generic-drug maker, said on May 2
it agreed to buy Cephalon for about $6.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cephalon and Eurand filed the lawsuit after the generic
drugmakers applied to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for
permission to make low-cost copies of Amrix. The companies had
conceded that their version of the formula infringed and claimed
the patents weren&#8217;t valid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Cyclobenzaprine Hydrochloride Patent
Litigation, 09-2118, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware
(Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3M, Andover Healthcare Settle Patent Suit Over CoFlex &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3M Co. (MMM) said it settled its patent-infringement lawsuit over
Andover Healthcare Inc.&#8217;s CoFlex compression system for treating
leg ulcers and other wounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement prevents Andover from selling its system,
St. Paul, Minnesota-based 3M said in a statement May 13. Other
terms weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A representative from Andover Healthcare didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, Nokia Challenge Apple&#8217;s &#8216;App Store&#8217; EU Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) are among four technology
companies challenging Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s European Union-wide
trademarks for &#8220;Appstore&#8221; and &#8220;App Store.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia, the world&#8217;s largest mobile-phone maker, Microsoft,
Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB and HTC Corp. (2498) all filed
separate requests May 12 with the EU trademark agency in
Alicante, Spain, seeking to invalidate Apple&#8217;s trademark rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies &#8220;are seeking to invalidate Apple&#8217;s trademark
registration for &#8216;APP STORE&#8217; and &#8216;APPSTORE&#8217; because we believe
that they should not have been granted because they both lack
distinctiveness,&#8221; according to a statement from Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decision by the agency could be appealed all the way to
the EU&#8217;s top court in Luxembourg. Apple, which pioneered the
sale of mobile-device applications, accounts for more than
three-quarters of revenue in the industry -- even as Google
Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s app sales grow faster. Apple&#8217;s App Store offers more than
350,000 apps for iPhones, iPods and iPads. It will bring in
$2.91 billion in revenue in 2011, up 63 percent from last year,
according to researchers at El Segundo, California-based IHS
ISuppli. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) on April 15 opposed Apple&#8217;s two EU
trademarks, according to documents on the trademark agency&#8217;s
website. The dispute over the validity of the Apple rights has
also reached the U.S., where Amazon, after being sued for
trademark infringement by Apple, argued the intellectual
property right was invalid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Hely, a U.K.-based spokesman for Cupertino,
California-based Apple, declined to comment, saying the company
doesn&#8217;t comment on pending litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Durrant, a spokesman for Espoo, Finland-based Nokia,
and Sony Ericsson spokeswoman Mandy Slater confirmed the
companies also objected to the trademark registration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase &#8220;means just what it says, a store for &#8216;apps,&#8217;
which in itself is a generic term for the services that the
trademark registrations cover,&#8221; Durrant said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony Ericsson Says Trademark Litigation With Clearwire Resolved &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB and its U.S. unit
Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications Inc. reported on May 13 the
resolution of trademark litigation initiated against Clearwire
Corp. (CLWR) and its primary operating unit, Clearwire Communications
LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The litigation involved Sony Ericsson&#8217;s contention that
Clearwire was using logos which infringed Sony Ericsson&#8217;s
trademark. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Privacy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News Corp. (NWSA), Miller Agree to $162,000 Deal in Hacking Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actress Sienna Miller agreed to accept 100,000 pounds
($162,000) from News Corp. (NWS) to end her lawsuit against the
company&#8217;s News of the World newspaper, which hacked into her
voice mail to get scoops about her private life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Miller is proceeding in this way because all of her
claims have been admitted,&#8221; Hugh Tomlinson, her lawyer, said in
court May 13. The company had &#8220;capitulated&#8221; on May 11 by
admitting in court it used hacked voice mails to publish 11
stories about Miller in 2005 and 2006, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the deal, News Corp. will also disclose the relevant
contents from about 8,000 e-mails and possibly some journalists&#8217;
notebooks. Lawyers for the parties at a hearing in London May 13
agreed to draft a final order and present it to a judge as soon
as next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller, 29, and her former boyfriend, actor Jude Law, are
among more than 20 celebrities and politicians that sued Rupert
Murdoch&#8217;s News Corp. over the scandal that erupted more than
four years ago. Miller had sought as much as 400,000 pounds in
the case. The New York-based company last month apologized and
offered to settle some of the cases after journalists linked to
the paper were arrested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Silverleaf, the newspaper&#8217;s lawyer, declined to
comment on the deal May 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Sienna Miller v. Newsgroup Newspaper, No.
HC10C03458 High Court of Justice, Chancery Division. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KPN Method to Track Customer Traffic Investigated by Authorities &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal KPN NV, the largest Dutch phone company, is being
investigated by the country&#8217;s government and regulators over the
method it uses to analyze mobile-phone customers&#8217; data traffic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They are using a method that is very radical and we think
they should not have gone this far,&#8221; said Harriet Garvelink,
spokeswoman for Opta, the telecommunications regulator. Opta and
the Dutch privacy-protection authority together are looking into
whether KPN violates its customers&#8217; privacy, Garvelink said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KPN is using &#8220;deep packet inspection&#8221; as a method to
analyze data traffic of its mobile phone customers, enabling it
to track the use of Whatsapp, an application that allows people
to communicate via Internet on their mobile phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KPN, responding to newspaper reports about the practice,
said May 12 it is scanning customers&#8217; mobile data traffic. It
doesn&#8217;t look at the content of the messages, it said in a
statement on its website. KPN concluded after an internal
investigation that the use of deep packet inspection doesn&#8217;t
violate privacy laws, it said in a statement May 13. The company
said it will cooperate with regulators&#8217; investigations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s Nigerian unit
said it will work with the country&#8217;s government to resolve
&#8220;confusion&#8221; about the status of three oil leases following a
media report they have been canceled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil leases 67, 68 and 70, which together produce 580,000
barrels of crude a day, were nullified by Nigerian Petroleum
Minister Diezani Alison-Madueke in a March 4 letter to Exxon
Mobil, Lagos-based ThisDay newspaper reported today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil &#8220;will vigorously protect the rights it
acquired in 2009,&#8221; Gloria Essien-Danner, a company spokeswoman,
said in by e-mail today. &#8220;We will work with the Minister of
Petroleum Resources and other relevant government officials to
resolve any confusion that may exist on this matter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negotiations for 16 oil blocks operated by companies
including Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Chevron Corp.
have been under way for two years. Exxon Mobil was the only
energy company to have its licenses renewed when it signed a
deal in November 2009 covering oil leases 67, 68 and 70. Shell
and Chevron remain in talks with Nigeria on renewing their
expired oil licenses. China National Offshore Oil Corp. had
expressed an interest in taking over some of the permits,
raising concern they wouldn&#8217;t be renewed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigeria, Africa&#8217;s top oil producer, is the fifth-biggest
source of U.S. oil imports. Shell, Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Total
SA and Eni SpA run joint ventures with the state-owned Nigerian
National Petroleum Corp., which pumps about 90 percent of the
country&#8217;s crude. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is seeking
money to bankroll fledgling hedge funds, its second attempt
since 2008 to break into a business now dominated by Blackstone
Group LP (BX), according to three people with knowledge of the plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank has spent the past year trying to attract clients
for a seeding fund, which provides managers with startup
investing capital in exchange for a cut of their fees, said the
people, who asked not to be identified because the effort is
private. Blackstone recently raised $2.4 billion for its second
seeding fund, the industry&#8217;s biggest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reservoir Capital Group, Larch Lane Advisors LLC and
PineBridge Investments LLC also are marketing new funds, saying
it&#8217;s a good time to back startups because after the financial
crisis investors are reluctant to trust even talented traders
going out on their own. Goldman Sachs, based in New York, shut a
fund in 2008, underscoring that betting on new managers can be
tricky even for one of Wall Street&#8217;s savviest firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Seeding isn&#8217;t an easy-money business,&#8221; Alexis Graham,
co-founder of Acceleration Capital Group, a New York-based firm
that works with seed investors, said in a telephone interview.
&#8220;There are only a small percentage of people out there who can
consistently outperform, build a business and scale assets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s agreement to
purchase Skype Technologies SA for $8.5 billion may set a
precedent for higher acquisition premiums, lifting the cost of
other technology buyouts, an EMC Corp. executive said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The premium appears to be significant,&#8221; Mark Lewis,
chief strategy officer at EMC, said today at Bloomberg Link&#8217;s
Enterprise Technology Summit in New York. &#8220;If we go to do
acquisitions, there will be comparables. It&#8217;s like real estate
-- it&#8217;s all based on what&#8217;s sold. It&#8217;s a starting point.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price represented a 40 percent markup from what Skype
itself said the company was worth in an April regulatory filing.
Still, Robert Eatroff, managing director of investment banking
at Morgan Stanley (MS), said it&#8217;s too early to tell whether there is
a bubble in technology valuations. There is real growth in the
industry in areas such as mobile and cloud products that may be
legitimately driving up valuations, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have huge secular growth in data and analytics, cloud
and mobile,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Will some of these valuations look like
they&#8217;re bubbles? Time will tell, but there are real drivers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brett Shockley, senior vice president of corporate
development and strategy at Avaya Inc., also said the situation
doesn&#8217;t feel like the Internet bubble of 10 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will make multiple
versions of its next Windows operating system, with four that
work on ARM Holdings Plc (ARM) technology, according to an Intel Corp. (INTC)
executive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The version designed for Intel chips will run older Windows
programs, Renee James, head of Intel&#8217;s software business, said
today in a presentation at the company&#8217;s Santa Clara,
California, headquarters. The ARM versions won&#8217;t run older
programs, she said. They will be tailored to mobile devices and
tablet computers and there will also be a version for Intel
chips to address that market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, is scrambling to
introduce a version of Windows that does a better job of letting
computer makers build rivals to Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPad. Microsoft
said personal computer shipments to consumers fell last quarter
partially because customers switched from cheap netbooks to
tablet computers. That decline also was a factor in slumping
sales for Microsoft&#8217;s Windows unit in the quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website WinRumors reported last month that the company
appeared to be building multiple versions of the program for use
on ARM-based chips. &lt;/p&gt;

U.S. energy company, said it&#8217;s discussing potential &#8220;business
ventures&#8221; with Russian oil producer OAO Rosneft (ROSN) in that
country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron confirmed the talks a day after BP Plc (BP/)&#8217;s $7.8
billion share swap and Arctic exploration deal with Rosneft
collapsed amid opposition from billionaire partners in a
separate BP venture. Kurt Glaubitz, a Chevron spokesman,
declined to specify what prospects, assets or locations within
Russia are under discussion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron continues to work with Rosneft on opportunities
to collaborate in business ventures,&#8221; Glaubitz said today in a
telephone interview from Chevron&#8217;s San Ramon, California,
headquarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron signed an accord with Moscow-based Rosneft in June
2010 to explore for oil and natural gas in the Russian sector of
the Black Sea. The arrangement called for initial investments by
the partners of $1 billion to drill wells in the West
Chernomorsky block, Rosneft Chairman Igor Sechin said at the
time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eleven months later, the companies and the Russian
government have yet to come to an agreement on fiscal terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp., based in Irving, Texas, is the largest
U.S. energy company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s
chairman and chief executive officer, said he was sorry for
foreclosure mistakes as hundreds of protesters at the annual
meeting demanded he do more to help homeowners and small
businesses recover from the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any errors that were made, &#8220;we deeply apologize,&#8221;
Dimon, 55, said today at the shareholders&#8217; meeting in a 2-
million-square-foot office building in Columbus, Ohio. &#8220;We are
doing everything we can to keep people in their homes that
should stay in their homes.&#8221; Dimon said he especially regretted
the bank&#8217;s mistakes in foreclosing on active-duty military
personnel and for fumbling paperwork on other home seizures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and other large U.S. banks are feeling the
backlash from the housing bust, with mortgage losses and related
litigation suppressing earnings and regulators investigating
industry practices. The U.S. Justice Department is suing
Deutsche Bank AG for more than $1 billion, and has said it may
go after other lenders for filing false claims for federal
mortgage insurance on faulty loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s record $5.56 billion in profit during the first
quarter was tempered by &#8220;extraordinarily high losses we still
are bearing on mortgage-related issues,&#8221; Dimon said last month.
JPMorgan&#8217;s $17.4 billion in net income last year made it the
most profitable bank in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Everyone is hurting, it seems like, except for Wall
Street and its executives,&#8221; said Jordan Estevao, who helped
lead demonstrations outside the meeting for National People&#8217;s
Action, a non-profit consumer advocacy group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Arrest &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protest organizers said about 850 attended, while the bank
put the figure at 350. Attendees were screened at four security
check points to get into the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robin Acree, a 50-year-old community activist from Mexico,
Missouri, said police sprayed her with mace while she was
protesting outside the facility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;So many of our folks are getting screwed by these big
banks,&#8221; Acree said. &#8220;A lot of people are angry. I&#8217;m angry. We
see economic stress on our families, no jobs and foreclosures.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protesters shouted &#8220;No more diamonds for Dimon&#8221; and other
slogans, and one was arrested, according to the advocacy group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re not doing their part to aid a recovery,&#8221; Estevao
said in an interview yesterday. &#8220;Instead they are lining their
pockets. They&#8217;re making massive profits, still giving themselves
massive bonuses and doing too little to help spur recovery for
the rest of America.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourteen of the largest mortgage servicers, including
JPMorgan and Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the biggest U.S. bank by
assets, signed an agreement in April with the Federal Reserve,
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency to refund costs to homeowners for foreclosures that
were mishandled and to overhaul procedures for seizing homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan took a $1.1 billion charge in the first quarter
and may add as many as 3,000 employees to comply with the
consent decree. The Department of Housing and Urban Development,
Federal Housing Finance Agency and state attorneys general also
are investigating the industry&#8217;s foreclosure practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Counsel Stephen Cutler said at the meeting that the
bank&#8217;s litigation costs were higher than expected in &#8220;every
area.&#8221; He said expenses for outside legal advice last year were
more than $700 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan agreed in April to pay $56 million to settle
claims that it overcharged military personnel on their
mortgages. Dimon has previously apologized, saying the bank
erred in handling certain mortgages covered by the
Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Military Foreclosures &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cutler said the bank mistakenly foreclosed on 27 active-
duty military personnel who were protected by the law. JPMorgan
is &#8220;making amends on every single one of those&#8221; by either
paying off their mortgages or giving them their houses back for
free, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon said the military foreclosures were the worst mistake
the bank has ever made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We deeply apologize to the military, the veterans, anyone
who&#8217;s ever served this country and we&#8217;re trying to go way
beyond,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re sorry,&#8221; he added, drawing a round of
applause. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A shareholder proposal requiring the bank to adopt and
disclose uniform foreclosure policies failed with 6.4 percent of
the vote. None of the other investor proposals were approved
either, with one to allow shareholder action by written consent
winning the most support with 48.99 percent of the vote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors also re-elected JPMorgan&#8217;s board of directors and
reappointed PricewaterhouseCoopers as its auditor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkish stocks weakened after Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. turned more cautious on investing in the
country because of its current-account deficit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ISE National 100 Index (XU100) of equities lost 0.05 percent to
65,385.38 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Istanbul. Turkish stocks
have declined for eight of the last 10 days, leaving the gauge
with a loss of 0.9 percent so far in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current-account deficit more than doubled in March from
a year earlier to $9.8 billion, the central bank said May 11.
Since January, the central bank has held the benchmark one-week
repo rate at 6.25 percent. It has also raised the reserve ratio
on the shortest-term bank liabilities to 16 percent from 6
percent to rein in the consumer borrowing and spending that has
contributed to the deficit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Foreigners have scant interest in Turkish stocks and the
primary reason is that there is too much uncertainty,&#8221; Isik Okte, a trader at Finans Invest, said in e-mailed comments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing-nation stocks fell today, driving the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index down 0.3 percent toward the lowest
closing level in almost two months, as Greece sought more
bailout funds and investors speculated rising interest rates may
sap economic growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman added Turkiye Is Bankasi (ISCTR) AS, or Isbank, Eregli
Demir  Celik Fabrikalari TAS, or Erdemir, and Turkcell Iletisim
Hizmetleri AS, also known as Turkcell, to its  &#8220;focus sell&#8221;
list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Isbank and Turkcell, Turkey&#8217;s biggest mobile-
phone operator, lost 0.4 percent. Erdemir, the country&#8217;s largest
steelmaker, sank 1.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lira, Bonds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The latest disappointing current-account deficit has
reinforced our view that Turkey needs to tighten
significantly,&#8221; Goldman Sachs wrote in a research report dated
today. &#8220;Consensus earnings estimates and valuations still do
not reflect this.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lira gained 0.3 percent to 1.5879 per dollar,
strengthening for a second day. Two-year benchmark bond yields
decreased four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 8.82
percent, falling for the first day in three, according to the
TEB Local Benchmark Bond Index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAP AG (SAP), the world&#8217;s largest maker of
business management software, is cornering a 7.5 billion-euro
($11 billion) market for products that help companies increase
productivity while limiting the effect on the environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its annual Sapphire conference this week in Orlando,
Florida, SAP is showing how software that lets businesses
monitor and manage such things as their carbon footprints and
the number of employee sick-days can couple with new mobile and
data-analysis products to boost efficiency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAP&#8217;s sustainability software, used by about 1,700
customers, was one of the company&#8217;s fastest growing segments
last year, said Daniel Schmid, vice president of sustainability
operations. Large enterprises worldwide will spend as much as
$12 billion on software and hardware related to sustainability
this year alone, according to researcher Gartner Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;SAP is a good distance ahead of the field,&#8221; said Stephen
Stokes, managing vice president at Gartner. To compete with
International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), which incorporates both
software and hardware solutions in its Smarter Planet offer, SAP
will need to find business partners, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among customers that purchased SAP&#8217;s sustainability
software are Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI), the oilfield services provider,
Deere  Co., the largest maker of farm equipment, and De Beers,
the world&#8217;s biggest diamond-producer, according to the Walldorf,
Germany-based software company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McKinsey Study &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a sizeable business for us,&#8221; Peter Graf, SAP&#8217;s
chief sustainability officer, said in an interview in Orlando.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve just started, this is a young discipline.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sustainability software generated a three-digit million
euros amount in revenue for SAP last year, Schmid said. In a
joint study with McKinsey  Co. on the market, SAP predicted
that the addressable market for SAP&#8217;s solutions would be worth
as much as a total of 7.5 billion euros between 2009 and 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adrian Bowles, vice president and principal analyst at
Constellation Research Inc., recently analyzed software
offerings for energy and carbon management and named companies
like Hara Software Inc. and C3, founded by Thomas Siebel.
Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) has struck partnership deals with both. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have deep pockets to invest,&#8221; Graf said, citing SAP&#8217;s
acquisitions of Clear Standards, a carbon-management software
company and Technidata, which makes software helping companies
comply with environmental, health and safety regulations. &#8220;We
might acquire more companies in the future if we feel like speed
to market is essential.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The son of a former Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) executive, Jacob Lief emulated the fundraising
strategies of charities with Wall Street ties to help schools in
South Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He built a database of likely donors, such as hedge-fund
titan Stanley F. Druckenmiller, Nobel Peace Prize winner
Archbishop Desmond Tutu and fashion designer Donna Karan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His Ubuntu Education Fund has supported education and
health care for more than 24,000 poor, orphaned or abused
children in townships near Port Elizabeth in South Africa&#8217;s
Eastern Cape Province. It also helps with exam preparation,
career guidance and college scholarships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With daily interventions of medical, psycho-social,
educational and nutritional support, we take a child from
incredible hardship and get him through university,&#8221; said Lief,
Ubuntu&#8217;s president and co-founder, in an interview at Bloomberg
News headquarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, Karan is donating space for an Ubuntu fundraiser
co-hosted by actor Joaquin Phoenix and author Salman Rushdie at
her Urban Zen Foundation headquarters in Manhattan&#8217;s West
Village. Other guests include actors Liv Tyler and Marisa Tomei.
The hip-hop/neo-soul group The Roots will supply the music. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu&#8217;s New York gala in November drew 700 attendees and
raised a record $2 million for the charity. The South African-
American musician Dave Matthews performed before donors and
guests including Druckenmiller, Goldman Chief Financial Officer
David Viniar, actor Robert De Niro and New York Jets quarterback
Mark Sanchez. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Chalk &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lief was studying diplomatic history at the University of
Pennsylvania and planning on a business career when his goals
shifted during a 1998 visit to South Africa. He saw poor schools
that used abandoned shipping containers for classrooms. He
visited classrooms where the blackboards were blank because the
schools couldn&#8217;t afford chalk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to school, he tapped his credit cards and raised
$300 with a raffle to launch the Ubuntu Education Fund the
following year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My father was very supportive when I wanted to do this,&#8221;
Lief said about Daniel Lief, an Ubuntu advisory board member.
&#8220;People were very skeptical at first, but my dad said whatever
you do, just go into it 100 percent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Ubuntu raised $1.2 million at an event
in London where it has an office. The event&#8217;s co-hosts were Earl Charles Spencer, the brother of the late Princess of Wales, and
Richard Gnodde, the London-based co-chief executive officer of
Goldman&#8217;s European division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing Budget &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 12 years, the charity&#8217;s budget has grown to $6.2 million
from a few thousand dollars. Lief now oversees a staff of 80 in
London, New York and Ubuntu&#8217;s headquarters in Port Elizabeth,
South Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re not Robin Hood, and you&#8217;re not going to see your
name in lights,&#8221; said Lief, referring to the New York-based
poverty fighting foundation supported by many hedge-fund
executives. &#8220;We&#8217;re getting people who really care about this
cause.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The money raised tonight will be used to help Ubuntu&#8217;s
nutrition program for orphans and poor children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Ubuntu&#8217;s first Wall Street supporters early on was
Harvard Business School professor Robert S. Kaplan, a former
Goldman vice chairman who oversaw the investment banking and
investment management units. In the past two years ago, the
charity has lured more Goldman and finance industry donors, Lief
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What our donors like about us is that we run our own
program, we know where we&#8217;re spending the money and we&#8217;re not
giving it to another organization to hand out,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
look these people in the eye and I say, &#8216;I won&#8217;t let you down, I
want to make this work.&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Ubuntu Education Fund&#8217;s &#8220;A Spring Evening&#8221; event is
tonight at Urban Zen, 705 Greenwich St. in Manhattan, from 7 to

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said comments made by
an Intel Corp. (INTC) executive yesterday about future version of its
Windows operating system were &#8220;factually inaccurate and
unfortunately misleading.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renee James, head of Intel&#8217;s software business, said
yesterday that Microsoft is planning multiple versions of the
next Windows, with four that work on technology from ARM
Holdings Plc. (ARM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft didn&#8217;t specify what about Intel&#8217;s remarks wasn&#8217;t
correct. Mark Martin, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft, yesterday declined to comment when he was asked to
respond to Intel&#8217;s statements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have been clear about our goals and have emphasized
that we are at the technology demonstration stage,&#8221; Microsoft
said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;As such, we have no further
details or information at this time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel isn&#8217;t commenting further on the matter, said Suzy
Ramirez, a spokeswoman for the Santa Clara, California-based
company today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James said yesterday that the version designed for Intel
chips will run older Windows programs. The ARM versions won&#8217;t
run older programs, she said. They will be tailored to mobile
devices and tablet computers and there will also be a version
for Intel chips to address that market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, said a study showed that its experimental drug
axitinib was more effective in treating advanced kidney cancer
than Bayer AG (BAYN)&#8217;s Nexavar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a late-stage trial of 723 patients with advanced kidney
cancer who had received other treatments, patients who received
axitinib lived a median of 6.7 months before their tumors
progressed, compared with 4.7 months for patients who received
Nexavar, New York-based Pfizer said in a statement. The data is
being presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology on
June 6 and a summary of the study was released today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nexavar, known by its chemical name of sorafenib, is sold
by Bayer, based in Leverkusen, Germany, in collaboration with
Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ONXX) of South San Francisco, California.
The medicine, also approved for liver cancer, generated $935
million in 2010 sales, Bayer reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Pfizer announced in November 2010 that the trial was
successful, it didn&#8217;t release details at the time. The company
said today it is working with global regulators on filing for
approval for kidney cancer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senator Richard Blumenthal asked
Apple Inc. (AAPL), Google Inc. (GOOG) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) for information
about the companies&#8217; collection of data from private wireless
networks to create maps of Wi-Fi service, saying the practice
raises privacy concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who serves on the Senate
Judiciary Committee, made the request in a letter to the
companies that was released today by his office in Washington.
The letter also was sent to BlackBerry maker Research in Motion
Ltd. (RIM), handset manufacturer Nokia Oyj (NOK) and Skyhook Wireless Inc.,
a provider of wireless phone location services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Attempting to document the locations of personal wireless
networks in individuals&#8217; homes without their knowledge or
consent raises issues regarding what constitutes a reasonable
expectation of privacy for an ordinary citizen,&#8221; Blumenthal
said in the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blumenthal&#8217;s letter coincides with broader inquiries by
U.S. lawmakers into the privacy of customer location data
gathered from smartphones and other mobile devices. Apple,
Google and Facebook Inc. are due to face questions on mobile
privacy tomorrow in a Senate Commerce subcommittee hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple and Google, the makers of software used in millions
of smartphones, also may face tougher European Union
restrictions on the way they handle user-location data after an
opinion by European Union privacy officials published today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies Respond &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have received Senator Blumenthal&#8217;s letter and look
forward to answering his questions,&#8221; Jay Nancarrow, a Google
spokesman, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft spokeswoman Christina Pearson said the company
has received the letter and &#8220;will be working toward a
response.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple had no immediate comment, spokeswoman Kristin Huguet
said. Research in Motion and Nokia did not immediately respond
to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skyhook makes software that uses the location of wireless
routers and telecommunications towers to pinpoint the location
of a mobile phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think it&#8217;s an important set of questions and we&#8217;ll be
happy to talk about the data we collect and how,&#8221; Ted Morgan,
Skyhook founder and chief executive officer, said in an
interview at a conference today in Washington. &#8220;There are a lot
of answers already on our website.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Street View Inquiry &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Connecticut attorney general, Blumenthal led a 40-state
inquiry into Google&#8217;s gathering of data as part of its Street
View project to map neighborhoods worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google had vehicles drive through streets to take pictures
of buildings for its Street View product, which lets users click
on maps to see photographs of roadsides. Names and signal
strengths of nearby wireless routers also were collected for a
database that would help locate phones based on their proximity
to cell-phone towers and the wireless access points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google said it was unaware that the software gathering
information on the routers also was collecting data that
unsecured Wi-Fi networks were sending out. The company said that
it stopped the practice and notified authorities as soon as it
learned that the information was being collected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some instances, that data has been destroyed, while in
others it&#8217;s been preserved at the behest of investigative
authorities, Google has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Honestly Embarrassed&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have tried to be very clear it was not our policy to
collect this information,&#8221; Alan Davidson, director of public
policy for Google, said in response to questions from Blumenthal
at a May 10 Senate hearing. &#8220;We never used that information.
People at the company were quite surprised and honestly
embarrassed to find out that we had been collecting it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The senator highlighted Street View in his letter, saying
the &#8220;scandal may represent the most visible example in recent
years of a large technology company unequivocally violating the
privacy of third parties, but is surely not the first or last
such example.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blumenthal&#8217;s letter asked the technology companies a series
of questions, including whether they&#8217;ve &#8220;contemplated,
implemented or purchased&#8221; information gathered from wireless
data transmissions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world&#8217;s biggest
theme-park operator, issued $500 million of notes as it returns
to the bond market for the first time in more than two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borrowers from railroad Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC) to
Cincinnati-based Cintas Corp. (CTAS) are selling at least $8.05 billion
of bonds in the U.S. today, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales of $30.3 billion through yesterday are the most
to start a week since the two-day period ended March 22,
Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, ranked A2 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and A by
Standard  Poor&#8217;s, is taking advantage of the lowest borrowing
costs in more than six months. Yields on investment-grade
corporate bonds averaged 3.75 percent yesterday, compared with
3.65 percent on Nov. 11, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burbank, California-based Disney sold the 3.75 percent, 10-
year bonds at a yield of 60 basis points, or 0.6 percentage
point, more than similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data
show. Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc managed the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes,
according to a person with knowledge of the offering who
declined by identified because they weren&#8217;t authorized to
discuss the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its last offering in March 2009, Disney issued $500
million of 5.5 percent, 10-year notes that paid a spread of
262.5 basis points, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norfolk Southern sold $400 million of 6 percent, 100-year
bonds in its second sale of such debt in the past year,
Bloomberg data show. Cintas marketed $500 million of five- and
10-year notes in its first offering since 2007. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Higher doses of an Alzheimer&#8217;s drug
sold by Eisai Co. and Pfizer Inc. (PFE) endanger patients and don&#8217;t
enhance the treatment&#8217;s effectiveness, according to a consumer
group that wants the regimen banned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public Citizen of Washington petitioned the Food and Drug
Administration today to remove the 23 milligram dose of Aricept
to treat moderate to severe Alzheimer&#8217;s from the U.S. market.
The nonprofit organization has filed 34 petitions to ban drugs,
22 of which are off the market, said Sidney Wolfe, the director
of health research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators approved a 23 milligram dose in July, four
months before a patent on Aricept&#8217;s 10 milligram dose expired.
Patients taking the larger amount had more side effects than the
10 milligram level, including nausea, vomiting and
gastrointestinal bleeding, according to the companies&#8217; website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Eisai, Pfizer knew the patent was going to expire and
since it was the leading Alzheimer&#8217;s drug, they wanted to figure
out a way to retain their leading share,&#8221; Wolfe said. Users are
&#8220;getting something that&#8217;s gratuitously extra toxic,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many as 5.1 million Americans may have Alzheimer&#8217;s, the
most common form of dementia in older people, according to the
U.S. National Institutes of Health. While there&#8217;s no cure, drugs
such as Aricept can ease symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approval of the 23 milligram Aricept was based on data
from a study of more than 1,400 patients with moderate to severe
Alzheimer&#8217;s, said Raul Damas, a Pfizer spokesman. &#8220;It&#8217;s
important for caregivers to have regular conversations with the
patients&#8217; health-care provider to discuss any new behavior or
concerns and also reassess the patients&#8217; treatment,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prescriptions Decline &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Finucane, a professor in the gerontology and
geriatric medicine division at the Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine in Baltimore also signed the petition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aricept prescriptions fell to 91,000 in March from 914,000
after the patent expired, Public Citizen said. Aricept accounted
for $417 million of New York-based Pfizer&#8217;s sales last year and
$323 million of Tokyo-based Eisai&#8217;s sales, data Bloomberg
compiled show. Aricept is Eisai&#8217;s top-selling treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 23 milligram dose of Aricept showed improvement over
the 10 milligram amount on cognitive symptoms, though it didn&#8217;t
show improvement on overall patient functioning, the companies
said on the drug&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) said the Fukushima
nuclear disaster in Japan in March won&#8217;t affect the growth of
atomic power in the next 25 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuclear power will be unchanged at 8 percent of the total
energy mix in 2030 compared with 6 percent in 2005 as forecast
in the company&#8217;s annual energy outlook which was published in
early January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nuclear is going to be an important power generation fuel
for the future, it is a low carbon energy source and we believe
diversification of energy sources is important,&#8221; said Rob Gardner, manager for the energy and economics division of Exxon
Mobil&#8217;s Corporate Strategic Planning department, at a media
briefing in Dubai today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countries including the U.S., China and Germany are
reassessing their use of atomic power after a March 11
earthquake and tsunami destroyed power lines and flooded diesel
generators at Tokyo Electric Power Co.&#8217;s Fukushima Dai-Ichi
plant, depriving its cooling systems of electricity. Fuel rods
in four of the plant&#8217;s six reactor buildings overheated, causing
fires, explosions and radiation leaks in the world&#8217;s worst
nuclear incident since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilities in Britain don&#8217;t need to shut down or reduce
output at reactors after Fukushima, the U.K.&#8217;s chief inspector
of nuclear installations said. In an interim report, Mike
Weightman recommended 25 areas for review by mid-June, including
the layout of existing plants and emergency response. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil expects 19 percent of power to be generated by
nuclear energy by 2030 compared with 17 percent in 2005,
according to its outlook. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crude oil and gold will lead a rally
in commodities as production fails to keep pace with demand,
said Ray Eyles, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM)&#8217;s commodity business in Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil supply will trail consumption in the second half as the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other
producers won&#8217;t increase output fast enough, the bank said in a
report May 6. Rabobank Groep expects shortages in corn and
cotton this year while Barclays Capital is predicting deficits
in copper, nickel, tin, lead and platinum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ultimately, the long-term fundamental supply and demand
of commodities is still pointing to higher prices,&#8221; Eyles said
in an interview. &#8220;The commodities that have the best underlying
fundamental stories at the moment&#8221; are in energy because of
unrest in the Middle East and Japan&#8217;s nuclear crisis, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude has more than tripled since December 2008 and gold
doubled, with the Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI Index of 24 commodities
beating stocks, bonds and the dollar for five straight months
through April, the longest run in at least 14 years. That kept
global food costs near a record, prompting central banks from
Brasilia to Beijing to raise interest rates and helping spur
conflict and riots in the Middle East and North Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June-delivery oil traded at $98.56 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange today after the most active contract touched
$114.83 this month, the highest level since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supply Limited &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precious metals will benefit the most from a &#8220;strong
interest&#8221; in diversification and inflation and currency hedges,
he said May 16. &#8220;What people tend to underestimate is how
strong and how far the market can go when there is a limited
supply to match a very heavy demand,&#8221; he said. Gold stored in
the bank&#8217;s vault in Singapore is &#8220;rapidly increasing,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cash gold touched a record $1,577.57 an ounce on May 2 and
is up 5.2 percent this year after a 30 percent rally in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP GSCI Index slumped 11 percent in the first week of
May on signs of an economic slowdown after climbing 20 percent
through April and more than doubling since the start of 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the short-term, the macro landscape seems to have
taken a turn,&#8221; said Eyles, referring to signs of a slowing
global economy, China&#8217;s monetary tightening and the European
debt crisis. That&#8217;s weighing on industrial metals, he said.
Copper declined 6.7 percent this year on the London Metal
Exchange and zinc dropped 12 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investor Demand &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in reports on April 11 and April
15 told investors to be &#8220;underweight&#8221; commodities in the next
three to six months. The bank still expects commodities to
advance about 10 percent over the next 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank by assets, has
joined Citigroup Inc., Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) and Australia  New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in boosting staff and business in
Asia to profit from investment and hedging demand. The number of
clients in Asia has grown 50 percent after the acquisition of
RBS Sempra Commodities LLP in 2010, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eyles, 41, who joined the bank in 1988, said the operations
in Asia had about 100 employees across sales, trading, research,
warehousing and physical business. The bank won the top spot in
the 2011 rankings by Asia Risk magazine of energy and commodity
derivatives brokers and dealers in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formerly chief executive of commodities for Europe, Middle
East and Africa, Eyles said the bank is seeking to expand its
physical trading of copper, aluminum and zinc to include gold in
China, a country that it considers an important priority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to build our gas, coal and power franchises
in the region as well as physical oil and investor businesses,&#8221;
he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infosys Technologies Ltd. (INFO) erased
losses after falling as much as 1.5 percent following a CNBC
TV18 report that said a U.S.-based employee filed a suit against
the Indian company for improper use of business visas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most recent case filed against Infosys in the U.S. was
a complaint by an employee in Lowndes County, Alabama, on March
23. Jack &#8220;Jay&#8221; Palmer Jr. alleged the company was misusing the
B-1 visa, a permit for temporary business visitors, to get
around H-1B visa limitations, court documents show. CNBC didn&#8217;t
say where it got the information for today&#8217;s report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The H-1B visa allows skilled overseas workers to be
employed in the U.S. in specialty occupations. Infosys fell 0.1
percent to 2,843 rupees at 1:51 p.m. in Mumbai. The benchmark
Sensitive Index, or Sensex, was little changed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European Union regulators&#8217; stress
tests on banks will be more demanding this year than a similar
exam in 2010 that said firms would need to raise 3.5 billion
euros ($5 billion), Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European banks have raised 122 billion euros since last
year&#8217;s tests, London-based analysts including Jernej Omahen and
Jean-Francois Neuez said in a report to clients today. The
European Banking Authority&#8217;s tighter definition of capital in
the 2011 tests may reduce Spanish banks&#8217; core Tier 1 capital by
23 billion euros, they said. Credit Agricole SA (ACA), Portuguese and
Austrian banks may also be &#8220;negatively affected,&#8221; they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ninety banks will be expected to maintain a core Tier 1
capital ratio of at least 5 percent under the stress-test
scenarios, according to the EBA, which is carrying out the
tests. This year&#8217;s exams will include a review of how lenders
would handle a 0.5 percent economic contraction in the euro area
in 2011 as well as a 15 percent drop in European equity markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;harsher methodology&#8221; in the 2011 tests &#8220;stops short
of testing for extremes,&#8221; the analysts wrote. The &#8220;EBA will
test for sharp declines in sovereign bond values, but not for a
restructuring.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A theoretical haircut of Greek government debt by 40
percent would mean eight banks would need to raise new capital,
the Goldman Sachs analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL), Google Inc. and other
smartphone technology companies may face tougher European Union
restrictions on the way they handle user-location data after
data privacy watchdogs said the information is private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information that could betray the location of devices such
as Apple&#8217;s iPhones and phones running Google&#8217;s Android software
must be treated as personal, requiring companies to comply with
European Union data protection law, EU privacy officials said in
a nonbinding opinion that was published yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users must be given &#8220;clear, comprehensive&#8221; and
understandable information about how, why and for how long their
data is processed, the so-called Article 29 Data Protection
Working Party said in the opinion. Technology firms can use
location data to deliver targeted advertising and help customers
find nearby businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data protection officials in Europe, including Germany and
France, are investigating recent reports on the collection and
storage of location data on Apple&#8217;s iPhones. Apple and Google
last week defended their handling of user location before U.S.
lawmakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opinion, dated May 16, said information collected
through the combination of a Wi-Fi access point with a mobile
device&#8217;s location is also personal data, and subject to EU
privacy rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have seen the Working Party&#8217;s paper and we are
reviewing it closely,&#8221; Al Verney, a spokesman for Mountain
View, California-based Google, said by telephone. &#8220;It&#8217;s worth
remembering that Google can&#8217;t identify anyone using Wi-Fi header
information, nor would we want to,&#8221; Verney said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple spokesman Alan Hely didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a
phone call and an e-mail seeking comment. Apple has said in
statements it is &#8220;not tracking the location of your iPhone&#8221;
and &#8220;has no plans to ever do so.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the opinion is nonbinding, it &#8220;confirms the position
of the regulators that are going to be policing compliance,&#8221;
Ustaran said. &#8220;It could potentially lead to sanctions
particularly if any infringements are seen to have an impact on
people&#8217;s privacy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple, Google, Microsoft Queried by U.S. Senator Over Privacy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Richard Blumenthal asked Apple Inc., Google Inc.
and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) for information about the companies&#8217;
collection of data from private wireless networks to create maps
of Wi-Fi service, saying the practice raises privacy concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who serves on the Senate
Judiciary Committee, made the request in a letter to the
companies that was released yesterday by his office in
Washington. The letter also was sent to BlackBerry maker
Research In Motion Ltd., handset manufacturer Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) and
Skyhook, a provider of wireless phone location services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Attempting to document the locations of personal wireless
networks in individuals&#8217; homes without their knowledge or
consent raises issues what constitutes a reasonable expectation
of privacy for an ordinary citizen,&#8221; Blumenthal said in the
letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Rejects Skyhook&#8217;s Allegations Over Phone-Location Service &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) rejected allegations that it undermined plans
by Samsung Electronics Co. and the former Motorola Inc. (MOT) to use a
competing location-finding service on Android-based mobile
phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skyhook Wireless Inc., a closely held software company in
Boston, claimed in a September lawsuit that Motorola and Samsung
were willing to pay for its service until Google threatened to
cut off the phonemakers&#8217; access to third-party applications in
the Android Market. Motorola and Samsung rely on Google&#8217;s
Android operating system for some of their devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google said it did nothing improper with regard to any
contracts Skyhook had with the phonemakers, according to a May
13 filing in response to the lawsuit in Suffolk County,
Massachusetts, Superior Court in Boston. The service, a software
system that uses Wi-Fi positions, GPS and cell-tower
triangulation to pinpoint a phone&#8217;s location, is used by
advertisers and businesses to target potential customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To the extent Google took any action that affected
Skyhook, those actions were the lawful exercise of legitimate
rights of Google and therefore are not actionable,&#8221; Mountain
View, California-based Google said in the filing. &#8220;If Skyhook
suffered any damages, which is denied, then any such damages
resulted solely from its own acts or omissions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate complaint in federal court in Boston, Skyhook
has claimed that Google infringed four of its patents related to
ways to establish the precise location of a smartphone. Google
has denied infringing the patents, and said in court filings
that the patents are invalid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state case is Skyhook Wireless Inc. v. Google Inc.,
2010-3652, Massachusetts Superior Court, Suffolk County
(Boston). The patent case is Skyhook Wireless v. Google Inc.,
10cv11571, U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts
(Boston). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patent &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genentech Sues Apotex Claiming Valcyte Patent Infringement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roche Holding AG (ROG)&#8217;s Genentech unit sued Apotex Inc. for
planning to sell a generic version of Valcyte, which treats a
virus that afflicts transplant patients and people with AIDS,
before Genentech&#8217;s patent for the drug expires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apotex, based in Toronto, told Genentech on April 6 that it
had applied for approval from the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration to make a generic of Valcyte, according to the
complaint filed May 17 in federal court in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genentech, based in South San Francisco, California, said
the plan to market the generic will cause &#8220;massive
infringement&#8221; of its patent covering the drug. Genentech seeks
a court order declaring that the Apotex generic is a patent-
infringing drug, blocking the FDA from approving it until
Genentech&#8217;s patent expires in 2015 and barring Apotex from
engaging in commercial activity that would infringe the
Genentech patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genentech last month filed a suit based on similar claims
against Sandoz Inc., a unit of Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis
AG. (NOVN) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roche has sued other drug manufacturers over generic copies
of Valcyte. The company settled a lawsuit with Ranbaxy
Laboratories Ltd. last year with Ranbaxy agreeing to sell its
generic copy of Valcyte in 2013, two years before a patent
expires, Basel-based Roche said in an August statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elie Betito, an Apotex spokesman, said the company hadn&#8217;t
reviewed the complaint and had no immediate comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Genentech Inc. v. Apotex Inc., 11-2410, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ITC Staff Issues Favorable Patent Recommendations for Kodak &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The staff of the U.S. International Trade Commission has
sided with Eastman Kodak Co. (EK) in its patent dispute with Research
In Motion Ltd. (RIM) and Apple Inc. The staff found that RIM and Apple
have infringed a Kodak patent on a way to preview digital images
using less processing power and storage space. The
recommendations, originally filed last month, were made public
May 17. The six-member commission is scheduled to release its
decision June 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kodak, based in Rochester, New York, is &#8220;looking forward
to the full ITC&#8217;s decision,&#8221; David Lanzillo, a company
spokesman, said by e-mail. Kristin Huguet, a spokeswoman for
Cupertino, California-based Apple, and Marisa Conway, a
spokeswoman for Waterloo, Ontario-based RIM, didn&#8217;t immediately
reply to e-mails and telephone calls seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The staff recommended that the ITC issue an order barring
imports of Apple&#8217;s iPhone and RIM&#8217;s Blackberry, saying the
public interest and competition in the marketplace wouldn&#8217;t be
harmed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ITC is a quasi-judicial arbiter of trade disputes.
While the agency can&#8217;t order monetary damages, the threat of
being shut out of the U.S. market often provides the incentive
for settlements. The agency doesn&#8217;t always follow the
recommendations of its staff, which acts as a third party in ITC
cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent in dispute covers a feature that previews low-
resolution versions of a moving image while recording still
images at a high resolution. Higher resolution requires more
processing power and storage space. Kodak, which generated $838
million from patents last year, contends the image-preview
feature is used in every digital camera and phone with a camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 13, in a separate case, a U.S. International Trade
Commission judge said Kodak&#8217;s digital-camera technology doesn&#8217;t
violate Apple Inc.&#8217;s patent rights. The judge&#8217;s findings are
subject to review by the six-member ITC, which has the power to
block imports of products that infringe U.S. patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In the Matter of Certain Mobile Telephones and
Wireless Communication Devices Featuring Digital Cameras, and
Components Thereof, 337-703, U.S. International Trade Commission
(Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mosaid Technologies Files Patent Claim Against Cisco at ITC &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mosaid Technologies Inc. (MSD) filed a patent-infringement
complaint against Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO), the world&#8217;s largest maker
of networking equipment, before the U.S. International Trade
Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mosaid claims certain Cisco routers and modems,
manufactured overseas and sold in the U.S., infringe six of its
patents. Those patents relate to power-over-Ethernet products,
which carry electrical current over data cables rather than
power cords, Ottawa-based Mosaid said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mosaid, a designer of semiconductors that received all of
its $71 million in revenue last year from patent licensing, is
already in a patent battle with San Jose, California-based
Cisco. That case, initiated by Cisco and pending in federal
court in Delaware, relates to the six patents in the ITC case
and four others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ITC, which can block imports of products found to
violate U.S. patents, must decide whether to investigate
Mosaid&#8217;s claims. If the agency takes the case, it would need
about 15 months to complete the review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In the Matter of Communications Networks,
including Switches, Routers, Gateways, Bridges, Wireless Access
Points, Cable Modems, IP Phones, 2807, U.S. International Trade
Commission (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney Defeats Trademark Suit Over &#8216;Little Miss&#8217; T-Shirts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. won dismissal of a lawsuit alleging that
the entertainment company&#8217;s sales of t-shirts bearing the logo
&#8220;Little Miss&#8221; infringed trademarks held by London-based THOIP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THOIP received the rights to the Mr. Men and Little Miss
marks, books and characters in 2004 from the family of
children&#8217;s author Roger Hargreaves, according to the complaint
filed in 2008 in Manhattan federal court. Hargreaves created the
characters in 1971 and died in 1988. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin said in a ruling
issued May 17 that she had previously found in favor of Disney
and had allowed the two sides to submit additional evidence to
determine if there was any product confusion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge said that after further review, she stood by her
earlier ruling that there was &#8220;virtually no chance that a
consumer seeing an allegedly infringing &#8216;Miss Disney shirt&#8217; or
&#8216;Little Miss Disney shirt&#8217; would think it came from, was
affiliated with or was approved by THOIP.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is THOIP v. Walt Disney Co., 1:08-cv-06823, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. Looks at Loosening Copyright Laws to Boost Creative Jobs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. Business Secretary Vince Cable welcomed proposals to
loosen copyright laws, saying they&#8217;d help creative industries
grow by making it easier to use material. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A report yesterday by Ian Hargreaves, an academic at
Cardiff Business School, recommended the government set up a
Digital Copyright Exchange, where licenses to use material could
be traded, and make it easier to use &#8220;orphan works,&#8221; whose
authors can&#8217;t be traced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cable also welcomed proposals to make it legal to copy for
private purposes, including ripping music from compact discs,
something currently forbidden in the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Such format-shifting is unlawful, though the music
industry has made it clear that it does not intend to act
against consumers who do it,&#8221; Cable said in a speech in London
yesterday. &#8220;So the consequence of the ban on format-shifting is
simply to make it harder for a British entrepreneur to compete
with technology developed in the U.S. and other countries where
there&#8217;s no such ban.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baidu Accused in U.S. Lawsuit of Aiding Chinese Censorship &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baidu Inc., the owner of China&#8217;s most popular search
engine, was sued by eight Chinese residents of New York who say
the company helps the Chinese government censor political
expression in violation of the U.S. Constitution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs&#8217; &#8220;writings, publications and coverage of
pro-democracy events has been censored and banned from any
search performed on the Baidu.com Inc. search engine,&#8221; they
said in a complaint filed yesterday in Manhattan federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China &#8220;openly and routinely uses censorship of political
speech and information on the Internet to silence criticism of
the government in China and the ruling Chinese Communist
Party,&#8221; the plaintiffs allege in their complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs are also charging that Baidu and China
violated New York state civil rights laws. They are demanding
$16 million in damages from Baidu and the Chinese government,
which is also a defendant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;China will be required to answer the complaint or there
will be a default judgment against them,&#8221; Stephen Preziosi, the
New York-based lawyer representing the plaintiffs, said in a
telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baidu has enjoyed a &#8220;near monopoly&#8221; in Internet searches
in China since Google Inc. cut back on operations there,
according to a presentation this month by brokerage CLSA Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaiser Kuo, a spokesman for Baidu, didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Zhang v. Baidu.com Inc., 11-3388, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost to protect debt issued by
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) climbed to the highest level in almost
five months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on New York-based Goldman Sachs
increased 6.7 basis points to 141.9 basis points, according to
data provider CMA. The contracts have risen 30.6 basis points
since a U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations&#8217;s
report last month said the firm misled clients about its bets on
mortgage-related investments. The panel&#8217;s findings were referred
to the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange
Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contracts, which are are at the highest since Dec. 1.,
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a swap protecting $10 million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) won U.S. approval to

2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration cleared Sutent for
treatment of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, also known as
pancreatic NET, the company said today in a statement. Novartis
AG (NVS)&#8217;s Afinitor won FDA approval for the same illness on May 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, based in New York, and Basel, Switzerland-based
Novartis plan to market their drugs for pancreatic tumors that
strike about 2,500 people a year in the U.S., according to the
University of Southern California Center for Pancreatic and
Biliary Diseases in Los Angeles. Both medicines, which target
cancer at the molecular level, work sufficiently to outweigh
risks, outside advisers to the FDA said at an April 12 meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;FDA believes it is important to provide cancer patients
with as many treatment options as possible,&#8221; Richard Pazdur,

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the most
profitable U.S. bank, is taking trading revenue from Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) as investments
including its $1.7 billion purchase of RBS Sempra&#8217;s commodities
business begin paying off, Deutsche Bank AG analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s share of total trading revenue among the top
five broker-dealers has risen to 24 percent during the first
quarter from 21 percent a year before, Deutsche Bank analysts
Matt O&#8217;Connor and David Ho told clients in a research note after
meeting with Chief Financial Officer Doug Braunstein yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We came away more confident than ever that share gains in
FICC trading are sustainable as management noted that strong
relative trading results recently reflect the benefits of
investment spend over the past couple of years,&#8221; the analysts
said, referring to JPMorgan&#8217;s fixed-income, interest-rate,
currency and commodities trading unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which had 26 percent of the trading market
last March, and Bank of America, which had 21 percent, both lost
ground to JPMorgan, according to Deutsche Bank&#8217;s data. Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s market share fell to 24 percent, while Bank of America&#8217;s
dropped to 19 percent. Run by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is already seeing higher revenue from individual
clients from investments in its capital markets business,
O&#8217;Connor and Ho wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-quarter net income for the New York-based bank
climbed to a record $5.56 billion. Almost 43 percent of that
profit came from the investment bank, where earnings fell 4
percent to $2.37 billion from a year earlier. Fixed-income and
equity markets revenue, where trading results are reported, was
$6.6 billion, or 81 percent of the investment bank&#8217;s revenue in
the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proprietary Trading Restrictions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulatory restrictions on proprietary trading and
international capital rules won&#8217;t result in a &#8220;meaningful&#8221;
loss in revenue for the second-largest U.S. bank by assets,
O&#8217;Connor and Ho said. They reiterated their &#8220;buy&#8221;
recommendation on the stock and raised their 12-month price
target to $54 from $52 a share. JPMorgan fell 87 cents to $43.13
at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expenses will remain high and JPMorgan&#8217;s mortgage book has
cost the company $22 billion since 2009, averaging $3 billion to
$4 billion a quarter, according to the note. Braunstein said
&#8220;additional mortgage hits were likely and could linger for
another 12 to 24 months,&#8221; O&#8217;Connor and Ho said. They estimated
the company will take another $3 billion in mortgage-related
litigation charges this year and again in 2012, &#8220;although our
bias is they could be higher.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) was sued by NES
Financial Corp. for allegedly defrauding it in the purchase of a
tax-related business, leaving NES with billions of dollars in
potential liability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NES Financial, in a complaint filed in federal court in
Manhattan yesterday, claimed that JPMorgan improperly hid a
&#8220;lengthy history of legal violations&#8221; when it sold its Section
1031 tax-deferred exchange business to NES in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While NESF thought it was purchasing a business that
would solidify its reputation for quality and trustworthiness,
it received a business that saddled it with potentially massive
liability,&#8221; the company claimed in its complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, NES Financial said, it is unable to raise
capital from outside investors and its value dropped to
$7 million from about $41 million before the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NES Financial helps its clients avoid U.S. taxes by
facilitating so-called 1031 exchanges, according to its website.
Section 1031 of the U.S. Tax Code permits the owners of certain
types of property used for business or investment to exchange
them &#8220;for property of like kind,&#8221; without recognizing a loss
or gain for tax purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan Chase spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a phone message seeking comment on the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is NES Financial Corp. v. JPMorgan Chase Bank NA,

(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider, plans to
invest $100 million exploring how companies can mine data like
its game show-winning machine Watson does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will use the money for research in the next two
to three years, studying how to find trends among words or
sentences scattered around the Web. The company will sift
through user information on sites like Facebook and Twitter,
said Rod Smith, vice president of emerging Internet technologies
at IBM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I need to harvest parts of that information to improve my
products if I&#8217;m a business,&#8221; Smith said in an interview. &#8220;The
problem is, finding your product is like finding a needle in a
haystack, and that&#8217;s where analytics comes in.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2015, IBM projects $16 billion in revenue from business
analytics and optimization, one of Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano&#8217;s focus areas for sales growth. The amount of data in
enterprises is estimated to increase by more than 650 percent in
the next five years, and 80 percent of it will be unstructured,
or information in the form of words, sentences and video
streams, according to research firm Gartner Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, based in Armonk, New York, used the same technology in
Watson, its computer that bested humans to win the game show
Jeopardy! The machine understands words and sentences rather
than the formatted data computers normally process, according to
IBM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insight From Data &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process can be used elsewhere, for example, to sift
through user complaints about software malfunctions and to
discover problematic trends, said Steven Sams, a vice president
in IBM&#8217;s global technology services. It could also tell a
business which of its applications are easiest to move to the
"cloud," or delivered over the Internet, versus those that might
not be worth it, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is beefing up some of its products with data
capabilities and has added the technology to 20 services that
help executives utilize their firms&#8217; information. In a 2011 IBM
study, 83 percent of 3,000 chief information officers surveyed
said applying analytics to IT operations was the &#8220;most
important element of their strategic growth plans over the next
three to five years,&#8221; according to IBM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Businesses have been frustrated,&#8221; Sams said. &#8220;They&#8217;ve
got hundreds and thousands of pieces of data, and they&#8217;re trying
to get some insight out of it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Bristol-Myers Squibb
Co. (BMY)&#8217;s apixaban blood thinner won European Union approval to
prevent deadly clots after surgeries to replace hips or knees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s the first approval for the drug, to be sold under the
name Eliquis, the companies said today in a statement. The
medicine may reach annual sales of $2.63 billion by 2015 if
broader indications are approved, according to the average
estimate of three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 40 percent to 60 percent of people undergoing hip or
knee surgery are at risk of developing blood clots, known as
venous thromboembolic events, if not treated preventively, the
New York-based companies said. The treatment is being studied in
60,000 patients to prevent and treat clots and strokes in a
variety of health disorders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The approval of Eliquis gives European orthopedic
surgeons a new option,&#8221; said Michael Rud Lassen, the lead
investigator for a late-stage trial of the drug. Apixaban &#8220;is
more effective than the current standard of care.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are about a half-dozen pills now in development to
replace the blood-thinners warfarin and aspirin as the standard
treatments to prevent blood clots in patients with the erratic
heart rate known as atrial fibrillation. Competing drugs include
Boehringer Ingelheim&#8217;s Pradaxa and Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) and Bayer
AG (BAYN)&#8217;s Xarelto. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boehringer&#8217;s drug was approved in the U.S. in October for
patients with an irregular heartbeat. Both drugs already are
sold in Europe to prevent clots after hip and knee surgery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) promoted
Mark Sorrell and Anthony Gutman to become co-heads of its U.K.
investment banking unit, succeeding Julian Metherell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorrell, 37, and Gutman, 36, were formerly co-chief
operating officers of U.K. investment banking, Richard Gnodde,
co-chief executive officer of the firm&#8217;s European unit, said in
an internal memo to employees. The contents were confirmed by a
spokeswoman in London today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will replace Metherell, who left Goldman Sachs this
month to join former BP Plc CEO Tony Hayward&#8217;s planned 1
billion-pound ($1.6 billion) energy-investment fund. Sorrell,
the son of WPP Group Plc CEO Martin Sorrell, joined Goldman
Sachs in 1994 and was a former head of the European natural
resources group. Gutman joined from Citigroup Inc. in 2007 as a
managing director advising companies in the retail industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is revamping the leadership of its investment
banking unit after the firm lagged behind JPMorgan Chase  Co.
and Morgan Stanley in advisory revenue during the first quarter.
The firm this week named Gnodde, 51, co-head of its investment
banking division, which includes mergers and acquisitions as
well as stock and bond underwriting, alongside David M. Solomon
and John S. Weinberg. The unit generated $1.27 billion in first-
quarter revenue, less than 11 percent of the firm&#8217;s total. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm is the top-ranked adviser on mergers and
acquisitions this year both globally and in the U.K., according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank helped to advise Anglo American Plc
on combining its U.K. building material operations with those of
Lafarge SA in February, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The firm also advised money manager Gartmore Group Ltd. on its
acquisition by Henderson Group Plc for about 335.3 million
pounds in April. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian talks with the European Union
over a visa-free regime are progressing, Russian Foreign Affairs
Minister Sergei Lavrov said today after meeting with his German
and Polish counterparts Guido Westerwelle and Radoslaw Sikorski. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa negotiations will be the main topic of a summit with
the EU in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia on June, 9-10, Lavrov said at
a briefing in Kaliningrad, which was translated by the Russian
state TV Vesti-24. &#8220;We are moving forward in negotiations,&#8221; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia doesn&#8217;t see much sense in the EU suctions against
Belarus, Lavrov said separately. He called for Belarus to
respect the human rights of its citizens and said prison
sentences against two former presidential candidates on May 20
were negative &#8220;but we don&#8217;t think that the sanctions may help
here&#8221;, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia wants guarantees that the proposed U.S.-led missile
shield in Europe won&#8217;t target it, and hopes to be able to
negotiate this, Lavrov said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After sitting on one of Mexico&#8217;s
biggest war chests, Coca-Cola Femsa SAB needs acquisitions more
than ever as its main rival&#8217;s profit increases twice as fast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico&#8217;s largest Coke bottler has doubled its cash hoard in
the past two years to $1.1 billion, more than all but two of the
nation&#8217;s 27 consumer-goods companies, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Coca-Cola Femsa has more cash versus debt than any
time since 2002, when the Mexico City-based company announced
its biggest takeover, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa hasn&#8217;t struck a deal greater than $100
million in three years and is losing ground after Embotelladoras
Arca SAB agreed to buy Mexico&#8217;s third-largest bottler this year.
Arca&#8217;s shares have gained about three times as much as Coca-Cola
Femsa since the end of 2008. As Coca-Cola Femsa seeks takeovers,
its finance chief says Arca&#8217;s deal may spur family-owned Latin
American bottlers to sell. The company may also look at Chile&#8217;s
Embotelladora Andina SA (AKO/A), according to Corp. Actinver SAB, or
Coca-Cola Co.&#8217;s Philippines franchise, said JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They have a large cash position and they want to use it
for acquisitions,&#8221; said Jose Miguel Garaicochea, who helps
manage about $1 billion, including Coca-Cola Femsa shares, in
Mexico City for a Banco Santander SA unit. Arca&#8217;s takeovers put
&#8220;pressure&#8221; on Coca-Cola Femsa, he said. &#8220;Obviously, one would
want them to buy and buy cheap and that would help growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kent Landers, a spokesman for Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co.,
declined to comment, as did Guillermo Garza, a spokesman for
Arca. Veronica Diaz, with Embotelladora Andina, did not respond
to a voice mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not Under Pressure &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa isn&#8217;t under pressure to make acquisitions,
said Jose Castro, the company&#8217;s investor relations chief. Larger
acquisitions take a long time to negotiate, and Coca-Cola Femsa
won&#8217;t be rushed into overpaying, he said. The company didn&#8217;t buy
franchises in Ecuador and South Korea because of price, he said,
declining to comment on future potential targets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa&#8217;s cash and short-term investments increased
to $1.1 billion as of March from $445 million at the end of 2008,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Its total cash is the most for
any consumer-goods company based in Mexico after its majority
owner Fomento Economico Mexicano SAB of Monterrey with $2.31
billion and the $2.27 billion held by Grupo Modelo SAB, the
brewer of Corona beer, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors and everyone are kind of waiting for something
to happen,&#8221; Lauren Torres, an analyst with HSBC Holdings Plc in
New York, said in an interview. &#8220;For them to be sitting on this
cash and not putting it to good use does cause concern.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net Cash &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa&#8217;s cash is projected to exceed borrowings by
yearend, JPMorgan estimates. That would be the first time in
eight years, just before the company completed its largest
acquisition, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Net debt is
currently $296 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2002 Coca-Cola Femsa agreed to pay $3.6 billion in cash
for Panamerican Beverages Inc., then Latin America&#8217;s biggest
soft-drink distributor with operations in eight countries in the
region. The deal, which closed in May 2003, took four years to
negotiate, said Coca-Cola Femsa&#8217;s Castro. The company also
bought a Brazilian bottler in 2008 from Coca-Cola Co. (KO) for $364
million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Arca, Mexico&#8217;s second-largest Coke bottler, have
surged since it agreed in January to buy Tampico, Mexico-based
Grupo Continental SAB for 27.7 billion pesos ($2.3 billion) in
stock. Arca has risen 21 percent, outstripping Coca-Cola Femsa&#8217;s
3.8 percent increase. Mexico&#8217;s benchmark IPC index fell 6.3
percent in that span. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit Growth &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arca and Grupo Continental, commonly known as Contal, will
form a bottler called Arca Continental that had $3.3 billion in
combined revenue last year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Coca-Cola Femsa had sales of $8.2 billion in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts estimate that Arca&#8217;s per-share earnings will
increase 25 percent this year, versus 11 percent for Coca-Cola
Femsa, using generally accepted accounting principles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors want to see them move this cash to do
acquisitions and continue growing the business,&#8221; Karla Pena, an
analyst with the Mexico City brokerage Actinver, said of Coca-
Cola Femsa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arca&#8217;s Contal transaction adds to the two Argentine
bottlers purchased in 2008 and the $345 million cash acquisition
last year of a Coca-Cola franchise in Ecuador, which Coca-Cola
Femsa executives said they had considered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Monterrey-based Arca have climbed 191 percent
since the end of 2008, almost triple the 64 percent gain for
Coca-Cola Femsa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Gates &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa is 54 percent owned by Fomento Economico
Mexicano, known as Femsa, and the Coca-Cola Co. holds a 32
percent stake. The Bill Gates Foundation and Cascade Investment
LLC, which manages money for billionaire Gates, own 8.7 million
of Coca-Cola Femsa&#8217;s American depositary receipts as the top two
investors in the U.S. shares, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embotelladora Andina, Chile&#8217;s largest Coca-Cola bottler,
would be an attractive acquisition for Coca-Cola Femsa,
according to Actinver&#8217;s Pena and Greenwood Capital Associates.
The Santiago-based company, which has a market value of 1.54
trillion Chilean pesos ($3.3 billion), will post record profits
this year and next, according to analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil accounted for 46 percent of Embotelladora Andina&#8217;s
sales last year, with 33 percent from Chile and 21 percent in
Argentina, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chilean Bottler &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If I were them, I&#8217;d focus on what I know best, which is
Latin America,&#8221; said Walter Todd, who helps manage $950 million
at Greenwood Capital in Greenwood, South Carolina. &#8220;The Chilean
bottler, the exposure that they have to Chile, Brazil and
Argentina, it would be very good for them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman Jose Antonio Fernandez said last year that Coca-
Cola Femsa won&#8217;t limit its acquisitions search to Latin America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa may seek to acquire Coca-Cola Co.&#8217;s North
America bottling franchise, according to Matt McCormick, a money
manager at Cincinnati-based Bahl  Gaynor Inc., which oversees
$3.6 billion. Coca-Cola Co. bought back the operations in
October for about $12.3 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Coca-Cola Co. may name multiple partners in North America
and Coke Femsa has to figure prominently in the list,&#8221; Carlos Laboy, a New York-based analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, said
in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laboy said in a report to clients in October that Coca-Cola,
the world&#8217;s largest soda maker, may ultimately break up its
newly acquired North American bottling operations into four
regional units and sell them. Coca-Cola Femsa would be a top
candidate, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philippines Franchise &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying one of the units could cost Coca-Cola Femsa more
than $3 billion, if each is valued equally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa may also consider buying Coca-Cola Co.&#8217;s
bottling franchise in the Philippines, according to Alan Alanis,
an analyst with JPMorgan in New York. In 2007 Coca-Cola Co.
acquired the 65 percent of Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines Inc.
it didn&#8217;t own for $590 million from San Miguel Corp., valuing
the entire operation at about $908 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s an increased likelihood that they would have to
go outside of Latin America to fulfill their acquisition
plans,&#8221; Alanis said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Coca-Cola Femsa were to pursue all three potential
acquisitions in Chile, North America and the Philippines, the
total price tag would be more than $7 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Latin American Bottlers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa Chief Financial Officer Hector Trevino said
the Arca merger with Contal may prompt Coca-Cola bottlers in
Latin America to explore selling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will see a new wave of at least some curiosity from
some of the owners to look at a potential transaction,&#8221; Trevino
said in an earnings conference call April 27. &#8220;We&#8217;ll continue
to be active.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bahl  Gaynor&#8217;s McCormick says Coca-Cola Femsa should
return more cash to shareholders rather than pursue takeovers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They have a bunch of cash in their pocket,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Acquisitions are one of the alternatives that people like, but
usually they take longer to impact the bottom line. Dividends
would be their best bet.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa has already increased its dividend 67
percent to 4.36 billion pesos ($370 million) this year. Trevino
said last month that management would raise payouts if it can&#8217;t
find any deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They generate a lot of cash so investors want to see them
move this cash to do acquisitions and continue growing,&#8221;
Actinver analyst Pena said. &#8220;They simply want the money to be
used somehow. If they see it&#8217;s not doing anything, then it can
hurt the share price.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, there have been 9,601 deals announced globally
this year, totaling $948.1 billion, a 21 percent increase from
the $786.5 billion in the same period in 2010, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hedge fund Paulson  Co., which last
month revealed details of its purchases of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. bonds, is asking a court to order Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) and other banks and investment funds to make the same
disclosures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and other creditors that have joined to back
a plan to distribute Lehman&#8217;s assets should disclose details of
their claims against the failed investment bank, including the
prices they paid in some circumstances, Paulson and other
creditors said in a filing today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To promote fundamental fairness and transparency in these
cases, the group respectfully submits that any party seeking to
participate in plan litigation be required to provide
comprehensive disclosure regarding their economic interests,&#8221;
the Paulson group said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creditors that have joined with Goldman Sachs to propose a
liquidation plan for Lehman include Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Morgan
Stanley (MS) and Silver Point Capital LP, according to court papers.
Paulson and other creditors, including the California Public
Employees&#8217; Retirement System, or Calpers, are pushing their own
plan. The groups are fighting over how much different groups of
creditors will recover from the remnants of Lehman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, didn&#8217;t
immediately comment. Deutsche Bank spokeswoman Renee Calabro,
Adam Weiner, a Silver Point spokesman, and Mary Claire Delaney,
a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$19.6 Billion &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson, Calpers and other senior bondholders disclosed
details of their Lehman holdings last month, including prices
they paid and dates of purchases. The group holds a total of
$19.6 billion in claims against Lehman units, according to the
court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Paulson group wants U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck in
Manhattan to set disclosure requirements for creditors that are
backing liquidation plans for Lehman and others involved in the
bankruptcy. The group wants creditors to reveal all their
holdings, what kind of claims they have and the prices they paid
if they were acquired after Lehman filed for bankruptcy in
September 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ), 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dan Dicker could be forgiven if he
hooted in vindication as crude plunged 15 percent in the first
week of May. He concluded long ago that petroleum prices have
become &#8220;just nuts,&#8221; as he says in &#8220;Oil&#8217;s Endless Bid.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil markets are defying the normal laws of supply and
demand, he argues in this timely book, and a large share of the
blame belongs to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS) and
other banks. A longtime floor trader, he brings valuable
insights to bear on a contentious subject that affects us all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dicker spent 25 years trading crude, natural gas, unleaded
gasoline and heating fuel at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Bit by bit, he saw Goldman -- &#8220;the devil to be feared,&#8221; he
says -- and its Wall Street brethren muscle into a sleepy market
that was once dominated by oil companies seeking to hedge the
risks of physical assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon a flood of &#8220;dumb money&#8221; from investors was gushing
into funds pegged to the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index, he says.
This high tide of cash, totaling billions of dollars, exerted an
upward price pressure on oil that burdens American business and
threatens to derail a U.S. economic recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are all invested in oil, whether we like it or not,&#8221;
he writes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the U.S.
bank that gets most of its revenue from trading, is facing a
widening gap between its assigned credit rating and that implied
by market performance, Moody&#8217;s Capital Markets Research said in
a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ratings implied by the performance of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
securities in the stock, bond and credit-default swap markets
are each at least four grades below the firm&#8217;s credit rating of
A1, analyst Allerton Smith said today. Moody&#8217;s Capital Markets
Research is separate from the Moody&#8217;s ratings company that has
assigned Goldman an A1 rating and negative outlook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s equity-implied rating has fallen two grades to
Ba2, below investment grade, and seven grades below its actual
rating, as its shares have dropped 19 percent this year.
Investors are concerned about the firm&#8217;s reputation after
investigations into its collateralized debt obligations
business, Smith wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given Goldman&#8217;s current franchise issues and reputational
challenges, as well as its negative rating outlook, investors
should be wary of additional headline driven spread
deterioration and the company&#8217;s continued decline in market-
implied ratings, which signal underperformance in the credit
markets,&#8221; Smith said in the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDS contracts on Goldman Sachs have widened the most of any
major U.S. bank this year, leading to its CDS-implied rating
dropping one grade to Baa3, according to the note. The firm&#8217;s
bond-implied rating also has dropped one grade this year to
Baa2. Those implied ratings were the same as Citigroup Inc. (C),
Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) as of May 18, according
to the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government Backing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, didn&#8217;t immediately return a call for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s A1 rating from the Moody&#8217;s ratings company
includes a one-grade increase from the assumption of government
support, and the negative outlook reflects the possibility that
assumption may be removed, according to the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Senate&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations,
led by Michigan Democrat Carl M. Levin, used Goldman Sachs as a
case study in its two-year examination of the financial crisis.
When the subcommittee released its 640-page report last month,
Levin said that Goldman Sachs misled clients and Congress about
the firm&#8217;s bets on the housing market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The testimony we gave was truthful and accurate and this
is confirmed by the subcommittee&#8217;s own report,&#8221; Lucas van Praag, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin and Oklahoma Senator Thomas A. Coburn, the
subcommittee&#8217;s ranking Republican, formally referred their
report to the Department of Justice and the Securities and
Exchange Commission, which are reviewing the findings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the largest U.S.
oil company, had an upset that caused flaring at the Joliet,
Illinois, refinery, according to a filing with state regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upset began May 21 before midnight local time and the
release of gases was ongoing, the company said in a filing with
the Illinois Emergency Management Agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Allexon, a Fairfax, Virginia-based spokesman for
Exxon, couldn&#8217;t immediately be reached by e-mail for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refinery outages can increase prices for refined products
as refiners turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts. Operational disruptions can also depress prices for
crude oil because less feedstock is needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 248,000-barrel-a-day refinery processes primarily
Canadian crude and produces gasoline, diesel, liquefied
petroleum gas and asphalt among others, according to the Exxon
Mobil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Joliet refinery is 42 miles (68 kilometers) southwest
of Chicago on the Des Plaines river. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) lost a bid to
dismiss a lawsuit by a group of Taiwanese banks that accuse HSBC
Bank USA of helping deceased financier Danny Pang&#8217;s PEMGroup
defraud them of more than $500 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Philip Gutierrez on May 19 rejected
HSBC&#8217;s arguments that the banks should have brought their claims
in the British Virgin Islands, where the PEMGroup entities that
issued the securities were based, rather than in Los Angeles. He
also dismissed contentions that the banks didn&#8217;t provide enough
facts to support their fraud and conspiracy claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These allegations, taken together, create a reasonable
inference that, based on the close business relationship between
HSBC and PEM Group, as well as the material incentives HSBC
stood to gain by providing investors with misleading or
inaccurate data regarding the investments, HSBC had sufficient
knowledge of PEM Group&#8217;s fraud,&#8221; Gutierrez said in his order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hua Nan Commercial Bank claimed $191 million in losses; Hua
Nan Investment Trust, $48 million; Cosmos Bank Taiwan (2837), $45
million; EnTie Commercial Bank (2849), $50 million; Bank SinoPac, $122
million; and Taichung Commercial Bank (2812), $70 million, according to
their October complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks said HSBC, the cash and asset custodian for the
PEMGroup securities, lied to investors about how long the bank
had serviced PEMGroup&#8217;s investments and falsely represented that
PEMGroup&#8217;s prior investment products had been performing in
conformity with their offering memoranda. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gutierrez dismissed fraud and negligent misrepresentation
claims by EnTie and Taichung. The banks were allowed to restate
their claims in an amended complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juanita Gutierrez, a spokesman for HSBC in New York, said
the bank wouldn&#8217;t comment on pending litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pang committed suicide in September 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Hua Nan Commercial Bank v. HSBC Bank USA, 10-
8773, U.S. District Court, Central District of California (Los
Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strauss-Kahn Lawyer Says Accusations Will Be Proven False &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dominique Strauss-Kahn&#8217;s lawyer said the first findings of
his investigation show that accusations by a hotel maid that the
former International Monetary Fund chief tried to rape her are
false. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Brafman, the lawyer, said he is &#8220;confident&#8221;
Strauss-Kahn will be acquitted after a trial. Brafman spoke in
an interview with France&#8217;s national TF1 television from Israel,
where he was staying for personal reasons, according to the
French broadcaster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;From what I have seen already in the file, I am
confident,&#8221; said Brafman, whose comments in English were
translated into French for broadcast. &#8220;If he can have a fair
trial, at the end of the hearings he will be acquitted. From the
investigations we have carried out, I believe the accusations
will prove false.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strauss-Kahn, 62, is charged in state court in New York
with sexual assault and attempted rape of a hotel housekeeper in
Manhattan on May 14. Strauss-Kahn, who resigned as IMF managing
director on May 18, was released from the Rikers Island jail
complex on May 20 after posting $1 million to the court as part
of his bail agreement. He also posted a $5 million bond as a
guarantee that he will appear for trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former French finance minister is staying temporarily
at a building in lower Manhattan that includes residential
units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an indictment filed May 19, Strauss-Kahn is charged with
criminal sex acts, attempted rape, sexual abuse, unlawful
imprisonment and forcible touching. While he has denied the
accusations, he hasn&#8217;t entered a formal plea to any of the
charges. He is scheduled to be arraigned June 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is People v. Strauss-Kahn, 2526/11, Supreme Court
of the State of New York, New York County (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banque Syz Sued by Madoff Trustee for $73.3 Million &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banque Syz  Co. was sued for $73.3 million by the trustee
liquidating Bernard L. Madoff&#8217;s firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Swiss bank, which received the money from so-called
feeder funds, &#8220;knew or should have known of numerous
irregularities&#8221; about the con man&#8217;s firm because of its
expertise in private banking and institutional asset management,
trustee Irving Picard said in a May 20 bankruptcy court filling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls to the Geneva bank&#8217;s main number went unanswered
outside of regular business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banque Syz, which had an account in New York with Madoff&#8217;s
firm, filed a customer claim seeking to recover funds it said it
lost on Madoff investments, according to Picard&#8217;s filing. In the
process, the bank &#8220;submitted&#8221; to the jurisdiction of the
bankruptcy court and &#8220;should reasonably expect to be subject to
New York jurisdiction,&#8221; the trustee said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Irving H. Picard v. Banque Syz  Co., 11-02149,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Sued by NES Financial Over 2008 Sale of Business &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) was sued by NES Financial Corp. for
allegedly defrauding it in the purchase of a tax-related
business, leaving NES with billions of dollars in potential
liability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NES Financial, in a complaint filed in federal court in
Manhattan May 19, claimed that JPMorgan improperly hid a
&#8220;lengthy history of legal violations&#8221; when it sold its Section
1031 tax-deferred exchange business to NES in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While NESF thought it was purchasing a business that
would solidify its reputation for quality and trustworthiness,
it received a business that saddled it with potentially massive
liability,&#8221; the company claimed in its complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, NES Financial said, it is unable to raise
capital from outside investors and its value dropped to $7
million from about $41 million before the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NES Financial helps its clients avoid U.S. taxes by
facilitating so-called 1031 exchanges, according to its website.
Section 1031 of the U.S. Tax Code permits the owners of certain
types of property used for business or investment to exchange
them &#8220;for property of like kind,&#8221; without recognizing a loss
or gain for tax purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan Chase spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t
return a phone message seeking comment on the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is NES Financial Corp. v. JPMorgan Chase Bank NA,
11-cv-3437, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart, CVS Drug Case Sent Back to West Virginia Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS) and four other
drug retailers lost their bid to move to federal court a lawsuit
by the state of West Virginia over pricing of generic drugs on
claims the case was a class action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, said May
20 that the drug retailers failed to show that the state was
pursuing a group lawsuit, or class action, which would have
required the litigation to be handled by a federal court. The
four other defendants are Target Corp. (TGT), Walgreen Co. (WAG), Kroger Co. (KR)
and Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD)&#8217;s Kmart chain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit &#8220;was brought under a West Virginia statute
regulating the practice of pharmacy and the West Virginia
Consumer Credit Protection Act, neither of which includes
provisions providing for a typical class action,&#8221; the appeals
court wrote in its 2-1 decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West Virginia Attorney General Darrell McGraw sued the
retailers in state court in Boone County, alleging the stores
overcharged state residents while filling prescriptions in
violation of two state laws. West Virginia law requires
substitution of generic drugs when available and requires
pharmacies to pass on the savings from using generics to
consumers, according to the state&#8217;s lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defendants sought to move the case to federal court in
Charleston, West Virginia, claiming the lawsuit was a
&#8220;disguised class action.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a dissent, U.S. appeals judge Ronald Lee Gilman, said
West Virginia&#8217;s case has the elements of a class action and
should remain with the federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a saying that if something looks like a duck,
walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it is probably a
duck,&#8221; Gilman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg Rossiter, a spokesman for Bentonville, Arkansas-based
Wal-Mart, said Gilman&#8217;s dissent sums up the company&#8217;s view
&#8220;nicely.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molly Koenst, a spokeswoman for Minneapolis-based Target,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimberly Freely, a spokeswoman for Sears, based in Hoffman
Estates, Illinois, and Keith Dailey, a spokesman for Cincinnati-
based Kroger, declined to comment. Tiffani Washington, a
spokeswoman for Deerfield, Illinois-based Walgreen, and
Christine Cramer, a spokeswoman for Woonsocket, Rhode Island-
based CVS Caremark, also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is West Virginia v. CVS Pharmacy Inc., 11-1251,
4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals (Richmond). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JJ Unit Ordered to Pay $10 Million Over Motrin Injuries &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) unit must pay $10 million in damages to
the family of a 13-year-old girl who suffered skin burns and eye
damage after she took Children&#8217;s Motrin to treat a fever and
cough, a Pennsylvania jury ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jurors in state court in Philadelphia deliberated for 10
hours over two days before holding JJ&#8217;s McNeil Consumer
Products unit liable for Brianna Maya&#8217;s injuries. Maya, now 13,
was left blind in one eye and suffered burns over 84 percent of
her body after taking Motrin in 2000 when she was 3 1/2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling means that &#8220;JJ and McNeil will be called to
task&#8221; for failing to properly warn parents about Motrin&#8217;s
risks, Keith Jensen, a lawyer for Maya and her family, said in
an interview after the verdict was announced May 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JJ, the world&#8217;s second-biggest seller of medical products,
recalled more than 40 consumer brands last year, among them
varieties of children&#8217;s and infants&#8217; Tylenol, Motrin and St.
Joseph Aspirin, over fears they had been tainted by production
problems. The withdrawals cost the New Brunswick, New Jersey-
based company $900 million in sales and prompted regulators to
exercise more oversight at McNeil plants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker &#8220;strongly disagrees with today&#8217;s verdict and
we are considering out legal options,&#8221; Marc Boston, a McNeil
spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Maya v. Johnson  Johnson, 002879, February
Term 2009, Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County
(Philadelphia). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sirius XM Wins Preliminary Approval of Class-Action Accord &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sirius XM Radio Inc. (SIRI) won a judge&#8217;s preliminary approval to
settle a class-action lawsuit by a group of subscribers who
claimed the satellite-radio company violated antitrust law by
boosting prices after acquiring its only rival. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hearing will be held Aug. 8 to determine whether the
settlement, valued at $180 million, is &#8220;fair, reasonable and
adequate to the class,&#8221; U.S. District Judge Harold Baer said,
according to a filing May 20 in Manhattan. No cash payments will
be made under the deal, court papers show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. bought XM Satellite Holdings
Inc., its only competitor, in 2008. A subscriber, Carl Blessing,
sued in December 2009 claiming the company &#8220;abused its monopoly
power&#8221; after the merger by raising prices, breaching subscriber
contracts and making false and misleading statements to the
public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baer certified the complaint as a class action in March. A
settlement was reached before the judge ruled on whether New
York-based Sirius XM violated antitrust law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick Reilly, a Sirius XM spokesman, and James Sabella, a
lawyer for the subscribers, didn&#8217;t respond to e-mails seeking
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the settlement, Sirius agreed to not raise prices
this year, deferring a plan to boost the monthly price by $2.
Many class members paid a monthly multiradio charge of $8.99,
according to court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Blessing v. Sirius XM Radio Inc., 09-10035,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong&#8217;s Lehman Minibond Holders Approve Settlement Offer &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong investors in notes tied to failed Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) approved a settlement agreement that would return
as much as 96.5 percent of their original investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than the required 75 percent of holders of the
structured notes, or so-called minibonds, passed the accord
following three days of meetings in Hong Kong, according to a
statement from receiver PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP May 20. The
payments may be made in June, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A successful settlement would help end discontent that led
investors to hold almost daily protests outside bank branches in
Hong Kong, featuring banging of cymbals and bullhorns blaring,
after New York-based Lehman&#8217;s collapse in September 2008 wiped
out their investments. About 43,000 Hong Kong investors had
bought an estimated $1.8 billion of the minibonds from lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement covers about 31,000 buyers. Investors in the
24 series of bonds will get 70 percent to 93 percent of their
money back, PwC said in March. Banks distributing the minibonds
offered an additional payment that would bring eligible
investors&#8217; recovery levels to as much as 96.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A July 2009 repayment offer from 16 banks of at least 60
cents on the dollar for a total of HK$6.3 billion ($810 million)
failed to mollify some investors. Bank of China Ltd. (3988)&#8217;s Hong Kong
unit was the biggest seller of the notes on the island, while
HSBC Holdings Plc is the trustee for the minibonds program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notes were sold to investors including the elderly and
poorly educated people as well as mentally ill individuals,
according to an investigation by the city&#8217;s de facto central
bank that was made public by lawmakers in April 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current settlement, reached between HSBC and the Lehman
estate, is conditional upon the court order being valid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Says Mitsui Will Pay $1 Billion in Gulf Spill Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc (BP/) said a unit of Mitsui  Co. will pay $1.065 billion
to settle claims from last year&#8217;s Gulf of Mexico spill, the
first payment by one of the U.K. oil producer&#8217;s partners in the
failed Macondo well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP reached an agreement with MOEX Offshore 2007 LLC, which
had a 10 percent stake in the well, covering all claims between
the companies related to the spill, the London-based company
said May 20 in a statement. Mitsui said BP had claimed about
$2.1 billion. BP shares rose the most since January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To have one, admittedly the smaller of the two partners,
settling&#8221; and &#8220;joining sides is significant from the moral
point of view,&#8221; David Stedman, a London-based analyst at Daiwa
Securities, said by phone. &#8220;It looks on paper as a reasonably
good deal for Mitsui,&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Macondo well blowout, which killed 11 workers and
caused the biggest U.S. oil spill, led to hundreds of lawsuits
against BP and its partners and contractors. BP said it&#8217;s
working to ensure other parties, including Anadarko Petroleum
Corp. (APC), which held 25 percent in Macondo, rig owner Transocean
Ltd. (RIG) and cement provider Halliburton Co. (HAL), contribute
&#8220;appropriately.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEB, HVB Lose Asia Pacific Breweries Gambler Fraud Appeal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bayerische Hypo-und Vereinsbank AG and SEB AB lost an
appeal to Singapore&#8217;s top court seeking to recover $58.6 million
in loans taken out by a former Asia Pacific Breweries Ltd. (APB)
executive to fund his gambling habits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, also known as SEB, and HVB
were among four banks that had handed out S$117.1 million ($94.6
million) in loans in an &#8220;elaborate fraud&#8221; engineered by Chia
Teck Leng, the brewer&#8217;s former finance manager, Chief Justice
Chan Sek Keong wrote in a 99-page ruling May 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s Mizuho Financial Group Inc. and Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group Inc. withdrew their case against Singapore-based
Asia Pacific Breweries, which makes Tiger Beer, and Chia on the
seventh day of the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They tell a cautionary tale of how two foreign banks in
their eagerness to secure a banking relationship&#8221; with Asia
Pacific Breweries failed to exercise due diligence, Judge Chan
wrote. Chia, called a &#8220;compulsive gambler,&#8221; was jailed for 42
years in 2004 for cheating and forgery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asia Pacific Breweries &#8220;was itself a victim of fraud and
is not responsible to repay loans,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer
Roland Pirmez said in a statement to the Singapore Exchange May
20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both European banks had argued that Asia Pacific Breweries
should be liable for their losses as Chia was the most senior
finance person in the brewer&#8217;s Singapore unit and responsible
for financial matters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (SEBA), Singapore
Branch v Asia Pacific Breweries (Singapore) Pte Ltd.  Another
CA121/2009 and Bayerische Hypo-Und Vereinsbank
Aktieengesellschaft v Asia Pacific Breweries (Singapore) Pte

co-founder, who was found guilty of 14 counts against him in the
largest illegal stock-tipping case in a generation, had the
most-read litigation docket on the Bloomberg Law system last
week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A jury of eight women and four men in Manhattan returned
the verdict May 11 after hearing evidence that Rajaratnam, 53,
engaged in a seven-year conspiracy to trade on inside
information from corporate executives, bankers, consultants,
traders and directors of public companies including Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) He gained $63.8 million, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defense attorney John Dowd said that he would appeal the
verdict to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-01184, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan
Stanley increased their forecasts for crude-oil prices by more
than 20 percent, signaling a bullish outlook for commodities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman, which correctly advised investors to sell oil and
copper last month before a price slump, boosted its 12-month
prediction for Brent crude to $130 a barrel from $107, analysts
led by Jeffrey Currie said today in a report. Morgan Stanley
raised its estimate by 20 percent to an average $120 this year
and by 24 percent to $130 in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Goldman and Morgan Stanley join JPMorgan Chase  Co.
in saying price declines may present a buying opportunity,
interest-rate increases and the European debt crisis have raised
concerns that global growth may slow. China, the world&#8217;s biggest
consumer of everything from energy to copper and soybeans, has
increased borrowing costs four times since mid-October to cool
the fastest inflation since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Economic growth will likely be sufficient to tighten key
supply-constrained markets in the second half, leading to higher
prices from current levels,&#8221; the Goldman analysts said. They
also advised buying copper and zinc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent advanced as much as 2.3 percent to $112.65 on ICE
Futures Europe Exchange. Copper for delivery in three months
climbed 0.8 percent to settle at $8,861 a metric ton on the
London Metal Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities Decline &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI index of 24 raw materials
dropped about 10 percent through yesterday since New York-based
Goldman told investors on April 11 to sell a basket of
commodities including oil, copper and cotton. The gauge rose 1.2
percent today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are substantially more confident when the market is
focused on demand growth relative to forward supply constraints
as opposed to near-term transient supply shocks,&#8221; Currie said
today in a telephone interview in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent jumped 31 percent this year through April 11 amid
concern that supplies from the Middle East would be disrupted as
protests spread from Tunisia and Egypt. Rising oil prices may be
&#8220;sowing the seeds of future demand destruction,&#8221;, the Paris-
based International Energy Agency said on April 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices of metals and energy dropped &#8220;more in line with
near-term fundamentals,&#8221; Goldman said. A sustained loss of
Libyan crude production because of the conflict there and
disappointing output from non-OPEC nations will tighten the oil
market to critical levels in early 2012, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasoline Costs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pullback in U.S. gasoline prices &#8220;makes us much more
comfortable about demand as we go into the summer driving season
that kicks off with the Memorial Day this weekend,&#8221; Currie said
in the interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will
&#8220;very likely&#8221; raise production to make up for an estimated 1.5
million barrels a day shut in by Libya&#8217;s civil unrest, Morgan
Stanley analysts led by New York-based Hussein Allidina and
Chris Corda said today. The group has an estimated 2 million
barrels a day that can be brought to the market quickly, the
U.S. bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see flat prices moving higher as spare capacity
continues its fall to untenable levels,&#8221; the Morgan Stanley
analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sovereign debt in Europe, the contraction in Japan&#8217;s
economy and the end of the second round of quantitative easing
in the U.S. are among &#8220;potential triggers&#8221; for a loss of
confidence that pose a risk to oil, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net Longs Drop &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money managers reduced their net-long positions in U.S.
commodity futures and options by 11 percent in the week ended
May 17 to the lowest since July, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. They also reduced bullish bets on oil to a three-
month low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the MSCI All-Country World Index dropped 1.8
percent to the lowest in two months on signs that Europe&#8217;s
credit crisis had deteriorated as costs to protect Greek debt
from default surged to a record. Global manufacturing measured
by a JPMorgan index slowed for two consecutive months and stood
at 55 in April. A reading of 50 and above suggests expansion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil and gold will lead a rally in raw materials as
production fails to keep pace with demand, Ray Eyles, the chief
executive officer of JPMorgan&#8217;s Asia commodity business, said in
an interview last week. Oil supplies will trail consumption in
the second half as OPEC and other producers won&#8217;t increase
output fast enough, the bank said in a report on May 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper has declined 13 percent from a record $10,190 a ton
on Feb. 15. Goldman analysts recommended buying futures for June
2012 delivery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank also favors zinc for delivery in December 2012,
forecasting demand to outpace supply next year. The metal, used
in production of galvanized steel, has dropped 11 percent this
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Although we do not see the zinc balance as tight as
copper next year, given how low current prices are relative to
industry economics, we believe that zinc price risk is
substantially skewed to the upside,&#8221; according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil rose in New York as the dollar
declined, boosting commodities&#8217; appeal as an alternative
investment, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley
increased their price outlooks for crude. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures jumped 1.9 percent as the dollar slipped from a
nine-week high against the euro after German business confidence
unexpectedly stayed near a record in May. Goldman Sachs and
Morgan Stanley raised their estimates for Brent oil futures,
saying the conflict in Libya is eating into OPEC spare capacity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The dollar&#8217;s under pressure,&#8221; said Gene McGillian, an
analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.
&#8220;The upward revisions to some of the investment-bank oil
forecasts may be lending a certain positive sentiment to this
market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude for July delivery rose $1.89 to $99.59 a barrel on
the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest settlement since
May 18. Prices have climbed 42 percent in the past year. Futures
have switched direction each day for the past five sessions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices pared gains from the settlement after the American
Petroleum Institute reported at 4:30 p.m. that U.S. crude-oil
stockpiles decreased 860,000 barrels to 368.1 million. July oil
rose $1.70, or 1.7 percent, to $99.40 a barrel in electronic
trading at 4:31 p.m. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent crude for July settlement gained $2.43, or 2.2
percent, to $112.53 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. Prices are up 58 percent in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar fell 0.4 percent to $1.4105 per euro at 4:29
p.m. in New York after the German confidence report fueled bets
that the European Central Bank will resume boosting borrowing
costs. Yesterday, the dollar touched $1.397 per euro, the
highest level since March 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities Rise &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities surged after Goldman Sachs said it&#8217;s turning
&#8220;more bullish&#8221; on raw materials, spurring a jump in sugar,
copper, oil and other commodities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 commodities
advanced as much as 1.2 percent. It was up 0.7 percent at 339.10
at 4:29 p.m. in New York. Twelve of the commodities climbed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs raised its three-month outlook for Brent oil
to $115 a barrel, its six-month view to $120 and its 12-month
price estimate to $130. Morgan Stanley increased its average
forecast for Brent this year by 20 percent to $120 a barrel and
by 24 percent for 2012 to $130 a barrel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is only a matter of time until inventories and OPEC
spare capacity will become effectively exhausted, requiring
higher oil prices to restrain demand, keeping it in line with
available supplies,&#8221; Goldman Sachs analysts led by New York-
based David Greely said in a note e-mailed today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libyan Supply &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude exports from Libya, holder of Africa&#8217;s biggest
reserves, slumped 79 percent in March from February, as
political unrest curbed shipments, official data posted on the
Joint Organization Data Initiative website showed May 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Oil fundamentals remain extremely constructive,&#8221; Amrita Sen, an analyst at Barclays Capital in London, said in a
Bloomberg television interview with Francine Lacqua. &#8220;Libyan
supply is not going to come back to the market anytime soon.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is
unlikely to increase crude production quotas at its next meeting
June 8 in Vienna, said Richard Jones, deputy executive director
of the International Energy Agency, the Paris-based adviser to
28 nations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would be skeptical,&#8221; he said today at a press
conference in Brussels. &#8220;Knowing OPEC politics, it would be
difficult to make a decision in June.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IEA said last week that there is a &#8220;clear, urgent need
for additional supplies.&#8221; The statement suggests it may
coordinate the release of emergency oil stockpiles if OPEC
doesn&#8217;t raise production, the London-based Centre for Global
Energy Studies said in a report yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Inventories &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. crude-oil inventories probably fell 1.5 million
barrels, or 0.4 percent, in the seven days ended May 20 from
370.3 million the prior week, according to the median of 13
analyst estimates before an Energy Department report tomorrow.
Supplies dropped after flooding along the Mississippi River
limited imports and refineries increased the amount of crude
they processed, the survey showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Three times this year we&#8217;ve seen crude stocks fall,&#8221;
said Matt Smith, a commodities analyst for Summit Energy
Services Inc. in Louisville, Kentucky. &#8220;We&#8217;re not willing to
move down and test the lows we&#8217;ve seen around $94 because of
continued supply concerns and intermittent bouts of
bullishness.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasoline supplies probably gained 450,000 barrels last week
from 205.9 million in the prior week, the survey showed.
Consumption of the motor fuel jumped 2.5 percent to 9.05 million
barrels a day during the second week in May, the biggest weekly
increase since April 8.Gasoline demand typically peaks during
the summer months in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasoline for June delivery rose 5.47 cents, or 1.9 percent,
to settle at $2.9928 a gallon on the Nymex. Futures have
advanced 52 percent in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 523,203
contracts as of 4:29 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 493,860
contracts yesterday, the lowest level in three weeks. Open
interest was 1.53 million contracts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will introduce a new
version of its Windows Phone software by this fall that includes
an enhanced Twitter connection, hands-free messaging and an in-
box for multiple e-mail accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code-named Mango, the software has 500 added features and
will come out on phones produced by new partners Acer Inc. (2353),
Fujitsu Ltd. (6702) and ZTE Corp. (000063), Microsoft said today in a statement.
Previously announced partners, including Nokia Oyj (NOK1V), also will
produce phones with the new software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is rushing to bolster its phone features after
handsets with the current operating system -- Windows Phone 7 --
didn&#8217;t sell as well as analysts projected. The Redmond,
Washington-based company, an early entrant to the smartphone
software field, has lost market share to Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPhone and
Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Android in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What Microsoft introduced looks great -- from a
technology perspective, this is probably what Windows Phone 7
should have launched with,&#8221; said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst
at Stamford, Connecticut-based Gartner Inc. &#8220;The problem is
it&#8217;s not something shipping immediately. Users aren&#8217;t going to
see it until fall.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bigger Market &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is banking on reaching more users than it could
before. Mango will be available in additional countries, at
lower prices than the current Windows Phone 7, opening up a
potential market that&#8217;s four times larger than its current
opportunity, Andy Lees, president of Microsoft&#8217;s mobile
business, said today at a company event. Microsoft is adding
support for languages, including simplified and traditional
Chinese, Japanese, Russian and Korean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software will have an e-mail in-box that can combine
messages from several different accounts. It also will include
better integration with Twitter Inc. and LinkedIn Corp.&#8217;s social
networks, as well as speech-to-text features that let users
write messages and chat without using their hands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mango has facial-recognition software, so users can easily
tag who is in the picture when they post it on Facebook Inc.&#8217;s
site. Customers also can switch between text messages, Facebook
chat and Windows instant messages within the same conversation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users can group contacts into a personalized tile on their
main phone screen. The tile will then show updates about those
contacts on that screen, without opening any programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current Windows Phone manufacturers HTC Corp., Samsung
Electronics Co. and LG Electronics Inc. also will make phones
with Mango, Microsoft said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dell&#8217;s Plans &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dell Inc., which also currently makes a Windows Phone, has
nothing to announce at present about a Mango version, said Ellen
Murphy, a spokeswoman for the Round Rock, Texas-based company.
Melissa Havel, a Microsoft spokeswoman, declined to comment on
Dell&#8217;s plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft previously discussed the Mango software last
month, saying it would let users run several programs at once
and allow developers to write programs that call up information
about a place or item when it&#8217;s viewed through the handset&#8217;s
camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it shipped more than 2 million copies of its
Windows Phone software in the December quarter, a figure that
fell short of some analysts&#8217; estimates. The company declined to
provide a similar figure for the recent quarter and has refused
to provide sales information, rather than shipments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s share of the mobile operating system market
fell to 3.6 percent in the first quarter, from 6.8 percent in
the year-earlier period, according to Gartner Inc. Android rose
almost fourfold to 36 percent from 9.6 percent, while Apple&#8217;s
iOS climbed to 17 percent from 15 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker, fell 2 cents
to $24.15 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
The shares have dropped 13 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil options volatility decreased as
the underlying futures rose after the dollar declined and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley increased their oil-
price outlooks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
July, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 33.9 percent as of 3 p.m. in New York,
down from 35.8 percent yesterday. Futures prices have switched
direction each day for the past five sessions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude for July delivery gained $1.89, or 1.9 percent, to
$99.59 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest
settlement since May 18. Prices have climbed 42 percent in the
past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most active contracts in electronic trading today were
July $90 puts, with 2,036 lots changing hands. They lost 47
cents to 66 cents a barrel. July $95 puts, the next-most active
option, dropped 85 cents to $1.58 a barrel with 1,910 lots
trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
releases information on floor trading, where the bulk of options
trading occurs, the next business day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;July $90 puts were the most active options traded
yesterday, with 7,154 lots changing hands. They rose 39 cents to
$1.13 a barrel. The next-most active options, December $125
calls, fell 25 cents to $1.99 a barrel on volume of 5,153 lots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open interest was highest for December 2012 $80 puts with
46,330 contracts. Next were December 2011 $120 calls with 43,646
and December 2011 $100 calls with 37,321. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copper futures rose in New York as
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., one of Wall Street&#8217;s leading commodity
traders, advised investors to buy the metal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs also recommended buying zinc and crude oil,
saying economic growth will probably be strong enough to tighten
some markets with supply constraints in the second half, leading
prices to climb. JPMorgan Chase  Co. said copper is &#8220;well
supported&#8221; and &#8220;will not collapse.&#8221; Yesterday, the metal had
the biggest drop in almost two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe that current copper-price levels offer an
attractive opportunity to establish long positions in the
metal,&#8221; Goldman Sachs analysts, led by the London-based head of
commodity research Jeffrey Currie, said today in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper futures for July delivery advanced 2.15 cents, or
0.5 percent, to $4.013 a pound at 1:12 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Yesterday, the metal fell 3.2 percent, the most since May
11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures have dropped 14 percent from a record $4.6575 a
Feb. 15, partly on concern that interest-rate increases in
China, the world&#8217;s biggest consumer of industrial metals, will
curtail demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The question is not if Chinese consumption will grow by
12 percent or 9 percent, but that it is growing,&#8221; Christian Schirmeister, an executive director of JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A.,
said today at a conference in Singapore. &#8220;China physical demand
is finally beginning to show up in the nearby spreads, although
the volumes still are soft.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months gained $67, or 0.8 percent, to $8,861 a metric ton ($4.02
a pound). Aluminum, lead, nickel, zinc and tin also advanced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia may hold a tender this year
for the rights to explore an offshore deposit near an oil field

&lt;p&gt;OAO Rosneft gained the most in more
two weeks after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. increased its
recommendation on the Russian oil producer&#8217;s shares to &#8220;buy&#8221;
from &#8220;neutral,&#8221; citing potential tax relief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares rallied 2.8 percent to 228.06 rubles by the 6:45

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Rosneft is well-positioned to benefit from potential tax
relief in upstream production,&#8221; Goldman Sachs analysts said in
an e-mailed report. &lt;/p&gt;

from $8.80. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian stocks rebounded from their
lowest in almost six months after crude advanced on speculation
unrest in the Middle East will reduce supply and Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. increased its oil price forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Micex Index of 30 stocks gained 1.6 percent to 1,598.82
by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, paring yesterday&#8217;s 1.9 percent
slide. OAO Rosneft, Russia&#8217;s biggest oil producer, and OAO
Gazprom, the country&#8217;s gas export monopoly, both rallied more
than 2.5 percent. OAO Sberbank, Russia&#8217;s largest bank, rose 2.2
percent. The dollar-denominated RTS Index added 2 percent to
1,800.04. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude for July delivery rose as much as $2.39 to $100.09 a
barrel in New York after Goldman and Morgan Stanley increased
their oil-price forecasts as conflict in Libya prolonged the
loss of output. U.S. inventories probably dropped last week,
according to a Bloomberg News survey before an Energy Department
report tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will
&#8220;very likely&#8221; raise production to make up for an estimated 1.5
million barrels a day shut in by Libya&#8217;s civil unrest, Morgan
Stanley analysts said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman, which correctly advised investors to sell crude
oil and copper last month before a price slump, boosted its 12-
month prediction for Brent crude to $130 a barrel from $107,
analysts led by Jeffrey Currie said in a report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley raised its Brent estimate by 20 percent to
average $120 a barrel this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking Heart &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosneft jumped 2.8 percent to 228.06 rubles as Goldman
analysts increased its recommendation to &#8220;buy&#8221; from
&#8220;neutral,&#8221; citing potential tax relief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Russia and crude have both taken heart from a revision to
Goldman Sachs&#8217; oil estimates as OPEC&#8217;s spare capacity is eaten
up by continued supply disruptions from Libya and elsewhere,&#8221;
Julian Rimmer, a trader of Russian shares at CF Global Trading
in London, said in e-mailed comments today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian stocks have slumped 8.2 percent this month as
global commodity prices fell. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index
has dropped 6.8 percent over the same period. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil rose in New York after its
biggest loss in more than a week, on signs of shrinking crude
inventories and as a drop in the dollar heightened the oil&#8217;s
appeal for protecting against inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley increased their
oil-price forecasts as conflict in Libya prolonged the loss of
supplies. An Energy Department report tomorrow may show U.S.
crude inventories fell last week. Gasoline demand typically
jumps from the Memorial Day holiday as motorists take to the
roads for summer vacations. Oil also gained as the dollar
weakened versus the euro after data showed Germany&#8217;s economy
grew at the fastest pace in almost a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Oil fundamentals remain extremely constructive,&#8221; Amrita Sen, an analyst at Barclays Capital in London, said in Bloomberg
television interview with Francine Lacqua. &#8220;Libyan supply is
not going to come back to the market anytime soon. We should get
a good Memorial Day driving season in the U.S.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude for July delivery rose as much as $1.47, or 1.5
percent, to $99.17 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, and was at $99.01 at 1:30 p.m. London
time. It tumbled $2.40 yesterday, the biggest drop since May 11.
Prices are up 41 percent from a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent crude for July settlement gained $1.55, or 1.4
percent, to $111.30 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. Prices are up 57 percent the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Matter of Time&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is only a matter of time until inventories and OPEC
spare capacity will become effectively exhausted, requiring
higher oil prices to restrain demand, keeping it in line with
available supplies,&#8221; Goldman Sachs analysts led by New York-
based David Greely said in a note e-mailed today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude exports from Libya, holder of Africa&#8217;s biggest
reserves, slumped 79 percent in March from February, as
political unrest curbed shipments, official data posted on the
Joint Organization Data Initiative website showed May 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley increased its average forecast for Brent
this year by 20 percent to $120 a barrel and by 24 percent for
2012 to $130 a barrel. Goldman Sachs raised its 12-month price
estimate for the European benchmark to $130 a barrel and
recommended investors buy Brent for settlement in December 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petromatrix GmbH, a consultant based in Zug, Switzerland,
said that prices cannot sustain levels of $130 a barrel because
the burden of higher fuel costs would reduce demand, according
to consultants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What we know from 2008 and early 2011 is that, at $130,
there is demand destruction,&#8221; Olivier Jakob, Petromatrix&#8217;s Zug-
based managing director, said in a report. &#8220;The sustainability
of those price levels is difficult due to demand destruction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent traded at a premium of $12.69 a barrel to U.S.
futures, compared with $12.40 yesterday. The difference between
front-month contracts in London and New York surged to a record
$19.54 on Feb. 21. It averaged 76 cents last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OPEC Help &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meets in
Vienna on June 8. The International Energy Agency&#8217;s statement
last week on a &#8220;clear, urgent need for additional supplies&#8221;
suggests it may coordinate the release of emergency oil
stockpiles if OPEC doesn&#8217;t raise production, the London-based
Centre for Global Energy Studies said in a report yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;OPEC has probably got room to increase production, so if
the market is tight in any way they can come in and help,&#8221; said
David Lennox, a resource analyst at Fat Prophets in Sydney, who
predicted oil will average $115 this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent crude has climbed 18 percent this year as unrest in
the Middle East and North Africa toppled leaders in Tunisia and
Egypt and spread to Libya, Iran and Syria. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil Inventories &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. crude stockpiles dropped 1.9 million barrels last week
from 370.3 million, according to the median of 11 analyst
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. Gasoline supplies probably
gained 500,000 barrels, the survey showed. The industry-funded
American Petroleum Institute will report its own data today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro climbed 0.2 percent to $1.4081 as of 1:32 p.m.
London time, after earlier weakening to $1.4002. German gross
domestic product increased 1.5 percent when adjusted for
seasonal swings, in line with a May 13 estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least one person was killed and 25 hurt in a fire and
explosion at a refinery in Abadan, Iran, during a visit by
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, state news agencies reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fire occurred in one wing of the facility and was
extinguished immediately, the state-owned Fars agency said
today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ICICI Prudential Asset Management
Co., India&#8217;s third-largest money manager, plans to sell a fund
that will allow locals to invest in assets overseas within the
next 12 months, Managing Director Nimesh Shah said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re looking at completing our product bouquet,&#8221; Shah,
who is also the money manager&#8217;s chief executive officer, said in
an interview at his office in Mumbai today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s central bank in 2004 allowed residents to invest up
to $200,000 overseas annually, or $1 million for a family of
five. That&#8217;s encouraged asset managers including JPMorgan Asset
Management India, Mirae Asset Global Investment (India) and DSP
Blackrock Investment Managers to sell products similar to the
one being planned by ICICI Prudential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICICI Prudential Asset Management, a venture between ICICI
Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC), India&#8217;s largest non-state lender and U.K.-based
Prudential Plc., had 735.52 billion rupees ($16.3 billion) in
assets at the end of March. The money manager offers 22 equity
funds, 19 debt plans and four hybrid funds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) hired Huw Pill of the European Central Bank to replace Erik Nielsen as its
chief European economist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pill will join the investment bank on Aug. 22 in London
after a decade at the Frankfurt-based ECB, where he was most
recently deputy director general of research, according to an
internal Goldman Sachs memo sent to employees today and obtained
by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recruiting of Pill comes a week since UniCredit SpA (UCG)
named Nielsen its global chief economist after 15 years at
Goldman Sachs. It marks a further revamping of the U.S. bank&#8217;s
economic division following Jim O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s departure as its chief
at the end of last year to chair Goldman Sachs Asset Management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pill has also led the ECB&#8217;s monetary policy stance division
as well as working at the Bank of England and teaching at
Harvard University, the memo said. He holds a degree from Oxford
University and a Ph.D from Stanford University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s economics team, which already includes
former ECB economist Natacha Valla, currently expects the
central bank to raise its key interest rate to 1.75 percent by
the end of this year from 1.25 percent. It predicts the euro
area economy will grow 2.1 percent this year with inflation
averaging 2.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highland Capital Management LP, the
debt manager with about $22 billion in assets under management,
and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) were sued by a Houston pension plan
over claims that willful looting led to the demise of the
Highland Crusader Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highland co-founders James Dondero and Mark Okada caused
the Crusader Fund to engage in &#8220;dozens of self-interested
transactions&#8221; with Highland affiliates designed to benefit the
firm at the fund&#8217;s expense, the Houston Municipal Employees
Pension System said in the complaint. The pension plan, which
invested $15 million in the fund, is seeking unspecified losses
caused by the alleged wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Crusader Fund &#8220;was harmed by virtue of being stuck
with poor quality assets that it would not have had if the
partnership had been managed in the best interests of the
partnership and its limited partners,&#8221; lawyers for the pension
plan said in the complaint filed in Delaware Chancery Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highland, founded by Dondero and Okada in Dallas in 1993,
announced plans in October 2008 to shutter its flagship Crusader
Fund and the Highland Credit Strategies Fund over a three-year
period after suffering losses on high-yield, high-risk loans and
other types of debt. Since then, the firm and two JPMorgan units
that administered the funds have been sued over claims of
fraudulently misleading investors about the health of the funds
and failing to provide accurate monthly statements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are extremely disappointed by the action filed today
by a single law firm in the Delaware Court, which is an attempt
to derail the continued hard work of over 100 investors,&#8221; Armel
Leslie, a Highland Capital spokesman, said in an e-mailed
statement. &#8220;As highlighted by the recently announced agreement
among investors in the Highland Credit Strategies hedge fund, we
are confident that an equitable solution that benefits all
Crusader investors will be reached. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highland announced in April that it had won approval from a
court in Bermuda to distribute assets of the Highland Credit
Strategies fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highland froze limited partner withdrawals from the funds
in 2008 even while it managed to reduce its own investment in
the Crusader Fund from $395 million to $16 million, according to
the pension plan&#8217;s complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, had no
immediate comment on the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Houston Municipal Employees Pension System v.
Highland Crusader Fund GP, CA6510, Delaware Chancery Court
(Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HR Block Sued by U.S. to Stop Purchase of TaxAct Maker &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department sued HR Block Inc. (HRB) to stop its
proposed purchase of TaxAct, saying the companies&#8217; merger would
stifle competition and raise prices in the growing market for
consumer tax-preparation software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department claimed in an antitrust complaint filed
yesterday in federal court in Washington that the deal would
eliminate a company that has competed aggressively with HR
Block and &#8216;&#8216;disrupted&#8221; the U.S. digital do-it-yourself tax-
preparation market through low pricing and product innovation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HR Block, the biggest U.S. tax preparation firm, agreed to
buy privately held 2SS Holdings Inc., the developer of TaxAct
digital tax preparation products, on Oct. 13 in a transaction
valued at $287.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The documents we acquired from parties during the course
of our investigation will show that the principal purpose of the
transaction was to eliminate a competitor,&#8221; Christine Varney,
the head of the Justice Department&#8217;s Antitrust Division, said
during a conference call yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An end of head-to-head competition between TaxAct and HR
Block would leave only two major providers of digital tax-
preparation services for consumers, the department said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William C. Cobb, HR Block&#8217;s president and chief executive
officer, said yesterday in an e-mailed statement that the
Justice Department&#8217;s decision would &#8220;stifle smart business
growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. HR Block, 1:11-cv-00948, U.S. District
Court for the District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abbott Labs Sued on Claims Humira Caused Permanent Eye Damage &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbott Laboratories (ABT) was sued by a New York Web designer who
claimed its top-selling drug Humira, which she took for Crohn&#8217;s
disease, permanently damaged her optic nerves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctor who treated Jamie Bixby at the New York Eye and
Ear Infirmary in Brooklyn in 2008 said Bixby&#8217;s optic neuritis
was &#8220;related to her use of Humira,&#8221; according to the lawsuit,
which was filed May 20 in Chicago federal court, near the
drugmaker&#8217;s headquarters in Abbott Park, Illinois. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bixby said she was told by a nurse on the company&#8217;s
telephone helpline that the eye pain she began experiencing
after a month of Humira treatments wasn&#8217;t related to the drug.
An eye doctor diagnosed Bixby with permanent damage to the
myelin sheath of her optic nerves a month later, after she
sought emergency treatment when vision in one eye became blurry
with black holes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Abbott had warned Bixby or her gastroenterologist &#8220;that
Humira could be the source of her eye pain, she would have
immediately discontinued taking the drug and would have
immediately obtained proper emergency medical treatment,&#8221; Bixby
said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Humira has more than 12 years of clinical and safety data
and best-in-class efficacy,&#8221; Adelle Infante, an Abbott
spokeswoman, said in an e-mail yesterday. &#8220;The therapeutic
risks associated with Humira, including disorders of the nervous
systems, are well known and documented in the prescribing
label.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bixby v. Abbott Laboratories, 1:11-cv-3414,

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, UBS, Deutsche Bank Said to Be Added to Probe &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., UBS AG and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) are being
probed in an expanded investigation by New York Attorney General
Eric Schneiderman into mortgage securitization, according to a
person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four bond insurers also were subpoenaed: Ambac Financial
Group Inc. (ABKFQ), MBIA Inc. (MBI), Syncora Holdings Ltd. (SYCRF) and Assured
Guaranty Ltd., according to the person, who couldn&#8217;t be
identified because the probe isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schneiderman is seeking information on claims paid out
during and after the economic crisis and any information or
documents related to litigation or settlements with the banks,
according to the person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Morgan
Stanley (MS) are already part of the probe, a person familiar with
the matter said earlier this month. Schneiderman, who took
office in January, is examining mortgage practices and the
packaging and sale of loans to investors, according to a person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lauren Passalacqua, a spokeswoman for the New York attorney
general, declined to comment. Michael Fitzgerald, a spokesman
for Ambac, declined to comment. Torie von Alt, a spokeswoman for
UBS, and JPMorgan spokesman Tom Kelly declined to comment.
Deutsche Bank said a spokesperson wasn&#8217;t immediately available
to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syncora and Assured Guaranty didn&#8217;t immediately return
telephone calls or e-mails seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Brown, a spokesman for MBIA, confirmed that the

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher Court Will Decide Whether Picard Can Sue JPMorgan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bankruptcy judge doesn&#8217;t have the authority to decide
whether the trustee liquidating Bernard Madoff&#8217;s firm has the
right to sue JPMorgan Chase  Co. for $6.4 billion, a higher
court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in New York said she
would determine whether trustee Irving Picard has standing to
sue the bank on behalf of the con man&#8217;s customers, as JPMorgan
requested. The question of Picard&#8217;s status requires
&#8220;significant interpretation&#8221; of federal non-bankruptcy law
that isn&#8217;t the province of a bankruptcy court, she said in a
written opinion yesterday explaining her May 4 decision to take
the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its request, &#8220;JPMorgan has satisfied the standard for
mandatory withdrawal&#8221; of the case to a higher court, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan argued that Picard was hired to liquidate the
Madoff firm, and wasn&#8217;t empowered by law to mount a class-action
suit to recover money on behalf of Madoff customers. Picard,
claiming that he was suing as a single entity, not a class,
&#8220;misses the point,&#8221; the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The issue is whether seeking damages on behalf of more
than 50 persons or prospective class members triggers&#8221; a law
that might bar Picard from bringing his suit, the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McMahon&#8217;s opinion is another challenge to Picard, who has
filed more than 1,000 suits claiming $100 billion for investors
in the Ponzi scheme. HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) has asked U.S. District
Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan to dismiss a $9 billion lawsuit
against it and so-called feeder funds, saying Picard isn&#8217;t
allowed by law to bring such suits on behalf of Madoff
customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the HSBC case temporarily, Rakoff agreed with the
U.K. bank that Picard&#8217;s lawsuit raised issues beyond the
jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court where Picard filed the
suit. He said he would decide whether Picard can bring common-
law claims such as unjust enrichment and can sue on behalf of
customers, since his job is to liquidate the Madoff firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard, whose firm was paid $146 million through March for
work since Madoff&#8217;s 2008 arrest, has fought to keep his cases in
bankruptcy court. JPMorgan &#8220;no doubt hopes to distance itself
both from the thousands of victims of that scheme and from other
alleged wrongdoers&#8221; by going to district court, Picard said in
a March filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeal is Picard v. JPMorgan Chase  Co., 1:11-
cv-00913, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Faulted on Failing to Catch Credit-Crunch &#8216;Bandits&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 2009, Attorney General Eric Holder vowed before
television cameras to prosecute those responsible for the market
collapse a year earlier, saying the U.S. would be &#8220;relentless&#8221;
in pursuing corporate criminals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 18 months since, no senior Wall Street executive has
been criminally charged, and some lawmakers are questioning
whether the U.S. Justice Department has been aggressive enough
after declining to bring cases against officials at American
International Group Inc. (AIG) and Countrywide Financial Corp.,
Bloomberg News&#8217; Justin Blum reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutions of three categories of crime that could be
linked to the causes of the crisis -- corporate, securities and
bank fraud -- declined last fiscal year by 39 percent from 2003,
the period after the accounting scandals at Enron Corp. and
WorldCom Inc., Justice Department records show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You need a massive prosecutorial effort,&#8221; said Solomon
Wisenberg, a white-collar defense attorney at Barnes  Thornburg
LLP in Washington and a former federal prosecutor. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see
evidence that it&#8217;s happening. If we were talking baseball, it
would be at the AAA level.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation
dispute that, saying they are continuing to investigate
potential wrongdoing connected to the emergency, and some probes
didn&#8217;t find criminal behavior. They say they stepped up

&lt;p&gt;Ensco, U.S. Seek, Get More Time to Reach Deep-Water Deal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensco Offshore Co. and the U.S. Justice Department sought
and received more time to negotiate an end to its lawsuit over
deep-water oil drilling permits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Martin Feldman in New Orleans yesterday
gave the government an 11-day extension until June 20 to act on
six offshore drilling permit applications that Ensco claims were
unreasonably delayed by regulators. Ensco and the government
asked for the delay in a joint filing on May 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both sides said an 11-day temporary delay of the judge&#8217;s
May 10 order would &#8220;prevent further unnecessary litigation.&#8221;
If they can&#8217;t reach a settlement by June 20, they may seek to
extend the stay to continue talks, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 10, Feldman, ruling on one of six issues in the
protracted suit, agreed with Ensco arguments that the London-
based company&#8217;s applications to the U.S. Interior Department had
been &#8220;unreasonably delayed&#8221; and he ordered the government to
act within 30 days on six deepwater drilling permit requests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Interior Department opposed Ensco&#8217;s suit, saying that a
delay in issuing new permits was needed to give the industry
time to boost safety and spill-response capabilities after the
Deepwater Horizon drilling rig off the Louisiana coast exploded
in April 20, 2010. The blast and spill released 4.1 million
barrels of crude from BP Plc (BP/)&#8217;s Macondo well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama temporarily halted all drilling in
waters deeper than 500 feet in May 2010. Feldman threw out the
ban as overly broad and punitive to the Gulf Coast economy. The
government imposed a similar, second ban that was withdrawn in
October. In February, Feldman found the Obama administration in
contempt for continuing to stall the resumption of deep-water
drilling through what he called a de-facto ban. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Ensco Offshore Co. v. Salazar, 2:10-cv-01941,
U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New
Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Appeal of 899 Million-Euro Fine May Limit EU Powers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s challenge to an 899 million-euro ($1.26
billion) European Union penalty for failing to comply with an
antitrust ruling may lead to a curb on regulators&#8217; powers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest software company will tell judges at an
appeal hearing today that in 2008 the European Commission failed
to give it sufficient guidance to avoid the fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is the only company in more than 50 years of EU
competition policy to be penalized for failing to comply with an
order. The Brussels-based commission said it breached an earlier
ruling by overcharging for licenses that rivals needed to
connect products to Windows computers. As the first appeal of
such a decision, the judges at the EU General Court in
Luxembourg will clarify the scope of the commission&#8217;s power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not about the money for Microsoft, it&#8217;s not about
the money for the commission or the other applicants,&#8221; said
Nicolas Petit, a competition law professor at the University of
Liege in Belgium. &#8220;At the heart of the case is whether a
regulator can find and penalize infringements without really
saying what the substance of the law is.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission, the EU&#8217;s antitrust authority, imposed the
899 million-euro fine as a so-called periodic penalty payment on
Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft for failing to comply with a
2004 antitrust order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the initial decision, Microsoft was fined 497 million
euros and ordered to provide data to competitors to allow
servers to connect to computers using the Windows operating
system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft was also required to limit to a &#8220;reasonable&#8221;
amount the royalties it charged for the technology. An EU court
in September 2007 rejected Microsoft&#8217;s appeal of that decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s case is the last remnant of years of disputes with
the commission that resulted in fines totaling 1.68 billion
euros. Microsoft agreed to a settlement in 2009 in a bid to
close a long chapter in the company&#8217;s uneasy relationship with
the EU regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for the commission, declined
to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is T-167/08, Microsoft v. European Commission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Galleon Trader Slaine Recorded Meetings With Goffer &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Slaine, a former Galleon Group LLC employee who
pleaded guilty to criminal charges, told jurors in the insider-
trading trial of Zvi Goffer that he wore a body wire to help
gather evidence for the government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slaine, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy and securities
fraud in December 2009, testified yesterday in federal court in
Manhattan that he cooperated with federal agents for about 2 1/2
years to try to avoid prison. Prosecutors played recordings of
meetings in which Slaine, pretending to be considering a
position with Goffer&#8217;s firm Incremental Capital LLC, tried to
learn the source of Goffer&#8217;s tips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors claim Goffer&#8217;s source was Jason Goldfarb, a
Brooklyn, New York, lawyer who got tips from Brien Santarlas and
Arthur Cutillo, two former lawyers in the New York office of the
firm Ropes  Gray LLP. Santarlas, who has pleaded guilty and is
also cooperating with the government, completed his testimony
yesterday. Goldfarb and Cutillo have also pleaded guilty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goffer, 34, founded Incremental Capital after he was fired
from Galleon, his lawyer, William Barzee, said in his opening
statement to jurors May 18. Goffer is being tried with his
brother, Emanuel Goffer, 32, and Michael Kimelman, 40, both
former traders at Incremental. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Goffer, 10-cr-00056, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Appeals Judge&#8217;s $502 Million Lehman Ruling &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp., ordered by a judge to return $501.8
million in deposits to Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) and pay
interest, appealed the ruling yesterday in a higher court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck signed the final judgment
last week after a November finding that Bank of America took
deposits unrelated to its loans to Lehman during the 2008
financial crisis and must return them. He set interest at 9
percent from November 2008 to December 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, argued
that it had a right to take Lehman&#8217;s deposits to offset its
loans, based on &#8220;uncontradicted legal rules and written
contracts.&#8221; It filed a notice of appeal yesterday in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We look forward to a review on appeal by the U.S.
District Court,&#8221; Lawrence Grayson, a spokesman for the bank,
said in an e-mail yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is one of several involving banks such as Barclays
Plc (BARC) and JPMorgan Chase  Co. that Peck is considering as New
York-based Lehman, which filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S.
history more than two years ago, sues to recover money to pay
creditors. The defunct firm, which has said creditors stand to
get an average of 18.6 cents on the dollar, lost an $11 billion
lawsuit against Barclays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman&#8217;s lenders, including Bank of America, became
&#8220;increasingly uneasy&#8221; about the investment bank&#8217;s financial
health in the summer of 2008, Peck wrote in November. Later that
year, Bank of America took collateral posted by Lehman to cover
overdrafts, using it to offset amounts owed on unrelated
derivatives deals, according to the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank didn&#8217;t first ask Peck for relief from the
bankruptcy law provision that prevents such seizures, called the
automatic stay, Peck said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peck ruled that an earlier security agreement drawn up by
Bank of America related only to Lehman&#8217;s intraday overdrafts and
shouldn&#8217;t have been used to offset derivative transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
08-13555, and the lawsuit is Bank of America NA v. Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-01753, both in U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America $410 Million Overdraft Fee Accord Approved &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp., the largest U.S. lender by assets,
won preliminary court approval for a $410 million settlement
with consumers who claimed the bank illegally charged excessive
overdraft fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge James Lawrence King in Miami yesterday
tentatively approved the accord between about 1 million account
holders and the bank, according to minutes from a hearing posted
on the court&#8217;s website. A final approval hearing is set for
November. The judge will award plaintiff attorneys&#8217; fees from
the $410 million fund, said one of the lead lawyers for the
consumers, Jeremy Alters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anne Pace, a spokeswoman for Charlotte, North Carolina-
based Bank of America, said the bank already has made changes to
its overdraft policies, including the elimination of overdraft
fees for debit card transactions and reduced fees for customers
who overdraw their accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re pleased to reach a fair resolution to this
matter,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Institutions including Citigroup Inc. (C), JPMorgan Chase  Co.
and Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) were named in related lawsuits.
Yesterday&#8217;s settlement is only with Bank of America. Bank of
America didn&#8217;t admit any liability in the cases, Alters said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re Checking Account Overdraft Litigation,
09-02036, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida
(Miami). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Dynamics, Boeing Backed by High Court in A-12 Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court set aside a ruling that had put the
federal government on track to collect $3 billion from Boeing
Co. (BA) and General Dynamics Corp. (GD) in a 20-year-old fight over a
canceled Navy aircraft contract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices unanimously said the government forfeited one
aspect of its claim against the companies by invoking the so-
called state secrets privilege to avoid disclosing sensitive
information in the litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling sent the dispute back to a lower court. The
justices also rejected a bid by General Dynamics to reinstate a
$1.2 billion award the companies won at an earlier stage in the
litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Neither side will be entirely happy with the resolution
we reach today,&#8221; Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal appeals court had said the Navy was justified in
canceling the A-12 Avenger contract on grounds that the
companies failed to meet their obligations. The ruling put the
government in line to recover $1.35 billion in payments, plus
the interest that has accrued over two decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In setting aside that ruling, the Supreme Court said the
government&#8217;s invocation of the state secrets privilege prevented
the courts from resolving one part of the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fight stems from one of the largest defense procurement
fiascos in U.S. history. The A-12, designed to penetrate heavily
defended locations, never made it into production in spite of
years of development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are General Dynamics v. United States, 09-1298,
and Boeing v. United States, 09-1302. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-UBS Client Jackson Given One Year Probation in Tax Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former UBS AG (UBSN) client who pleaded guilty to failing to
tell U.S. authorities about an offshore account avoided prison
at the hands of a judge who will sentence her father today for a
similar offense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucille Abrahamsen Jackson, 42, got one year of probation
yesterday in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, where her
father, Harry Abrahamsen, also pleaded guilty last year. In
pleading, Jackson said that her father set up a Swiss bank
account in her name in 1992 to evade U.S. taxes and that its
value reached $759,376 in 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jackson is one of more than two dozen former UBS clients
who pleaded guilty to tax crimes. Zurich-based UBS avoided U.S.
prosecution in February 2009 by paying $780 million, turning
over the names of U.S. account holders and saying it helped
Americans hide assets from the Internal Revenue Service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I commend the government for going after these offshore
tax cheats,&#8221; U.S. District Judge Dennis Cavanaugh said at the
hearing. &#8220;There&#8217;s no question that this is serious. However, in
the big scheme of things, this is definitely on the lesser side
of the types of cases that the government prosecutes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jackson, of Hillsdale, New Jersey, has &#8220;already paid a
significant penalty, both financially and personally,&#8221; the
judge said. He denied a request by prosecutors to sentence her
to six months of home confinement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jackson admitted she filed a false tax return in 2005, and
she failed to file required Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts
Reports, or FBARs, from 2000 to 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a civil penalty, she had to pay 50 percent of the
highest annual balance of the account in those years. She paid
an FBAR penalty of $379,688. With back taxes and penalties, she
paid more than $400,000, said her lawyer, Robert Mintz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would like to express how deeply remorseful I am,&#8221;
Jackson told Cavanaugh as she wept. Jackson, who runs a printing
company, said her actions affected her family and her employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Jackson, 10-00797, U.S. District Court,
District of New Jersey (Newark). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Litigation Departments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Paid Managers, Lawyers $27.1 Million in April &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., whose fees to advisers have
exceeded $1.26 billion during its bankruptcy, paid lawyers and
managers $27.1 million in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weil, Gotshal  Manges LLP, based in New York, was paid
$293.8 million through April for acting as Lehman&#8217;s lead
bankruptcy law firm, including almost $7.9 million last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restructuring firm Alvarez  Marsal LLC, whose co-founder
Bryan Marsal runs the defunct investment bank, made $431.7
million in &#8220;interim management&#8221; fees for 31 1/2 months of
work, including $8.9 million last month, according to a filing
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marsal, who bills Lehman hourly, aims to raise $61 billion
by selling the defunct c ompany&#8217;s assets to pay $322 billion in
claims, giving creditors 18.6 cents on the dollar, on average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimberly Macleod, a Lehman spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t respond to
an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the world&#8217;s fourth-biggest investment bank, Lehman is
fighting for control of a $61 billion liquidation plan with a
group of bondholders including hedge fund Paulson  Co. and a
rival group of derivatives creditors that includes Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan Stanley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TPG Capital, the U.S. buyout firm
that manages $48 billion, plans to hire Steve Sun from Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. as a China partner, two people familiar with
the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sun, a managing director at Goldman Sachs&#8217;s private-equity
unit, has resigned from the New York-based bank, the people said,
asking not to be identified before an announcement. Sun hasn&#8217;t
returned calls seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TPG has been seeking native Chinese to help it compete for
investments in China after senior managers Shan Weijian and Mary
Ma left in the past year to join other asset managers. China is
Asia&#8217;s biggest private-equity market over the past three years
and investments jumped 40 percent to $19.7 billion in 2010,
according to the Asian Venture Capital Journal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connie Ling, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman at Goldman Sachs,
declined to comment as did Tim Payne, a spokesman in Hong
Kong for Fort Worth, Texas-based TPG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign buyout firms are facing stiffer competition from
local rivals as former executives at Goldman Sachs and Ping An
Insurance (Group) Co. set up their own funds. TPG yesterday
agreed to sell a stake to China Development Bank Corp.&#8217;s
investment unit to raise capital for expanding beyond buyouts as
private-equity fundraising remains at an eight-year low,
according to a person with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TPG Investments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sun joined Goldman Sachs from Morgan Stanley in 2006 as
executive director. He was named a managing director in October
2007. Sun helped Goldman buy 12.02 percent of Taikang Life
Insurance Co., China&#8217;s fifth-biggest life insurer, in April, and
a stake in Shenzhen Hepalink Pharmaceutical Co., a Chinese
drugmaker, in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TPG sold its stake in Shenzhen Development Bank Co. (000001) in 2009
to Ping An, China&#8217;s second-biggest insurer. The fund has since
raised $2.44 billion by selling Ping An shares it received in
the deal. TPG&#8217;s Newbridge Capital LLC paid about $145 million
for the Shenzhen Bank stake in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past seven months, TPG bought stakes in China
International Capital Corp., the first Sino-foreign investment
bank, Comtec Solar Systems Group Ltd. and Hong Kong Energy
Holdings Ltd., a developer of renewable-energy projects focusing
on China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TPG has invested $8.1 billion in Asia since the start of
2008, more than Carlyle Group and KKR  Co. China accounted for
37 percent of Asian deals last year, an increase from 29 percent
in 2009, according to AVCJ estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ma, the former Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) chief financial officer
who joined TPG in 2007, quit this year to help ex-Ping An
President Louis Cheung start private-equity firm Boyu Capital
Ltd. Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing&#8217;s charity foundation said
last month it agreed to invest in a Boyu Capital fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shan, a former partner in TPG&#8217;s Hong Kong office, left last
year to join Pacific Alliance Group, an Asia-based alternative
investment manager, as chairman and chief executive officer.
Shan helped TPG buy the Shenzhen Development Bank stake, one of
the company&#8217;s most profitable investments in Asia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) hired PV Krishna from Morgan Stanley (MS) to run its equity capital markets
business in India, two people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krishna, who was an executive director in charge of equity
capital markets at Morgan Stanley, will join Goldman Sachs in
August as a managing director after completing three months of
so-called gardening leave, the people said, declining to be
identified as no announcement has been made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian companies have raised 244 billion rupees ($5.4
billion) in domestic share sales in 2011, about half of the
total for the same period last year, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Morgan Stanley was ranked seventh in arranging
such offerings in the past 12 months, while Goldman Sachs was
11th, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noel Cheung, a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong,
confirmed that Krishna is leaving the firm. Connie Ling, a
spokesman for Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong, declined to comment.
Reuters reported Krishna&#8217;s move earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krishna joined Morgan Stanley from Nomura Holdings Inc. in
India more than a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s stocks, trading almost 10
percent below this year&#8217;s highs, may extend declines as higher
interest rates slow economic growth, according to ICBC Credit
Suisse Asset Management Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai Composite Index has tumbled 9.9 percent from a
five-month high on April 18, having earlier dropped as much as
10 percent, a level that signifies a correction to some
investors. The gauge slumped the most in four months yesterday,
erasing its advance for the year, after data signaled a slowdown
in manufacturing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government has increased reserve requirements for banks
11 times and boosted interest rates four times since the start
of 2010 to cool consumer prices, which exceeded economists&#8217;
estimates in April with a 5.3 percent increase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We remain cautious in the near term and we haven&#8217;t seen
the bottom yet,&#8221; said Hao Kang, a Beijing-based fund manager at
ICBC Credit Suisse Asset, which oversees $8.7 billion. &#8220;The
economy&#8217;s definitely slowing but we&#8217;ve yet to see inflation
easing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China should get used to an inflation rate between 5
percent and 10 percent for an extended period of time, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported May 22, citing Wang Jian,
secretary general of the National Development and Reform
Commission&#8217;s China Society of Macroeconomics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the largest U.S.
natural-gas producer since its acquisition of XTO Energy Inc.
last year, is slowing drilling in Texas gas fields amid a supply
glut that slashed prices for the fuel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson may be pressed at
tomorrow&#8217;s annual meeting in Dallas to show that the $34.9
billion XTO purchase -- Exxon&#8217;s largest transaction since he
became CEO in January 2006 -- hasn&#8217;t been a bust, said Manuj Nikhanj of Ross Smith Energy Group Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Exxon completed the XTO acquisition on June 28, Exxon
shares have lagged Chevron Corp., ConocoPhillips and even BP Plc (BP/),
operator of the deep-sea well that triggered the worst-ever U.S.
marine oil spill last year. All those companies have benefited
to a greater degree than Exxon from rallying crude prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a gas bet that obviously hasn&#8217;t worked yet,&#8221;
Nikhanj, an analyst at Calgary-based Ross Smith, said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;Exxon isn&#8217;t making any money off the
commodity that XTO was known for.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North American energy markets were flooded with gas after
new drilling techniques allowed producers to tap into previously
inaccessible geologic formations. U.S. gas futures tumbled as
much as 30 percent in the months after the acquisition closed in
June, and remain down 7.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineers and Scientists &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the XTO purchase, Exxon gained gas and oil fields from
the Texas-Mexico border to North Dakota, as well as a workforce
of 3,000 that includes engineers and geoscientists who pioneered
techniques for tapping gas encased in shale rock. The acquired
assets helped drive a 24 percent increase in first-quarter gas
output for Exxon, compared to a 0.6 percent decline in crude
production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The merger also tilted Exxon&#8217;s proved reserves from 51
percent oil at the end of 2009 to 53 percent gas a year later, a
shift that may signal lower earnings in years to come because
gas is 75 percent cheaper than oil, on an energy-equivalent
basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, is taking steps to curb its
exposure to low natural-gas prices. XTO, which now operates as
an Exxon unit, filed 371 applications to drill wells in Texas
during the first four months of this year, a 16 percent decline
from the same period in 2010, according to the Texas Railroad
Commission, which oversees drilling in the largest oil-and gas-
producing state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holding Steady &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon doesn&#8217;t plan to reduce the number of rigs drilling
wells on XTO projects this year, David Rosenthal, Exxon&#8217;s vice
president of investor relations, said during an April 28
conference call to discuss the company&#8217;s first-quarter results.
Drilling will concentrate as much as possible on oil-rich areas
&#8220;to make sure that we&#8217;re maximizing the value of that
program,&#8221; Rosenthal said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Exxon Mobil and XTO merger brought together two
highly complementary organizations whose combined strengths
deliver strong shareholder value and open new opportunities for
the production of clean-burning natural gas,&#8221; Karen P. Matusic,
spokeswoman for Exxon, said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;I do not
think you can jump to any conclusions based on a couple months
of rig data in one state.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas prices have averaged $4.23 per million British thermal
units this year, after production from U.S. wells rose 4.8
percent to 21.58 trillion cubic feet in 2010, the highest since
1973, according to the Energy Department in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Prices would need to come up to the $5.50 or $6 range for
a sustained period to allow for perpetual drilling,&#8221; said Rick
Smead, a Houston-based energy analyst at Navigant Consulting Inc. (NCI)
who has advised gas producers such as Chesapeake Energy Corp. on
strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competing Fuels &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural gas has benefited in recent months from rising
prices for coal, a competing fuel for power plants and steel
mills, said Robert Ineson, senior director of global gas at IHS
Inc.&#8217;s Cambridge Energy Research Associates. Surging demand for
coal in expanding economies such as China pushed prices to a 26-
month high, and is prompting some electricity generators to
switch to lower-cost gas, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tillerson, 59, told analysts in March that he intends to
dispatch XTO engineers worldwide to assess fields considered
unconventional because of the intensive techniques required to
harvest the gas or crude. Gas fields in Asia, Europe or Latin
America have the potential to generate higher profits than U.S.
finds because demand has outpaced local production in those
markets, elevating prices, said Brian Youngberg, an analyst at
Edward Jones  Co. in St. Louis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The XTO transaction has brought Exxon new expertise to
produce fuels from unconventional formations such as shale or
dense sandstone, known as tight sands, said Douglas Ober, chief
executive officer at Petroleum  Resources Corp. (PEO), for whom Exxon
is the largest holding among $837 million under management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unconventional Expertise &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon already is benefiting from XTO&#8217;s expertise, Rosenthal
said in the April earnings conference call. &#8220;If you look at the
objectives we have of improving capital efficiency, improving
productivity, and lowering operating costs, we are making good
progress and are very pleased with how that&#8217;s going,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 2009, Exxon abandoned a $75 million effort to
crack open a tight-sand formation in Hungary after striking more
water than gas. Exxon&#8217;s geologists and engineers had failed to
detect an underground aquifer on seismic maps of the prospect,
Stephen Schultz, a spokesman for Exxon&#8217;s partner in the project,
Falcon Oil  Gas Ltd., said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hungarian prospect involved tight sands similar to
those in the Freestone Trend in Texas that accounted for 28
percent of XTO&#8217;s pre-merger production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shale formations have the potential to more than double the
world&#8217;s gas reserves, the U.S. Energy Department&#8217;s Energy
Information Agency said in an April 5 assessment, adding 6,622
trillion cubic feet to 6,609 trillion of conventional gas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobil Acquisition &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The XTO transaction has been more positively received by
investors than the $87.7 billion Mobil Corp. transaction in 1999
that was the largest-ever oil industry merger. Exxon&#8217;s 16
percent increase since the XTO agreement was announced 17 months
ago is more than double the 8.9 percent gain during the same
time span after the Mobil deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying XTO was smarter than spending years trying to build
an unconventional drilling business from the ground up and
risking failure, Ober said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;From a financial-returns basis, it&#8217;s difficult to say
what kind of result they&#8217;re getting at this point from XTO,&#8221;
Ober said. &#8220;But from an intellectual-returns perspective, it&#8217;s
already paying off. This was never really about XTO&#8217;s gas fields
as much as it was about getting hold of their technology and
their people.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the largest U.S.
oil company, flared gases at the Joliet, Illinois, refinery,
according to a filing with state regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A compressor trip led to flaring of SO2,&#8221; Kevin Allexon,
an Exxon spokesman based in Fairfax, Virginia, said in an e-mail
late yesterday. Allexon declined to comment on &#8220;operational
details like run rates nor will we speculate on when repairs
might be completed.&#8221; Exxon expects to meet customer commitments
while repairs are made, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery started flaring gases yesterday at 1:30 a.m.
local time, according to a filing with the Illinois Emergency
Management Agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery reported an upset late May 21 and said more
than 500 pounds of sulfur dioxide was released, according to an
earlier filing with the agency. The plant started a unit and
flared gas May 23, according to another filing made available
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outages can increase prices for refined products as
refiners turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts. Operational disruptions can also depress prices for
crude oil because less feedstock is needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Joliet refinery is 42 miles (68 kilometers) southwest
of Chicago on the Des Plaines River. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investcorp has backed former Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) proprietary trader Reza Ali&#8217;s hedge fund with
initial capital and will provide marketing support as the
alternative investment firm expands in structured credit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosiris Capital Management LLC, which plans to focus on
securitized debt and corporate credit linked to the assets,
received between $50 million to $100 million, a typical amount
from the Bahrain-based firm, said Deepak Gurnani, Investcorp&#8217;s
head of hedge funds and chief investment officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We were looking to team up with a manager&#8221; with
experience in the sector, Gurnani said. &#8220;Unfortunately, most of
the portfolios got decimated during the credit crisis. What
immediately struck us about this firm is that Reza, who managed
significant amounts of money during the credit crisis, performed
well during the period.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before starting New York-based Prosiris in 2009, Ali headed
the Americas principal funding and investments group at New
York-based Goldman Sachs, where he managed &#8220;a multi-billion
dollar portfolio of credit and structured finance assets and
credit derivatives&#8221; from 2006 to 2009, according to an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ali, 41, said in a telephone interview that he couldn&#8217;t
comment further on the details of his trading at Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While values of securitized debt have rallied by record
amounts from the unprecedented lows reached during the credit
crisis, the market is compelling for investors because so few
fund managers understand the nuances of the assets, Ali said.
Banks in both the U.S. and Europe are also off-loading their
holdings at a faster pace after bolstering their balance sheets,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Sophisticated Players&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Most of the hedge funds did not play here. The more
sophisticated players were on the sell side, prop desks or
principal areas of the banks,&#8221; Ali said. Prosiris will use both
&#8220;short&#8221; and &#8220;long&#8221; bets in its investing, he said, meaning
it can profit from declines and gains in the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Goldman Sachs, Ali worked at Merrill Lynch  Co.,
where he created the firm&#8217;s structured-credit proprietary
trading desk, and also headed structuring for credit derivatives
in Europe, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investcorp, which oversees $11.8 billion of assets, first
invested in securitized-debt funds in 2006, when it began
participating through a fund in bets against the U.S. subprime
mortgage-bond market as &#8220;portfolio insurance,&#8221; Gurnani said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosiris will become the seventh investment adviser on the
firm&#8217;s so-called single manager platform, which has a total of
$1.6 billion in money from Investcorp and its clients under
management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seer Capital &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seer Capital Management LP, the investment firm headed by
Philip Weingord, Deutsche Bank AG&#8217;s former head of global
markets in the Americas, has also said hedge funds focusing on
securitized debt should be attractive to investors because fewer
money managers have expertise in the sector. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main hedge fund run by New York-based Seer, which
oversees $400 million in assets, gained 9.2 percent in the first
four months of this year, after a 24.9 percent return last year,
according to a monthly letter to investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seer&#8217;s best-performing investments in April were in unusual
asset-backed securities and collateralized loan obligations,
which pool leveraged loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk, according to the letter. That reflects &#8220;our
capability to identify opportunities across subsectors&#8221; of
securitized debt beyond just residential- and commercial-
mortgage securities, Seer said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
has closed the gap in market value with Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), giving
it the potential to become the second-most valuable technology
company as its bet against personal computers pays off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CHART OF THE DAY shows how IBM&#8217;s market value has
climbed to nearly that of Microsoft, which was worth three times
as much as IBM in 2000. Microsoft had a market capitalization of
$203.7 billion when markets closed yesterday, compared with
IBM&#8217;s $203.5 billion, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, whose Windows and Office software are used
primarily on PCs, lost its spot as the most valuable technology
company last year to Apple Inc. (AAPL), as sales of iPad tablets and
iPhones crimped PC demand. IBM Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano divested the company&#8217;s PC business six years ago,
calling it commoditized, to invest in software and services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, now the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider,
topped Microsoft&#8217;s value in intraday trading last week. It
hasn&#8217;t closed with a value above its rival since 1996, according
to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM gained 2 cents to $168.01 at 9:42 a.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading, while Microsoft gained 9 cents
to $24.24 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The companies had
gained 14 percent and lost 13 percent, respectively, this year
before today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount of cocaine trafficked
through West Africa to Europe may have doubled since 2006 and
drug cartels are cooperating with al-Qaeda in the region, an
official with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as 80 metric tons of cocaine, worth $1.2 billion,
might pass through West Africa to Europe this year, Manuel de
Almeida Pereira, legal adviser to the Vienna-based anti-crime
unit of the UN, said in an interview on May 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the product comes from South America and is brought
across the Atlantic by plane, then transited toward Europe
through the Middle East, he said. Drug cartels are beginning to
share weapons, information, safe houses, and other assets with
al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Pereira said, citing &#8220;sources
of intelligence we cannot reveal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m sure that they are in this country,&#8221; Pereira said
from Bissau, the capital of Guinea-Bissau on West Africa&#8217;s
Atlantic coast. &#8220;This is a new trend we have to address.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three Malians were detained in Ghana in December 2009 and
extradited to the U.S., where they were charged with trafficking
cocaine in order to finance terrorism. The case is ongoing. The
arrests &#8220;and other reports and congressional testimony suggest
that there may be collaboration between drug traffickers and
terrorist organizations in the region,&#8221; the Congressional
Research Service said in a report in February, 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guinea-Bissau &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb operates in North Africa
and has kidnapped and ransomed foreigners in countries like
Mali, Niger and Mauritania. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a May 18 interview, Guinea-Bissau&#8217;s Attorney General
Amine Michel Saad said terrorist activity in the country has
become &#8220;a reality.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is more a problem for Europe and the U.S. and other
Western countries than it is for Guinea-Bissau,&#8221; Saad said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UNODC is also concerned that cartels trafficking Afghan
heroin into the U.S. are passing through West African states,
particularly Nigeria and Guinea-Bissau, Pereira said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a very recent trend that we are still studying,&#8221;
he said. Saad described those concerns as &#8220;speculation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UNODC&#8217;s estimates of cocaine trafficked through West Africa
don&#8217;t include Guinea-Bissau, where the state&#8217;s inability to
patrol the islands beyond its capital has made the former &#8220;a
blank in terms of statistics,&#8221; Pereira said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coastal country of 1.5 million people doesn&#8217;t have a
single helicopter, airplane or boat that can monitor activity in
its 80 islands, where much of drug trafficking is thought to
take place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The areas where we have narco-trafficking are those where
we can&#8217;t even reach, no matter what&#8217;s happening there,&#8221; Saad
said. &#8220;It&#8217;s an impossibility.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local Consumption &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UNODC is also concerned about West African consumption of
drugs, particularly crack cocaine, Pereira said. In the past
year, the organization witnessed a rise in the amount of crack
being sold locally, often at prices as low as 14,000 CFA francs
($30) a gram. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crack trade poses a security threat to regional states,
particularly Guinea-Bissau, which has only one rehabilitation
center and no prisons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This will increase violence, this will increase
robberies, this will increase many forms of criminality,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;This is a weak society, it can be destroyed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index advanced 0.4 percent to
1,325.69 at 4 p.m. in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
increased 8.10 points, or 0.1 percent, to 12,402.76. Both
benchmark gauges yesterday snapped a three-day decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The bright side is that there&#8217;s a clear dichotomy between
the health of corporate America and the economy,&#8221; said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Philadelphia-based
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, which manages $53 billion. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
softened somewhat. Still, profits remain good and there&#8217;s MA
activity. That tells me that we&#8217;re not going to see a huge move
in stocks in either direction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 fell 2.8 percent from an almost three-year high
on April 29 amid concern about Europe&#8217;s debt crisis and weaker-
than-forecast economic data. Still, the benchmark gauge is up
5.4 percent from the end of 2010 amid government stimulus
measures and higher-than-forecast corporate profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GDP Report &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. economy grew at a 1.8 percent annual rate in the
first quarter, less than forecast, reflecting a smaller gain in
consumer spending than previously calculated. The revised rise
in gross domestic product was the same as estimated last month
and compared with a 3.1 percent gain in the prior quarter,
Commerce Department figures showed. The median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a 2.2 percent
increase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Americans unexpectedly filed applications for
unemployment benefits last week, a sign the labor market is
struggling to gain momentum. Jobless claims increased by 10,000
to 424,000, Labor Department figures showed. The median estimate
of economists was for a drop to 404,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier today, stocks extended declines after Luxembourg&#8217;s
Jean-Claude Juncker, who leads the group of euro-area finance
ministers, said the International Monetary Fund may not release
its portion of a 12 billion-euro ($17 billion) aid payment to
Greece next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Troika&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are specific IMF rules and one of those rules says
that IMF can only take action when the refinancing guarantee is
given over 12 months,&#8221; Juncker said today at a conference in
Luxembourg. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think that the troika will come to the
conclusion that this is given,&#8221; he said, using the term to
describe a team of inspectors from the European Union, the IMF
and European Central Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiffany increased 8.6 percent to $76.04. The jeweler raised
its full-year forecast as sales did better in Japan than
expected after the earthquake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NetApp rose 6.9 percent to $55.31. The data-management
company forecast adjusted earnings of as much as 57 cents a
share for the first quarter, compared with the average estimate
of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg of 50 cents a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Rallies &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft rose the most in the Dow, adding 2 percent to
$24.67. Shares of the world&#8217;s biggest software maker are
&#8220;statistically&#8221; cheap, Mario Gabelli, chairman of Gamco
Investors Inc., said in an interview on Bloomberg TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walgreen Co. (WAG) retreated 1 to $43.70 after Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. cut the largest U.S. drugstore chain from its
&#8220;conviction buy&#8221; list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big Lots Inc. (BIG) declined 2.8 percent to $31.44. The discount
retailer forecast second-quarter earnings of 38 cents to 48
cents a share, falling short of the average analyst estimate of
52 cents, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lowered its year-end forecast for
the SP 500 to 1,450 from 1,500 and reduced its 2012 earnings
projection, citing weakening economic estimates. SP 500
companies will post combined profit of $104 a share next year,
compared with Goldman Sachs&#8217;s prior estimate of $106, according
to David Kostin, the New York-based equity strategist. He
maintained his 2011 earnings forecast for the SP 500 of $96 a
share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Lowered GDP Growth&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our adjustments reflect a combination of developments
including recently lowered GDP growth estimates by our
economists in the U.S. and Asia and a significant increase in
our Brent oil price forecast,&#8221; Kostin wrote today in a note to
clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies in the SP 500 that raised dividends for at least
25 years are beating the benchmark gauge, reversing a trend
started in August when the Federal Reserve signaled additional
economic stimulus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index is again beating the
SP 500 after an almost six-month period of underperformance.
Since the middle of February, the index of dividend payers rose
3.1 percent through yesterday and the SP 500 fell 0.9 percent.
The ratio between the two gauges rebounded to 0.41 from a one-
year low of 0.39 on Feb. 14. It had fallen from a record of 0.42
on Aug. 26 through mid-February. During that period, the
&#8220;aristocrats&#8221; surged 18 percent as a group, trailing a 27
percent gain for the SP 500. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Once the Fed signaled QE2, we had a resumption of the
risk rally,&#8221; said Russ Koesterich, the San Francisco-based
global chief investment strategist for the IShares unit of
BlackRock Inc., which oversees $3.65 trillion as the world&#8217;s
largest asset manager. &#8220;Now that we&#8217;re coming to an end of QE2
and there&#8217;s concern about a slower pace of economic growth,
investors are turning more defensive. These more stable, higher-
dividend paying companies are the beneficiaries of that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will preview its
Windows operating system designed for tablet computers in
demonstrations planned for next week, according to three people
with knowledge of the company&#8217;s plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will showcase the software&#8217;s touch-screen
interface running on hardware with an Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) Tegra chip,
said the people, who declined to be identified because the plans
are confidential. Windows President Steven Sinofsky is scheduled
to present at the All Things D conference, while Vice President
Steve Guggenheimer will address the Computex show in Taipei. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is rushing to adapt Windows to better support
devices that can compete with Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPad, which dominates
the tablet market. The new operating system won&#8217;t be out until
next year, people familiar with the plans said in March. Still,
the company is eager to show it is moving forward, seeking to
generate demand among computer makers and chip suppliers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nvidia&#8217;s Tegra microprocessor is based on the ARM Holdings
Plc (ARM) technology that dominates the smartphone market. ARM-based
chips are also used in the iPad and tablets that run Google
Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Android operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Martin, a spokesman for Microsoft, declined to
comment. The company&#8217;s shares rose 48 cents, or 2 percent, to
$24.67 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
Nvidia gained 46 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $18.82. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said
earlier this week that machines with the new operating system,
which he referred to as Windows 8, would be released in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;In a Race&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, later retracted
the comments, claiming they were a misstatement. The company is
scrambling to expand Windows to computing devices such as phones
and tablets, Ballmer said in a speech in New Delhi today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are in a race,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We are not doing that
badly, frankly. We are doing pretty well in that race. But the
race is on to continue to push Windows to a variety of new form
factors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple sold 4.69 million iPads in the most recent quarter,
for a total of 19.5 million since the device&#8217;s April 2010
release. If the next version of Windows does come out on tablets
in 2012, Apple will likely be selling its third generation of
iPad hardware by then, according to Michael Gartenberg, an
analyst at researcher Gartner Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft works on the new Windows software, sales in
the operating-system business are taking a hit as some consumers
choose iPads instead of less-expensive netbook computers that
run Windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PC Shipments Slip &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer personal-computer shipments dropped 8 percent in
the quarter, Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein said
last month. Sales of netbooks plunged 40 percent, partially
because of defections to tablet computers, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That helped make last quarter the second in a row in which
Windows revenue fell short of analyst estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The demonstration may be a boon to Nvidia, a maker of
graphics processors for PCs, which is trying to break into the
market for tablet computer chips with Tegra. Most tablets are
now built with mobile-phone processors made by Texas Instruments
Inc. (TXN), Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) and Samsung Electronics Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel Corp. (INTC), whose processors lead in PCs, has been unable
to parlay that dominance into design wins in phones and tablets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology website WinRumors reported earlier that
Microsoft will demonstrate the tablet software design at All
Things D, which is being held in Rancho Palos Verdes,
California. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) lowered its
year-end forecast for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index to 1,450
from 1,500 and reduced its 2012 earnings projection, citing
weakening economic estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP 500 companies will post combined profit of $104 a share
next year, compared with Goldman Sachs&#8217;s prior estimate of $106,
according to David Kostin, the New York-based equity strategist.
He maintained his 2011 earnings forecast for the SP 500 of $96
a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our adjustments reflect a combination of developments
including recently lowered GDP growth estimates by our
economists in the U.S. and Asia and a significant increase in
our Brent oil price forecast,&#8221; Kostin wrote today in a note to
clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is forecasting U.S. real gross domestic
product growth of 2.6 percent in 2011 and 3.2 percent in 2012,
while it predicts global expansion will be 4.4 percent and 4.8
percent, respectively. The New York-based bank estimates that
the price of Brent crude will reach $120 by the end of this year
and $140 in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 fell 3.2 percent from an almost three-year high
on April 29 through yesterday amid concern about Europe&#8217;s debt
crisis and weaker-than-forecast economic data. Still, the
benchmark gauge rose 5 percent since the end of 2010 on
government stimulus measures and higher-than-forecast profits. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before today, the average estimate of 13 strategists
tracked by Bloomberg called for the SP 500 to rise 6.5 percent
in the last seven months of 2010 to 1,406. Corporate profits in
the benchmark index for U.S. equities may reach $104.73 a share
in the next 12 months as consumer demand pushes sales up 13
percent, according to data from about 9,000 analysts compiled by
Bloomberg. The income estimate rose 2.8 percent in the four
weeks ended May 2. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve Bank of New York
is looking into allegations that a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) unit
improperly denied mortgage borrowers the chance to lower
payments through a government program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Times reported late yesterday on its website
that it received a letter from an anonymous employee of the
unit, Litton Loan Servicing LP, with the allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are in possession of the letter and are conducting an
inquiry,&#8221; Jack Gutt, a spokesman for the New York Fed, said in
an e-mail to Bloomberg News yesterday without elaborating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, said
in March it&#8217;s trying to sell Houston-based Litton after
acquiring it more than three years ago. The unit is cooperating
with investigations by the attorneys general from 50 states of
the mortgage industry&#8217;s foreclosure practices, which began after
they discovered some firms used faulty or falsified paperwork to
seize homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Duvally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unidentified person familiar with Litton said some loan
modifications were denied because Litton employees made mistakes
in calculating the borrower&#8217;s income or on the grounds that
documents were missing, even if the computer system showed the
appropriate paperwork was received, the Financial Times
reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will support higher
prices on mobile-phone applications from outside developers to
encourage better products, rather than embracing the free or 99-
cent apps common in other companies&#8217; stores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;d rather developers sell fewer than a million downloads
and get to a million dollars,&#8221; Brandon Watson, director of an
apps developer program for Microsoft, said in a press briefing
in Helsinki. &#8220;If we can support a higher price point that&#8217;s good
for developers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) adopted Windows Phone 7 as its primary smartphone
platform in February, saying that it will give the Finnish phone
company and its developers more opportunities to produce
distinctive products than Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Android, which was also
considered. Microsoft on May 24 announced handset agreements
with Acer Inc., Fujitsu Ltd., and ZTE Corp., as well as 500
features to be added in the fall release of Windows Phone 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nokia expands distribution quite a bit, including China,
India, Russia -- it&#8217;s very important to have a marketplace in
those countries where developers can sell local apps,&#8221; Watson
said in an interview. &#8220;China is going to be very, very big.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia intends to release its first Windows phones in the
fourth quarter, Watson said, adding that he was reiterating
guidance from Nokia&#8217;s smartphones chief, Jo Harlow. Along with
the handsets, Nokia will open its own app store for Windows
Phone and is working with Microsoft to convince the thousands of
developers for its Symbian software to write for Windows Phone
as well, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different Look &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It will look slightly different on the phone from the one
that&#8217;s for all the other vendors, and they will have more
control over the merchandising,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Nokia&#8217;s invested
tons of money around building apps, so one of my main jobs right
now is ensuring that we don&#8217;t lose a single developer to Android
or iOS,&#8221; he added, referring to Apple Inc.&#8217;s mobile-phone
operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further features beyond those already introduced, such as
face-recognition software and voice dictation for messages, will
be announced in the coming weeks for the fall release, code-
named Mango, Watson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We announced most of the major stuff, but there are more
delighters coming,&#8221; he said at the briefing, which took place
at an event for app developers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fidelity Investments, the Boston-
based fund company that oversees $1.64 trillion, is bullish on
the U.S. currency just as Pacific Investment Management Co. and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) are warning investors against buying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The value of the dollar is close to a bottom,&#8221; John Carlson, manager of the Fidelity New Markets Income Fund (FNMIX), wrote
in a report yesterday on the company&#8217;s website. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never
been more optimistic on the long-term prospects of the U.S.
dollar and U.S. economy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America&#8217;s currency will strengthen over the next 18 months
to&#160;three years because of competitive advantages in the U.S.
including the rule of law, a strong education system and labor
mobility, Carlson wrote. The greenback is cheap now, according
to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar has dropped 13 percent in the past year against
a trade-weighted basket of six currencies, even after rallying
more than 3 percent from a 33-month low set May 4. Pimco and
Goldman Sachs argue that overseas markets will lure money
managers in the coming years with faster economic growth, higher
interest rates and stronger government finances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. currency slid 0.7 percent against the euro to
$1.4184 as of 1:03 p.m. in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatives to Treasuries &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Gross, who runs the $240.7 billion Total Return Fund
for Pimco in Newport Beach, California, said investors should
&#8220;revolt&#8221; against the Federal Reserve&#8217;s low interest rates.
Fund managers should seek alternatives to U.S. bonds,
&#8220;including developing/emerging-market debt at higher yields
denominated in non-dollar currencies,&#8221; he wrote in a commentary
this month on the company&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross&#8217; Total Return Fund, the biggest bond fund in the
world, returned 7.83 percent in the past year, beating almost
four-fifths of its competitors, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlson&#8217;s New Markets Income Fund gained 14.1 percent,
which topped almost two-fifths of its peers, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the U.S. bank that lost money from trading
on only one day in the first quarter, cut its dollar forecasts
on May 18, saying growth in the world&#8217;s largest economy is
lagging behind other nations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dollar Forecast &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar will decline to $1.55 per euro in a year,
analysts led by Thomas Stolper in London wrote in a note to
clients. It will trade at 86 yen in 12 months, from an earlier
forecast of 90 yen, according to the report. The greenback
bought 81.87 yen today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For the dollar to stabilize or even to rally, investors
need to be convinced of the case for additional long-term
investments in the U.S.,&#8221; the Goldman analysts wrote. &#8220;With
unemployment still high, fiscal consolidation looming and
continued weakness in the real estate sector, the growth outlook
remains less compelling in the U.S. than in many other regions
or countries.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said at his first news
conference in April that the economy still requires monetary
support. Policy makers have kept their target for overnight
lending in a range of zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008
to sustain the expansion. Central bank rates are 1.25 percent in
Europe, 1 percent in Canada, 0.5 percent in the U.K. and 4.75
percent in Australia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. economy will grow 2.76 percent this year, compared
with 1.63 percent in Europe and 9.59 percent in China, according
to the International Monetary Fund in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. unemployment has been more than 8 percent since
February 2009. President Barack Obama and lawmakers are debating
how to cut spending, raising concern the economy will suffer as
government support wanes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Affordable&#8217; Prices &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar has been able to maintain its buying power,
Carlson wrote in his report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In my travels around the globe, I have seen that despite
some recent inflation, prices for everything from goods to
gasoline to hotel rooms remain&#160;affordable for people in the
U.S.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices over the life of the debt, has narrowed to
2.32 percentage points from 2.67 percentage points in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month&#8217;s figure was the most in three years. The
average over the past decade is 2.10 percentage points. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) and Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) are among banks that held funds for Muammar Qaddafi&#8217;s
government investment fund, according to U.K. advocacy group
Global Witness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC held $292.7 million across 10 accounts and Goldman
Sachs had almost $44 million in four accounts as of June 30,
2010, according to a document on the Libyan Investment Authority
posted on London-based Global Witness&#8217;s website. The banks
refused to confirm if they hold the funds, the group said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Libyan state fund lost 4.5 percent in market value from
the previous quarter, with total assets dropping to $53.3
billion, according to the report. Qaddafi has retained control
of the fund as he resists U.S.-supported attempts to unseat him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These are the Libyan people&#8217;s assets and they have a
right to share in them,&#8221; Gavin Hayman, a director at Global
Witness, said from Hong Kong today. The advocacy group is
confident about the authenticity of the document and has
independently verified it, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governments should force banks and investment managers to
disclose the state-owned funds they manage, Global Witness said.
The group, founded in 1993, campaigns against natural resource-
related corruption and environmental and human rights abuses in
countries from Cambodia to Angola. It has more than 60 employees
in London and Washington, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derivatives Plunge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investments in equity derivatives with a book cost of
almost $1.25 billion plunged 98 percent in market value to $19.9
million as of June 30, according to the report on the state fund.
The Libyan Investment Authority&#8217;s deposits amounted to $19.8
billion, and it held $5.23 billion in shares and $3.39 billion
in bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About $3.9 billion was invested in structured products with
hedge funds and investment banks, including more than $1 billion
at Societe Generale (GLE) SA and $171.5 million at JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM), the document shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connie Ling, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment. A Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for
Societe Generale, who declined to be identified citing company
policy, said the bank can&#8217;t comment on specific clients or
transactions. Andrew Donohoe, a spokesman for JPMorgan in Sydney,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our duty of confidentiality means we cannot comment on
any individuals or companies, even to confirm or deny they are
clients or customers,&#8221; Vinh Tran, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman
for HSBC, said by phone today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baidu Inc., owner of China&#8217;s most-
popular search engine, said it may expand its partnership with
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) as it steps up plans to offer services outside
its home market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baidu &#8220;won&#8217;t rule out&#8221; further collaboration with
Microsoft, with which it has an existing agreement on the Bing
search engine in China, Haoyu Shen, senior vice president at the
Chinese company, said in an interview in Beijing today. He
declined to elaborate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with Microsoft may help Baidu speed up its overseas
expansion after the Beijing-based company overcame competition
from Google Inc. (GOOG) to dominate the industry in China. Baidu is
developing products in 12 foreign languages, said Shen, who
declined to say when they will be rolled out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baidu is close to signing a strategic agreement on search-
engine operations with Microsoft, Donews.com reported on May 13,
citing people it didn&#8217;t identify. Shen declined to comment on
the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, owner of the world&#8217;s most popular search engine,
accounted for 19.2 percent of China&#8217;s search market by revenue
in the first-quarter, declining from 19.6 percent three months
earlier, according to research company Analysys International.
Baidu&#8217;s market share rose to 75.8 percent from 75.5 percent,
while Microsoft Bing has less than 1 percent market share,
according to Analysys. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procter  Gamble Co. (PG), the maker of
Scope mouthwash, sued Vi-Jon Inc., claiming the packaging of the
private-label manufacturer&#8217;s mouthwash violates PG&#8217;s patents
and trademarks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PG charged that its patents, trademarks, trade dress and
copyright were infringed by closely held Vi-Jon through the
bottle and shape of the label of its mouthwash, according to a
statement from the Cincinnati-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Vi-Jon is using and benefiting from our intellectual

&lt;p&gt;A catalytic cracker at Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s Joliet refinery is expected to remain shut for seven to
10 more days as workers attempt to repair an air blower,
according to a person with knowledge of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workers are opening the main air blower turbine associated
with the catalytic cracker for repairs, said the person, who
declined to be identified because the information isn&#8217;t public.
The refinery has one cat cracker with a capacity of 98,000
barrels a day, said the person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Allexon, a company spokesman based in Fairfax,
Virginia, declined to comment today. He said in an e-mail May 24
that the plant had a compressor trip. He declined to give more
details or say whether any units had been shut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery reported an upset late May 21, according to a
filing with the Illinois Emergency Management Agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premium for conventional 87-octane gasoline in Chicago
rose 2.75 cents to 20 cents a gallon versus futures traded on
the New York Mercantile Exchange at 12:44 p.m., according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The fuel was at a 1.5-cent discount
on May 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery has a capacity of 248,000 barrels a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Joliet refinery is
42 miles (68 kilometers) southwest of Chicago on the Des Plaines
river. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ), the second-
largest U.S. exchange operator, gained the most in more than a
month after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reinstated its
recommendation that investors buy the shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nasdaq OMX climbed 4.8 percent to $25.54 at 11:37 a.m. in
New York after rallying 5.4 percent earlier, the most intraday
since April 1. That was the day it announced a joint offer with
IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE) for larger rival NYSE Euronext,
which agreed two months earlier to merge with Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1)
in Frankfurt. The shares have gained 7.7 percent in 2011. Nasdaq
OMX and ICE dropped their bid May 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The earnings growth of Nasdaq remains under-
appreciated,&#8221; Daniel Harris, a New York-based analyst at
Goldman Sachs, wrote in a note today. &#8220;Nasdaq will outperform
peers as its results provide it optionality to return capital to
shareholders or pursue accretive niche acquisitions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nasdaq OMX beat or matched profit estimates in all but one
of the past 12 quarters, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The exchange operator has been expanding beyond
equities into derivatives and, at the same time, returning
capital to shareholders -- it bought back $797 million of stock
in 2010. Chief Executive Officer Robert Greifeld said yesterday
he is &#8220;maniacally focused&#8221; on the existing business plan and
on keeping Nasdaq OMX open to &#8220;emerging growth opportunities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs withdrew its rating of the New York-based
company after Nasdaq announced its NYSE Euronext (NYX) bid, because
Goldman was advising NYSE Euronext on the proposals. Harris has
a $29 price estimate for the next 12 months, according to the
note. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nigeria&#8217;s state-owned energy company
signed agreements today with local units of Royal Dutch Shell
Plc (RDSA) and Chevron Corp. (CVX) for the supply of natural gas to the
country&#8217;s power stations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two agreements, which cover the supply of more than 70
percent of the total gas requirements to the domestic power
industry, serve as a framework for future agreements, Petroleum
Minister Diezan Alison-Madueke told reporters today in Abuja,
the west African nation&#8217;s capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are now in a position where we can very rapidly
replicate these agreements across all other power plants,&#8221; she
said. &#8220; Although it has taken a while to close the
negotiations, the knock-on effect in terms of other agreements
that can be immediately executed is phenomenal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigeria, holder of Africa&#8217;s largest gas reserves, wants to
expand transmission and processing facilities to deliver the
fuel to power plants in order to increase generation more than
fourfold to about 14,000 megawatts by 2013. Most of the gas
currently pumped with crude oil in the nation is flared off due
to inadequate infrastructure to process it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell will supply 90 million standard cubic feet of gas a
day to the country&#8217;s largest power plant under the new
agreements signed, Osten Olorunsola, Shell&#8217;s vice president in
charge of gas in sub-Saharan Africa, said today in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This will assure regular supply of gas and result in
improved electricity supply in the country,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkish stocks tumbled, heading for
the biggest monthly loss since October 2008, after JPMorgan
Chase  Co. cut them to &#8220;underweight&#8221; from &#8220;overweight,&#8221;
citing concern on the current account deficit and banks&#8217;
profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main ISE National 100 index (XU100) fell as much as 1,901.26,
or 3 percent, to 61,854.09. The index declined 2.1 percent to
62,407.42 at 5:30 p.m. in Istanbul, taking the month&#8217;s losses to
9.9 percent. Yields on two-year benchmark bonds rose 7 basis
points to 8.97 percent, the fifth weekly increase. The lira fell
0.1 percent to 1.6047. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The global environment with equity markets under pressure
puts capital-importing Turkey under additional pressure,&#8221; David Aserkoff, an analyst at JPMorgan, said in an e-mailed report
today. He also cited slowing &#8220;bank profit growth&#8221; and &#8220;higher
headline consumer price inflation&#8221; for the downgrade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank lending is increasing at an annual pace of more than
35 percent even after the central bank raised banks&#8217; reserve
requirements four times since December to stem an expansion in
loans it says is widening the current account deficit. The gap
may expand to 8.7 percent of economic output this year, the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said in a
report May 25. The higher reserves are crimping profits at
banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreigners &#8220;Not Buying&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market turned negative after the JPMorgan report,&#8221;
Orhan Veli Canli, a trader at Is Invest in Istanbul, Turkey&#8217;s
largest broker, said by telephone. &#8220;The outlook for the banking
industry is not looking good and despite a fall in prices
foreigners are still not buying.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) lost 2 percent to 6.92 liras.
Akbank TAS (AKBNK), part-owned by Citigroup Inc., fell 3.3 percent to
7.14 liras. Turkish banking stocks are equivalent to 40 percent
of the main share index&#8217;s value, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We would be tempted to trade in and out of banks around
key levels, e.g. buying into Garanti bank below 7 liras,&#8221;
Aserkoff said. &#8220;But we would wait for policy clarity before
recommending the sector on a medium-term view.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current account deficit widened to a record $9.8
billion in March, the central bank said on May 11. Consumer
price inflation accelerated to 4.3 percent in April from 4
percent in March, the statistics office said on May 3. The
government is due to publish trade data for April on May 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkish stocks, bonds and the lira also fell after Fitch
Ratings lowered Japan&#8217;s outlook to &#8220;negative&#8221; from &#8220;stable&#8221;
citing rising government debt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil rose, headed for a weekly gain in
New York on speculation that the global economic recovery will
sustain demand for fuel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude rose as much as 1 percent after Group of Eight
leaders said the world economy is gaining strength and as a
weakening dollar boosted the appeal of commodities. The
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries may raise output
quotas to meet global demand, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Demand data continues to be reasonably robust,&#8221; Amrita Sen, a London-based analyst at Barclays Plc, said in an e-mail
today. &#8220;Given that the upside risks are higher than the
downside risks, prices are edging higher.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude for July delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange
was at $101.20 a barrel, up 97 cents, at 1:37 p.m. London time,
after rising as much as $1 to $101.23. Futures yesterday fell
$1.09 to $100.23, the lowest settlement since May 24. Prices are
up 2 percent this week and 11 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent oil for July settlement was up 54 cents at $115.59 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
contract yesterday rose 12 cents, or 0.1 percent, to $115.05,
the highest closing price since May 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. GDP Growth &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York futures slumped yesterday after a report showed
U.S. gross domestic product expanded at a 1.8 percent annual
rate in the first quarter, slower than the 2.2 percent estimated
in a Bloomberg News survey of economists. U.S. jobless claims
unexpectedly rose last week. The dollar fell 1 percent to
$1.4292 against the euro today after a report showed consumer
spending in the U.S. rose less than forecast in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The dollar selloff is pushing commodities higher,&#8221; said
Andrew Johnston, a London-based commodities trader at One
Financial Markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Group of Eight leaders, meeting at a two-day summit that
ends today in Deauville, France, said a strengthening global
economy will pave the way to cuts in the debt built up in the
recession that followed the 2008 financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The global recovery is gaining strength and is becoming
more self-sustained,&#8221; according to a draft statement prepared
for the leaders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OPEC is likely to increase production quotas to 27 million
to 27.5 million barrels a day when it meets in Vienna June 8,
JPMorgan said in a report e-mailed today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Price Forecasts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. boosted its 12-month prediction
for Brent crude to $130 a barrel from $107, analysts led by
Jeffrey Currie said in a report on May 23. Barclays&#8217; Sen said
yesterday its $102-a-barrel forecast for this year &#8220;may yet
turn out to be conservative,&#8221; partly because of concerns about
supply from non-OPEC members. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude may rise next week after Goldman and Morgan Stanley
increased their price projections, a Bloomberg News survey
showed. Fourteen of 36 analysts, or 39 percent, forecast oil
will climb through June 3. Twelve respondents, or 33 percent,
predicted prices will decline and 10 estimated little change.
Last week, 42 percent of respondents said futures would gain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent has advanced 21 percent this year as unrest in the
Middle East and North Africa toppled leaders in Tunisia and
Egypt and spread to Libya, Iran and Syria. Hundreds of Yemeni
families fled gun battles in the capital and the U.S. State
Department urged Americans to leave the country while commercial
transportation is available. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ARM Holdings Plc (ARM), whose chip designs
are used in Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPad, said Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s adoption
of its technology will help Windows software expand into cars
and televisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARM may start generating royalties from chips using its
technology in Windows-based laptops and tablets as early as next
year, President Tudor Brown said in an interview today.
Microsoft&#8217;s use of ARM technology will help the Cambridge,
England-based chip designer gain market share, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will preview a Windows operating system designed
for tablets this week, according to three people familiar with
knowledge of the plans. Adapting Windows to better support
devices that can compete with Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPad will also help
ARM increase market share and may open the door for new uses for
its technology, Brown said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Where it gets potentially game-changing is, what other
opportunities does it open up for Microsoft,&#8221; Brown said in
Taipei. &#8220;This opens up a much bigger market, and makes a valid
and viable operating system for&#8221; TVs and automotive
electronics, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARM seeks new applications for its chip technology as it
faces competition from Intel Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest computer
chipmaker. Semiconductors based on ARM&#8217;s designs are used in
most tablet computers, including Apple&#8217;s iPad, and the company
is also targeting the server computing market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tegra Chip &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARM expects its share of the market for chips used in
mobile computers, such as tablets, notebooks and low-cost
netbooks, to jump fivefold to 50 percent by 2015, Brown said.
The company&#8217;s current 10 percent market share will expand to 15
percent by the end of the year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re going to see tablets, and eventually laptops and
servers using ARM-based operating systems, which should open
significant opportunities,&#8221; said Jerome Ramel, a Paris-based
analyst at Exane BNP Paribas with a &#8220;neutral&#8221; rating on the
stock. &#8220;For servers and laptops, power consumption is becoming
crucial, and ARM is all about power consumption.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARM has risen 35 percent in London trading this year,
giving the company a market value of 7.7 billion pounds ($12.7
billion). The stock added 1.4 percent to 572.5 pence on May 27.
U.K. and U.S. markets are closed for holidays today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josie Taylor, a Microsoft spokeswoman, doesn&#8217;t immediately
have a comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will showcase the operating system&#8217;s touch-screen
interface running on hardware with an Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) Tegra chip,
said the people last week, declining to be identified because
the plans are confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global shipments of tablets will climb to 215 million units
in 2015 from 17 million last year, Toni Sacconaghi, a New York-
based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co., wrote in a May 26
report. The devices will cannibalize purchases of consumer PCs,
reducing computer sales growth by 2 percent annually between
2010 and 2015, Sacconaghi wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, settled claims it had against Teva Pharmaceutical
Industries Ltd. (TEVA) over generic versions of the Neurontin epilepsy
drug, ending a trial that was under way in federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial terms are confidential, Teva, the world&#8217;s biggest
generic-drug company, said in a statement. Teva will be able to
continue selling the copy under a license from Pfizer, according
to a filing in the case. U.S. District Judge Faith Hochberg in
Newark, New Jersey, who was presiding over the trial that began
May 17, dismissed the suit today, according to the court docket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer claimed that copies of the pill made by Teva and its
Ivax unit, along with Actavis Group hf&#8217;s Purepac unit, infringe
a patent that expires in 2017. The drugmaker was seeking
compensation for profit it lost when sales plunged to $150
million in 2005 from $2.5 billion the previous year because of
the low-cost competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement covers Teva, its Ivax unit, and Actavis Group
hf&#8217;s Purepac unit, which had an agreement with Teva over its
Neurontin copy, said Chris Loder, a spokesman for New York-based
Pfizer. He declined to provide any financial details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-cost versions of Neurontin have been on the market
since 2004. A federal appeals court in 2007 overturned a U.S.
judge&#8217;s ruling that Teva and Ivax didn&#8217;t infringe Pfizer&#8217;s
patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Off-Label Uses &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The generic-drug companies also argued that Warner-Lambert
Co., which Pfizer purchased in 2000, turned Neurontin into a
blockbuster drug by illegally marketing it for uses not approved
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In 2004, Warner-
Lambert pleaded guilty and agreed to pay $430 million to resolve
U.S. criminal and civil allegations that it marketed Neurontin
for so-called off-label uses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent that was the subject of the trial is for a
process to make gabapentin, the active ingredient in Neurontin,
with fewer contaminants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ivax, then a standalone company, began selling a variation
of the drug in August 2004. Purepac started selling its generic
version in October 2004 with Teva after the companies agreed to
share any potential legal costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Warner-Lambert Co. v. Purepac Pharmaceutical,
00-cv-2931, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey
(Newark). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) said it is keeping
three oil pipeline segments shut near Baton Rouge, Louisiana,
because of high water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The pipelines are still shut down, the water is still
high in area,&#8221; Patricia Errico, a spokeswoman for ExxonMobil
Pipeline Co. in Houston, said in an e-mail. Exxon said on May 13
it was shutting two 12-inch crude oil lines and a 16-inch
products pipeline to reduce risk of damage from flooding along
the Mississippi River. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crude line segments supply Exxon&#8217;s Baton Rouge refinery
and Alon USA Energy Inc. (ALJ)&#8217;s Krotz Springs plant. The products
pipeline originates at the Baton Rouge refinery, according to
Exxon&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alon shut its 83,000-barrel-a-day refinery near Krotz
Springs on May 23 because of supply disruptions caused by rising
water levels on the Atchafalaya River. The company said it would
reopen in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s Baton Rouge refinery is the second-largest in the
U.S. with a capacity of 525,500 barrels a day. The plant is on
the east bank of the Mississippi. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, may boost return on equity by
taking capital from the businesses that invest the firm&#8217;s own
money, according to an analyst at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kian Abouhossein raised his recommendation on Goldman Sachs
stock to &#8220;overweight&#8221; from &#8220;neutral&#8221; because he thinks the
company can release $28 billion of capital from the investing
and lending segment, he said today in a note to investors. The
changes won&#8217;t take place immediately, said London-based
Abouhossein, who also lowered his estimate for 2011 earnings per
share to $12.80 from $13.50. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the world&#8217;s most profitable securities firm
before converting to a bank during the 2008 financial crisis, is
grappling with new rules that restrict the company&#8217;s ability to
make investments on its own behalf. Investing and lending, the
segment that includes the firm&#8217;s proprietary trades and its
principal investments in companies and other assets, contributed
30 percent of pretax profit last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What we believe is there&#8217;s a transformation of the
business from a client-plus-investing business to a client
business and that will allow the group to release quite a bit of
capital,&#8221; Abouhossein said in a telephone interview. &#8220;It will
not happen this year clearly&#8221; as the New York-based firm waits
to see how regulations are implemented, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abouhossein estimates that after new regulations kick in,
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s investing businesses will be using $30 billion
of capital. About $27 billion of that can be returned to
shareholders, shrinking Goldman Sachs&#8217;s business and making it
possible to generate 16 percent annual return on equity, an
increase from an estimated 12 percent to 13 percent, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compensation Expenses &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s shares rose $2.53, or 1.8 percent, to
$141.19 at 10:20 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading and have dropped 16 percent this year. The company had
$119.63 of tangible book value per common share at the end of
March, according to the firm&#8217;s most recent quarterly filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs can further enhance profit by paying a
smaller percentage of revenue as compensation, Abouhossein
wrote. Goldman Sachs has already cut its so-called compensation
ratio to about 40 percent of revenue from an average of 47
percent in the years 1999 to 2008, Abouhossein said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s very highly likely that comp ratios will further
decline,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Goldman can cut more than others on the
comp ratio and still be the most attractive&#8221; employer for
bankers and traders, he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerns about Goldman Sachs&#8217;s potential legal liabilities
in the wake of the financial crisis and a U.S. Senate
subcommittee report are already discounted by the stock price
and don&#8217;t pose significant further risk, Abouhossein wrote.
Goldman Sachs, which Abouhossein said operates as &#8220;a machine,&#8221;
can withstand any management changes, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying Opportunity &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the market is again over-reacting to the
negative news flow,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In our view, the price weakness
is a buying opportunity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abouhossein&#8217;s note said that he had attended a &#8220;group
meeting&#8221; with Michael S. Sherwood, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s London-based
vice chairman, who serves as co-chief executive officer of the
firm&#8217;s business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
Abouhossein didn&#8217;t attribute any of the views in his note to
Sherwood and said in the telephone interview that all of his
estimates and opinions on the firm&#8217;s future were his own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York,
declined to comment on Abouhossein&#8217;s note. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), ranked
first globally in advising on mergers, said takeovers involving
South Korean companies may climb by as much as 27 percent on
government stake sales and local firms buying overseas assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annual deal volumes may expand to $60 billion to $70
billion over the next three to four years, John Kim, Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s head of South Korea investment banking and co-country
head, said in an interview in Seoul on May 30. The Asian nation
had about $55 billion in such transactions last year, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local companies ambitious to expand beyond the domestic
market and those seeking access to resources are stepping up
bids for overseas assets, Kim said. The divesting of stakes in
firms that were bailed out following the 1997-98 Asian financial
crisis has also helped fuel the most takeovers in the first five
months since the same period in 2008, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;More Korean companies are teaming up with private equity
funds and other partners to buy overseas assets, a trend not
many would have imagined five years ago,&#8221; Kim, 44, said.
&#8220;Korean buyers have become much more sophisticated about going
abroad.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs vaulted to No. 2 among banks involved in
mergers linked to Korean companies, from No. 10 last year, after
advising buyers of a combined 4.96 trillion won ($4.6 billion)
of stakes in Hyundai Engineering  Construction Co. in the
nation&#8217;s largest deal this year. Local rival Korea Development
Bank is ranked first and Seoul-based Woori Investment 
Securities Co. is No. 3, data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based firm also advised a group including
Posco (005490), the world&#8217;s third-biggest steelmaker, on buying a stake
in a Brazilian rare-metal producer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mid-Sized Clients &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street firm, which has invested more than $1.5
billion in the nation since 1999, established a representative
office in Seoul in 1992 and made it into a branch in 1998,
according to the company. It got a local banking branch license
in June 2006, and now employs about 180 people in Seoul at the
bank, securities unit and an asset management service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim, who joined the New York-based firm in 2000 after
stints at Merrill Lynch  Co., Salomon Smith Barney and Credit
Suisse First Boston, said Goldman Sachs would consider extending
services to mid-sized Korean companies if they become more
active in overseas acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of companies such as Woori Finance Holdings Co. and
Hynix Semiconductor Inc. (000660) are likely to dominate domestic
takeovers, according to Kim. The Financial Services Commission
in May revived a plan to divest the government&#8217;s 57 percent
holding, worth 6.4 trillion won based on yesterday&#8217;s closing
price, in Woori. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Sheer Size&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholders of Hynix, the chipmaker that was bailed out by
creditors after the Asian crisis, held meetings in May to resume
attempts to sell their stakes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The sheer size of large deals, like the sale of Hynix
Semiconductor, will eclipse smaller transactions in terms of
prominence, but the number of overseas acquisitions by South
Korean companies will continue to grow,&#8221; Kim said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korean companies purchased $13.9 billion worth of
overseas assets last year, 35 percent more than a year earlier,
led by state-run Korea National Oil Corp.&#8217;s $2.8 billion
acquisition of U.K.-based Dana Petroleum Plc, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, local companies have announced $4.57 billion of
outbound transactions, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overseas Acquisitions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest is the bid by a group led by Seoul-based
sportswear company Fila Korea Ltd. (081660) to buy U.S.-based Acushnet
Co., the maker of Titleist golf balls and clubs, from Fortune
Brands Inc. (FO) for $1.23 billion in cash. The National Pension
Service, Mirae Private Equity and KDB Financial Group Inc. were
among buyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Korean companies may choose to bid for targets abroad
as part of a consortium to reduce the financial burden or gain
access to commodities or energy supplies without owning a
majority stake, Kim said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Korean firms making outbound acquisitions will be a
notable trend,&#8221; Kim said. &#8220;Armed with past experiences and the
financial firepower, they have become more confident and capable
of doing such deals.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount of cocaine trafficked
through West Africa has been declining steadily over the past
four years, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and
Crime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narcotics that transit from South Africa to Europe via West
Africa have seen a &#8220;plateau to slight drop,&#8221; said Preeta
Bannerjee, an information officer with Vienna-based UNODC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since peaking at as much as 47 metric tons in 2007, the
amount of trafficking drugs along that route may have fallen to
as low as 21 tons in 2009, the latest year for which data is
available, she said in an e-mailed statement. The volume of
cocaine consumed in Europe, however, has doubled in the last
decade, Bannerjee said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UN&#8217;s anti-crime agency will release new estimates of the
amounts of trafficked drugs on June 23, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a May 17 interview, Manuel de Almeida Pereira, a
legal adviser with the UNODC in Bissau, Guinea-Bissau&#8217;s capital,
said that traffic of Europe-bound cocaine from West Africa had
doubled since 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t have data to substantiate this claim,&#8221; Bannerjee
said by phone May 30. &#8220;If we go by seizures -- that&#8217;s the solid
evidence we have -- the seizures don&#8217;t suggest that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alpha Prime Fund Ltd. and Senator
Fund SPC, two funds sued along with HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) by the
trustee liquidating Bernard Madoff&#8217;s firm, filed so-called cross
claims against HSBC to try to recoup damages they incurred in
the fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC, which acted as custodian for the funds, failed in its
duty to monitor Madoff and profited from his Ponzi scheme at
their expense, Alpha Prime and Senator Fund said in a filing.
The London-based bank is therefore &#8220;liable for any damages
accrued by&#8221; the funds, they said in the May 27 filing in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC is &#8220;the direct cause of the loss of hundreds of
millions of Alpha Prime&#8217;s dollars and tens of millions of
Senator Fund&#8217;s dollars,&#8221; they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irving Picard, the Madoff firm&#8217;s trustee, sued HSBC and a
dozen feeder funds for $9 billion in December, saying they
should have known of the fraud. HSBC, Europe&#8217;s biggest lender,
has asked a district court judge in New York to dismiss Picard&#8217;s
suit, saying it didn&#8217;t know of the fraud and lost $1 billion of
its own money investing in funds that in turn put money with
Madoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tax and advisory firm KPMG LLP told HSBC about the
risks of Madoff&#8217;s business in 2006 and 2008, according to copies
of the reports obtained by Bloomberg, which was allowed access
to them on the condition they not be published. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KPMG identified 25 &#8220;fraud and related operational risks&#8221;
in the way Madoff received, checked and accounted for client
funds, it said in a 56-page report dated Feb. 16, 2006, more
than two years before the fraud came to light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limited controls in place &#8220;may not prevent fraud or
error occurring on client accounts if management or staff at
Madoff LLC either override controls or undertake activities
where appropriate controls are not in place,&#8221; according to the
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an e-mailed statement to Bloomberg in March, HSBC said
that &#8220;KPMG did not conclude in either of its reports that a
fraud was being committed by Madoff. HSBC did not know that a
fraud was being committed and lost $1 billion of its own assets
as a victim,&#8221; the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC spokesman Patrick Humphris and spokeswoman Juanita
Gutierrez didn&#8217;t respond to an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff is serving a 150-year sentence in federal prison in
North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. Alpha Prime, 09-01364, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks May Negotiate Menu of Options in Foreclosure Deal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. banks and state attorneys general, seeking to avoid
$17 billion in court claims over faulty foreclosures, are
discussing a settlement framework that may let firms choose from
a menu of options for helping borrowers, two people briefed on
the talks said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the proposal, Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Wells Fargo 
Co. (WFC), JPMorgan Chase  Co., Citigroup Inc. (C) and Ally Financial
Inc. would pay penalties and pledge billions of dollars in
relief to home buyers, one of the people said, asking not to be
named because the talks are private. Firms may fulfill
obligations to borrowers over time, choosing among options such
as reducing loan principal, cutting fees or paying moving costs,
the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stitching flexibility into settlements may help defuse
opposition from a group of Republican attorneys general, who
object to principal reductions sought by other states, one of
the people said. The pace of talks is accelerating, with parties
also nearing agreement on an industrywide overhaul of procedures
for handling mortgages, that person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State and federal officials have been meeting with the
largest U.S. loan servicers to resolve a nationwide probe into
documentation lapses during home seizures. Earlier this week,
attorneys general told the banks they will face an estimated $17
billion in claims if the inquiries result in civil lawsuits,
according to a person with knowledge of the talks. The banks had
previously offered to pay $5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the proposal, banks would pay the penalties to the
states, which would determine how to use the funds, according to
the people briefed on the talks. The separate relief funds,
which banks could decide how to provide, are expected to account
for a majority of the companies&#8217; costs, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan Frahm, a spokesman for Charlotte, North Carolina-based
Bank of America, and Sean Kevelighan, a spokesman for New York-
based Citigroup, declined to comment. Vickee Adams of San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo and Gina Proia of Detroit-based Ally
also declined to comment. A representative of New York-based
JPMorgan didn&#8217;t respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MBIA Can Proceed With Morgan Stanley (MS) Fraud Claim, Judge Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A MBIA Inc. (MBI) unit that backed mortgage-linked securities
which soured during the U.S. housing crisis can proceed with
fraud and breach-of-contract claims against Morgan Stanley and
two of the bank&#8217;s units, a New York judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State Judge Gerald Loehr in White Plains rejected motions
to dismiss claims by MBIA Insurance Corp. that the bank
fraudulently induced the insurer to issue policies covering
$223.2 million in mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MBIA also can proceed with claims that Morgan Stanley
Mortgage Capital Holdings LLC failed to cover defective loans
backing the bonds, and that Saxon Mortgage Services Inc.
breached loan-servicing obligations, the judge said. An unjust-
enrichment claim against Saxon was dismissed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased that the court has allowed our fraud and
contract claims to move forward,&#8221; Kevin Brown, a spokesman for
Armonk, New York-based MBIA, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary Claire Delaney, a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley in
New York, declined to comment. The ruling was dated May 26 and
posted on MBIA&#8217;s website May 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is MBIA Insurance Corp. v. Morgan Stanley,
29951/2010, New York State Supreme Court, Westchester County
(White Plains). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Unit Accused in Suit of Mismanaging Worker Retirement Plans &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc (BP/)&#8217;s North American unit was accused in a lawsuit by
its employees of mismanaging their retirement savings plans by
investing heavily in its own stock before last year&#8217;s Gulf of
Mexico oil spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP&#8217;s safety and compliance record before the April 2010
sinking of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig made the company&#8217;s
U.S. shares an &#8220;imprudent investment,&#8221; according to a
consolidated master complaint filed May 27 in federal court in
Houston. BP Corp. North America Inc., its directors and members
of the savings plan committee breached their fiduciary duty by
buying BP stock and &#8220;failing to divest the plans&#8221; of the
shares, the employees said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A disaster of the proportion of Deepwater Horizon and the
resulting losses were both predictable and likely,&#8221; the
employees said. &#8220;Because of defendants&#8217; failure to protect the
participants&#8217; retirement savings from being imprudently invested
in an excessively risky BP stock fund, plaintiffs and the class
have lost hundreds of millions of dollars in retirement
benefits.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP workers last year filed multiple lawsuits on behalf of
all U.S. employees participating in the company&#8217;s retirement
savings plans. The suits, combined together in the Houston
court, claim losses of more than $1 billion from the stock
plunge after the rig explosion and subsequent spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott Dean, a BP spokesman, didn&#8217;t return an e-mail seeking
comment May 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re BP Plc (BP) Securities Litigation, 4:10-
md-2185, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Texas
(Houston). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lehman Sued by Real-Estate Investors for Overvaluing Assets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) real estate units and
executives including former Chairman Richard Fuld were sued in
New York State Supreme Court by investors who said they
contributed part of $640 million in 2008 to properties for which
Lehman overpaid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investors, including Barbara J. Fried of Virginia,
described themselves in a filing as limited partners of Lehman
Brothers Real Estate Partners III and 10 other partnerships
formed by Lehman mostly in 2007, about a year before the former
investment bank&#8217;s bankruptcy. They seek unspecified damages and
fees for themselves and others in a similar situation, they said
in the filing May 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Lehman was writing down commercial real estate in
2007, the partnerships &#8220;spoke only of future market
opportunities,&#8221; according to the filing. Overvalued assets
including the &#8220;toy building&#8221; at 200 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan
were bought and &#8220;warehoused&#8221; for the funds, which planned to
borrow $1.2 billion to buy them and didn&#8217;t disclose the risk,
the investors alleged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit is similar to one filed in May 2010 by plaintiffs
including Glickenhaus  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimberly Macleod, a Lehman spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t respond to
an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Fried v. Lehman Brothers Real Estate
Associates, 651461/2011, New York State Supreme Court
(Manhattan). The main case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc., 08-13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Sued by PayPal Over Claims It Stole Trade Secrets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) was sued by PayPal Inc., the fastest-growing
unit at online marketplace EBay Inc. (EBAY), over claims it
misappropriated trade secrets from PayPal&#8217;s mobile-payment
business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Osama Bedier, a former PayPal executive now at Google,
stole PayPal&#8217;s confidential information, the company said in the
lawsuit filed May 27 in state court in San Jose, California.
Stephanie Tilenius, another ex-PayPal executive now at Google,
violated contractual obligations by recruiting Bedier, PayPal
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bedier &#8220;is now leading Google&#8217;s efforts to bring point-of-
sale technologies and services to retailers on its behalf,&#8221;
according to the complaint. &#8220;Bedier and Google have
misappropriated PayPal trade secrets by disclosing them within
Google and to major retailers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both companies are trying to move into storefronts from
online transactions and build their mobile businesses. PayPal,
based in San Jose, is working with major retailers to develop a
new type of point-of-sale system -- the equipment next to cash
registers where consumers swipe credit cards. download coupons
with a tap of their mobile phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Silicon Valley was built on the ability of individuals to
use their knowledge and expertise to seek better employment
opportunities, an idea recognized by both California law and
public policy,&#8221; Aaron Zamost, a Google spokesman, said in an e-
mailed statement. &#8220;We respect trade secrets, and will defend
ourselves against these claims.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, based in Mountain View, California, unveiled May 26
two services to let consumers pay merchants and download coupons
with a tap of their mobile phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is PayPal v. Google Inc., 11CV201863, California
Superior Court, County of Santa Clara (San Jose). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Wins Lawsuit Over Banker Injured on Skiing Trip &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s European unit won a discrimination
lawsuit by a London banker who said the bank cut his bonus and
fired him after he was injured on a skiing trip with clients and
had to work reduced hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision, handed down at the U.K. Court of Appeal May
27, overturned a 2008 ruling by a London employment tribunal
that Russell Chweidan, an executive director for the bank&#8217;s
hedge-fund sales credit team, was discriminated against because
of disability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chweidan seriously injured his back while skiing with a
client in March 2007, according to court documents. After the
injury he had to wear a back brace and work fewer hours. In
January 2008, he was given a bonus of $450,000, 44 percent less
than the previous year. He was fired in July 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I very much doubt whether the reduction in the
respondent&#8217;s bonus, dramatic though it was, provided sufficient
evidence of direct discrimination on grounds of disability,&#8221;
Judge Martin Moore-Bick said in the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for JPMorgan, Emma Smith, said at a hearing
earlier this month that Chweidan lost his job after he failed to
build up his &#8220;narrow&#8221; client base because he was unable to
entertain prospective clients in the evening. He had worked for
JPMorgan and its predecessors since 1994. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for JPMorgan, declined to
comment. Sharon Steward, a spokeswoman for Chweidan&#8217;s lawyers at
Leigh Day  Co., declined to immediately comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Russell Chweidan v. JPMorgan Europe Ltd.,
10-2193, Court of Appeal, Civil Division (London). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barai Capital Founder Admits Insider-Trading Fraud &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barai Capital Management LP founder Samir Barai pleaded
guilty to securities fraud and other charges as part of the U.S.
government&#8217;s largest crackdown on insider trading at hedge
funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barai, 39, of New York, also pleaded guilty May 27 in
Manhattan federal court to conspiracy to commit securities and
wire fraud, wire fraud and obstruction for impeding a federal
grand jury probe by destroying evidence. U.S. Magistrate Judge
Nathaniel Fox said Barai could face as long as 65 years in
prison when he is sentenced Aug. 29. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plea came just hours after Sonny Nguyen, 39, of San
Jose, California, and a former senior financial analyst for
Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Jed
Rakoff to conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud in a
related case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I deeply regret all of my actions in this case,&#8221; Barai
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barai and Nguyen are among 13 people charged in a federal
investigation of insider trading brought by U.S. Attorney Preet
Bharara in Manhattan. The probe is part of a larger
investigation by Bharara&#8217;s office of insider trading by hedge
funds including Galleon Group LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barai spoke into a microphone to describe his crimes,
saying he conspired with two SAC Capital Advisors LP fund
managers, Noah Freeman and Donald Longueuil, to violate federal
securities laws. Freeman and Longueuil have pleaded guilty to
insider trading charges in the case. Freeman is cooperating with
prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Barai and Nguyen implicated Winifred Jiau, then a
consultant at expert networking firm Primary Global Research LLC
in their schemes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barai and his lawyer, Evan Barr, declined to comment after
court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are U.S. v. Barai 11-cr-00116, and U.S. v.
Nguyen, 11-CR-161, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breyer Sold Wal-Mart Shares in Advance of Supreme Court Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer sold between
$15,000 and $50,000 in Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) shares last year in
a move that has let him take part in a case that may limit
class-action lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale, revealed May 26 in Breyer&#8217;s annual financial
disclosure report, took place in January 2010, three months
before a federal appeals court ruled that Wal-Mart had to face a
gender-bias suit on behalf of potentially a million female
workers. The justices heard arguments in March on Wal-Mart&#8217;s
appeal of that decision and are scheduled to rule by the end of
June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breyer and his wife in recent years have sold shares in
more than a dozen companies so he can take part in additional
cases at the Supreme Court. Justices typically disqualify
themselves from cases involving companies in which they have a
financial interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Justice John Roberts has also sold a number of his
individual stock holdings since joining the court in 2005.
According to his disclosure report, Roberts last year sold his
Pfizer Inc. (PFE) stock, valued at $15,000 or less, eliminating a
holding that on several occasions prevented him from taking part
in Supreme Court cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breyer continues to hold stock in a number of companies,
including IBM Corp., Amgen Inc. (AMGN) and Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) Roberts
owns shares of Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Intel Corp. (INTC) and Freddie Mac,
while Justice Samuel Alito owns Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Bristol-
Myers Squibb Co. Alito sold less than $15,000 in Walt Disney Co. (DIS)
stock last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Court Filings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smurfit-Stone Investor Lawsuit Most Popular Docket &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawsuit by Smurfit-Stone Container Corp. (SSCC) investors asking
a judge to block a $3.5 billion buyout of the packaging maker by
Rock-Tenn Co. (RKT) because it doesn&#8217;t provide enough for the
company&#8217;s shares, was the most-read litigation docket on the
Bloomberg Law system last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investors lost the bid May 20 after a judge found
Smurfit-Stone executives didn&#8217;t sell the company too cheaply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chancery case is Marks v. Smurfit-Stone, CA-6164,
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). The bankruptcy case was
Smurfit-Stone Container Corp., 09-10235, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next head of the International
Monetary Fund must be capable of helping to create a new global
framework, for the existing U.S.-led order has had its day,
Jeffrey Sachs, who heads the Earth Institute at Columbia
University, wrote in the Financial Times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past 20 years, the U.S. has been unable to provide
monetary stability, financial regulation and fiscal rectitude;
if the dollar remains the only key currency, the world will go
on suffering the consequences of America&#8217;s troubles, as happened
during the financial crisis, Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is a system based on several regional
currencies: the dollar, the euro, the yuan and, perhaps, the
Brazilian real and the Indian rupee; that means regional groups
such as the eurozone, the Arab world and the main economies of
southeast Asia must assume responsibility for monetary policy,
financial regulation, tax coordination and enforcement and
fiscal policy harmonization, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IMF would still have plenty to do, for the world is
&#8220;rife with lawlessness and recklessness, with tax havens and
regulation-free zones catering to the avarice of globally mobile
capital,&#8221; Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new IMF leader should not be &#8220;anointed&#8221; but selected on
the basis of careful vetting, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is putting
&#8220;troublesome&#8221; restrictions on makers of processors used to run
the coming Windows tablet-computer operating system, Acer Inc. (2353)
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer J.T. Wang said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re really controlling the whole thing, the whole
process,&#8221; Wang said at the Computex trade show in Taipei
without identifying the restrictions. Chip suppliers and PC
makers &#8220;all feel it&#8217;s very troublesome,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will unveil a Windows operating system with a
touch-screen interface for tablet computers this week, three
people familiar with the company&#8217;s plans said last week. Acer,
the No. 3 maker of personal computers in 2010, is among PC
makers that expect to sell more tablet computers once the
operating system is introduced to narrow the gap with Apple
Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows President Steven Sinofsky is scheduled to make a
presentation at the All Things D conference in Rancho Palos
Verdes, California, this week while Vice President Steve Guggenheimer will address Computex. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker, will
showcase the interface running on hardware with an Nvidia Corp. (NVDA)
Tegra chip, the people said last week, declining to be
identified because the plans are confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Martin, a spokesman for Microsoft, couldn&#8217;t
immediately be reached for comment today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tighter controls on how hardware makers use Windows may
enable Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft to bring devices to
the market more quickly and ensure they run smoothly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is rushing to release a version of Windows
compatible with chip technology from ARM Holdings Plc (ARM) so
Windows-based tablet computers can compete with Apple&#8217;s iPad,
which controls an estimated 64 percent of the tablet market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global market will almost quadruple this year to 70
million units from 18 million in 2010, according to estimates in
a May 17 report by Jefferies Group Inc. Apple will control about
64 percent of the tablet market this year, dropping to 41
percent in 2012, when 158 million units probably will be sold,
according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) offered
Libya the opportunity to become one of its biggest shareholders
two years ago, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing
unidentified people familiar with the matter and Libyan and
Goldman documents that it&#8217;s reviewed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offer of preferred shares or unsecured debt in Goldman
followed the almost total loss during the financial crisis of an
investment of $1.3 billion in the bank by the Libyan Investment
Authority, the Middle East country&#8217;s sovereign wealth fund, the
newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talks between Goldman and the fund continued for months
during the summer of 2009, eventually coming to nothing, the
Journal said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussions inside Goldman about how to repair the
relationship with Libya, which was furious about the loss,
included Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein,
David Viniar, the finance chief, and Michael Sherwood, the
bank&#8217;s top executive in Europe, the newspaper said, adding that

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. settled a dispute over $222.3 million in
claims on the defunct firm that the second-biggest U.S. bank
inherited when it bought Washington Mutual Bank after Lehman&#8217;s
September 2008 bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement was disclosed in a court filing today.
Details weren&#8217;t given. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WaMu claims stemmed from a swap agreement it had with
Lehman&#8217;s special-financing unit, according to proofs of claim
filed by JPMorgan. The New York-based bank paid itself back for
what was owing by taking collateral deposited with it by Lehman,
according to the claim documents. Lehman had objected that $80
million of the collateral was part of a guarantee agreement that
JPMorgan wasn&#8217;t entitled to draw on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement doesn&#8217;t affect Lehman&#8217;s ongoing $8.6 billion
lawsuit against JPMorgan. JPMorgan, Lehman&#8217;s main clearing bank
in the 2008 credit crisis, is trying to get the suit dismissed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two companies are due to present their agreement on the
WaMu claims to a Manhattan bankruptcy judge tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ),
08-13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). The adversary case is Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
v. JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 10-03266, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) is
proposing a framework to settle claims against the failed
investment bank from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) and other banks related to derivatives transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman hopes to use the proposal to avoid court fights with
13 banks that are its largest derivatives counterparties and
help resolve its bankruptcy case so it can pay creditors, it
said in a summary of the plan made public yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a major step forward in resolving this important
group of derivatives claims,&#8221; Daniel Ehrmann, Lehman&#8217;s head of
international operations and co-head of derivatives, said in an
e-mailed statement. &#8220;We are hopeful that counterparties who
have provided input to the framework will settle and look
forward to announcing such progress soon.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 30 financial institutions filed about $22 billion of
derivatives claims, which Lehman estimated would be reduced to
about $11 billion, it said yesterday. With the new settlement
framework, Lehman expects the aggregate amount of allowed claims
of the 30 institutions will be about $10 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The derivatives proposal applies to 13 banks and will be
used to determine the amounts of their claims, according to the
proposal. It only becomes effective if at least 10 of them
accept the plan and settlement agreements are reached by June
30, Lehman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Vigorously Contest&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar amount of the derivatives claims of the 13 banks
under the settlement framework hasn&#8217;t been made public, Kimberly Macleod, a Lehman spokeswoman, said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman will &#8220;vigorously contest&#8221; the claims of the banks
and seek to reduce the claims to amounts lower than those
proposed under the settlement plan if it&#8217;s not accepted, Lehman
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides Goldman and JPMorgan, the other banks affected by
the proposal include Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Barclays Plc (BARC), BNP
Paribas (BNP), Citigroup Inc. (C), Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), Deutsche Bank
AG (DBK), Bank of America&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit, Morgan Stanley (MS), Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS), Societe Generale (GLE) SA, and UBS AG (UBSN),
according to the plan. Spokespeople for the banks either
declined comment or couldn&#8217;t immediately be reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     June 1 (Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN) lead dealers purchasing mortgage bonds sold by
the U.S. Treasury since the department began disposing of its
holdings in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales totaled $10 billion in May, bringing the amount off-
loaded to $23.7 billion, the department said today in an e-
mailed statement from Washington. The Treasury has said it plans
to sell as much as $10 billion a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is the first time the Treasury disclosed buyers of
the securities, which are guaranteed by government-supported
mortgage-finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. New York-
based JPMorgan bought 17.8 percent of the securities sold since
March, while Zurich-based Credit Suisse bought 11.8 percent,
according to the department&#8217;s rankings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe that the publication of this scorecard will
help both maximize taxpayer returns and provide additional
transparency,&#8221; Mary Miller, the Treasury&#8217;s assistant secretary
for financial markets, said in a May 2 statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department began buying Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
mortgage securities after seizing the companies in September
2008 as then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson sought to
stabilize markets and reduce the cost of mortgages amid the
worst global financial crisis and U.S. housing slump since the
Great Depression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed Program &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve the next year started its own program
to purchase $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage securities.
Acquisitions in the $5.4 trillion market ended in March 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Treasury&#8217;s holdings of mortgage bonds fell to $106
billion at the end of May, down 45 percent from a peak of $192
billion in December 2009, according to the department&#8217;s data.
Refinancing and home sales tied to loans underlying the bonds
have also shrunk the portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Capital and Royal Bank of Canada ranked as the
third- and fourth-largest purchasers from the Treasury since its
sales began, according to the data. Each bought 10 percent, the
data showed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) won&#8217;t face
criminal prosecution related to sales of mortgage-linked
securities because such a move could threaten the U.S. financial
system, according to Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Justice, which is reviewing a Senate
subcommittee report that alleged Goldman Sachs misled clients
before the financial crisis, will avoid jeopardizing the fifth-
largest U.S. bank by assets because it&#8217;s viewed as &#8220;too big to
fail,&#8221; Hintz wrote in note to clients today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If an alleged violation is identified during a Goldman
investigation, we expect a reasoned response from the Justice
Department,&#8221; Hintz wrote. &#8220;In a worst case environment, we
would expect a &#8216;too big to fail&#8217; bank such as Goldman to be
offered a deferred-prosecution agreement, pay a significant fine
and submit to a federal monitor in lieu of a criminal charge.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment on Hintz&#8217;s note. Laura Sweeney, a
spokeswoman for the Justice Department in Washington, didn&#8217;t
immediately reply to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under a deferred-prosecution agreement, the U.S. files
charges against a company and agrees to dismiss them after a
certain period, typically if the company pays a fine or penalty
and improves its governance or other practices. In October, the
Justice Department dismissed a conspiracy case against UBS AG (UBSN),
Switzerland&#8217;s biggest bank, after the expiration of an 18-month
deferred prosecution agreement with the Zurich-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Litigation Risk &#8216;Manageable&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hintz, ranked the No. 1 analyst covering brokerage firms in
a survey by Institutional Investor last year, said that the
Justice Department&#8217;s approach to criminal charges against
companies has changed since accounting firm Arthur Andersen
LLP&#8217;s business collapsed following a felony charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2003 Justice Department policy document &#8220;stated that
prosecutors can reward cooperation by offering a negotiated
settlement to a targeted company that can range from immunity
from criminal indictment to a deferred prosecution agreement,&#8221;
Hintz wrote. &#8220;Ultimately, the targeted company is treated not
as a hardened criminal but as the equivalent of a juvenile
offender that can be reformed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s potential civil litigation risk related to
sales of mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt
obligations &#8220;is manageable,&#8221; Hintz wrote, because the statute
of limitations for many of the claims has already passed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, settled claims against Teva Pharmaceutical Industries
Ltd. (TEVA) over generic versions of the Neurontin epilepsy drug,
ending a trial in federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial terms are confidential, Teva, the world&#8217;s biggest
generic-drug company, said in a statement. Teva will be able to
continue selling the copy under a license from Pfizer, according
to a filing in the case. U.S. District Judge Faith Hochberg in
Newark, New Jersey, who was presiding over the trial that began
May 17, dismissed the suit yesterday, according to the court
docket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer claimed that copies of the pill made by Teva and its
Ivax unit, along with Actavis Group hf&#8217;s Purepac unit, infringe
a patent that expires in 2017. The drugmaker was seeking
compensation for profit it lost when sales plunged to $150
million in 2005 from $2.5 billion the previous year because of
the low-cost competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement covers Teva, its Ivax unit and Actavis Group
hf&#8217;s Purepac unit, which had an agreement with Teva over its
Neurontin copy, said Chris Loder, a spokesman for New York-based
Pfizer. He declined to provide any financial details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-cost versions of Neurontin have been on the market
since 2004. A federal appeals court in 2007 overturned a U.S.
judge&#8217;s ruling that Teva and Ivax didn&#8217;t infringe Pfizer&#8217;s
patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The generic-drug companies also argued that Warner-Lambert
Co., which Pfizer purchased in 2000, turned Neurontin into a
blockbuster drug by illegally marketing it for uses not approved
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In 2004, Warner-
Lambert pleaded guilty and agreed to pay $430 million to resolve
U.S. criminal and civil allegations that it marketed Neurontin
for so-called off-label uses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subject of the trial is patent 6,054,482, which covers
a process to make gabapentin, the active ingredient in
Neurontin, with fewer contaminants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Warner-Lambert Co. v. Purepac Pharmaceutical,
00-cv-2931, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey
(Newark). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patent Fee Changes &#8216;Critical&#8217; to Economy, Commerce Tells House &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Letting the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office set its own
fees and keep all the money it collects is &#8220;critical&#8221; to
promoting innovation, according to the Commerce Department,
which oversees the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House is considering a measure known as the America
Invents Act that would mark a fundamental change in how patents
are reviewed and the biggest revision to U.S. patent law since
1952. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke wrote in support of the
proposed legislation in letters yesterday to Representative
Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican who chairs the House Judiciary
Committee, and Michigan Representative John Conyers, the panel&#8217;s
top-ranking Democrat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate passed a similar measure in a 95-5 vote on March
8. Locke said the administration, which supported the Senate
version, wants &#8220;prompt passage&#8221; of legislation, saying it may
help promote job creation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Enactment of a balanced bill is an important part of the
administration&#8217;s goal of &#8216;out-innovating&#8217; our economic
competitors and winning the future -- and it can be done with no
cost to taxpayers and no addition to the deficit,&#8221; Locke wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House may take up the measure next month, according to
the office of Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a Virginia
Republican. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key provision of the legislation would give the patent
office more power over its funding by allowing the agency to
alter its fee structure and keep Congress from diverting fees
for non-patent purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This structure is critical to enable the USPTO to better
meet the needs of America&#8217;s innovators,&#8221; Locke wrote,
suggesting there should be technical changes to allow the patent
office to make interim fee adjustments &#8220;so it can best use this
new authority on day one.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measure also calls for granting patents to the first
inventor to file an application, eliminating an often years-long
procedure to determine who first came up with an idea. The
first-to-file system is used in most countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House patent bill is H.R. 1249. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEB Wins U.S. Supreme Court Patent Fight With Global-Tech &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court, in a decision limiting the rights
of some patent holders, upheld a $5 million award against a
home-appliance maker for persuading retailers to sell a copycat
version of an SEB SA (SK) deep fryer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 8-1 ruling set a high bar for claims that one company
induced another to infringe a patent, while saying SEB met that
standard in its suit against Hong Kong-based Global-Tech
Advanced Innovations Inc. (GAI) The majority said the patentholder
must prove the defendant knew about the infringement or at least
was &#8220;willfully blind&#8221; to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling will help companies that make mobile phones or
design software, said Edward Reines, a patent lawyer with Weil
Gotshal  Manges LLP.  &#8220;This is a big deal,&#8221; said Reines, who
filed a brief on behalf of companies including Red Hat Inc. (RHT),
General Motors Co., Yahoo! Inc., EBay Inc. (EBAY) and Hewlett-Packard
Co. (HPQ) &#8220;In a world with products that are so versatile and
flexible, a higher standard to prove inducement of infringement
makes sense.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case divided businesses along what have become familiar
lines in patent cases -- with large technology companies
including Google Inc. (GOOG) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) urging limits on
infringement suits, and the drug industry arguing for robust
patent protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing for the Supreme Court, Justice Samuel Alito said a
lower court standard made it too easy for patentholders to win
suits alleging inducement to infringe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Alito said SEB met the Supreme Court&#8217;s
new standard. SEB proved to a jury that a Global-Tech unit
&#8220;took deliberate steps to avoid knowing&#8221; that it was selling a
knockoff version of a patented SEB fryer, Alito wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In developing its fryer, Pentalpha bought an SEB fryer in
Hong Kong and copied its &#8220;cool touch&#8221; features, Alito said.
Pentalpha never told its lawyer that it had copied the design,
and the lawyer later issued a written opinion that the fryer
didn&#8217;t violate any of the patents he had uncovered, Alito said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Anthony Kennedy was the lone dissenter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Global-Tech Appliances v. SEB SA, 10-6. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;College Bookstore Association Seeks Dismissal of Amazon Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trade group for college bookstores that has challenged
Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)&#8217;s advertising claims for discounted textbooks
asked a federal judge to dismiss the online retailer&#8217;s lawsuit
against it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Association of College Stores Inc. was sued by
Amazon.com May 3 in a complaint seeking a court order declaring
that its advertised 30 percent discounts on new textbooks and 90
percent discounts on used books aren&#8217;t false or misleading.
Amazon asked the court to say those ads didn&#8217;t violate federal
trademark law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, the Oberlin, Ohio-based group asked the Better
Business Bureau&#8217;s national advertising division to review the
ads, which it says are deceptive and haven&#8217;t been substantiated.
Amazon.com hasn&#8217;t been harmed by the association or its request
for a review, so the complaint should be thrown out, the group
said in a May 27 filing in federal court in Seattle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit appears to have been filed to thwart the
college store group&#8217;s effort to have the Amazon.com ads reviewed
by the bureau, the filing says. The complaint was closed because
the bureau doesn&#8217;t accept cases that are the subject of
lawsuits, the filing says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A voice-mail message left at Seattle-based Amazon.com&#8217;s
media office wasn&#8217;t immediately returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Amazon.com v. National Association of College
Stores Inc., 11-754, U.S. District Court, Western District of
Washington (Seattle). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NCR Sues Blockbuster Trust Over Movie-Rental Kiosks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NCR Corp. (NCR) sued a trust set up by Blockbuster Inc. (BLOAQ) in a bid
to continue licensing the company&#8217;s name for movie-rental
kiosks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Blockbuster Express name, design and related trademarks
are held by the BB 2009 trust, NCR said in the lawsuit filed in
U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Delaware. Blockbuster, once
the largest video-rental chain, sold its assets to Dish Network
Corp. in April for about $320 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dish rejected the NCR contract and sent the company a
termination letter, NCR said. NCR, based in Duluth, Georgia,
builds kiosks, often placed in grocery and convenience stores,
where customers can rent and drop off movies. The company, which
branded more than 9,000 kiosks with the Blockbuster name, pays
for use of the brand and collects all revenue from rentals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;NCR has undertaken significant time and expense in
establishing and operating kiosks throughout the United States
branded with the trademarks, and has earned substantial revenues
from those operations,&#8221; Melanie Sharp, an attorney representing
NCR, said in court papers filed May 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockbuster transferred its interest in the trust to Dish
as part of its asset sale, according to court papers. NCR
contends that the trust wasn&#8217;t included in the sale because it
wasn&#8217;t part of Blockbuster&#8217;s bankruptcy filing. In addition,
only the trust has the right to terminate the license, not Dish,
NCR claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc Lumpkin, a Dish spokesman, didn&#8217;t immediately respond
to an e-mail seeking comment. Dish, based in Englewood,
Colorado, is the second-largest satellite-television provider in
the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is NCR Corp. v. BB 2009 Trust, 11-cv-481, U.S.
District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;St. Laurent Tells Court Red Shoe Soles Neither New Nor Unique &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yves Saint Laurent America Inc. responded to a trademark-
infringement case brought by Christian Louboutin SA by saying
there is nothing particularly distinctive about putting a red
sole on a pair of shoes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louboutin sued St. Laurent in federal court in Manhattan
April 7, accusing the French fashion house of misleading the
public and tarnishing the shoemaker&#8217;s reputation. The shoemaker
introduced the red soles in 1992 and since then they have been
on all of the company&#8217;s luxury shoes, according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Barneys&#8217;s website, Louboutin red-sole shoes are priced
from $445 to more than $4,000 a pair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saint Laurent has been selling red-sole shoes under brand
names such as Tribute, Palais and Woodstock at high-end fashion
stores that also sell Louboutin footwear, including Saks Fifth
Avenue, Barneys New York and Bergdorf Goodman, according to the
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its response to the complaint, St. Laurent said red
soles have been used for centuries, including those worn by
France&#8217;s King Louis XIV in the 17th century. Dorothy, the
heroine of &#8220;Wizard of Oz&#8221; clicked together the heels of her
red-soled ruby slippers and was transported home at the end of
the 1939 film, St. Laurent said in its pleadings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louboutin &#8220;cannot plausibly assert that red outsoles are
singularly associated with the Louboutin brand,&#8221; the French
fashion house said. St. Laurent accused Louboutin of making a
&#8220;demonstrably false&#8221; statement to the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office when the shoemaker claimed in a trademark
filing that its use of the red sole was exclusive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;St. Laurent also said that it isn&#8217;t using a red sole as a
signature element. It colored the soles of all its shoes to
match the uppers, achieving a monochromatic effect, the company
claims. Yves Saint Laurent, the Algeria-born French fashion
designer for whom the fashion house is named, died in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to seeking a judicial declaration that it isn&#8217;t
infringing, St. Laurent asked the court to order the
cancellation of the Louboutin red-sole trademark and for awards
of money damages, attorney fees and litigation costs. St.
Laurent asked for extra damages because of what it called
&#8220;Louboutin&#8217;s malicious, willful, tortuous interference and
unfair competition.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Christian Louboutin SA v. Yves Saint Laurent
America Inc., 11-2381, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas Lawmakers Seek Public Disclosure of &#8216;Fracking&#8217; Formulae &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil drilling companies that operate in Texas may soon be
unable to protect as trade secrets the formulas for the
chemicals they use to fracture rock formations, Associated Press
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state House of Representatives approved a measure May
28 requiring drilling companies to disclose their so-called
&#8220;fracking&#8221; chemicals, the news service reported. The governor
hasn&#8217;t said whether he will sign it, AP said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drillers pump millions of gallons of water containing their
proprietary blend of chemicals into the ground in their quest
for oil, according to AP. Some environmental groups are
concerned that the chemicals can harm groundwater or soil, AP
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world&#8217;s largest
soft-drink maker, is in talks with China&#8217;s government to list
shares in Shanghai as the company accelerates expansion in the
world&#8217;s most populous nation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are interested in exploring the opportunity of
listing our stock on the Shanghai Stock Exchange,&#8221; Geoff Walsh,
Coca-Cola&#8217;s Hong Kong-based public affairs and communications
director for Asia, said in an e-mailed reply to queries. &#8220;We
continue to have positive discussions with Chinese government
officials as we look at this opportunity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola, whose Sprite is China&#8217;s top-selling soft drink,
will probably raise spending in the country as it invests a
planned $2 billion faster than expected, Chief Executive
Officer Muhtar Kent said in November. China has the world&#8217;s
third-biggest stock market, and companies including HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA) are seeking permission to list on its bourses to
raise funds in the Chinese currency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This would be attractive for Chinese domestic investors
as it would give them more diversity in the type of companies
they can invest in,&#8221; said Arjuna Mahendran, Singapore-based
head of investment strategy for Asia at HSBC Private Bank,
overseeing $460 billion globally. &#8220;It also makes a lot of
sense for Coca-Cola as it gives them access to international
activities to fund their Chinese expansion and allows them to
raise funds in yuan.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building Factories &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 14 percent of Coca-Cola&#8217;s $35 billion in sales last
year were made in the Pacific region, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The maker of Minute Maid juice is
building plants in China at a faster pace than it expected as
it jostles for market share with rivals including PepsiCo Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve been ahead on that commitment&#8221; to invest $2
billion in China from 2009 to 2011, Walsh said in a phone
interview today. He declined to comment further on any plans to
sell shares in Shanghai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While overseas companies can sell stock in Hong Kong,
they&#8217;re barred from doing so in mainland China. The government
may approve a board for overseas companies on the mainland by
the end of June and the first listing may occur as soon as
October, Caixin Century magazine reported May 30, citing an
unidentified investment banker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mainland China doesn&#8217;t include Hong Kong, Macau or Taiwan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC, LSE &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC, Europe&#8217;s largest bank by market value, aims to raise
a &#8220;significant amount&#8221; through a Shanghai listing, Michael Geoghegan, chief executive officer at the time, said last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE) wants to list in Shanghai
by the end of 2011, Chief Executive Officer Xavier Rolet said
last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Most of the impact from a Coca-Cola listing will be in
terms of improving its brand in China,&#8221; Charles Yan, Hong
Kong-based greater China consumer analyst for Yuanta Securities
Co., said in a phone interview today. &#8220;In China, if you&#8217;re a
public firm, it helps your brand. It&#8217;s also much easier to get
a loan from local banks, and some local governments treat
listed companies better.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China controls capital flows and only allows citizens to
buy overseas-listed shares through institutions under its

&lt;p&gt;About 100 JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
current and former employees in Japan may have failed to declare
taxable assets worth about 2 billion yen ($25 million), the
Yomiuri newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tokyo Regional Taxation Bureau told the employees that
they may have omitted to report stocks in overseas accounts
after exercising options for JPMorgan shares, the newspaper
reported, without saying how it obtained the information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan isn&#8217;t aware of an investigation by the authorities
against the employees, the bank said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have worked and will work in close cooperation with
Japan&#8217;s tax authorities to provide all necessary personal
compensation information of each JPMorgan employee,&#8221; the

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) has asked chipmakers
that want to use the next version of Windows for tablets to work
with no more than one computer manufacturer, three people with
knowledge of the plan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chipmakers and computer makers that agree to the terms will
get incentives from Microsoft in exchange for accepting the
restrictions, which tie a single chipmaker to one tablet design,
said the people, who declined to be identified because the new
program hasn&#8217;t been made public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking to limit variations may help Microsoft speed the
delivery of new Windows tablets by keeping tighter control over
partners and accelerating development and testing. Though the
program isn&#8217;t mandatory, the restrictions may impede chip- and
computer makers from building a variety of Windows-based models
to vie with Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPad, the people said. In past versions
of Windows software, chipmakers could work with multiple
computer manufacturers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft is still in the development process on the next
version of Windows, continuing the engineering work with our
silicon partners as part of the technology preview we talked
about in January,&#8221; Microsoft said in an e-mailed statement.
&#8220;We continue to talk regularly with hardware partners around
the world as part of our development process.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sole Alliances &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the plan being proposed by Microsoft, a given
chipmaker would have to ally itself with a single PC
manufacturer in order to qualify for certain incentives. Those
may include features that ensure the device runs better or lower
prices for the software, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acer Inc. (2353) Chief Executive Officer and Chairman J.T. Wang,
in an interview yesterday at the Computex trade show in Taipei,
said Microsoft was trying to set limits on other companies. He
didn&#8217;t specify the restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re really controlling the whole thing, the whole
process,&#8221; Wang said of Microsoft. &#8220;They try to set the game
rules,&#8221; he said, and chip suppliers and PC makers &#8220;all feel
it&#8217;s very troublesome,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first time Microsoft has produced a Windows
operating system that works with ARM Holdings Plc (ARM)&#8217;s technology,
increasing the number of potential chip suppliers. The program
seeking to pair one chipmaker with one computer maker might
increase the chances of initial success by enabling the company
to focus efforts on a smaller number of designs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design Limits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the rules may constrain chipmakers&#8217; ability to have
their products featured in a range of devices. Computer makers
whose designs aren&#8217;t chosen may be left out, one of the people
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Microsoft&#8217;s program, chip suppliers will also be able
to select a second computer maker for clamshell-style notebook
computers that use the new operating system, one of the people
said. Chipmakers for the new version of Windows, including Intel
Corp. (INTC), Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD), Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM)
and Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN), can also decline to be part of the
program and work with whichever computer makers they want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program only applies to the version of Windows that&#8217;s
being tailored for mobile computers, the person said. The
regular version of Windows for desktop PCs will have no such
limits, as with past versions of Windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preview Tomorrow &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. will preview the next generation of the
company&#8217;s Windows operating system to clients and media tomorrow
in Taipei, Steven Guggenheimer, a corporate vice president at
Microsoft, said at the Computex trade show today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker, has failed
to gain traction in the market for tablets dominated by Apple,
which develops the hardware and software that runs the iPad,
introduced in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acer was the No. 3 maker of PCs in 2010, according to
researcher IDC. The company is among those hoping to boost sales
by selling tablet devices, a faster-growing slice of the
computer market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global tablet market will almost quadruple this year to
70 million units from 18 million in 2010, according to estimates
in a May 17 report by Jefferies Group Inc. Apple will control
about 64 percent of the 2011 tablet market, dropping to 41
percent in 2012, when 158 million units will probably be sold,
according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said last
week that machines with the new operating system, which he
referred to as Windows 8, would be released in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft later retracted the
comments, claiming they were a misstatement. The company is
eager to expand Windows to computing devices such as phones and
tablets, Ballmer said in a speech in New Delhi last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are in a race,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We are not doing that
badly, frankly. We are doing pretty well in that race. But the
race is on to continue to push Windows to a variety of new form
factors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) accused
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) of deliberately trying to delay a
bankruptcy investigation by moving at a &#8220;glacial pace&#8221; in
turning over documents related to the probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman claimed Goldman Sachs is deliberately moving slowly
to run out a deadline for providing information for Lehman&#8217;s
probe into whether rumors about its condition damaged its
business during the 2008 financial crisis, according to a filing
yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. Attorneys for
Lehman said the documents are needed to determine whether to
make claims against Goldman Sachs, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman Sachs is deliberately moving at a glacial pace in
an effort to run out the statute of limitations without
producing the requested documents,&#8221; Lehman said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees of Goldman Sachs &#8220;may have been involved in
originating or spreading rumors about Lehman,&#8221; according to
yesterday&#8217;s filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, Lehman sought e-mails and instant messages from
Goldman Sachs custodians in New York who were involved in
marketing prime brokerage services to hedge funds and
proprietary trading of Lehman securities in London, according to
the filing. After a series of negotiations, Goldman Sachs said
it had begun searching for documents from 11 of 37 custodians
and was unable say when that search would be completed,
according to yesterday&#8217;s filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman is asking U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck to order
Goldman Sachs to provide the documents within two weeks of his
decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history on
Sept. 15, 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
08-13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, was subpoenaed by the Manhattan
District Attorney&#8217;s office for information on the firm&#8217;s
activities leading into the credit crisis, two people familiar
with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subpoena relates to the U.S. Senate&#8217;s Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations report on Wall Street&#8217;s role in
the collapse of the financial markets, which accused New York-
based Goldman Sachs of misleading buyers of mortgage-linked
investments, the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity
because the inquiry isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has dropped 16 percent in New York trading
since the Senate subcommittee, led by Michigan Democrat Carl M. Levin, used the firm as a case study in a 640-page report on its
findings released in April. At the time, Levin said Goldman
Sachs had also misled Congress about the company&#8217;s bets on the
housing market. The firm has said its testimony was truthful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t comment on specific regulatory or legal issues,
but subpoenas are a normal part of the information request
process and, of course, when we receive them we cooperate
fully,&#8221; said David Wells, a company spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A subpoena is a request for information and doesn&#8217;t mean
the company is a target of a criminal investigation. Analysts
including Sanford C. Bernstein  Co.&#8217;s Brad Hintz have said they
don&#8217;t expect the firm to be criminally prosecuted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erin Duggan, chief spokeswoman for Manhattan District
Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares Decline &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs dropped 1.3 percent to $134.38 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate report was referred to the U.S. Department of
Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are
also investigating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin said when his report was released that federal
prosecutors should review whether to bring perjury charges
against Goldman Sachs Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 56, and other current and former employees who
testified to Congress last year. Levin said they denied under
oath that Goldman Sachs took a financial position against the
mortgage market solely for its own profit, statements the
senator said were untrue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schneiderman&#8217;s Probe &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs met last month with New York Attorney General
Eric Schneiderman&#8217;s office as part of his examination of
mortgage securitization before the housing collapse, according
to a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition
of anonymity because the probe isn&#8217;t public. The meeting took
place within the past two weeks, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schneiderman has been conducting a broad examination of
mortgage practices and the packaging and sale of loans to
investors, according to the person. JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), UBS
AG (UBSN), Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Morgan Stanley (MS) and
the Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) also are part of that
investigation, the person said. Four bond insurers have been
subpoenaed as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lauren Passalacqua, a spokeswoman for Schneiderman,
declined comment, as did Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Wells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year Goldman Sachs paid $550 million to settle SEC
claims related to its marketing of the complex securities known
as collateralized debt obligations. The settlement resolved
claims that the company failed to disclose that hedge fund
Paulson  Co. was betting against, and influenced the selection
of, CDOs the company was packaging and selling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Phillips Chemical Co. LLC
reported a unit upset at its Cedar Bayou chemical plant in
Baytown, Texas, according to a filing with state regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A compressor, which tripped and caused the upset, was
restarted, the company said in a filing with the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality. Emissions associated with
the upset started at 10 p.m. local time yesterday and lasted 6
hours, the filing said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cracking furnace and an ethylene unit were included in
the listed sources of the emissions, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steam crackers split oil products like naphtha and
liquefied petroleum gases through pressure and heat. Outages can
increase prices for ethylene and propylene as companies turn to
spot markets to help them meet supply contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is a joint venture of Chevron Corp. (CVX) and
ConocoPhillips. (COP) Steam crackers process natural gas liquids or
naphtha into basic petrochemicals used in plastics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cedar Bayou plant is located about 32 miles (51

&lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief
executive officer of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), said the bank is
buying back stock at a faster pace than originally announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the most profitable U.S. bank, has already
purchased almost $3 billion of its own shares this year, Dimon
told investors at a conference hosted by Sanford C. Bernstein 
Co. in New York today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We told the world we were going to buy back $3 billion at
a minimum&#8221; this year, Dimon said. &#8220;Obviously we&#8217;re buying back
at a much faster pace than that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was among the first of the major U.S. banks
allowed by the Federal Reserve to raise its quarterly dividend
in March. The bank increased its payout to 25 cents a share from
5 cents and authorized up to $15 billion in buybacks, with as
much as $8 billion eligible for repurchase this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon said the New York-based bank&#8217;s buyback depends on
whether there are better opportunities to invest elsewhere as
well as limits on capital plans set by federal regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed told banks in November to consider conservative
dividend payouts that would still allow for a significant build-
up of capital. The central bank said in March that firms are
&#8220;generally expected&#8221; to keep dividends no higher than 30
percent of earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have a lot of excess capital," Dimon said. "We can&#8217;t
use all that excess capital. Therefore buying back stock becomes
attractive for us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon said the bank&#8217;s limit on buybacks this year is $8
billion. &#8220;We apply again to regulators next year&#8221; to release
more capital, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed capital tests measured how banks would absorb
stresses from a typical recession, such as a decline in the
value of riskier assets and a higher unemployment rate that
would pressure borrowers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying options on Google Inc. (GOOG) will
allow investors to position for potential volatility around the
earnings report from the owner of the world&#8217;s most popular
search engine, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy Google July $530 calls and the same
number of July $530 puts in a strategy known as a &#8220;straddle&#8221;
that profits from volatility in the share price, Katherine Fogertey and John Marshall, equity-derivatives strategists at
Goldman, said in a note today. Three-month implied volatility is
near one-year lows, they wrote. Google shares rose 0.5 percent
to $528.06 at 4 p.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Buying options in early reporters tends to fare better
than later reporters, when we tend to see implied volatility
decline across the board,&#8221; the strategists wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of the Mountain View, California-based company have
risen 7 percent in the past year, compared with a gain of 20
percent for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. Over the past eight
quarters, Google shares have moved an average of 6.1 percent
around the earnings releases, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman strategists said the expected July 14 earnings-
report day is an estimate, and that there&#8217;s a risk with the
straddle strategy if the profit announcement comes after the
July 15 options expiration. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Icon Plc (ICON)&#8217;s alliance with Pfizer Inc.
is &#8220;likely&#8221; to generate in excess of $100 million in revenue a
year, and potentially &#8220;significantly more,&#8221; Chief Executive
Officer Peter Gray said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It should mean a significant extra amount of business for
the next couple of years,&#8221; as the deal &#8220;builds up,&#8221; said Gray
today in an interview at the Dublin-based company&#8217;s
headquarters. The company expects to boost its capacity to cope
with the influx of new business, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icon said May 26 it will serve as one of two preferred
providers of clinical trial implementation services for Pfizer,
the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker. The deal should allow Icon to use
spare capacity, which had &#8220;squeezed&#8221; margins in the first
quarter, according to Gray. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We were aware that this was coming and have not been
allowing our capacity to shrink.&#8221; Gray said. Pfizer is cutting
to two from 17, the companies it partners with on clinical
development, according to Gray. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icon&#8217;s share price was little changed at 17.35 euros at 3
p.m. in Dublin. It has risen 1.8 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icon expects to boost its business by attracting more
outsourced business as drugmakers cut their research and
development spending, according to Gray. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Budget &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer CEO Ian Read said in February the company will cut
the drugmaker&#8217;s research budget to between $6.5 billion to $7 in
2012 compared with its previous target of $8 billion to $8.5
billion. The New York-based company is closing its Sandwich,
England, research hub, where it developed Viagra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icon&#8217;s Gray said he would be &#8220;surprised&#8221; if by the end of
2012 the company&#8217;s workforce doesn&#8217;t reach &#8220;at least&#8221; 8,500,
compared with about 7,700 people today. An employee of Icon will
travel to Asia this month to follow up on potential acquisition
leads, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icon said in April it paid an initial cash consideration of
$27.7 million for its acquisition of Oxford, England-based
Oxford Outcomes, a health outcomes consultancy firm. Icon is
interested in acquiring in companies involved in &#8220;late phase&#8221;
research, such as technology-driven firms that can help reduce
the cost of tracking clinical trials, said Gray. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icon said April 21 net revenue rose 5 percent to $229.3
million in the first quarter ended March 31. Income from
operations fell 59 percent to $10.97 million, with operating
margins before restructuring charges falling to 7 percent from
12.2 percent in the same quarter a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;

expect to deliver low-teen growth on a consolidated basis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Icecek, in which Coca-Cola Co. (KO) holds a 20.1
percent stake, is the fifth-largest bottler of Coca-Cola Co. in
the world, according to an investor presentation on its website.
The Istanbul-based company&#8217;s Turkish sales totaled 74 percent of
the 665.4 million unit cases sold in 2010. Total Sales advanced
14 percent to 2.75 billion liras ($1.7 billion) in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per capita consumption of sparkling beverages is 44 liters
a year in Turkey and this is &#8220;still way below that of
neighboring countries and the European Union average,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill
said. Bulgaria&#8217;s consumption is 89 liters per person a year, he
said. &#8220;Our long-term guidance for Turkey operations is high
single-digit growth and mid-to-high-teens growth in
international markets,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Icecek rose as much as 80 kurus to 22.85 liras
and traded 2 percent higher at 22.50 liras as of 12:29 p.m. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth Opportunities &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company sells products in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan,
Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Syria, Iraq, Jordan and
Turkey, with bottling plants in 20 locations, including eight in
Turkey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Icecek expects &#8220;the pace of growth to decelerate
in the second half of 2011,&#8221; after the &#8220;high growth&#8221; in
volumes of 17 percent in the second half of 2010, O&#8217;Neill said.
&#8220;We expect the growth momentum to normalize throughout the
year. We also expect net revenue growth to normalize in the
second half in line with volume growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 62 percent of people in Coca-Cola Icecek&#8217;s market of
363 million are aged below 29 and this presents &#8220;tremendous
growth opportunities for companies operating in the region,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neill said. &#8220;You will see more countries becoming a part of
CCI in the future,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As we look at the next 10 years, we see a more positive
demographic picture,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said. &#8220;There is no reason&#8221; why
Turkey can&#8217;t match the Bulgarian per capita consumption and no
reason Pakistan can&#8217;t reach the Turkey per capita figure &#8220;over
time,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central Asia, Iraq &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company expects central Asian operations to lead growth
this year as consumer spending in these markets is rising,
O&#8217;Neill said. Central Asian sales volume grew 25 percent in the
first quarter, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Iraq operations will be an important growth driver for
CCI,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said. Iraq operations delivered over 30 percent
sales growth for the fifth consecutive quarter, he said. Coca-
Cola Icecek bought a 70 percent stake in the Iraqi bottler CC
Beverage Ltd. for $36.9 million in March, raising its stake to
100 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan, which has a population of 185 million and
accounts for Coca Cola Icecek&#8217;s biggest volume sales outside
Turkey, is expected to improve growth this year after floods in
2010, he said. The company&#8217;s sales in the country rose 8.3
percent in 2010 and are expected to grow &#8220;in the mid-teens&#8221;
this year, he said. The company will invest $300 million in
Pakistan in the next three years, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Icecek&#8217;s total capital expenditure will be about
12 percent of net revenue this year, compared with 5 percent in
the past two years, O&#8217;Neill said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A federal judge refused to grant Walt
Disney Co. (DIS) an injunction that would prevent satellite television
provider Dish Network Corp. (DISH) from giving its subscribers free
access to Disney movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge George Daniels in New York denied the
motion by Disney Enterprises Inc. for a preliminary injunction
in a one-page order signed June 1 and filed yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney sued Dish, the second-largest satellite TV company,
in May, accusing it of distributing Disney movies over the Starz
movie channels without charging subscribers an additional
premium, as is done with a service such as HBO. Starz is a unit
of Liberty Media Corp. Disney accused Dish of copyright
infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Dish Network pays hundreds of millions of dollars for the
right to distribute Starz content to our customers, which
includes the rights to a number of Disney movies,&#8221; Englewood,
Colorado-based Dish said May 3 in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dish said the contract is between Starz and Disney, and
that &#8220;we will vigorously defend our rights against any attempt
to drag our customers into the middle of their dispute.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc Lumpkin, a spokesman for Dish, said today the company
has no comment on the judge&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zenia Mucha, a spokeswoman for Burbank, California-based
Disney, didn&#8217;t immediately return a call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney dropped 68 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $39.38 at 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Dish fell
53 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $29.03 in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DirecTV, based in El Segundo, California, is the largest
satellite TV provider in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Disney Enterprises Inc. v. Dish Network LLC,
11-2973, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s ABC is close to an
agreement with Katie Couric for a syndicated talk show, two
people with knowledge of the situation said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parties may announce an accord as soon as Monday, said
the people, who declined to be identified because they weren&#8217;t
authorized to speak publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An agreement with Couric would give ABC and its affiliate
stations a brand name replacement for Oprah Winfrey, whose
syndicated afternoon program ended a 25-year run on May 25.
While distributed by CBS Corp. (CBS), Winfrey&#8217;s program was carried by
ABC stations covering almost half of the U.S. TV households,
according to information provided by the networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zenia Mucha, a spokeswoman for Burbank, California-based
Walt Disney Co., didn&#8217;t immediately respond to requests for
comment. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier today the two
sides were finalizing an agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Couric, 54, was anchor of the &#8220;CBS Evening News&#8221; for five
years before stepping down last month. Prior to that she was co-
host of the &#8220;Today&#8221; show on NBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney fell 68 cents to $39.38 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have gained 5
percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;United Therapeutics Corp. (UTHR) shares are
likely to rise when data from a drug trial come out, which is
expected this month, and options are a good way to bet on
potential gains, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy United Therapeutics July $65 calls,
according to Goldman options strategists Katherine Fogertey and
John Marshall. They cited Terence Flynn, Goldman&#8217;s analyst on
the company, who sees a 75 percent chance of a positive outcome
from a Phase 3 trial of an oral version of the Remodulin drug
and rates the stock a &#8220;buy.&#8221; Shares of the Silver Spring,
Maryland-based company fell 0.7 percent to $63.11 yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see calls as attractive to own versus stock,&#8221; the New
York-based strategists said, using Flynn&#8217;s estimate that the
stock could trade at $82 if oral Remodulin is successful, or
fall to $58 if it fails. &#8220;Our analyst&#8217;s upside is stronger than
options imply&#8221; given volatility levels, they wrote. June
implied volatility is 102 percent, while July&#8217;s is 77 percent
and August&#8217;s is 63 percent, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;United Therapeutics has risen 20 percent in the past year,
compared with a 27 percent gain by the Standard  Poor&#8217;s MidCap
400 Index. The company&#8217;s price-to-earnings ratio is 34.1,
compared with 21.3 for the index. The stock has declined 11
percent since April 27, after United Therapeutics reported
first-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings-per-share that were
below analyst estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Following approval, our analyst views United Therapeutics
as a strong merger-and-acquisition candidate, keeping us from
recommending longer-dated options, despite the lower implied
volatility,&#8221; Fogertey and Marshall said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc. and its co-founder Mark
Zuckerberg asked a court to order Paul Ceglia, the New York man
who claims half of Zuckerberg&#8217;s holdings, to turn over the
original contract and e-mails on which he bases his suit, saying
the steps are needed to short-circuit a fraud on the court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook yesterday asked a federal judge in Buffalo for an
order requiring Ceglia, 37, to provide expedited fact-finding,
or discovery, in the case. The company said forensic examination
of the documents will support its claim that the contract is
&#8220;an amateurish forgery&#8221; and the e-mails are fabricated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This discovery will bring this case to an immediate end
by establishing that the purported contract and e-mails are
forgeries,&#8221; Facebook and Zuckerberg said yesterday in the court
filing. &#8220;The contract is a cut-and-paste job, the e-mails are
complete fabrications and this entire lawsuit is a fraud.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook asked for an order forcing Ceglia to immediately
produce the original April 2003 signed contract and all e-mails
referred to in his complaint. The company also asked the court
to seize Ceglia&#8217;s computers and otherwise to delay the exchange
of evidence in the case until the documents are turned over and
inspected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Ceglia welcomes the opportunity to expedite discovery
in this case and disagrees with the opinions within the filing,
which have been made by those who have not examined the actual
contract at issue in this case or any of the other relevant
evidence,&#8221; Ceglia&#8217;s lawyers said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Ceglia v. Zuckerberg, 1:10-cv-00569, U.S.
District Court, Western District of New York (Buffalo). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tribune Retirees, Deutsche Bank Sue Shareholders Over Buyout &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former shareholders of Tribune Co. were sued by a Deutsche
Bank AG (DBK) unit and retirees over claims that the media company&#8217;s
2007 leveraged buyout was a fraud that pushed it into
bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit of Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank, in its role as
trustee for senior noteholders, sued dozens of shareholders,
brokers and other defendants yesterday in federal courts in
Philadelphia and Boston. The creditors are owed about $2.5
billion, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The LBO lined the pockets of Tribune&#8217;s former
shareholders with $8.5 billion of cash at the expense of
Tribune&#8217;s creditors, and precipitated Tribune&#8217;s careen into
bankruptcy,&#8221; the Deutsche Bank unit said in the complaints. It
asks to recover money paid to shareholders in the buyout that
creditors labeled &#8220;fraudulent transfers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Scottrade Inc. were among defendants named in the retirees&#8217;
complaint, which seeks $109 million. Yesterday&#8217;s lawsuits were
the first of a group of cases authorized in March by Tribune&#8217;s
bankruptcy judge. The targeted firms sold Tribune shares for
themselves or on clients&#8217; behalf as part of the buyout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Tribune, pressured by its majority shareholders and lured
by a scheme orchestrated by Sam Zell, abandoned its duties and
obligations to its retirees, employees and creditors,&#8221;
according to the retirees&#8217; complaint filed in New York state
court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zell, who has been named in similar lawsuits, has
repeatedly denied that creditors have any legal basis for suing
him. Tribune, which owes about $13 billion to creditors, is
valued at about $6.75 billion, according to court records filed
by the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Halldin, a spokesman for Charlotte, North Carolina-
based Bank of America, and David Wells, a spokesman for New
York-based Goldman Sachs, declined to comment on the retirees&#8217;
lawsuit. Carrie Hibbs, a spokeswoman for St. Louis-based
Scottrade, said she couldn&#8217;t comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Philadelphia cases are Deutsche Bank Trust Company
Americas v. Commonwealth of PA-PSERS, 11-03570, and Deutsche
Bank Trust Company Americas v. Ametek Inc. Employees Master
Retirement Trust, 11-03569, both U.S. District Court, Eastern
District of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Boston case is Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas v.
Anne G. Taylor, 11-10982, U.S. District Court, District of
Massachusetts (Boston). The retirees&#8217; case is Niese v.
AllianceBernstein LP, 651516/2011, Supreme Court of the State of
New York, New York County (Manhattan). The bankruptcy case is In

&lt;p&gt;Abbott in Settlement Talks on Depakote Marketing, U.S. Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and the U.S. are &#8220;engaged in active
settlement discussions&#8221; of the government&#8217;s lawsuit alleging
the company improperly marketed its drug Depakote, Justice
Department lawyers said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. asked the judge overseeing the suit to halt
proceedings until July 8, postponing a May 31 scheduled filing
of an amended complaint by the government and allowing
settlement discussions to continue. The U.S. also asked the
court to consolidate four related false-claims cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The short extension would allow the parties to determine
if a negotiated resolution is possible, which could reduce the
demand on judicial resources,&#8221; Timothy Heaphey and Daniel
Bubar, Justice Department lawyers, wrote in a May 20 filing in
federal court in Abingdon, Virginia. &#8220;Consolidating the actions
would avoid having nearly identical filings made in four
different actions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whistleblowers claim in the suits that Abbott Park,
Illinois-based Abbott marketed Depakote, an epilepsy drug, for
unapproved uses including agitation and aggression in patients
with dementia, autism, sexual compulsion and other disorders.
The government joined the False Claims Act suits in February,
according to court dockets. More than 25 states also sued Abbott
over the marketing of Depakote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to cooperate with the investigation,&#8221; Scott
Stoffel, a spokesman for Abbott, said yesterday in a phone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depakote is approved to prevent migraines, treat acute
manic episodes in bipolar patients and treat seizure disorders
in adults and children, he said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. ex rel. Spetter v. Abbott Laboratories,
1:10-cv-00006, U.S. District Court, Western District of Virginia
(Abingdon). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legal Reviews &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Said to Get Subpoena From New York Prosecutor &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by
assets, received a subpoena from the Manhattan District
Attorney&#8217;s office seeking information on the firm&#8217;s activities
leading into the credit crisis, according to two people familiar
with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t comment on specific regulatory or legal issues,
but subpoenas are a normal part of the information request
process and, of course, when we receive them we cooperate
fully,&#8221; said David Wells, a company spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The request relates to the U.S. Senate&#8217;s Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations report on Wall Street&#8217;s role in
the housing market collapse, which accused New York-based
Goldman Sachs of misleading buyers of mortgage-linked
investments, the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity
because the inquiry isn&#8217;t public. The Senate report was referred
to the U.S. Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange
Commission, which are also investigating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erin Duggan, chief spokeswoman for Manhattan District
Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A subpoena is a request for information and doesn&#8217;t mean
the company is a target of a criminal investigation. Analysts
including Sanford C. Bernstein&#8217;s Brad Hintz have said they don&#8217;t
expect the firm to be criminally prosecuted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Antitrust Probe Could Mean Years of Self-Defense &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) may be forced to spend years defending itself
in a U.S. Federal Trade Commission investigation that could be
the government&#8217;s biggest antitrust probe since the Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT) case, Bloomberg News&#8217;s Jeff Bliss and Sara Forden report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if Google ultimately prevails, the probe might create
uncertainty around the company&#8217;s business, slowing its momentum,
lawyers and analysts said. Federal courts ruled that Microsoft
engaged in illegal monopoly practices in a dispute that
stretched over two U.S. presidential administrations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Google effectively is already running under the yellow
flag of caution,&#8221; Eric Goldman, associate professor and
director of the High Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara
University in California, said in an interview. An FTC probe
&#8220;could make it more difficult&#8221; for Google to compete, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency is likely to examine whether Google is using its
position in Internet search to subdue rivals in adjacent markets
with threats and jacked-up advertising rates, the lawyers said.
The company&#8217;s conduct in new sectors, such as mobile devices,
also will probably be a focus, they said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expert Networker Tapped &#8216;Cooks&#8217; for Inside Tips, U.S. Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Primary Global Research LLC consultant Winifred Jiau
gave secret information from insiders at technology companies
she called &#8220;cooks&#8221; to hedge fund managers for a fee,
prosecutors told a federal jury in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In opening statements yesterday at Jiau&#8217;s criminal trial,
Assistant U.S. Attorney David Leibowitz described a
&#8220;sophisticated&#8221; scheme in which he said insiders at technology
companies were paid by fund managers for illegal tips. He said
her information was precise &#8220;to the decimal point.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leibowitz said Jiau spoke in code, demanding payments for
the information, which she called &#8220;sugar,&#8221; and describing her
sources as &#8220;cooks&#8221; and referring to tips as &#8220;recipes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At the heart of that scheme, playing a critical role, was
the defendant,&#8221; Leibowitz told jurors. &#8220;The defendant was the
insider who was worth every penny they paid her, and she
received over $200,000 they paid her for that information.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jiau, 43, of Fremont, California, is charged with
securities fraud as well as conspiracy to commit wire and
securities fraud for allegedly passing inside tips about Nvidia
Corp. (NVDA) and Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charges are connected to the arrests of eight employees
or consultants at Primary Global Research, a Mountain View,
California-based firm that links investors with industry experts
at public companies. She is the first expert networker to go on
trial for insider-trading charges and, if convicted, may face as
long as 25 years in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Jiau, 11-cr-00161, U.S. District Court,

&lt;p&gt;Marijuana for Migraines Tests Sprint Policy on Workplace Drugs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 21-year-old woman suffered from migraine headaches. Her
health-care provider told her to use marijuana for relief. She
did, and was fired from her telemarketing job after failing a
drug test required by Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She sued TeleTech Holdings Inc. (TTEC), which ran a sales office
in Bremerton, Washington, under contract with Sprint, for
dismissing her in 2006. The state&#8217;s medical-marijuana law lets
her smoke pot for medical purposes, she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outcome of the case, now before the state&#8217;s Supreme
Court, may guide U.S. employers caught between their efforts to
maintain a drug-free workplace and laws in 16 states and the
District of Columbia that permit the use of marijuana for
medical purposes, Bloomberg Government&#8217;s Stephanie Armour
reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Employers are in a tizzy,&#8221; Danielle Urban, a lawyer at
Fisher  Phillips LLP in Denver who represents companies, said
in an interview. &#8220;What if an employee comes in impaired? No one
wants to be sued. It could be very costly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal law further complicates employer decisions. It
defines marijuana as a controlled substance similar to cocaine
and heroin, with no accepted medical use and penalties for sale
and possession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies are fighting, and so far winning, when lawsuits
are filed by applicants or employees who are rejected after
failing company drug tests. The screening is part of the hiring
process for all job candidates at 55 percent of U.S. companies,
according to a 2010 survey by the Alexandria, Virginia-based
Society for Human Resource Management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Roe v. TeleTech Customer Care, 81283-7, Supreme
Court for the State of Washington (Olympia). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Loses Appeal of STMicroelectronics Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) lost its appeal of a U.S. judge&#8217;s
order to pay STMicroelectronics NV (STM), Europe&#8217;s largest chipmaker,
about $400 million over unauthorized investments in auction-rate
securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal appeals court in Manhattan yesterday upheld
most of a March 2010 ruling by U.S. District Judge Deborah
Batts, who affirmed a 2009 arbitration award against Zurich-
based Credit Suisse by the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court said Batts should have lowered the amount owed by
Credit Suisse because, before her decision, Geneva-based
STMicroelectronics sold securities with a face value of $153.5
million to Deutsche Bank AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The district court&#8217;s judgment should have credited Credit
Suisse for approximately $75 million that ST received in
exchange for selling some of the failed auction-rate securities
at issue in this case, and should have reduced Credit Suisse&#8217;s
liability of interest accordingly,&#8221; the appeals panel wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Walker, a spokesman for Credit Suisse, said the
ruling will have an &#8220;immaterial impact&#8221; on the amount of money
the bank sets aside for anticipated losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The auction-rate securities market, once valued at $330
billion, collapsed in February 2008 when dealers stopped
participating in the auctions. Interest on the investments,
typically municipal and student-loan-backed bonds and preferred
shares, reset every seven to 35 days at bidding managed by the
dealers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STMicroelectronics accused Credit Suisse of investing in
risky securities after claiming it would invest only in student
loans backed by the U.S. government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is STMicroelectronics NV v. Credit Suisse
Securities (USA) LLC, 10-3847, U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit (Manhattan), and 09-cv-01388, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Madoff Employee Eric Lipkin to Plead Guilty, U.S. Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Bernard Madoff employee Eric Lipkin will plead
guilty to federal criminal charges including falsifying books
and records of a broker-dealer and bank fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipkin will plead guilty to six separate crimes, Assistant
Manhattan U.S. Attorneys Lisa Baroni and Julian Moore said in a
letter to U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain, who is
presiding over the case. Lipkin is set to plead on June 6,
Baroni said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to two counts of falsifying records and one
count of bank fraud, Lipkin will also plead guilty to two counts
of conspiracy and one count of making a false statement. He
faces as long as 70 years in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The parties anticipate that, at the conference, Eric
Lipkin, a former employee in the investment advisory business of
Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, will plead guilty
to the information pursuant&#8221; to an agreement with the
government, prosecutors said in the June 1 letter that was made
public yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Filan, a lawyer for Lipkin, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Lipkin, 10-CR-228, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Xinhua Finance CEO Fredy Bush Pleads Not Guilty to Fraud &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former chief executive officer of Xinhua Finance Ltd. (9399),
accused of taking part in a $50 million insider-trading scheme,
said she isn&#8217;t guilty of defrauding investors and lying to
regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loretta Fredy Bush, who headed Xinhua Finance for almost a
decade, pleaded not guilty yesterday in federal court in
Washington to charges of conspiracy, mail fraud and making false
statements. Bush entered her plea by telephone from her
residence in Hawaii because of illness, her lawyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant U.S. Attorney Seth B. Waxman said Bush must
present herself to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in
Honolulu for booking. U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth said
Bush will remain free pending trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lamberth has ordered that details of Bush&#8217;s illness remain
private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two former Xinhua Finance board members indicted with Bush,
Shelly Singhal and Dennis Pelino, pleaded not guilty last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xinhua Finance, the first Chinese company listed on the
Tokyo stock exchange, provides information products focused on
Chinese and international financial markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three are accused of using entities to disguise the
sale of shares in Shanghai-based Xinhua Finance from the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission and investors and engage in
insider trading, according to an indictment. They are also
accused of manipulating the company&#8217;s balance sheet to avoid
impairment charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Singhal, 11-cr-00142, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Litigation Departments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White House Counsel Bob Bauer Leaving, Administration Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White House Counsel Bob Bauer is leaving his job to return
to private practice and will be replaced by his principal
deputy, Kathryn Ruemmler, the administration announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bauer, 59, will return to the law firm Perkins Coie LLP and
serve as general counsel for President Barack Obama&#8217;s re-
election campaign as well as Obama&#8217;s personal lawyer, according
to a White House statement. Bauer will also serve as the general
counsel to the Democratic National Committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruemmler, 40, joined the administration at the start of
Obama&#8217;s term and has been a deputy in the counsel&#8217;s office since
January 2010. Before joining the administration she was a
litigation partner in the Washington office of Latham  Watkins
LLP from 2007 to 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruemmler served as a federal prosecutor for six years and
was part of the prosecution team that led to the convictions of
former Enron Corp. executives, receiving an award from the
attorney general&#8217;s office for her work. She also worked in the
counsel&#8217;s office during the end of President Bill Clinton&#8217;s
administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German Attorneys Call for 19 Percent Increase in Fees &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German lawyers deserve a 19 percent increase in the
statutory fees they can charge in cases where they can&#8217;t
negotiate an hourly rate, the head of the country&#8217;s attorney
association said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fees haven&#8217;t been altered since 1994, Wolfgang Ewer,
the president of the German Attorneys Association, said at the
group&#8217;s annual meeting in Strasbourg, France, yesterday. If the
increase were implemented by 2013, lawyers would get an average
annual raise of 2.1 percent, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For years, the bar had to bear a pay freeze, while costs
for running a law firm and employees&#8217; salaries have been rising
steadily,&#8221; Ewer said. &#8220;Professional legal service needs fair
pay.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Germany, attorneys earn a fee based on the value of a
lawsuit or the case at issue, even if they lose. The losing
party in a court case has to pay both sides&#8217; legal bills. If
their case shows some prospect of success, those unable to pay
can get state support to cover the costs of hiring a lawyer.
Because the legal aid is taxpayer-funded, any increase in
lawyers&#8217; fees also raises public spending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statutory fees don&#8217;t typically apply to attorneys
representing large companies who are generally paid by the hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger said in
her speech at the meeting yesterday that she will work to change
the payment structure as part of a reform of court and other
fees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renewed proposals to eliminate the
tax-exempt status of municipal bonds as a way to reduce the $1.5
trillion federal deficit are unlikely to succeed, Bank of New
York Mellon Corp. said in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abolishing the asset class would drive up borrowing costs
and further strain the budgets of muni issuers, leading to cuts
in services and capital projects, according to the report
yesterday by Standish Mellon Asset Management Co., the fixed-
income arm of the New York-based investment bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A proposed budget submitted by Representative Paul Ryan,
the House Budget Committee chairman, and a report from the
Simpson-Bowles debt commission embraced by President Barack
Obama in December both sought to eradicate the tax-exempt
treatment of municipal bonds, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the effort to address the federal deficit will bring
tax loopholes under scrutiny, &#8220;it is unlikely that municipal
entities will be penalized,&#8221; Steven Harvey, a senior portfolio
manager, and Nathan Harris, a research analyst, wrote in the
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Egypt Bourse Says New Tax Won&#8217;t Affect Stock-Trading Profits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Egyptian government&#8217;s plan to levy a capital-gains tax
only applies to company dividend distributions and not to
profits from trading in stocks, the Egyptian Exchange said
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bourse is studying the plan and will discuss it with
the business community and the markets regulator before advising
the government, the exchange said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10 percent tax &#8220;is still a proposed law that will be
discussed&#8221; with local business councils &#8220;to figure out how to
best implement it so as not to affect foreign investment in
Egypt,&#8221; bourse Chairman Mohamed Abdel Salam said in the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The North African country plans to levy the tax starting in
the next fiscal year on dividend payments, mergers and
acquisitions and asset revaluations, Finance Minister Samir
Radwan said. Egypt is trying to rein in a widening budget
deficit as it raises subsidy spending and public salaries to
meet public demand for improved living standards following the
overthrow of former President Hosni Mubarak in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global Capital Surcharge May Affect 26 Firms, Memo Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many as 26 financial firms could be forced to hold extra
capital to avoid collapses that would threaten global financial
stability, according to a participant at a meeting of the
Financial Stability Board last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We understand that it is likely that the number will be
in the 15-26 range,&#8221; Tim Ryan, chief executive officer of the
Global Financial Markets Association, a finance-industry group,
said in a memo sent to board members following the meeting in
Frankfurt. &#8220;Though a capital buffer is likely, the structure,
amount and implementation timeline is still undecided,&#8221; Ryan
said in the memo, obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is discussing
forcing so-called global systemically important financial
institutions to hold additional capital buffers equivalent to as
much as 3 percent of risk-weighted assets, people familiar with
the negotiations said in March. New York-based GFMA, whose board
includes executives from Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS), says the surcharge will suppress returns on equity that
will already be under pressure from new capital requirements
that will apply to all banks, not just the largest. &lt;/p&gt;

section, below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Said to Get Subpoena From New York Prosecutor &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by
assets, received a subpoena from the Manhattan District
Attorney&#8217;s office seeking information on the firm&#8217;s activities
leading into the credit crisis, according to two people familiar
with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t comment on specific regulatory or legal issues,
but subpoenas are a normal part of the information request
process and, of course, when we receive them we cooperate
fully,&#8221; said David Wells, a company spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The request relates to the U.S. Senate&#8217;s Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations report on Wall Street&#8217;s role in
the housing market collapse, which accused New York-based
Goldman Sachs of misleading buyers of mortgage-linked
investments, the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity
because the inquiry isn&#8217;t public. The Senate report was referred
to the U.S. Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange
Commission, which are also investigating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erin Duggan, chief spokeswoman for Manhattan District
Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A subpoena is a request for information and doesn&#8217;t mean
the company is a target of a criminal investigation. Analysts
including Sanford C. Bernstein&#8217;s Brad Hintz have said they don&#8217;t
expect the firm to be criminally prosecuted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Antitrust Probe by U.S. May Mean Years of Self-Defense &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) may be forced to spend years defending itself
in a U.S. Federal Trade Commission investigation that could be
the government&#8217;s biggest antitrust probe since the Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT) case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if Google ultimately prevails, the probe might create
uncertainty around the company&#8217;s business, slowing its momentum,
lawyers and analysts said. Federal courts ruled that Microsoft
engaged in illegal monopoly practices in a dispute that
stretched over two U.S. presidential administrations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency is likely to examine whether Google is using its
position in Internet search to subdue rivals in adjacent markets
with threats and jacked-up advertising rates, the lawyers said.
The company&#8217;s conduct in new sectors, such as mobile devices,
also will probably be a focus, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FTC has alerted technology companies that it plans to
gather information from them for the probe, three people
familiar with the matter said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FTC&#8217;s investigation is the latest example of government
regulators&#8217; growing concern that the Mountain View, California-
based company is restricting competition on the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union and the state of Texas have begun
investigations and the U.S. Justice Department is monitoring
Google&#8217;s compliance with an agreement letting it purchase ITA
Software Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google has set aside $500 million for a U.S. government
investigation into online pharmacy ads the company accepted that
may have violated the law, a person familiar with the matter
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mistique Cano, a spokeswoman for Google, said in an e-mail
that the company &#8220;understands that with success comes
scrutiny.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are happy to answer questions about our business, as
we have during four separate reviews by the federal government
over the past four years,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Korean Regulator Criticized for Failing to Probe Banks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea&#8217;s financial watchdog came under increased
scrutiny over its monitoring of savings banks after Prime
Minister Kim Hwang Sik said it resisted probes by the state
auditor into the lenders last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Supervisory Service, or FSS, tried to
dissuade the Board of Audit and Inspection from examining
savings banks between January and April 2010 for suspicion of
improper lending, Kim told lawmakers yesterday in Seoul. Kim was
chairman of the state auditor at the time, before taking his
current post in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling Grand National Party on June 1 proposed a probe
by an independent counsel into savings banks amid growing
speculation that regulators overlooked illicit activity at the
lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allegations by the prosecutor&#8217;s office come as the FSS is
tightening oversight of foreign banks&#8217; securities trading to
prevent rapid capital flows from disrupting markets. The
regulator said this week London-based HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) and
Paris-based Credit Agricole SA (ACA) were penalized for improperly
outsourcing Korean branches&#8217; derivatives trading to branches in
Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IRS Allows Extension of Deadline for Offshore Disclosure &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internal Revenue Service will let taxpayers with
undeclared offshore accounts apply for a 90-day extension of the
Aug. 31 deadline for coming forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change, announced on the IRS website yesterday, would
let taxpayers apply for the extension in writing by showing that
they have made a &#8220;good-faith attempt&#8221; to meet the deadline and
explain what information they are missing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IRS is conducting its second voluntary offshore
disclosure program, allowing taxpayers to pay penalties related
to undeclared accounts to avoid criminal prosecution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar program ended in October 2009 and attracted about
15,000 taxpayers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MUFG May Get Systemically Important Status, Deutsche Bank Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306), Japan&#8217;s biggest
publicly traded bank, may be defined as one of the most
important lenders to the international financial system,
according to Deutsche Bank AG. (DB) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Status as a so-called global systemically important
financial institution will probably be given to the Tokyo-based
bank because of its ties with Morgan Stanley, said Yoshinobu
Yamada, an analyst at Deutsche Bank in Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The designation would subject Mitsubishi UFJ to higher
capital requirements that it can likely meet without selling new
shares, he said. Smaller rivals Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) and
Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) may be classified as
national systemically important financial institutions because
their operations overseas are comparatively limited, Yamada
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global regulators are tightening capital and liquidity
rules to prevent another financial crisis. The Basel Committee
on Banking Supervision is discussing forcing the world&#8217;s most
important banks to hold capital buffers equivalent to as much as
3 percent of risk-weighted assets, people familiar with the
negotiations said in March. As many as 26 financial firms could
be forced to hold extra capital, according to a participant at a
meeting of the Financial Stability Board last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU, IMF Wind Up Greek Review as Second Bailout Readied &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Union and International Monetary Fund officials
today complete a review of Greece&#8217;s plan for 78 billion euros
($113 billion) in asset sales and austerity measures as they
prepare the nation&#8217;s second bailout in little more than a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assessment caps a week when Greece&#8217;s fiscal crisis
worsened enough for Moody&#8217;s Investors Service to raise the
probability of a default to 50 percent. Greek Prime Minister
George Papandreou will discuss the findings at 3 p.m. on a visit
to his Luxembourg counterpart, Jean-Claude Juncker, who leads
the group of euro-area finance ministers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lifeline may incorporate a role for bondholders as
European leaders try again to prevent the euro area&#8217;s first
sovereign default. Their May 2010 rescue failed to stem an
investor exodus from Greece and the Greek government now faces a
funding gap of 30 billion euros next year with 10-year borrowing
cost above 16 percent, Europe&#8217;s highest debt load and the
economy in a three-year slump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Papandreou is promising 6.4 billion euros of spending cuts
this year, another 22 billion euros up to 2015, and 50 billion
euros in sales of assets. Moody&#8217;s downgraded Greece to Caa1, on
a par with Cuba, and raised the nation&#8217;s risk of default on June
1. The move prompted Greek 10-year bonds to fall to the lowest
since January. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Namibia Competition Commission to Appeal Wal-Mart Court Ruling &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Namibian Competition Commission said it appealed a
ruling that declared conditions it imposed on the takeover by
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) of Massmart Holdings Ltd. (MSM) as invalid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeal was lodged yesterday in the Supreme Court, the
Windhoek-based regulator said in a faxed statement yesterday.
Wal-Mart this week won the approval of South Africa&#8217;s
Competition Tribunal to buy a controlling stake in Johannesburg-
based Massmart with conditions. It needs the same approval in
Namibia for the transaction to take effect in the southern
African country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Namibia&#8217;s Competition Commission recommended the
transaction be approved in that country on condition that it
guarantee jobs won&#8217;t be cut and that it offers shares to black
citizens. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carbon Market May Bring Financial Bubble, Bolivian Envoy Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global carbon market, valued at about $124 billion in
2010, may create a new financial bubble and is a poor way to
address the climate crisis, Bolivia&#8217;s United Nations ambassador
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The possibility of a new financial bubble that will be
created through this carbon market is very big,&#8221; Pablo Solon,
Bolivia&#8217;s ambassador to the UN and the country&#8217;s chief climate
negotiator, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comments open a new argument in Bolivia&#8217;s effort to
keep CO2 trading off the agenda at the UN climate talks. Solon
spearheaded an effort at last year&#8217;s gathering in Cancun,
Mexico, to exclude carbon-market mechanisms from a program
designed to protect forests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solon&#8217;s opposition to the measures fed into a rift between
rich and poor nations that derailed the UN talks two years ago
in Copenhagen. His concerns were overruled in December in
Cancun, allowing the discussions to progress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate negotiators will gather for UN talks in Bonn
beginning June 6. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dodd-Frank Rules Will Help Derivatives End-Users, Gensler Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dodd-Frank Act rules for the derivatives market will help
manufacturers and other corporate end-users compete for better
prices from Wall Street dealers, said Gary Gensler, chairman of
the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The financial community maintains information advantages
over their nonfinancial counterparties,&#8221; Gensler said in a
speech prepared for a New York conference of the National
Association of Corporate Treasurers. Swap buyers don&#8217;t generally
know how much other customers pay for similar trades because
Wall Street banks don&#8217;t disclose the prices, Gensler said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CFTC and Securities and Exchange Commission are writing
new regulations required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the financial
overhaul enacted last July, after largely unregulated swaps
helped fuel the 2008 credit crisis. Dodd-Frank seeks to reduce
risk and boost transparency in the $601 trillion global swaps
market by having most swaps guaranteed by central clearinghouses
and traded on exchanges or other venues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lobbying groups including the Business Roundtable are
pressing regulators to ensure that end-users don&#8217;t need to set
aside margin in their swap transactions to reduce risk, which
would force them to set aside millions of dollars that could be
invested elsewhere. Lobbyists for end-users have criticized a
proposal from bank regulators that could require the companies
to post margin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dimon to Shun Mortgage Ownership Under Proposed Capital Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive officer of
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), said the bank probably won&#8217;t keep
mortgages on its books under a plan requiring the largest
lenders to hold extra capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon made the remarks yesterday at a Sanford C. Bernstein
 Co. investor conference in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal will distort U.S. markets, what consumers pay
for credit and the types of risk banks would be willing to
retain on their balance sheets, Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s got consequences that I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ve really
thought about,&#8221; Dimon said of regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central bankers and financial supervisors worldwide are
devising capital, liquidity and risk-management standards for
banks, known as Basel III. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan also may distort the market favorably for JPMorgan
as its borrowing costs probably will decrease and deposits may
climb compared with less-capitalized competitors, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EU&#8217;s Barnier Says Convergence Can Prevent Regulatory Arbitrage &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. and European regulators must work toward convergence
on financial-industry rules that prevent firms from benefiting
from regulatory arbitrage, European Union financial markets
commissioner Michel Barnier said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I want to make sure we act in parallel,&#8221; Barnier, the
EU&#8217;s top financial regulator, said yesterday during a Bloomberg
News interview in Washington. &#8220;We are not there yet.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnier came to the U.S. capital to meet with officials
including Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner as he pushes
for greater coordination on rules to govern firms whose failure
might imperil the global economic system, as well as the $601
trillion over-the-counter swaps market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Differences have emerged between the U.S. and EU since
leaders from the Group of 20 biggest industrialized and emerging
economies agreed after the 2008 credit crisis to implement broad
financial regulation principles by the end of 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Europe is not going to be under American supervision,&#8221;
he said. &#8220; There will be reciprocity. There will be either
convergence or reciprocity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) plans to partner with
China&#8217;s Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. to produce low-
cost generics for the world&#8217;s third-biggest drug market. Hisun
shares rose the most in seven months in Shanghai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is looking for new sources of revenue before it
loses U.S. patent protection in November for Lipitor, the
cholesterol medication that was the world&#8217;s best-selling drug
last year with $10.7 billion in sales. Off-patent medicines,
including branded generics, are one of the fastest growing
segments in the global pharmaceutical market, Pfizer and Hisun
said in a joint press release issued late yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The joint venture will mainly target the local market in
China while also exploring opportunities in global markets,&#8221;
said Neena Moorjani, a spokeswoman for Pfizer, said in an e-
mailed response to questions. The two companies &#8220;will focus on
branded generic medicine&#8221; and &#8220;could contribute selected
existing products,&#8221; she said, adding their combined investment
in the potential venture would amount to about $295 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s pharmaceutical market, the world&#8217;s third largest,
is predicted to grow at least 25 percent this year, according to
U.S. based pharmaceutical research firm IMS Health. Generics
account for 60 percent of the domestic market, Pfizer and Hisun
said in the release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is already the top drug company in China ranked by
sales, followed by AstraZeneca PLC and Sanofi, according to IMS
Health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares Gain &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The potential joint venture would be an important
milestone for Pfizer&#8217;s efforts to broaden the reach of its
world-class healthcare solutions in China,&#8221; David Simmons,
Pfizer&#8217;s head of Established Products and Emerging Markets, said
in the press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hisun shares rose 2.9 percent to 36.92 yuan at the 11:30
a.m. trading break in Shanghai, after earlier gaining as much as
7 percent, the largest intraday increase since October. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zynga Inc. is in talks to have
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) lead its initial public offering and
provide a credit line of more than $1 billion to help make
acquisitions, said a person with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is expected to make a decision by today, said
the person, who asked not to be named because the announcement
hasn&#8217;t been made public. Zynga, the largest maker of games for
Facebook Inc.&#8217;s site, is preparing to file for an IPO by the end
of this month, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social-media companies are lining up for IPOs after shares
of LinkedIn Corp., the largest professional-networking site,
more than doubled in their debut two weeks ago. Groupon Inc.,
the biggest online coupon site, announced plans yesterday to
raise up to $750 million in an IPO, and music streaming service
Pandora Media Inc. is seeking as much as $123.2 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of early last week, Zynga had met with representatives
of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley (MS), both based in New York, and
was close to choosing bankers, a person familiar with the matter
said at the time. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Credit
Suisse Group AG are underwriting Groupon&#8217;s IPO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dani Dudeck, a spokeswoman for San Francisco-based Zynga,
declined to comment, as did Andrea Rachman, a spokeswoman for
Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s Aromasin, used to treat
breast cancer and stop it from returning, also prevents tumors
from developing in healthy women at risk for the disease, with
fewer side effects than existing options, a study found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women at least 60 years old or with a previous diagnosis of
precancerous lesions who took Aromasin for three years were 65
percent less likely to have invasive breast cancer than those
given a placebo, research showed. A report on the data, funded
by New York-based Pfizer, was presented today at the American
Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breast cancer strikes 1.3 million women worldwide a year,
researchers said. While generic tamoxifen and Evista, made by
Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly  Co., are approved for prevention,
rare and sometimes deadly side effects such as stroke and blood
clots limit their use, said Paul Goss, head of breast cancer
research at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. There were
no serious side effects in the study of 4,560 women, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This drug is a major step forward in terms of side
effects and removes one of the major obstacles to prevention,&#8221;
Goss said in a telephone interview. &#8220;The pool of women who are
eligible for this may be even larger than the group we studied
because the toxicity profile is so favorable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goss said that while follow-up for the study was short, the
researchers were &#8220;optimistic that with further data it will be
maintained.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aromasin generated $483 million in sales last year for
Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker. The company lost U.S.
patent protection for the treatment in April, and will lose
marketing exclusivity in Europe and Japan in July, said Chris Loder, a company spokesman, in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Mixed Blessing&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is that Pfizer isn&#8217;t expected to file for U.S.
Food and Drug Administration approval of the drug for breast
cancer prevention, Goss said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a mixed blessing not having regulatory approval
pending,&#8221; Goss said. &#8220;It would imply a drug company would be
pushing it, and the cost would be beyond the reach of many
women. The price has already come down dramatically.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors can prescribe approved drugs for any indication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aromasin, along with AstraZeneca Plc (AZN)&#8217;s Arimidex and
Novartis AG (NOVN)&#8217;s Femara, work by blocking the production of the
hormone estrogen that can fuel cancer growth. This was the first
study to examine the use of the drugs, called aromatase
inhibitors, for preventing cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tamoxifen prevents tumor cells from using estrogen. Two-
thirds of all breast cancers rely on estrogen to grow, according
to the National Institutes of Health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invasive Breast Cancer &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invasive breast cancer was diagnosed in 11 women taking
Aromasin, compared with 31 of those given placebo. There were no
differences in fracture rates, cardiovascular complications or
other cancers, according to the study that was simultaneously
published by the New England Journal of Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings should lead to more breast cancer prevention
efforts, wrote Nancy Davidson and Thomas Kensler, from the
University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, in an editorial that
accompanied the study in the New England Journal of Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Breast cancer is the second most common cause of death
from cancer and one of the most feared diagnoses for women in
the United States,&#8221; they wrote. &#8220;We have the knowledge and
tools to reduce its incidence today. We have run out of excuses.
What are we waiting for?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Linda Sandler and Edvard Pettersson" date="Jun 04, 2011 12:01 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-04/jpmorgan-asks-judge-to-dismiss-6-4-billion-madoff-trustee-suit.html"><headline>JPMorgan Asks Judge to Dismiss $6.4 Billion Suit by Madoff Trustee Picard</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. sought to
dismiss a $6.4 billion lawsuit by the trustee liquidating
Bernard Madoff&#8217;s firm, saying he doesn&#8217;t have the right to sue
the bank on behalf of the con man&#8217;s investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trustee Irving Picard sued JPMorgan in U.S. Bankruptcy
court in Manhattan in December, alleging it ignored signs of
fraud as billions of dollars flowed from Madoff&#8217;s account at the
bank to investors. JPMorgan was Madoff&#8217;s primary banker. The
lawsuit seeks $1 billion in fees and transfers, and $5.4 billion
in damages, alleging that JPMorgan defrauded federal regulators
and violated banking law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank, asked in a filing
yesterday that a U.S. District Court judge to dismiss the suit.
The trustee&#8217;s &#8220;complaint never alleges facts showing that
anyone at JPMorgan knew that Madoff was a crook,&#8221; the bank said
in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard was hired to liquidate Madoff&#8217;s firm and doesn&#8217;t
have the legal right to sue on behalf of investors in the
$17 billion Ponzi scheme, New York-based JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanda Remus, a Picard spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t immediately
return a call to her office after regular business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s case is one of at least three that has been
moved from bankruptcy court to district court, in a challenge to
Picard&#8217;s authority. U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in New
York in May took JPMorgan&#8217;s case from U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Burton Lifland, saying she would determine whether Picard had
standing to sue the bank and decide other questions of federal
non-bankruptcy law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC, UniCredit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;District Court Judge Jed Rakoff said he would review some
issues in Picard&#8217;s $9 billion suit against HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) and
feeder funds, as well as laws used by the trustee to sue Italian
bank UniCredit SpA (UCG), named in a $59 billion suit against Bank
Medici AG, its founder Sonja Kohn and other defendants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard has filed more than 1,000 suits seeking $90 billion
for Madoff investors. Lifland has approved fees of almost
$180 million for the trustee and his firm, Baker  Hostetler
LLP, since the Ponzi scheme operator&#8217;s 2008 arrest, according to
court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the HSBC case temporarily, Rakoff agreed with the
U.K. bank that Picard&#8217;s lawsuit raised issues beyond the
jurisdiction of bankruptcy court. He said he would decide
whether Picard can bring common-law claims such as unjust
enrichment and can sue on behalf of customers, since his job is
to liquidate the Madoff firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard, who said in court this week that he was getting a
&#8220;percentage&#8221; of his firm&#8217;s fees from the Madoff case, fought
to keep his cases in bankruptcy court. JPMorgan &#8220;no doubt hopes
to distance itself both from the thousands of victims of that
scheme and from other alleged wrongdoers&#8221; by going to district
court, Picard said in a March filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeal is Picard v. JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), 1:11-cv-
00913, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
