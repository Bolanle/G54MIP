<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the largest U.S.
oil company, flared gases at its Joliet refinery in Channahon,
Illinois, according to a filing with state regulators. </p>
<p>The filing to the Illinois Emergency Management Agency said
malfunctioning equipment caused the flaring, which began at 2:45
a.m. yesterday and ended three minutes later. </p>
<p>Refinery outages can increase prices for refined products
as refiners turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts. Operational disruptions can also depress prices for
crude oil because less feedstock is needed. </p>
<p>The refinery has a processing capacity of 248,000 barrels a
day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>

<p>A Walt Disney Co. (DIS) unit sued Dish
Network Corp. (DISH), the second-largest U.S. satellite-TV provider,
for copyright violations in connection with the distribution of
movies on the Starz service. </p>
<p>Dish was accused of giving subscribers free access to the
Starz premium television service, including copyrighted movies
that were provided by Disney on the condition that Starz operate
as a premium channel such as HBO, Cinemax and Showtime, the suit
says. Starz, a unit of John Malone''s Liberty Media Corp., wasn''t
named in the suit filed yesterday in federal court in New York. </p>
<p>Dish''s unlawful distribution, transmission, copying and
public display and/or performance of the Starz programming,
including Disney Enterprises'' copyrighted movies, has already
resulted in the repeated and continuing infringement of
plaintiffs'' copyright rights, the suit says. </p>
<p>Dish, which agreed along with EchoStar Corp. (SATS) yesterday to
pay TiVo Inc. (TIVO) $500 million to settle patent litigation, said in
a statement that it pays hundreds of millions of dollars for
the right to distribute Starz content to its customers,
including the rights to several Disney movies. </p>
<p>Dish Network does not have visibility to the contract
between Starz and Disney, but we will vigorously defend our
rights against any attempt to drag customers into the middle of
their dispute, Englewood, Colorado-based Dish Network said in
an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Starz also filed a lawsuit today against Dish Network in
Colorado District Court in Douglas County, accusing it of
violating an agreement between the two companies that allows
Dish to offer Starz television channels to subscribers,
according to a copy of the complaint provided by Starz.
Eric Becker, a spokesman for Starz, declined additional comment. </p>
<p>The case is Disney Enterprises Inc. vs. Dish Network LLC,

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chief Executive Officer
Ian Read said he is reviewing the possible sale or spinoff of
four divisions with $18.3 billion in annual revenue, led by the
company''s third-biggest unit, established products. </p>
<p>Results of the division reviews will be announced in the
second half this year and in early 2012, Read said today in a
telephone interview. The emerging-markets portion of New York-
based Pfizer''s established-products business is big enough to
stand on its own, with $915 million in sales in the first
quarter, he said. No decisions have been made. </p>
<p>We need to fix the innovative core of Pfizer, Read
said. Part of that may be we become a smaller company. </p>
<p>Read, who took control of Pfizer in November, said in
February that he was reviewing each of the company''s units to
focus on product development. The shares have climbed 17 percent
this year as investors bet that Read may create a leaner, more-
profitable company. </p>
<p>Even though some of these businesses are growing, they''re
not growing fast enough and they''re not large enough to impact
the whole company, said Linda Bannister, an analyst at Edward
Jones  Co. in Des Peres, Missouri, in a telephone interview
today. With the core that''s left, good news in the pipeline
could really have an impact. </p>
<p>Controversial Unit </p>
<p>Read said he is reviewing veterinary products, over-the-
counter medicines, baby formula and established products to
determine whether the company should divest or increase
investment for each unit. The question of whether Read might
shed the established-products division, which sells generic
drugs and brands that have lost patent exclusivity, has
generated the most controversy, said Tony Butler, an analyst at
Barclays Capital in New York. </p>
<p>Established products are a bit of a cash cow. You don''t
pay to market it, Butler said today in a telephone interview.
The real key is, if restructuring comes to fruition, what''s
the value of what''s left? That''s where things get a little
tricky. </p>
<p>Pfizer fell 58 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $20.44 at 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </p>
<p>Pfizer today reported first-quarter profit excluding
certain items of 60 cents a share, beating the 58-cent average
estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Reduced costs and
higher sales of its Prevnar pneumonia vaccine offset declining
sales of Lipitor, the best-selling drug in the world with $10.7
billion in sales last year. The company lost patent exclusivity
for Lipitor in Spain and Canada in 2010 and faces competition
from cheaper generics in the U.S. in November. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)''s Bing will be the
default search engine and map application on Research In Motion
Ltd. (RIM)''s BlackBerry smartphones, a boon for the software maker as
it seeks expand in mobile devices and catch up with Google Inc. (GOOG) </p>
<p>Bing will be deeply integrated into the devices, creating
unique experiences for millions of BlackBerry customers,
Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said today in an
unbilled appearance at the annual BlackBerry World trade show in
Orlando, Florida. He said the partnership will be ready in time
for the holiday shopping season later this year. </p>
<p>Microsoft is trying to challenge Google, whose share of the
U.S. search market is more than four times larger than that of
Bing. The RIM partnership also advances Microsoft''s efforts to
expand in mobile devices, a campaign that includes a pact with
Nokia Oyj (NOK1V), the world''s largest mobile-phone maker by unit sales. </p>
<p>Microsoft has added search features, stepped up the
marketing of Bing and teamed up with former rival Yahoo! Inc. to
increase its market share. Google had 65.4 percent of searches
in February, compared with Bing''s 13.6 percent, according to
Reston, Virginia-based research firm ComScore Inc. </p>
<p>Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, fell 11 cents to
$25.55 on the Nasdaq Stock Market at 11:23 a.m. New York time.
Google, based in Mountain View, California, declined $1.21 to
$537.35. Waterloo, Ontario-based RIM added 17 cents to $48.27. </p>
<p>Facebook, Angry Birds </p>
<p>RIM, the second-largest North American smartphone maker, is
trying to pack more features into its handsets and PlayBook
tablet to challenge larger rival Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Bing
announcement was one many that RIM made to generate buzz for the
PlayBook and a touch-screen edition of the BlackBerry Bold it
debuted at the show yesterday. </p>
<p>The phone maker is looking to counter mixed reviews for the
PlayBook and a plunge in its share price caused by the company
cutting its sales and profit forecasts last week. </p>
<p>RIM co-CEO Mike Lazaridis said that the popular game Angry
Birds will be available on the PlayBook soon. RIM executives
demonstrated a new PlayBook app for social-networking website
Facebook and the Android player, which allows BlackBerry users
to download apps originally built for Google''s Android platform. </p>
<p>The new Bold, which has a faster browser, is designed to
replace the current Bold and other aging models, which have lost
market share to Apple''s iPhone and devices using Android. RIM''s
forecast cut, which the company said came because new products
were taking longer to develop than originally anticipated,
triggered the stock''s biggest drop in 19 months. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. dropped its
recommendation for investors to bet against U.S. five-year
notes, citing Federal Reserve comments and the pace of
inflation. </p>
<p>Goldman, one of the 20 primary dealers authorized to trade
directly with the Fed, initiated the trade on March 18 at a
yield of 1.94 percent and a target of 2.30 percent, Francesco
Garzarelli, Goldman''s London-based chief interest-rate
strategist, wrote today a report to clients. </p>
<p>We are exiting the trade essentially flat, the report
said. The trade performed well through mid-April until a
combination of dovish Fed comments, slightly softer-than-
expected inflation prints, and ongoing concerns that high fuel
prices will hit consumer spending triggered a wave of short
covering. </p>
<p>Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke signaled April 27 the central
bank will maintain its record monetary stimulus after ending
large-scale bond purchases in June. The Fed said its preferred
gauge of inflation, the personal consumption expenditures price
index minus food and energy, will rise by 1.3 percent to 1.6
percent this year, up from its earlier estimate of 1.0 percent
to 1.3 percent and within its preferred range of 2 percent or a
bit lower. Oil rose to a 31-month high yesterday. </p>
<p>The five-year yield was little changed today at 1.97
percent as of 1:16 p.m. in Singapore, declining from 2.35
percent on April 8, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
price of the 2 percent security maturing in April 2016 was 100
1/8. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs will look for opportunities to bet against,
or short, the note again, the report said. So-called short
covering is when investors reverse wagers on an asset declining. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Femsa SAB, Latin America''s

plant in Brazil to meet surging soft-drink demand. </p>
<p>The plant will be located in the state of Minas Gerais and
have annual production capacity of 2.1 billion liters by 2015,
the Mexico City-based company said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>The company''s soft-drink, water and flavored-water volume
increased 12 percent in Brazil last year as the economy rose 7.5
percent, the fastest pace since 1985. </p>
<p>Hector Trevino, the company''s chief financial officer, said
on an April 27 conference call that a plan to build one plant in
Brazil and another in Colombia was presented to the board of
directors for approval. Trevino said capital expenditures will
likely increase by as much as $60 million from its original plan
to about $620 million this year. </p>

<p>Russia has shortlisted Morgan Stanley,
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) to manage an initial
public offering of OAO Sovcomflot, Russia''s biggest shipper,
this year, the Economy Ministry said. </p>
<p>The ministry approached 23 banks as possible advisers for a
three-year asset-sale program and plans to select winners for
most of the deals by early June, Alexei Uvarov, head of the
ministry''s property department, told reporters today in Moscow. </p>
<p>The government plans to raise $30 billion by 2015 from the
sales, helping to improve corporate governance and replenish
state coffers, Economy Minister Elvira Nabiullina said April 25.
President Dmitry Medvedev ordered the government in March to set
the final schedule of the program for the next three years,
saying it would bolster the investment climate. </p>
<p>The Economy Ministry has prepared a detailed timeline for
the sales and submitted it to the government, proposing to cap
banks'' fees at 2 percent of a sale''s value, Uvarov said. </p>
<p>Holdings in Sovcomflot, OAO Sberbank, OAO Novorossiysk
Commercial Sea Port and Murmansk Commercial Seaport are slated
to be sold this year, Uvarov said. The government expects to
offer stakes in OAO RusHydro, VTB Group and Federal Grid Co.
next year before proceeding with the sale of OAO Rosneft, OAO
Russian Railways and Russian Agricultural Bank in 2013. </p>
<h2>23 Banks </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank are among 23
foreign and domestic banks selected by the government last year
to help manage its asset sales. </p>
<p>JPMorgan was the third-biggest organizer of Russian equity
and bond sales last year, while Deutsche Bank was ranked 13th
and Morgan Stanley was 28th, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
VTB Capital, the investment-banking unit of VTB, led the
rankings, followed by Troika Dialog, which is being acquired by
Sberbank. </p>
<p>The government raised $3.3 billion in February by selling a
stake in VTB, the nation''s second-largest lender, in the biggest
offering of assets in almost four years. Bank of America Merrill
Lynch, Deutsche Bank and VTB Capital were joint bookrunners on
the transaction. </p>
<p>OAO TransContainer, a unit of Russia''s rail monopoly, was
the last state-owned company to hold an IPO, raising about $400
million in November 2010. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), accused of
misleading clients by a U.S. Senate inquiry, is likely to make
management changes in the near-term, said William Tanona, an
analyst at UBS AG. </p>
<p>Any turnover will concern investors despite the firm''s
deep bench, Tanona, who worked at Goldman Sachs from 2005 to
2008, wrote today in a note to investors. GS''s management team
is very strong; however, missteps on the public relations front
have further tarnished the firm''s reputation. Managers will
remain under strain after lawmakers sent findings to the Justice
Department and Securities and Exchange Commission, he said. </p>
<p>Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, the Democratic chairman of
the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, and Tom Coburn of
Oklahoma, the panel''s senior Republican, signed a letter asking
prosecutors and the SEC to examine findings of a two-year
inquiry on the financial crisis released last month. Levin said
he wants them to determine whether Goldman Sachs broke laws by
misleading clients who bought securities tied to the housing
market without knowing the firm would benefit if values fell. </p>
<p>In making his prediction, Tanona didn''t identify any
managers who might leave or take new roles, according to a
summary of his note. Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for New York-
based Goldman Sachs, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Tanona initiated coverage on Goldman Sachs in a note today
that rated the firm buy. His share-price estimate for the
firm is $200, 32 percent above yesterday''s closing price.
Goldman Sachs has fallen 9.7 percent this year, after dropping
0.4 percent in 2010. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, Citigroup </p>
<p>Tanona, who previously covered financial firms at Collins
Stewart Plc before joining Zurich-based UBS last year, also
placed initial buy recommendations on JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
and Citigroup Inc. (C), according to the note. He rated Morgan
Stanley (MS) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) neutral. </p>
<p>The sector of universal banks and brokers has significant
long-term upside while legal and regulatory issues may provide
turbulence in the short-term, he wrote. </p>
<p>The Senate report came less than a year after Goldman Sachs
paid $550 million to resolve SEC claims that it failed to
disclose that hedge fund Paulson  Co. was betting against, and
influenced the selection of, collateralized debt obligations the
company was packaging and selling. </p>
<p>Attorney General Eric Holder, testifying before the House
Judiciary Committee yesterday, confirmed that his department is
scrutinizing the Senate report. Two people briefed on the matter
confirmed that the SEC enforcement division is also studying it. </p>

<p>DirecTV Inc. (DTV), the largest satellite-television company in
the U.S., sued nine named and 10 unnamed defendants for
copyright infringement. </p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Newnan, Georgia, on
May 2, accuses the defendants of hijacking DirecTV''s subscriber
accounts, creating fraudulent subscriber accounts and obtaining
and distributing DirectTV programming to Canadian businesses and
individuals. </p>
<p>DirectTV isn''t authorized to sell its services in Canada,
the El Segundo, California-based company said in court papers. </p>
<p>Among the ways in which the defendants are accused of
infringement is by adding unauthorized mirrored satellite
receiving equipment to legitimate accounts without the knowledge
of or authorization by DirectTV or its subscribers. </p>
<p>The defendants also allegedly exported DirecTV receiving
equipment to Canada and activated the equipment without
authorization and in violation of U.S. laws, the company said in
its complaint. They have operated websites displaying the
DirecTV marks and used them to deceive the public into thinking
they were offering legitimate DirecTV services, according to
court papers. </p>
<p>The satellite-television company said its investigators
initiated controlled purchases of DirecTV services through the
defendants that weren''t authorized. </p>
<p>It asked the court to order the defendants to stop their
infringing activities and for awards of money damages, profits
derived from the alleged infringement, extra damages to punish
the defendants for their actions, and litigation costs and
attorney fees. </p>
<p>DirecTV is represented by Matthew Dexter Richardson and

<h2>Alibaba Welcomes U.S. Praise of Intellectual-Property Efforts </h2>
<p>Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. said it will further enhance
the level of trust and integrity in its online marketplaces
after the U.S. Trade Representative urged other Chinese e-commerce operators to follow the company''s lead. </p>
<p>Taobao, Alibaba''s online marketplace, started examining
vendors'' advertising and sales to provide leads to Chinese law
enforcement on infringing activities, the USTR said in its
annual review of the global state of intellectual-property
rights protection and enforcement, released May 2. </p>
<p>We appreciate the USTR''s acknowledgment of our ongoing
efforts to work with brand owners in protecting their
intellectual-property rights, Alibaba, the owner of China''s
biggest online retailer, Taobao.com, said in an e-mailed

<p>Alibaba started an anti-piracy campaign in March after the
U.S. Trade Representative identified Taobao and an online
marketplace operated by Baidu Inc. as notorious, along with
the Silk Market in Beijing and the Ladies'' Market in Hong Kong. </p>
<p>Other online platforms, especially those cited as
notorious markets in the earlier report, should follow
Taobao''s lead in increasing cooperation with Chinese police and
U.S. rights holders, the U.S. trade office said. </p>
<p>The U.S. also encourages Chinese enforcement agencies to
reach out not only to the larger foreign enterprises, but also
to small and medium enterprises that are also being injured by
counterfeit goods, the USTR said. </p>

Navy SEALS are here to see you. Along that same line is a t-shirt printed with the text Navy Seals 1, Bin Laden 0. </p>
<p>Mugs and T-shirts can be ordered with the text Obama got

<h2>Patents </h2>
<h2>FTC''s Leibowitz Denounces Patent Accords That Delay Generics </h2>
<p>Drug company deals to delay the introduction of generic
drugs rose 63 percent last year, Chairman Jon Leibowitz of the
Federal Trade Commission said, calling such arrangements
collusive and costly to consumers. </p>
<p>The number of such agreements among makers of brand-name
and generic medicines rose to 31 in fiscal year 2010 from 19 the
year before, Leibowitz said yesterday in an interview at the
Bloomberg News office in New York. </p>
<p>These are sweetheart deals, Leibowitz said. They are
outrageous, and they harm consumers. Either the courts or
Congress needs to stop them. </p>
<p>Prices of generic drugs are generally 20 percent to 30
percent less than those of brand-name drugs and in some cases as
much as 90 percent cheaper, the FTC said in a statement. </p>
<p>The agency has challenged such settlements in court,
contending that they are anticompetitive and violate U.S.
antitrust law. The FTC has supported legislation in Congress
that would prohibit settlements increasing the cost of
prescription drugs. </p>
<p>The settlements are known as reverse-payment or pay-for-delay deals because the brand-name company compensates the
generic-drug maker in return for dropping challenges to patents. </p>
<p>The court challenges haven''t always been successful. In
September, a federal appeals court refused to reconsider whether
a Bayer AG (BAYN) settlement of a challenge to its patent on the
anthrax treatment Cipro was appropriate. </p>
<p>Antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic are
focusing on how settlements between companies that make branded
medicines and generics might harm consumers. Bayer was among
drugmakers told by European Union officials in January to submit
details of patent-settlement deals that may delay the
introduction of generics. </p>
<p>Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) in 2006 tried to protect its heart
pill Plavix, the company''s best-seller, from generic competition
in a transaction that resulted in the firing of former Chief
Executive Officer Peter R. Dolan. Dolan made a deal to delay
sales of cheaper Plavix copies by Apotex Inc., violating terms
of a deferred prosecution agreement. </p>
<p>Cephalon Inc. and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) face
an EU investigation of a deal that delayed generic versions of
Cephalon''s biggest product, Provigil, a treatment for excessive
sleepiness. </p>
<p>Cephalon last year lost an attempt to dismiss U.S.
antitrust suits, including one by the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission, over patent-infringement settlements it reached
regarding generic versions of Provigil. It also lost a U.K. bid
in November that aimed to block Mylan Inc. and Orchid Chemicals
 Pharmaceuticals Ltd. from selling generic versions of the drug
in Britain before a patent trial. </p>
<h2>University Seeks Patent on Lobster-Shell Golf Ball Invention </h2>
<p>The University of Maine applied for a patent on a invention
that uses ground-up lobster shells to make biodegradable golf
balls, the school said in a statement. </p>
<p>The shells are a byproduct of the lobster canning industry.
They are ground up and mixed with a biodegradable binder and
coating, the school says. </p>
<p>The market for such golf balls would be cruise ships.
Golfers could hit the balls off the ship and into the water
without adding to pollution of the ocean. </p>
<p>According to a 2007 story in the New York Times, the
practice of hitting golf balls into the ocean from cruise ships
was ended in 1990 when the International Maritime Commission
banned the dumping of plastic into the ocean. </p>
<p>The cost of ingredients to make a single golf ball would be
about 19 cents, the school said. The balls, which will be white
and dimpled, can be used with both wood and iron clubs. </p>
<p>Another possible use for the invention would be surveying
stakes or plant pots that decompose when placed in the ground. </p>
<p>The application isn''t yet published in the database of the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. </p>
<h2>N.C. State Licenses Biofuel Technology to Avjet''s Red Wolf </h2>
<p>AvJet Biotech Inc.''s Red Wolf Refining unit took a license
to technology developed at North Carolina State University for
producing biofuels from fats and for producing products from
genetically modified marine microalgae, the Pinehurst, North
Carolina-based company said in a statement. </p>
<p>The company has an exclusive license to the invention, and
will reimburse the school for its investment in patent
applications. To date, patent applications have been filed in 22
foreign countries in addition to the U.S. </p>
<p>The company said it will sell stock and used the funds to
reimburse the university and for development capital to create a
production model for the biofuel-refining system. The ultimate
aim is the production of aviation biofuels. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. are dropping bets against Treasuries. </p>
<p>Economic growth is falling short of forecasts and market
participants may need to reduce their yield predictions, Jim Caron, the New York-based global head of interest-rate strategy
at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a report yesterday. Goldman Sachs
cited Federal Reserve comments and a slower-than-forecast pace
of inflation in a report the same day. </p>
<p>A rally in Treasuries is confounding traders and economists
who predicted yields would rise as the economy improved. The
opposite has happened as data showed gross domestic product
growth slowed and housing market is struggling to rebound. Bill Gross, who runs the world''s biggest bond fund at Pacific
Investment Management Co., said he is sticking to his bearish
view on U.S. debt. </p>
<p>We have recently turned neutral from bearish on bonds,
Caron wrote. We are also tactically looking to buy bonds if
yields rise. Consensus forecasts for yields are at risk. </p>
<p>Treasuries returned 1.2 percent in April, the most since
August, based on Bank of America Merrill Lynch data. Ten-year
yields fell to a six-week low of 3.23 percent today, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The notes yielded 3.24 percent as
of 7:35 a.m. in London. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, two of the 20 primary
dealers authorized to trade directly with the Federal Reserve,
both said in their reports they may turn more bearish later. </p>
<p>Surprise Index </p>
<p>Yields slid last month as the Commerce Department said on
April 28 that GDP growth slowed to an annual rate of 1.8 percent
in the first quarter, from 3.1 percent in the previous three
months. Residential real-estate prices dropped 3.3 in the 12
months to February, the most in more than a year, SP/Case-
Shiller data showed April 26. </p>
<p>The Citigroup U.S. Economic Surprise Index fell to negative
6.7 yesterday, the lowest level since December, indicating that
economic data are falling short of forecasts by the steepest
degree this year. </p>
<p>Banks and securities companies surveyed by Bloomberg
predict Treasury yields will keep rising. The 10-year rate may
climb to 3.59 by June 30 and 3.91 percent by year-end, the
companies said, with the most recent forecasts given the
heaviest weightings. </p>
<p>Pimco''s Gross said a federal funds target at virtually zero
posed a threat to bondholders amid quickening inflation and
negative real yields. </p>
<p>Real Yield </p>
<p>There should be little doubt that simply holding
Treasuries at these yield levels for an extended period of time
represents an abdication of responsibility, Gross wrote in his
monthly outlook on Pimco''s website yesterday. </p>
<p>Gross, 67, bet against U.S. government-related debt in
March and boosted cash to be the largest of the company''s $241
billion Total Return Fund holdings. </p>
<p>The Fed has kept its target rate for overnight lending in a
range of zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008. </p>
<p>The real yield, or the difference between the consumer
price index and the 10-year Treasury rate, declined to 0.55
percent yesterday, the least since 2008. Based on two-year
Treasuries, the real yield is negative 2.1 percent. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs dropped its recommendation for investors to
bet against five-year notes, Francesco Garzarelli, the London-
based chief interest-rate strategist, wrote in his report. </p>
<p>Fuel Prices </p>
<p>The trade performed well through mid-April until a
combination of dovish Fed comments, slightly softer-than-
expected inflation prints, and ongoing concerns that high fuel
prices will hit consumer spending triggered demand for bonds,
Garzarelli wrote. </p>
<p>Fed Bank of New York President William C. Dudley said on
April 1 the recovery is tenuous. Janet Yellen, vice chairman
of the Fed''s Board of Governors, said April 11 the increase in
food and fuel costs will have only a temporary impact on prices
and consumer spending. </p>
<p>The consumer-price index excluding food and energy rose 0.1
percent in March, less than the 0.2 percent increase projected
in a Bloomberg survey, the Labor Department said April 15. Oil
rose to a 31-month high this week. </p>

<p>Visa Inc. (V), the world''s biggest bank-
card network, said fiscal second-quarter profit rose 24 percent,
beating analysts'' estimates, on a pickup in consumer spending. </p>
<p>Net income for the three months ended March 31 climbed to
$881 million, or $1.23 a share, from $713 million, or 96 cents,
in the same period a year earlier, the San Francisco-based
company said today in a statement. The average estimate of 29
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was $1.21 a share. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Joseph W. Saunders, 65, is buying
back shares as more people pay with plastic and U.S. consumer
spending rebounds. Household purchases, which account for about
70 percent of the economy, rose at a 2.7 percent pace in the
first quarter, the Commerce Department said last week. </p>
<p>The company posted double-digit growth in payments
volume, cross-border volume and Visa-processed transactions from
across the globe, Saunders said in the statement. </p>
<p>Visa fell $1.07 to $78.70 today on the New York Stock
Exchange and slid 1.5 percent at 5:08 p.m. in extended trading.
The shares have declined 8.9 percent in the past year, lagging a
15 percent gain for No. 2 network MasterCard Inc. (MA), based in
Purchase, New York. </p>
<p>12 Billion Transactions </p>
<p>Worldwide spending on Visa debit and credit cards climbed
13 percent to $861 billion, the company said. Cross-border
volume, a measure of spending by cardholders outside their home
countries, advanced 13 percent. Processed transactions rose 13
percent to 12 billion, compared with the same period a year
earlier. </p>
<p>Net revenue increased 15 percent to $2.25 billion, while
operating expenses rose 3 percent to $862 million. </p>
<p>Saunders is facing investor concern that U.S. caps on
debit-card swipe fees, or interchange, may lead to more
regulation and damage Visa''s business model. Visa and MasterCard
set the fees and pass the money to card-issuing banks. </p>
<p>The Federal Reserve has proposed capping the fees at 12
cents a transaction, replacing a formula that costs merchants an
average of 1.14 percent of the purchase price, or about 44
cents. The curbs may reduce annual revenue by $12 billion at
U.S. banks that issue Visa and MasterCard debit cards, including
Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) and JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) </p>
<p>The rule may be delayed or modified. Senator Jon Tester, a
Montana Democrat, has introduced a measure that would delay the
Fed''s rulemaking. Anticipation of such action is pushing Visa''s
shares higher, Tien-tsin Huang, a JPMorgan analyst, wrote in a
May 2 note to clients. </p>
<p>The company bought back about 8.7 million shares in the
quarter valued at $630 million and authorized a new $1 billion
repurchase program, according to the statement. </p>

<p>National Stock Exchange of India Ltd.,
the nation''s largest bourse, will seek to collaborate with other
exchanges on joint products rather than merge or acquire to
drive growth, the chief executive officer said. </p>
<p>The NSE plans to introduce rupee-denominated derivatives 
based on the U.K.''s benchmark FTSE 100 Index, the 
Standard  Poor''s 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average
and is seeking an exciting Far Eastern product, Ravi Narain 
said in an interview at the World Federation of Exchanges
IOMA/IOCA conference in Mumbai. The exchange will also expand
in currency and interest-rate derivatives, he said. </p>
<p>We are busy focusing on internal organic growth,
Narain, 55, said. Broader alliances outside India work well
for us. The moment you do a merger with one exchange you lock
out all other exchanges -- we are more interested in looking at
product by product alliances to see what are the gaps and needs
in the Indian financial firmament that we can fill. </p>
<p>Exchanges have announced takeovers totaling about $20
billion since October as competition forces chief executive
officers to seek to cut costs by expanding into new markets.
Indian government rules mean shareholders in Mumbai-based NSE,
which include Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Temasek Holdings Pte,
can only take a 5 percent stake in the privately held company
that has 77 percent of equity trading in the world''s second-
fastest growing major economy. </p>
<p>New Markets </p>
<p>Deutsche Boerse AG agreed a $9.5 billion purchase of NYSE
Euronext that would create the world''s largest exchange
operator. London Stock Exchange Group Plc said it will acquire
Canada''s TMX Group Inc., owner of the Toronto bourse. </p>
<p>Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. and IntercontinentalExchange Inc.
announced a rival offer for NYSE Euronext, which the company''s
board has twice rejected. The current wave of consolidation
started in Asia when Singapore Exchange Ltd. (SGX) bid for ASX Ltd.,
the Australian stock exchange. </p>
<p>As the developed-market consolidation game plays out,
there''s an equally large chunk of the world that is watching
these developments with huge interest but with an understandable
amount of caution, Narain said. The big-ticket
consolidations are new and still underway and only time will
tell. The jury is still out. </p>
<p>The SGX deal, unanimously recommended by the companies''
boards, was blocked by Australian regulators who cited national
interest, leading SGX President Muthukrishnan Ramaswami to say
earlier this week that the exchange now thinks collaboration
ventures in Asia are likelier than mergers. Narain said he was
stunned at the Australian decision. </p>
<p>Bring to India </p>
<p>NSE said in July it''s in discussions with the Tokyo Stock
Exchange for companies in both countries to list shares in each
other''s markets. NSE''s customers are increasingly looking to
diversify their holdings to include more non-Indian assets, he
said. </p>
<p>We are going to understand and analyze what are the
assets people are looking at and bring them to India to trade as
a rupee-denominated asset on the NSE, said Narain, who studied
at the Cambridge University in the U.K. and the U.S. Wharton
School of Business. </p>
<p>The average daily turnover on the NSE over the past year is
140 billion rupees as compared with 42 billion rupees on the
Bombay Stock Exchange, Asia''s oldest bourse, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>India''s economic growth and corporate earnings lured
foreign investors to buy a record $29.4 billion of local
equities last year and made the local benchmark index the best
performer and most expensive among the world''s 10 biggest
markets. </p>
<p>Foreign funds invested a net 72.1 billion rupees in April
and 69 billion rupees in March, after withdrawing 94 billion
rupees in the first two months of 2011, according to data on the
website of the Securities and Exchange Board of India. </p>
<p>When everyone else is rushing into India why would I go
rushing out? said Narain, who helped set up the NSE and has
been involved in it since its incorporation in 1992. If there
are six exchanges that are in fierce competition to each other
on a global platform, we can happily tie up with each of them
without ruffling any feathers. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) lost at least
its fourth senior U.S. energy investment banker in a year, as
Adam Peakes in Houston quit to join former colleagues at Tudor,
Pickering, Holt  Co., said a person with knowledge of the move. </p>
<p>Peakes, a managing director at New York-based Goldman
Sachs, will have the same title at Tudor, Pickering when he
joins later this year, said the person, who requested anonymity
because Peakes hasn''t started at his new job yet. Tudor,
Pickering is an energy-focused investment bank based in Houston. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs has lost energy bankers to competitors as a
boom in mergers and acquisitions among oil and gas companies
puts the professionals in demand. Energy deals jumped 57 percent
to $357 billion in 2010 from $227 billion the previous year,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Brady Parish, a Goldman Sachs managing director in Houston,
left last year and opened an office for Moelis  Co. this year.
William Montgomery, a partner in Houston, is retiring and plans
to join a local private-equity firm. Raymond Strong, a managing
director in New York, quit for Evercore Partners Inc. this year. </p>
<p>Andrea Rachman, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman, declined to
comment. </p>
<p>Peakes was part of the Goldman Sachs team that is advising
offshore driller Pride International Inc. (PDE) on its proposed $7
billion sale to Ensco Plc. He advised Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI) on its
$5.5 billion purchase of BJ Services Co. last year. </p>
<p>Tudor, Pickering was formed in 2007 by Bobby Tudor, a
former Goldman Sachs partner, and Dan Pickering. Maynard Holt,
the co-president, is also a former Goldman Sachs banker. </p>
<p>Byron Trott''s BDT Capital Partners LLC and ex-Murphy Oil
Corp. Chief Executive Officer Claiborne Deming agreed last month
to provide $110 million to Tudor, Pickering. Trott founded his
Chicago-based firm in 2009 after leaving Goldman Sachs, where he
was a vice chairman and arranged some of the biggest purchases
by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, named Alejandro Vollbrechthausen to
replace Valentino Carlotti as president of the Brazilian unit. </p>
<p>Carlotti, who has led Goldman Sachs''s Brazil business since
April 2007, will remain in the region over the next several
months to effect a smooth transition before relocating to New
York, according to an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the biggest U.S. securities firm before
converting to a bank holding company in September 2008, is
expanding in economies in emerging markets including China,
Russia and India, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein has said. </p>
<p>Foreign investment banks have faced increased competition
from local companies in Brazil as they seek wealth-management
and advisory business in Latin America''s biggest economy.
Brazil''s gross domestic product expanded 7.5 percent last year,
the most in two decades. Unemployment is at all-time lows and
credit has expanded to record highs. </p>
<p>Vollbrechthausen previously managed the emerging market
sales desk in New York, according to the memo, which was
confirmed by Michael DuVally, a spokesman in New York. </p>
<p>Under Carlotti''s management, Goldman hired bankers to start
a local private-banking business and asset-management division
in 2009, which completed the firm''s strategy to establish a
full-service bank in the region after two failed attempts to buy
local lenders. </p>
<p>After Carlotti''s arrival in Brazil, the Wall Street firm
increased its Brazil-based staff to about 300 people from about
10 bankers and traders who advise on mergers, underwrite
securities, trade derivatives and commodities and analyze
companies. </p>

<p>General Motors Co. (GM), the biggest
overseas automaker in China, reported sales fell in April, the
first decline since December, as the removal of government
incentives dented demand. </p>
<p>GM sold 203,367 vehicles in China last month, the Detroit-
based company said in a statement today. That compares with
sales of 213,112 units last April. The decline follows delivery
growth of 1.2 percent in March and a 6 percent increase in
February. </p>
<p>Automakers including GM, Toyota Motor Corp., and Honda
Motor Co. have seen car buying slow this year after China
reinstated a 10 percent tax rate on small-car sales and phased
out subsidies for vehicle trade-ins in rural areas. GM, which
makes Buick-branded cars and Wuling minivans with Chinese
partner SAIC Motor Corp., aims to double sales in the world''s
largest auto market to 5 million units by 2015, it said last
month. </p>
<p>The automaker boosted China sales 29 percent to 2.35
million vehicles last year, helped by state incentives and
economic growth. </p>
<p>Sales by SAIC-GM-Wuling Automotive Co., the minivan venture
that makes the Wuling Sunshine, China''s best-selling vehicle,
totaled 100,262 vehicles in April. </p>
<p>GM Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson is counting on
emerging markets including China to help drive growth after an
initial public offering of more than $20 billion in November.
The carmaker plans to boost investment in China and introduce 60
new and upgraded models over the next five years, it said during
the Shanghai Auto show last month. The company estimates it has
a 14.7 percent market share in China. </p>
<p>Last year, China''s overall auto sales surged 32 percent to
a record 18.06 million, helping make the nation the world''s
largest vehicle market for the second year running. </p>
<p>Passenger-car sales in 2011 may grow slower than an earlier
forecast of 10 percent to 15 percent, the China Association of
Automobile Manufacturers said this month. </p>

<p>Emerging-markets funds managed by
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Franklin Resources Inc. (BEN) were among
the U.S.-registered mutual funds that fell the most in this
week''s commodities selloff. </p>
<p>The $831 million Goldman Sachs BRIC Fund (GBRAX) and the $825
million Templeton BRIC Fund (TABRX), which focus on Brazil, China, India
and Russia, both dropped 5.7 percent in the week ended
yesterday. The funds, from New York-based Goldman Sachs and
Franklin Resources in San Mateo, California, were the biggest
losers among diversified equity funds with more than $500
million in assets and at least 20 percent in energy or basic
materials stocks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Commodities plunged yesterday as investors accelerated
sales following year-to-date gains through April of more than 23
percent for silver, oil, gasoline and coffee. The Standard

close since March 15. Silver dropped 2.6 percent to $35.29,
capping the week''s plunge at 27 percent, the biggest since at
least 1975. </p>
<p>New Risks'' </p>
<p>The leaders of the four countries plus South Africa, a
group known as the BRICS, said last month that excessively
volatile commodity prices pose new risks for the ongoing
recovery of the world economy. </p>
<p>The $726 million DWS Latin America Equity Fund, managed by
the funds unit of Frankfurt''s Deutsche Bank AG, fell 5.4 percent
in the past week. Boston-based Fidelity Investments'' $5.46
billion Canada Fund lost 5.3 percent, and the $1.4 billion FPA
Capital Fund, run by Los Angeles-based First Pacific Advisors
LLC, dropped 4.6 percent. </p>
<p>Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds dedicated to
commodities, including index-based products, suffered steeper
declines. The ProShares Ultra Silver (AGQ) ETF, designed to return
twice the daily performance of silver, plummeted 51 percent in
the week. Non-leveraged silver ETFs fell about 30 percent. </p>
<p>Bill Miller, manager of the $3.94 billion Legg Mason
Capital Management Value Trust (LMVTX), said in an April 19 letter to
investors that he saw little value in commodities. He pointed to
research from Stifel, Nicolaus  Co. showing that commodity
returns relative to stock returns were at a 200-year high on a
rolling 10-year basis. </p>
<p>Cyclical'' Returns </p>
<p>One thing is clear from the analysis of long-term
commodity returns: they are cyclical, Miller wrote. </p>
<p>Open interest in silver futures has tumbled about 15
percent since the Comex exchange in New York began raising
margin requirements on April 25. Futures on Brent crude, crude
oil, heating oil, gasoline and natural gas plunged more than 6.9
percent yesterday. </p>
<p>Crude oil dropped below $100 a barrel for the first time
since March 17. Copper futures slumped 3.3 percent, falling
below $4 a pound for the first time in five months. Among
agricultural commodities, cocoa, cotton, corn and weak retreated
more than 2.3 percent in futures trading. </p>
<p>Jack Ablin, chief investment officer for Chicago-based
Harris Private Bank, said commodity prices would eventually
resume their climb. </p>
<p>I don''t think we have lost the tail wind, Harris, who
helps manage $55 billion, said in a phone interview. They may
have moved up too far too fast, but the long-term underpinnings
for higher prices are still in place. </p>

<p>Shareholder approval for Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)''s 2010 compensation plan, which doubled pay for
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, tumbled
to 73 percent from 96 percent a year ago. </p>
<p>General Counsel Gregory K. Palm announced the vote tally at
the end of today''s annual meeting, held for the first time at
Goldman Sachs''s building in Jersey City, New Jersey. </p>
<p>It''s significant when you''ve got a quarter of all shares
voting against, said Julie Tanner, assistant director of
social responsibility at Christian Brothers Investment Services
Inc., which manages $4 billion and owns about 67,000 shares of
New York-based Goldman Sachs. What is the board going to do to
show that it''s responsive to shareholder concerns? </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which set a record for Wall Street bonuses
in 2007, has given shareholders a non-binding advisory vote on
compensation, known as say on pay, for the past two years.
Shareholders at today''s meeting approved a measure that will
give them such a vote every year. </p>
<p>Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for the bank, declined to
comment on the voting results. Shares of the company fell 31
cents, or 0.2 percent, to $150.10 in composite trading on the
New York Stock Exchange at 4:15 p.m. They are down 11 percent
this year. </p>
<p>Pay Disconnect'' </p>
<p>Blankfein''s $19 million compensation for 2010, which
included a $5.4 million cash bonus, was almost double the prior
year''s award even as profits fell and the share price was little
changed. Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. recommended
stockholders vote against the compensation plan, citing a pay-
for-performance disconnect. </p>
<p>All six shareholder proposals were defeated at today''s
meeting, including two relating to pay. One would have required
named executive officers including Blankfein to retain 75
percent of their stock for at least three years after leaving
the company. The other would compel the board''s compensation
committee to review the firm''s policies and submit a report to
shareholders by Oct. 1. </p>
<p>There''s an apparent lack of any serious commitment to pay
for performance, said Lance E. Lindblom, president and CEO of
the Nathan Cummings Foundation, which submitted the proposal
requesting a report on compensation policies. Goldman Sachs is
taking money from the company''s owners, its shareholders, to
reward executives presiding over its decline. </p>
<p>All 11 members of the company''s board of directors won re-
election with more than 90 percent of the vote, Palm said. </p>
<p>Lehman, Buffett </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs was the most-profitable securities firm when
Blankfein, 56, took the helm almost five years ago. While the
company survived the financial crisis that bankrupted smaller
rival Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and repaid U.S. rescue funds
and Warren Buffett''s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., its practices
before the crisis have remained under scrutiny. </p>
<p>At last year''s meeting, Blankfein created a business-
standards committee to study the firm''s practices and recommend
ways they could be improved. The committee, which issued a
report in January, was formed in part as a response to an April
2010 Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit alleging the
firm misled clients about a mortgage-linked investment. Goldman
Sachs paid $550 million in July to settle the suit. </p>
<p>In the self-examination that went into the business
standards committee report, Goldman Sachs learned that not
every element of the firm was always operating in a way that was
of the highest order, Blankfein said. Not everybody will be
happy all the time. We do the best we can do. </p>
<p>Legal Fees </p>
<p>In response to shareholder questions at today''s meeting,
Palm disclosed that the firm spent $726 million on legal fees
last year and employs 286 full-time lawyers, up from 252 a year
ago. </p>
<p>Last month the U.S. Senate''s Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations issued a report on the causes of the financial
crisis that accused Goldman Sachs of misleading clients in its
sales of mortgage securities, a charge the firm denies. The
report was referred to the Justice Department and the SEC, which
have said they are looking into it. </p>
<p>The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations issued a
report and we take into account all of it and we disagree with
some of it, Blankfein said at today''s meeting. He added that
the company is trying to learn from the report. </p>

<p>A Coca-Cola Co. (KO) trademark-infringement
lawsuit against PepsiCo Inc. over fruit-juice packaging was
dismissed after the companies reached a settlement. Terms of the
settlement weren''t disclosed. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Sim Lake signed an order dismissing the
case after the world''s two biggest soft-drink makers submitted a
joint motion seeking to terminate it, according to a filing
yesterday in federal court in Houston. </p>
<p>All matters in dispute in this case have been fully and
finally resolved by the parties, both sides said in court
papers. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola, based in Atlanta, sued its smaller rival in
October claiming that the packaging for PepsiCo''s low-calorie
Trop50 fruit juice line would likely deceive consumers and
dilute the quality of Coca-Cola''s Simply brand of premium
juices. </p>
<p>A trial had been set for June. Lake told lawyers for Coca-
Cola and Purchase, New York-based PepsiCo in December that they
should try to settle out of court to avoid the expense of trial. </p>
<p>We are pleased we were able to amicably resolve this
dispute, Dan Schafer, a Coca-Cola spokesman, said in a
telephone interview. We will continue to diligently protect the
Simply brand''s iconic and distinctive packaging against
imitators and copycats. </p>
<p>Confidentiality Agreement'' </p>
<p>Citing a confidentiality agreement, Schafer declined to say
whether PepsiCo must alter its packaging design as a result of
the settlement. Timothy Durst, an attorney for PepsiCo, declined
to comment, citing the confidentially agreement. </p>
<p>Simply and Trop50 juices are both packaged in clear plastic
carafes with oversized green screw caps. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola introduced the Simply line in 2001, according to
court papers. PepsiCo began selling Trop50 juices in paper
cartons in 2009 and repackaged the product in the clear plastic
carafes last year, according to court filings. </p>
<p>The case is Coca-Cola Co. v. PepsiCo Inc., 10-04184, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston.) </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, said shareholders re-elected the
company''s directors and approved a compensation plan for top
executives. </p>
<p>Directors were re-elected with 90 percent of the vote and
the pay awards for named executive officers were approved by 73
percent in a so-called say on pay vote, General Counsel Greg Palm said today at the New York-based bank''s shareholder meeting
in Jersey City, New Jersey. None of the proposals submitted by
shareholders was approved, Palm said. </p>
<p>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and
top deputies including Gary D. Cohn, president and chief
operating officer, and David A. Viniar, chief financial officer,
received no bonuses for 2008 and no cash bonuses for 2009.
Earlier this year, Goldman Sachs said it was increasing salaries
for Blankfein and his deputies and paid Blankfein $19 million
for 2010, including a $5.4 million cash bonus. </p>
<p>Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. recommended
stockholders cast a non-binding vote against the awards for
executive officers. The ISS report cited a pay-for-performance
disconnect after Goldman Sachs''s executives'' compensation
increased even as profits fell last year. </p>
<p>Glass Lewis  Co., another proxy advisory service,
expressed concern about Goldman Sachs''s opaque program for
determining compensation, even though it recommended that
shareholders vote in favor of the awards. </p>
<p>Social Responsibility </p>
<p>Christian Brothers Investment Services Inc., which manages
$4 billion and owns about 68,000 Goldman Sachs shares, voted
against the pay awards this year, Julie Tanner, the firm''s
assistant director of social responsibility, said in an
interview before the meeting. </p>
<p>I don''t think that the pay level is justified, Tanner
said. There''s a level beyond which pay is not appropriate and
needs to be reined in, and I think this company is one of those
examples. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs was the most-profitable securities firm when
Blankfein, 56, took the helm almost five years ago. While the
company survived the financial crisis that bankrupted smaller
rival Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and repaid U.S. rescue funds
and Warren Buffett''s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., its practices
before the crisis have remained under scrutiny. </p>
<p>At last year''s meeting, Blankfein created a business-
standards committee to study the firm''s practices and recommend
ways they could be improved. The committee, which issued a
report in January, was formed in part as a response to an April
2010 Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit alleging the
firm misled clients about a mortgage-linked investment. Goldman
Sachs paid $550 million in July to settle the suit. </p>
<p>Senate Probe </p>
<p>The questions didn''t end there. Last month the U.S.
Senate''s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations issued a
report on the causes of the financial crisis that accused New
York-based Goldman Sachs of misleading clients in its sales of
mortgage securities, a charge the firm denies. The report was
referred to the Justice Department and the SEC, which have said
they are looking into it. </p>
<p>There are still lingering problems for Goldman Sachs,
said Benjamin B. Wallace, an analyst at Westborough,
Massachusetts-based Grimes  Co., which manages about $1 billion
and doesn''t own Goldman Sachs stock. If the Senate and the SEC
and the Department of Justice would stop investigating them they
could probably put it behind them. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs rose 12 cents, or 0.1 percent, to $150.53 in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange at 12:06 p.m.
It has dropped 11 percent this year, compared with a 1.5 percent
gain for the 82-member Standard  Poor''s 500 Financials Index
and a 7.3 percent advance for the SP 500 Index. </p>
<p>Compensation Principles </p>
<p>At the meeting two years ago, as public outrage over Wall
Street bonuses swelled following the government bailouts of
financial institutions, Blankfein read shareholders a
description of Goldman Sachs''s compensation principles. The
principles included an emphasis on tying pay to long-term firm
performance and avoiding multiyear guarantees. </p>
<p>Although the firm rebounded from the crisis to achieve
record profit in 2009, earnings sagged last year and in the
first quarter of 2011. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s return on equity, a measure of how well the
firm reinvests shareholder capital, dropped to 11.5 percent in
2010 from 32.7 percent three years earlier. While it still beats
competitors including Morgan Stanley, whose 2010 return on
equity from continuing operations was 8.5 percent, investors
question whether the bank can achieve its former profitability. </p>
<p>Scrape for Business'' </p>
<p>There is a more competitive framework out there and they
do have to scrape for business, said Peter Sorrentino, a
senior portfolio manager at Huntington Asset Advisors in
Cincinnati, which manages $14.8 billion, including almost
135,000 Goldman Sachs shares. In the regulatory environment we
find ourselves in, where does Goldman sit in all this? How
should we set our expectations for success going forward? </p>
<p>Blankfein''s future at the firm continues to be subject to
speculation. Earlier this week, the New York Post, citing people
it didn''t identify, reported that Blankfein is likely to stay
for at least two more years. The company has said he has no
plans to leave. </p>
<p>Probably starting about now is when he could safely leave
and say he got Goldman through everything, said Grimes  Co.''s
Wallace. But maybe with all the PR stuff, you want to stay on
because one thing you want to do when you turn it over to new
leadership is have a clean slate. </p>

<p>General Dynamics Corp. (GD), which posted
the smallest sales increase since 1995 last year, may now need
acquisitions more than ever as it faces the weakest stretch of
profit growth in two decades. </p>
<p>The maker of Gulfstream jets and Abrams battle tanks hasn''t
done a billion-dollar deal for a publicly traded company in five
years, and is looking at opportunities to buy businesses
after revenue rose less than 2 percent in 2010, Chief Executive
Officer Jay Johnson said last week. Buying flight-simulator
maker CAE Inc. (CAE) may boost growth, according to Fifth Third Asset
Management, which sold General Dynamics on concern earnings will
slump. Shareholder Fiduciary Trust Co. said General Dynamics
should buy a company outside defense and aerospace or split up. </p>
<p>A deal may help 64-year-old Johnson recoup some of the
money investors lost on General Dynamics in the past year, even
as the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index gained 15 percent, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Without a transaction, analysts
project annual profits at General Dynamics will grow less than
10 percent for three years, the slowest rate since at least
1991, as the U.S. government cuts defense spending. </p>
<p>We don''t see a lot of positive catalysts right now,
said Michael Mullaney, who helps oversee $9.5 billion at
Fiduciary Trust in Boston, which owns shares of General
Dynamics. An acquisition could be a shot in the arm as far as
earnings. They should focus on industrial names because that''s
what they are good at, he said. </p>
<p>Rest Assured'' </p>
<p>Rob Doolittle, a spokesman for Falls Church, Virginia-based
General Dynamics, said the company doesn''t comment on rumors or
speculation about mergers and acquisitions. </p>
<p>Rest assured, we''re looking at opportunities in the
defense space as well as in aerospace, Johnson said on a
conference call on April 27 after the company''s first-quarter
earnings announcement. General Dynamics reported a 3.5 percent
increase in net income as sales rose less than 1 percent. </p>
<p>The 1.7 percent drop in General Dynamics''s shares in the
past year trimmed its market value to $27.4 billion, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The SP 500 has gained 15 percent
over the same period, while defense and aerospace stocks in the
benchmark index for American common equity climbed an average of
9.9 percent, the data show. </p>
<p>Today, General Dynamics rose 0.9 percent to $74.35 as of
11:07 a.m. in New York. </p>
<p>Since Johnson, a retired admiral and former U.S. Chief of
Naval Operations who flew combat operations in Vietnam, became
CEO of General Dynamics in July 2009, the company has returned
39 percent to shareholders. Rival defense and aerospace
companies have delivered a 62 percent gain including dividends
to their owners, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Battle Tanks </p>
<p>Revenue at General Dynamics rose 1.5 percent last year, the
smallest increase since a 0.3 percent gain in 1995. Sales
declined at its combat systems unit, which sells battle tanks
and rockets, the data show. </p>
<p>General Dynamics was dealt a setback in January after U.S.
Defense Secretary Robert Gates proposed to cancel its
Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle it was building for the Marine
Corps. With the government under pressure to cut spending and
reduce the military''s presence in Iraq and Afghanistan, Johnson
has said the Gulfstream unit will remain its growth engine. </p>
<p>For the full year, analysts anticipate that per-share
profit will increase 4.7 percent, followed by gains of 7.6
percent and 9.3 percent in the next two years, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Since at least 1991, General Dynamics has
never had a three-year stretch of profit growth that didn''t
exceed 10 percent in at least one year, the data show. </p>
<p>Buy Growth'' </p>
<p>There''s going to be no growth in defense budgets, said
Brian Ruttenbur, a Nashville, Tennessee-based equity analyst at
Morgan Keegan  Co. To replace that, they''re going to have to
go out and buy growth, he said. </p>
<p>The last deal by General Dynamics for a publicly traded
company worth more than $1 billion was its $2.2 billion
acquisition of Fairfax, Virginia-based Anteon International
Corp. in 2006, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Anteon designed, integrated, maintained and upgraded
computer systems for government agencies such as the Departments
of Homeland Security and Defense. General Dynamics bought
business-jet maker Gulfstream in 1999 for $5.4 billion including
net debt in its biggest acquisition, the data show. </p>
<p>General Dynamics, which has $2.5 billion in cash and short-
term investments, can add as much as $3 billion to its adjusted
long-term debt -- which includes pension obligations and
operating leases -- and still keep its B3H debt rating,
according to Bloomberg''s Company Credit Ratings. </p>
<p>Credit Ratings </p>
<p>The grade is three levels above junk, according to the
ratings, which analyze companies based on indebtedness,
profitability and other financial ratios. Borrowing more than
$15 billion would push the credit rating of General Dynamics to
junk level, the ratings show. </p>
<p>The company should use its cash to boost earnings through
acquisitions as defense spending slows, said Keith Wirtz, chief
investment officer at Fifth Third Asset Management in
Cincinnati, which oversees $18 billion. </p>
<p>CAE, which has a market value of $3.3 billion and makes
aviation training technology for commercial-airline and military
pilots, would be a good fit, according to Wirtz. Sales at the
Montreal-based company will increase 11 percent next year, while
earnings will climb 16 percent, according to analysts'' estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Both are more than double the projections
for General Dynamics, the data show. </p>
<p>More Opportunities'' </p>
<p>It would be almost intuitive that they start to do
strategic considerations, Wirtz said. What they are going to
be looking to do is to acquire new technologies and look for
companies that will give more opportunities that they don''t
already have. CAE might be an example. </p>
<p>CAE is not a company that is for sale, said Nathalie Bourque, the company''s spokeswoman. </p>
<p>CAE advanced 0.6 percent to C$12.56 in Toronto. </p>
<p>Fiduciary Trust''s Mullaney says that General Dynamics
should consider a deal with an industrial company that
specializes in energy or health care. </p>
<p>At best, it would be a field which potentially reduces
your exposure to government dependency, or puts you into a
complementary growth area, he said. Anything that helps
buffer General Dynamics from being so dependent on government
spending would be a step in the right direction. </p>
<p>It could combine with Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO), the
world''s largest maker of laboratory instruments, he said. </p>
<p>Laboratory Instruments </p>
<p>The company, which has a market value of $23.3 billion,
will increase profit by 56 percent this year -- 12 times the
rate projected for General Dynamics, analysts'' estimates
compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Investors value Thermo Fisher''s stock at almost 22 times
earnings, more than twice the level for General Dynamics,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Shares of Thermo Fisher gained 1.3 percent to $60.48. </p>
<p>Ron O''Brien, a spokesman for Waltham, Massachusetts-based
Thermo Fisher, declined to comment. </p>
<p>While General Dynamics may want to expand its maintenance
and repair services for Gulfstream customers, many of those
companies are small, privately held businesses, according to
Peter Arment, an analyst who rates General Dynamics a buy at
Gleacher  Co. in Greenwich, Connecticut. </p>
<p>One option would be to spin off the aerospace division
because it has been a drag on this company for a while, said
Fiduciary Trust''s Mullaney. While the aerospace unit had
operating income of $860 million last year, a 22 percent
increase from 2009, that''s still less than the $1.02 billion it
reported the prior year. </p>
<p>Buffett''s Criteria </p>
<p>General Dynamics was also one of more than 40 companies
that Bloomberg identified in March that met the acquisition
criteria Warren Buffett listed in his annual letter to
shareholders. </p>
<p>Buffett typically prefers simple businesses with
pretax profit exceeding $75 million, consistent earning
power, and good returns on equity while employing little or
no debt, according to his report. His takeover strategy has
shifted as Berkshire has grown to focus on capital intensive
businesses, such as power producers and railroads, which
require consistent investment in infrastructure and equipment. </p>
<p>Buffett didn''t respond to a request for comment e-mailed to
his assistant, Carrie Kizer. </p>
<p>Overall, there have been 8,499 deals announced globally
this year, totaling $839.2 billion, a 22 percent increase from
the $686.3 billion in the same period in 2010, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the only Wall
Street bank to remain profitable throughout the financial
crisis, is in advanced negotiations to resolve its piece of
a broader U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation
into how mortgage-linked securities were packaged and sold as
the housing market unraveled. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s securities unit has been cooperating with agency
officials and is currently in advanced discussions with the
staff concerning a potential resolution of that investigation,
the New York-based bank said in a quarterly financial report
filed with the SEC today. </p>
<p>The SEC is working to wrap up investigations into how banks
bundled and sold investments tied to risky mortgages, after
years of being faulted by lawmakers and investors for failing to
hold Wall Street accountable for misconduct that may have fueled
the financial crisis. JPMorgan has been probed by the SEC for
its role in designing and selling a $1.1 billion collateralized
debt obligation known as Squared in 2007, according to a
person briefed on the matter. </p>
<p>There can be no assurance that any such resolution will
be finalized or approved, JPMorgan said in today''s filing. The
bank didn''t specify which CDOs were the subject of the SEC
talks. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-
largest U.S. bank by assets, joined Bank of America Corp. (BAC) in
reporting a perfect trading period in the first quarter. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s revenue linked to market risk was higher than
$160 million on seven of the period''s 64 trading days, the New
York-based lender said today in a filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. The average daily revenue
was $112 million, according to the filing. </p>
<p>The firm, led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 55, had $6.64 billion in sales and trading revenue in the
first quarter, second only to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) among the
biggest U.S. banks. JPMorgan posted perfect trading periods in
three of four quarters last year. </p>
<p>Markets were affected during the first quarter by Japan''s
worst earthquake on record and a resulting tsunami and nuclear
crisis, which triggered the biggest three-day climb in the
Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index since May 2010
and an 18 percent drop in the Nikkei 225 Index. </p>
<p>Last year, the bank had eight days of trading losses, a
feat that Jes Staley, 54, CEO of the investment bank, said in
February he didn''t expect to repeat. Including other market-
related risks, the bank had 13 days of losses in 2010, according
to its annual report. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s figures may not be directly comparable with
other banks'' because they also include market risk besides
trading, such as principal transactions in its chief investment
office and some mortgage fees and hedges. </p>
<p>Bank of America''s trading-related revenue was positive
every day and exceeded $25 million on 98 percent of days during
the year''s first three months, according to a filing yesterday
by the Charlotte, North Carolina-based firm. In 2010, it had
gains on 90 percent of trading days, with perfect records in
that year''s first and third quarters, according to previous

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s Gavea
Investimentos Ltda., the investment company founded by former
Brazil central banker Arminio Fraga, is setting up a $2 billion
fund to buy stakes in Brazilian companies. </p>
<p>Gavea, which manages $2.5 billion in three private-equity
funds, will return proceeds from two of them to investors this
year as it starts the new one as early as this month, Gavea
partner Amaury Bier said in an interview at his office in Rio de
Janeiro yesterday. Consumer goods are among the industries Gavea
identified as the best opportunities for stake purchases, though
its funds don''t focus on specific sectors, he said. </p>
<p>The consumer story in Brazil is being boosted by income
growth, said Bier, a former deputy finance minister who runs
Gavea with Fraga. This is very powerful and will continue. </p>
<p>Blackstone Group LP (BX), Carlyle Group and KKR  Co. are among
global firms buying stakes in Brazilian businesses to tap family
consumption that jumped 7.5 percent in the fourth quarter from a
year earlier. Private-equity funds have as much as $8 billion
ready to buy stakes in the country, Piero Minardi, a partner at
Gavea, said at the Bloomberg Brazil Economic Forum in Sao Paulo
on March 30. </p>
<p>Raia SA (RAIA3), the Brazilian drugstore chain that raised 655
million reais ($404 million) in an initial public offering last
year, is among family-owned consumer goods businesses that Gavea
invested in and helped sell shares. It has gained 5.4 percent in
Sao Paulo trading since the IPO in December. </p>
<p>Highbridge Capital </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s Highbridge Capital Management agreed to buy 55
percent of Gavea last year and may acquire a further 45 percent
within five years. The sale to JPMorgan gives Gavea access to a
fantastic distribution network outside Brazil while helping
the New York-based bank increase its presence in the country as
other global securities firms build up their local teams, Bier
said. </p>
<p>UBS AG''s Brazil unit plans to more than double its
workforce as it seeks to reach 5 billion Swiss francs ($5.7
billion) of private-banking assets under management in five
years, country manager Lywal Salles said in an interview last
week. </p>
<p>Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4) and Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4), Brazil''s
two largest banks by market value, and Spain''s Banco Santander
SA have also set up private-equity funds in Brazil. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) received a
subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over
failed mortgages, a person familiar with the investigation said,
as the agency probes banks including Credit Suisse Group AG (CS) for
allegedly failing to share refunds from sellers of faulty debt. </p>
<p>Credit Suisse received a subpoena from the SEC last week,
bond insurer MBIA Insurance Corp. said in a filing yesterday in
a lawsuit against three of that Zurich-based bank''s units. The
agency asked New York-based JPMorgan for information after a
court in January unsealed allegations made about Bear Stearns
Cos.'' practices in another suit, said the person, who declined
to be identified because the matter isn''t public. </p>
<p>U.S. investigators have been scrutinizing companies
involved in the mortgage business after the worst collapse in
home prices since the Great Depression. </p>
<p>Bond insurers MBIA and Ambac Assurance Corp. have said
Credit Suisse and Bear Stearns, which JPMorgan bought in 2008,
demanded refunds from originators that sold the banks the loans
that they packaged into bonds, and then failed to use those
settlement amounts to fulfill their own contractual promises on
the debt. </p>
<p>We''re really starting to finally get into evidence that
suggests blatant fraud, said Isaac Gradman, a San Francisco-
based litigation consultant and formerly a lawyer at Howard Rice
Nemerovski Canady Falk  Rabkin. </p>
<p>Seeking Documents </p>
<p>Jennifer R. Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan, declined to comment. Steven Vames, a Credit Suisse
spokesman in New York, declined to comment on MBIA''s statement
about an SEC investigation. John Nester, an SEC spokesman,
declined to comment. </p>
<p>Kevin Brown, a spokesman for MBIA, said that Patterson
Belknap Webb  Tyler LLP as counsel for the bond insurer was
also subpoenaed by the SEC, seeking documents related to the
Credit Suisse matter. </p>
<p>U.S. agencies have been seeking evidence of wrongdoing
across the mortgage industry from before the market collapsed in
2007. JPMorgan said in a regulatory filing today it''s in
advanced discussions with the SEC to resolve an investigation
into collateralized debt obligations, which package assets such
as mortgage bonds into new securities. </p>
<p>The Justice Department sued Deutsche Bank AG this week for
more than $1 billion, saying the firm lied about its process for
checking the quality of loans granted federal insurance. </p>
<p>Charlotte Stripper </p>
<p>Credit Suisse knowingly packaged bad loans into bonds, MBIA
said in a court filing. The insurer included an exhibit in its
suit composed of e-mails related to a stated income loan
sought by a stripper in Charlotte, North Carolina, whose
reported monthly pay of $12,000 was questioned by some bank
employees. </p>
<p>MBIA Insurance Corp., the bond insurance unit of Armonk,
New York-based MBIA Inc. (MBI), disclosed Credit Suisse''s SEC subpoena
and the exhibit in a filing in New York State Supreme Court. The
document, dated April 29, was filed yesterday. </p>
<p>Credit Suisse is now the subject of an investigation by
the Securities and Exchange Commission, which issued a subpoena
this week seeking the same types of documents as MBIA seeks,
the insurer said. </p>
<p>MBIA alleges in its lawsuit that Credit Suisse failed to
repurchase soured mortgages out of a 2007 securitization as it
was contractually obligated to do. Earlier, the bank made
demands similar to MBIA''s to recover funds from the originators
of the loans -- money it didn''t share with the securities''
buyers, MBIA said. </p>
<p>Ambac Suit </p>
<p>The allegations echo claims made in January in a suit
brought by Ambac Assurance against the defunct investment bank
Bear Stearns and JPMorgan. Ambac first sued in 2008 in federal
court in Manhattan. The insurer filed a separate lawsuit over
the issues in New York State Supreme court in February. </p>
<p>Ambac is a large, sophisticated insurance company that is
trying to blame others for risks it knowingly took and was paid
for taking, Zuccarelli said earlier this year. We do not
believe Ambac''s claims are meritorious and intend to defend Bear
vigorously. </p>
<p>Credit Suisse, in a filing in MBIA''s case on April 29, said
contracts for its mortgage-bond transaction didn''t call for the
bank to repurchase loans simply because they became delinquent
within a few months or involved borrower fraud. That differed
from contracts between mortgage originators and Credit Suisse,
the bank said. </p>
<p>Originators'' Commitments </p>
<p>Credit Suisse cited e-mails between its employees and MBIA
officials before the deal closed, which the bank argued had
stated explicitly that those so-called representations and
warranties wouldn''t be made. Representations and warranties are
contractual promises that loans meet certain characteristics or
will perform in certain ways. </p>
<p>The loan originators'' commitments to Credit Suisse are
different from -- and materially broader than -- Credit Suisse''s
representations and warranties tied to the securitization
transaction, the bank said in court filings. </p>
<p>MBIA is entitled to what its contracts with CS provide,
and not more, Vames, the Credit Suisse spokesman, said
yesterday in an e-mail. </p>
<p>MBIA said in yesterday''s court filing that Credit Suisse in
some cases cited the same issues as it later did to reach
settlements with lenders, and that any early loan defaults
should have been seen as red flags for further reviews of
its obligations. </p>
<p>Early Defaults </p>
<p>A review by Credit Suisse in 2006 showed that 60 percent of
loans with early defaults failed to meet promised underwriting
guidelines, MBIA said, citing an e-mail between the banks''
employees. </p>
<p>External auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP advised Bear
Stearns in August 2006 that it needed to review loans that were
defaulting or defective to see if their quality breached its
obligations and begin the immediate processing of the buy-out
if there is a clear breach in order to match common industry
practices, the expectation of investors and to comply with its
mortgage bonds'' contracts, according to Ambac''s filing. </p>
<p>Its own lawyers by early 2007 were making similar
suggestions, according to the insurer''s amended complaint. </p>
<p>MBIA is seeking access to a database that contains
information about Credit Suisse''s quality control and
repurchase processes and shows how much the bank recovered
from loan originators, according to its suit. Before MBIA found
references to the database through the lawsuit, Credit Suisse
denied its existence, the insurer said. </p>
<p>Previously Securitized'' </p>
<p>The insurer''s filing said that it has also discovered in
the last few weeks that the securitization at issue in the
case, HEMT 2007-2, included home loans that were previously
securitized by Credit Suisse and then repurchased by Credit
Suisse as defective, just months before Credit Suisse pumped
them into the deal. </p>
<p>MBIA is unable to determine what Credit Suisse knew about
the defects associated with these recycled loans that required
their repurchase from other securitizations, the insurer said. </p>
<p>MBIA filed hundreds of pages of records and e-mails between
Credit Suisse employees, loan originators and brokers that the
insurer says show the bank knew of -- and received recoveries on
-- loans on which borrowers misrepresented income or otherwise
failed to comply with underwriting guidelines. </p>
<p>They show Credit Suisse''s motivation and scienter for
fraudulently inducing MBIA to participate in the bond deal,
the insurer said in court filings. The bank did so, in part,
to obtain double-recoveries on the defective loans by shoveling
them into the trust, profiting from their securitization, and
then recovering again when it demanded that the originators of
those loans repurchase them, even though Credit Suisse no longer
owned the loans. </p>
<p>Adult Entertainer </p>
<p>In the e-mails involving the North Carolina stripper''s loan
application, Credit Suisse employees questioned whether her
income was accurately reported. </p>
<p>We have an adult entertainer that is stating $142,800 per
year, Ron Szukala, a Credit Suisse underwriting manager in
Florida wrote in a January 2007 e-mail to another bank employee.
While I know this profession can make decent money, we feel
that $142K is overstated in NC. </p>
<p>I don''t believe she is making $12K per month, Robert
Sacco, a director at the bank, wrote in a separate e-mail,
saying that of all the so-called Alt-A loans the bank bought in
2006, 1 percent of those with fully documented incomes had gone
delinquent for 60 days or more, compared with 5.56 percent for
loans with stated incomes. 5 1/2 times worse because they are
overstating their income on their application, Sacco wrote. </p>

<p>A U.S. judge granted JPMorgan Chase 
Co.''s request to decide whether the trustee liquidating Bernard
Madoff''s firm has the right to sue the bank for $6.4 billion,
alleging it aided the confidence man''s fraud. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in New York set a
briefing schedule for JPMorgan''s argument that the case should
be dismissed, saying she will write an opinion explaining her
decision, according to a court filing May 4. The bank will ask
her to dismiss the case next month. </p>
<p>McMahon''s decision is the latest challenge to trustee
Irving Picard, who has filed more than 1,000 suits claiming $100
billion for investors in the Ponzi scheme. HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)
this week asked U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan to
dismiss a $9 billion lawsuit against it and so-called feeder
funds, saying Picard isn''t allowed by law to bring such suits on
behalf of Madoff customers. </p>
<p>Taking the HSBC case temporarily, Rakoff agreed with the
U.K. bank that Picard''s lawsuit raised issues beyond the
jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court where Picard filed the
suit. He said he would decide whether Picard can bring common-
law claims such as unjust enrichment and can sue on behalf of
customers, since his job is to liquidate the Madoff firm. </p>
<p>Amanda Remus, a Picard spokeswoman, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Picard, whose firm has sought $175 million for work since
Madoff''s 2008 arrest, is fighting to keep his cases in
bankruptcy court. </p>
<p>The issue of JPMC''s misconduct belongs before the
bankruptcy court as the court most versed in the nuances of the
Ponzi scheme and the roles of other, related wrongdoers in that
scheme, he told Rakoff in the filing in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan. JPMC seeks refuge in this court to escape the
scrutiny of the bankruptcy court. </p>
<p>Picard sued JPMorgan in December, claiming the bank, as
Madoff''s main lender, aided the fraud and should pay all of
investors'' losses in specified years. Denying wrongdoing, New
York-based JPMorgan said it had a right to a jury trial in the
district court. </p>
<p>Madoff, 72, pleaded guilty to orchestrating the biggest
Ponzi scheme in history. He is serving a 150-year sentence in
federal prison in North Carolina. </p>
<p>The case is Picard v. JPMorgan Chase  Co., 1:11-cv-00913,

<p>Altria Should Face Ill Smoker''s Suit, California Court Says </p>
<p>Altria Group Inc. (MO)''s Philip Morris USA Inc. should face
claims by a smoker who sued the cigarette maker for lung cancer
years after becoming ill, the California Supreme Court said. </p>
<p>Plaintiff Nikki Pooshs smoked from 1953 through 1987 and
was diagnosed with pulmonary disease in 1989 and periodontal
disease in 1990 or 1991. She knew that both illnesses were
caused by smoking and didn''t file a lawsuit until she was
diagnosed with lung cancer in 2003, according to the advisory
opinion. Philip Morris won a lower court ruling that Pooshs
waited too long to file the claims. </p>
<p>The California Supreme Court, based in San Francisco, ruled
yesterday that the two earlier illnesses were qualitatively
different from cancer and didn''t trigger the statute of
limitations for suing for misrepresentation, concealment,
product liability and failure to warn. </p>
<p>The judges ruled after a federal appeals court in San
Francisco considering Pooshs''s case asked for an opinion on the
treatment of statute of limitations under California law. </p>
<p>Although we are disappointed with the decision, the
California Supreme Court made it clear that it was not
addressing the merits of this case or any case, Steve
Callahan, an Altria spokesman, said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>The case is Pooshs v. Philip Morris USA Inc., S172023,
California Supreme Court (San Francisco). </p>
<p>BDO USA Settles Suit With Former Client Banco Espirito Santo </p>
<p>BDO USA, the accounting firm formerly known as BDO Seidman
LLP, agreed to settle a lawsuit that accused it of failing to
detect a fraud in a joint venture of former client Banco
Espirito Santo SA. (BES) </p>
<p>BDO won reversal of a $521.7 million jury verdict in the
case last year when a Florida appeals court ordered a new trial.
The terms of the settlement are confidential, Jerry Walsh, a BDO
spokesman, said. </p>
<p>BDO USA LLP has entered into confidential settlement
agreements with Banco Espirito Santo and Barry Mukamal, the
bankruptcy trustee of E.S. Bankest LC, pursuant to which the
lawsuits against BDO have been resolved, Walsh said in an e-
mailed statement. </p>
<p>Banco Espirito Santo, based in Lisbon, sued in 2004
claiming it suffered losses when New York-based BDO certified as
real accounts receivable at E.S. Bankest that were fake. </p>
<p>In 1998, the bank formed E.S. Bankest, which bought
receivables and collected the debt, as a joint venture with
Bankest Capital. E.S. Bankest officials faked millions of
dollars in receivables, and four executives were later convicted
of crimes. Banco Espirito Santo sold its interest in 2002 for
$10 million. </p>
<p>Florida''s Third District Court of Appeal in Miami ruled in
June that a 2007 jury award in the case should be reversed
because a decision to split a trial in three parts possibly
prejudiced jurors. </p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge A. Jay Cristol in Miami, who is
overseeing E.S. Bankest''s bankruptcy case, ordered the
settlement papers sealed and will hold a private hearing in
chambers about the accord on May 19. </p>
<p>The case is Banco Espirito Santo International Ltd. v. BDO
Seidman LLP, 04-14009-CA-01, 11th Judicial Circuit of Florida
(Miami-Dade County). </p>
<p>Fannie Mae Loses Bid to Dismiss Ex-Contractor''s Lawsuit </p>
<p>Fannie Mae lost its bid to dismiss a lawsuit filed by a
former contractor who alleges she was fired and blocked from a
Treasury Department job after complaining about the company''s
work on a program to modify home loans. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer in Washington
yesterday ordered Fannie Mae to turn over documents to help
determine whether the government-owned mortgage finance company
was a private employer or a federal entity when Caroline Herron
claims she was improperly fired and blackballed. </p>
<p>The outstanding issue that will govern this case and that
cannot be decided without a fact record is whether Fannie Mae
is, or was at the relevant time period, a private'' actor or a
federal'' actor, Collyer said in her ruling. </p>
<p>Herron sued Fannie Mae and three current and former
executives last year, claiming they ruined her reputation in the
industry because she told Treasury officials that Fannie Mae
wasn''t pursuing loan-modification projects requested by the
department, such as the Making Home Affordable Program. Herron
seeks more than $1.2 million in damages. </p>
<p>Amy Bonitatibus, a spokeswoman for Fannie Mae, declined to
comment. </p>

<p>Barclays Must Return $2.1 Billion, Lehman Brokerage Says </p>
<p>Barclays Plc (BARC), which bought Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.''s
North American business, must return $2.1 billion in margin
assets to the trustee liquidating the remnants of the brokerage,
the trustee said. </p>
<p>Trustee James Giddens raised his demand for margin assets
from $1.8 billion on April 28, as he and Barclays step up their
dispute over about $3.5 billion in assets after a judge''s ruling
failed to specify how much Barclays was entitled to take in
September 2008. He wants interest at 9 percent on the $2.1
billion. </p>
<p>At the same time, Giddens agreed to pay Barclays $869
million in damages plus 9 percent interest for failing to
deliver trading assets after the purchase. The so-called
clearance box assets were held to clear trades. </p>
<p>London-based Barclays is claiming $1.5 billion of the
disputed margin assets, saying it was entitled to take non-cash
margin in the deal. In a court filing May 4, it said the judge
should clarify his February order, spelling out the bank''s
right to margin and other assets. </p>
<p>Barclays said it was entitled to $134.8 million owed to
futures exchanges, plus other sums for liabilities it took on
with the purchase. </p>
<p>Michael O''Looney, a Barclays spokesman, didn''t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment. </p>
<p>The filings by Barclays and the Lehman brokerage come ahead
of a court conference scheduled for next week by U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge James Peck. The judge had directed Barclays and Giddens to
interpret the ruling he made in February granting the London-
based bank some assets and denying it some others, including
cash. </p>

<p>Allen Stanford Indicted Again With 7 of 21 Charges Dropped </p>
<p>R. Allen Stanford, the Texas financier accused by U.S.
prosecutors of leading a $7 billion investor fraud scheme, was
indicted again and accused of seven fewer counts than
previously. </p>
<p>Prosecutors filed a revised charging document May 4 in U.S.
District Court in Houston. Stanford, who has denied all
allegations of wrongdoing, has been in federal custody since
June 2009 awaiting trial. </p>
<p>Stanford is accused of defrauding investors who bought
certificates of deposit issued by his Antigua-based Antigua-
based Stanford International Bank Ltd. by misleading them about
the nature of the investments and their regulatory oversight. </p>
<p>The original indictment contained 21 criminal counts. The
new one contains 14, including conspiracy to commit money
laundering, obstruction of a U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission investigation, wire fraud and mail fraud. </p>
<p>Two wire-fraud counts were dropped and five of mail fraud. </p>
<p>The original indictment was such a mess, I think
prosecutors were just trying to clean up the charges, Ali
Fazel, one of Stanford''s criminal-defense lawyers, said in a
telephone interview today. I don''t think anything of relevance
has been dropped right now. </p>

<p>ICP Founder Priore Challenged by SEC Over Home Transfers </p>
<p>ICP Asset Management LLC founder Thomas Priore was accused
by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of illegally
selling two homes into trusts controlled by himself, his wife
and a friend after he was told the agency planned to sue him for
fraud. </p>
<p>The SEC yesterday asked a federal court in New York to let
it amend a complaint filed in June against Priore, ICP and two
related companies to include allegations that Priore
fraudulently transferred the homes, located on Martha''s Vineyard
in Massachusetts and in Chappaqua, New York. </p>
<p>In the original complaint, the SEC claimed Priore and New
York-based ICP fraudulently directed more than $1 billion of
trades at artificially high prices on behalf of collateralized
debt obligations they managed. </p>
<p>After his lawyer was told the agency intended to sue,
Priore sold the Martha''s Vineyard property, for $1, and the
Chappaqua home, for $10, to the trusts to hinder the
commission''s ability to collect disgorgement, penalties and
prejudgment interest from him, the SEC said in its proposed
amended complaint. </p>
<p>Dane Butswinkas, a lawyer representing Priore and ICP,
declined to comment. The defendants have denied wrongdoing and
are fighting the suit. </p>
<p>The case is SEC v. ICP Asset Management LLC, 10-CV-4791,

<p>Trials/Appeals </p>
<p>Rajaratnam Jury Hears Replay of Chiesi Wiretaps </p>
<p>Jurors in the Raj Rajaratnam insider-trading case listened
to replays of wiretapped recordings of the Galleon Group LLC co-
founder''s conversations with former trader Danielle Chiesi as
they continued to deliberate. </p>
<p>The jury yesterday asked to hear six recordings played
during the trial in federal court in Manhattan. On one of them,
Chiesi, a former analyst at New Castle Funds LLC who has pleaded
guilty in the case, asked Rajaratnam whether she should show a
pattern of trading. </p>
<p>You should buy and sell, and buy and sell, Rajaratnam
said, according to a recording that prosecutors say is evidence
that the two tried to hide their illegal trades. </p>
<p>The alleged Rajaratnam-Chiesi conspiracy is the fifth of
five separate insider-trading conspiracies on the list of
charges against Rajaratnam, who is also accused of making nine
specific illegal trades. </p>
<p>It''s anybody''s guess, but I think they''re close to
reaching a verdict, said Anthony Sabino, who teaches law at the
Tobin School of Business at St. John''s University in New York.
He isn''t involved in the case. </p>
<p>Deliberations were restarted May 4, after U.S. District
Judge Richard Holwell replaced a juror who was dismissed for
medical reasons. Some of the Rajaratnam-Kumar recordings were
re-played May 4 for the new juror. </p>
<p>Rajaratnam, 53, is on trial as part of the largest
crackdown on hedge-fund insider trading in U.S. history.
Prosecutors said he gained $63.8 million from tips leaked by
corporate insiders and hedge-fund traders about stocks including
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Intel Corp. (INTC) and Clearwire Corp.
Rajaratnam, who said he based the trades on research, faces as
long as 20 years in prison if convicted of the most serious
counts. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Says It Didn''t Discriminate Against Injured Banker </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-largest U.S. bank by
assets, said it didn''t discriminate against a London banker who
had his bonus cut and was fired after he reduced his hours
because of a skiing injury. </p>
<p>The bank is seeking to overturn a 2008 ruling that it
discriminated against Russell Chweidan, an executive director
for the bank''s hedge-fund sales credit team, on the grounds of
disability, JPMorgan lawyer Emma Smith said at a hearing
yesterday at the Court of Appeal in London. </p>
<p>Chweidan seriously injured his back while skiing with a
client in March 2007, according to court documents. After the
injury he had to wear a back brace and work fewer hours. In
January 2008 he was given a bonus of $450,000, 44 percent less
than the previous year. Then in July 2008 he was fired. Later
that year, a London employment tribunal ruled he had been
discriminated against. </p>
<p>Smith said yesterday that, while the banker was disabled,
he lost his job after he couldn''t build up his narrow client
base because he couldn''t entertain prospective clients in the
evening. </p>
<p>The reason why was a lack of a broad client base and the
reason for a lack of a broad client base was his hours, she
said, adding an employee without a disability who was unable to
expand their client list would be treated exactly the same. </p>
<p>Chweidan''s lawyer, Anna Beale, said the employment tribunal
was right to find he was discriminated against based on
disability. Chweidan was one of the strongest performers in his
team, yet he had the greatest proportionate drop in bonus,
she said. The bank may have chosen to pay him less because they
knew he would find it difficult to find another job. </p>

<p>New Suits </p>
<p>Lawson Sued Over $2 Billion Offer From Golden Gate, Infor </p>
<p>Lawson Software Inc. (LWSN), a global provider of business
software, was sued by an investor who said he will be
shortchanged in a proposed $2 billion takeover bid from Golden
Gate Capital Corp. and Infor Global Solutions. </p>
<p>Sanjay Israni, a Lawson stockholder, sued the company,
certain executives and the Golden Gate and Infor affiliate that
will be used for the acquisition on May 3 in Delaware Chancery
Court in Wilmington. Israni, who seeks to represent outside
investors as a group in the lawsuit, says the offer undervalues
the company and management failed to negotiate a better deal. </p>
<p>Rather than permitting the company''s shares to trade
freely and continue to benefit from Lawson''s opportunities for
long-term profitable growth, the executives acted to benefit
themselves to the detriment of the company''s shareholders,

<p>Verdicts/Settlement </p>
<p>Ex-Arcandor CEO Ordered to Pay Investor Over Thomas Cook Stake </p>
<p>Thomas Middelhoff, the former Arcandor AG (ARO) chief executive
officer, was ordered to cover the losses an investor had on
Thomas Cook Group Plc (TCG) shares bought in 2008 after Arcandor
denied it was looking to sell its stake. </p>
<p>Middelhoff intentionally damaged investors when he didn''t
prevent a company spokesman from telling the media that Arcandor
would keep shares of the travel company, while management was
secretly weighing selling them, an Essen, Germany, court ruled
yesterday. The suit was brought by Jan-Eric Peters, the editor
in chief of newspaper Die Welt, court spokesman Wolfgang Schmidt
said in an interview. </p>
<p>Arcandor, the former parent of German department-store
chain Karstadt, filed for insolvency in June 2009. Middelhoff''s
home and office were searched in October as part of a probe into
the company''s demise and any related misconduct. </p>
<p>Arcandor said on Sept. 24, 2009, that it had to clarify
an earlier statement that it wouldn''t give away part of its
majority stake in Thomas Cook to guarantee loans. The shares
fell 30 percent the next day. After several refinancing efforts
faltered, Arcandor announced that it would sell 23 million new
shares to Bank Sal Oppenheim Jr.  Cie. </p>
<p>Peters claimed he lost more than 50,000 euros ($73,000)
because he bought Arcandor shares relying on the information. He
limited his suit to 5,000 euros to avoid cost risks and was
awarded 2,575 euros yesterday. </p>
<p>Middelhoff''s attorney Hartmut Fromm said he will appeal
yesterday''s ruling. The court improperly declined to call
witnesses who would have backed Middelhoff''s position, Fromm
said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Yesterday''s case is LG Essen, 4 O 244/09. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) plans to boost
debt capital markets staff in the Asia-Pacific region by 30
percent to help Chinese companies sell bonds as measures to curb
inflation make borrowing in China more expensive. </p>
<p>The bulk of new hires will be in Hong Kong, while others
will join the Beijing operations of the bank''s joint venture
with First Capital Securities Co., Murlidhar Maiya, head of debt
capital markets for Asia ex-Japan, said in a phone interview
from Hong Kong. He declined to provide further details on staff
numbers. </p>
<p>My team covers all 12 countries in non-Japan Asia but 100
percent of the new hires are focused on China, or the greater
China market, said Maiya. Domestic interest rates in China
are shooting up and the government is trying to curb credit. You
talk to any Chinese company and they''re looking at what they can
do offshore. </p>
<p>China has raised interest rates four times since September
to help curb inflation that reached a 32-month high in March.
Chinese companies may help sales of yuan-denominated bonds in
Hong Kong rise to as much as 150 billion yuan ($23 billion) this
year, according to HSBC Holdings Plc. Sales in dollars, euros or
yen this year from these issuers have increased almost six-fold
to $20.5 billion compared to the same period in 2010, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Dim Sum Bonds </p>
<p>JPMorgan is the No. 3 arranger of so-called Dim Sum bond
sales this year after organizing no issues of yuan-denominated
bonds in Hong Kong in 2010, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The New York-based company''s share in the so-called
G3-currency bond market involving Chinese issuers is 3 percent,
down from 9 percent the same period last year, the data show. </p>
<p>In addition to China, the bank is focused on bond markets,
including local-currency issuance, in other parts of Asia such
as Korea and India, Maiya said. </p>
<p>The number of bankers who are familiar with the offshore
Chinese debt capital markets is by definition very small because
until recently, most Chinese companies had no need to look at
dollar financing, Maiya said. </p>
<p>As well as searching for talent within the region, Maiya
said the bank is also reaching out to find people in Europe
and the U.S. who are familiar with the language and the culture
and who are looking to come back home. </p>

<p>Lloyd C. Blankfein, chief executive
officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), has sought to quell
shareholder concerns about its bonuses and business practices at
the past two annual meetings. Today, he will try again. </p>
<p>As the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets hosts investors
for the first time at its building in Jersey City, New Jersey,
shareholders are still questioning Goldman Sachs''s actions
during the financial crisis, executive pay and business model. </p>
<p>They really do have to reshape the firm and get the
message out there that Look, here''s what we''re going to look
like going forward,'' said Peter Sorrentino, a senior portfolio
manager at Huntington Asset Advisors in Cincinnati, which
manages $14.8 billion, including almost 135,000 Goldman Sachs
shares. I still think we''re one headline away from this stock
getting clobbered. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs was the most-profitable securities firm when
Blankfein, 56, took the helm almost five years ago. While the
company survived the financial crisis that bankrupted smaller
rival Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and repaid U.S. rescue funds
and Warren Buffett''s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., its practices
before the crisis have remained under scrutiny. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs fell $1.11 to $150.41 yesterday on the New
York Stock Exchange and has dropped 10.6 percent this year,
compared with a 0.6 percent gain for the 82-member Standard 
Poor''s 500 Financials Index and a 6.2 percent advance for the
SP 500 Index. </p>
<p>$550 Million Settlement </p>
<p>At last year''s meeting, Blankfein created a business-
standards committee to study the firm''s practices and recommend
ways they could be improved. The committee, which issued a
report in January, was formed in part as a response to an April
2010 Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit alleging the
firm misled clients about a mortgage-linked investment. Goldman
Sachs paid $550 million in July to settle the suit. </p>
<p>The questions didn''t end there. Last month the U.S.
Senate''s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations issued a
report on the causes of the financial crisis that accused New
York-based Goldman Sachs of misleading clients in its sales of
mortgage securities, a charge the firm denies. The report was
referred to the Justice Department and the SEC, which have said
they are looking into it. </p>
<p>There are still lingering problems for Goldman Sachs,
said Benjamin B. Wallace, an analyst at Westborough,
Massachusetts-based Grimes  Co., which manages about $1 billion
and doesn''t own Goldman Sachs stock. If the Senate and the SEC
and the Department of Justice would stop investigating them they
could probably put it behind them. </p>
<p>Sins of the Past'' </p>
<p>The business-standards committee was a good idea for public
relations and a useful guide for future conduct, but the
problem is that does not absolve you from the sins of the
past, said Huntington''s Sorrentino. </p>
<p>I would not at this moment say that any financial
services firm, especially Goldman, who was preeminent during
that whole time, is out of the woods on this, he said. At
this juncture, given the magnitude of what happened, I don''t
know what the time window is. </p>
<p>At the meeting two years ago, as public outrage over Wall
Street bonuses swelled following the government bailouts of
financial institutions, Blankfein read shareholders a
description of Goldman Sachs''s compensation principles. The
principles included an emphasis on tying pay to long-term firm
performance and avoiding multiyear guarantees. </p>
<p>Cash Bonuses </p>
<p>Blankfein, who''s also Goldman Sachs''s chairman, and top
deputies including Gary D. Cohn, president and chief operating
officer, and David A. Viniar, chief financial officer, received
no bonuses for 2008 and no cash bonuses for 2009. Earlier this
year, Goldman Sachs disclosed that it was increasing salaries
for Blankfein and his deputies and paid Blankfein $19 million
for 2010, including a $5.4 million cash bonus. </p>
<p>Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. recommended that
stockholders cast a non-binding vote against the awards for
Goldman Sachs''s executive officers. The ISS report cites a
pay-for-performance disconnect after Goldman Sachs''s
executives'' compensation increased even as profits fell last
year. </p>
<p>Glass Lewis  Co., another proxy advisory service,
expressed concern about Goldman Sachs''s opaque program for
determining compensation, even though it recommended that
shareholders vote in favor of the awards. </p>
<p>Social Responsibility </p>
<p>Christian Brothers Investment Services Inc., which manages
$4 billion and owns about 68,000 Goldman Sachs shares, is voting
against the pay awards this year, said Julie Tanner, the firm''s
assistant director of social responsibility. </p>
<p>I don''t think that the pay level is justified, Tanner
said in an interview. There''s a level beyond which pay is not
appropriate and needs to be reined in, and I think this company
is one of those examples. </p>
<p>For investors like Sorrentino, a bigger concern is how the
company plans to drive revenue and profit growth going forward.
Although the firm rebounded from the crisis to achieve record
profit in 2009, earnings sagged last year and in the first
quarter of 2011. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s return on equity, a measure of how well the
firm reinvests shareholder capital, dropped to 11.5 percent in
2010 from 32.7 percent three years earlier. While it still beats
competitors including Morgan Stanley, whose 2010 return on
equity from continuing operations was 8.5 percent, investors
question whether the firm can achieve its former profitability. </p>
<p>There is a more competitive framework out there and they
do have to scrape for business, Sorrentino said. In the
regulatory environment we find ourselves in, where does Goldman
sit in all this? How should we set our expectations for success
going forward? </p>
<p>Two More Years </p>
<p>Blankfein''s future at the firm continues to be subject to
speculation. Earlier this week, the New York Post, citing people
it didn''t identify, reported that Blankfein is likely to stay
for at least two more years. The company has said he has no
plans to leave. </p>
<p>Probably starting about now is when he could safely leave
and say he got Goldman through everything, said Grimes  Co.''s
Wallace. But maybe with all the PR stuff, you want to stay on
because one thing you want to do when you turn it over to new
leadership is have a clean slate. </p>

<p>Visa Inc. (V), the world''s biggest
payments network, posted a 24 percent profit increase that beat
most analysts'' estimates as global card spending surged. </p>
<p>Net income for the fiscal second quarter ended March 31
climbed to $881 million, or $1.23 a share, from $713 million, or
96 cents, in the same period a year earlier, the San Francisco-
based company said yesterday in a statement. The average
estimate of 29 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was $1.21 a share. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Joseph W. Saunders, 65, is buying
back shares as more people pay with plastic and consumer
spending rebounds. U.S. household purchases, which account for
about 70 percent of the economy, rose at a 2.7 percent pace in
the first quarter, the Commerce Department said last week. </p>
<p>We continue to have a huge opportunity almost everywhere
in the world, Saunders said in a conference call with
analysts. I think our numbers would suggest we are doing quite
well in Asia, other parts of Latin America and other regions
outside the U.S. I''m bullish on where we''ll be in the next few
years. </p>
<p>Visa fell $1.07 to $78.70 yesterday in New York Stock
Exchange trading, before the results were announced. The shares
have declined 8.9 percent in the past year, lagging a 15 percent
gain for No. 2 network MasterCard Inc. (MA), based in Purchase, New
York. </p>
<p>12 Billion Transactions </p>
<p>Worldwide spending on Visa debit and credit cards advanced
13 percent to $861 billion, the company said. Purchases climbed
12 percent to $230 billion in the Asia-Pacific region, and 26
percent to $77 billion in Latin America and the Caribbean. Card
spending in the U.S. climbed 12 percent to $477 billion,
according to the statement. </p>
<p>Cross-border volume, a measure of spending by cardholders
outside their home countries, advanced 13 percent. Processed
transactions rose 13 percent to 12 billion, compared with the
same period a year earlier. Net revenue increased 15 percent to
$2.25 billion, while operating expenses rose 3 percent to $862
million. </p>
<p>Saunders is facing investor concern that U.S. caps on
debit-card swipe fees, or interchange, may lead to more
regulation and damage Visa''s business model. Visa and MasterCard
set the fees and pass the money to card-issuing banks. </p>
<p>The Federal Reserve has proposed capping the fees at 12
cents a transaction, replacing a formula that costs merchants an
average of 1.14 percent of the purchase price, or about 44
cents. The curbs may reduce annual revenue by $12 billion at
U.S. banks that issue Visa and MasterCard debit cards, including
Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) and JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) </p>
<p>Fed Rulemaking </p>
<p>The rule may be delayed or modified. Senator Jon Tester, a
Montana Democrat, has introduced a measure that would postpone
the Fed''s rulemaking. Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee
Republican, also is helping lead efforts to craft a bipartisan
bill. </p>
<p>Saunders said he expects the Senate to consider Tester''s
measure in the near future. </p>
<p>Visa bought back about 8.7 million shares in the quarter
valued at $630 million and authorized a new $1 billion
repurchase program, according to the statement. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) raised its oil-
price forecasts because OPEC and other producers aren''t matching
rising demand and consumers will take time to react to higher
prices. </p>
<p>The bank boosted its 2011 Brent crude forecast to $120 a
barrel from $110, and changed its estimate for West Texas
Intermediate crude to $109.50 from $99. Forecasts for 2012
prices were raised to $120 and $114, respectively. </p>
<p>While financial bushfires or perhaps a rapid resolution
to the Libyan civil war could radically alter market dynamics,
the balance of both risks and fundamentals still points to a
supply-constrained world, JPMorgan analysts led by New York-
based Lawrence Eagles wrote in a report yesterday. </p>
<p>Oil futures posted their biggest weekly decline since
December 2008 last week amid concern about the pace of the
economic recovery, with London-traded Brent plunging 13 percent
to $109.13. </p>
<p>JPMorgan forecasts supply to fall short of demand by
600,000 barrels a day during the third quarter, even with the
assumption that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries increases output by 1.2 million barrels a day in
coming months. </p>
<p>The gap could narrow to 300,000 barrels a day by the fourth
quarter, assuming Saudi Arabia increases production to 9.5
million barrels a day, Angola to 1.7 million and Iraq to 3
million, though that may prove a stretch, the bank said.
Output from those three OPEC countries in March was 8.66
million, 1.56 million and 2.69 million barrels a day,
respectively, it said. </p>
<p>Supply Gap </p>
<p>Consumers draw on stockpiles when production fails to match
demand. Still, with inventories already below the five-year
average, any supply gap will have to be balanced by lower demand
growth, rationed by higher prices, the New York-based bank
said. </p>
<p>Next quarter there''s a risk oil may move toward record
levels near $150 set in 2008, unless there''s a surprise increase
in OPEC output beyond 29.4 million barrels a day or slower
economic growth, the bank said. JPMorgan forecast Brent to
average $130 and WTI $116 during the July-to-September period. </p>
<p>While the bank lowered its estimate of world demand by
100,000 barrels a day, in part because of the earthquake-led
disruptions in Japan, it raised its forecast for Chinese
consumption, saying data implies China''s crude-oil inventories
have been drawn heavily in the past six months. </p>
<p>We have observed a parallel destocking activity in the
copper market, JPMorgan said. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), the sixth-largest U.S.
bank by assets, posted trading revenue of more than $100 million
on 10 days in the first quarter. </p>
<p>The firm''s trading division lost money on 3 days during the
period, compared with 13 days in the fourth quarter, New York-
based Morgan Stanley said in a filing with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission. Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) last week posted perfect quarters, with positive
revenue on each trading day. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley had $3.47 billion in sales and trading
revenue in the three months ended March 31, more than triple its
fourth-quarter figure and about half that of rivals Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and JPMorgan. Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, 52, has replaced management and increased hiring in the
fixed-income trading unit to close the gap. </p>
<p>Our trading results demonstrated considerable improvement
and reflect continued focus and discipline, Chief Financial
Officer Ruth Porat said on a conference call last month. She
said the daily revenue disclosure would be another way of
underscoring that with the addition of the team, greater
presence with clients, greater client facilitation
opportunities, that we''re productive. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s market risk-related revenue averaged $112
million a day in the quarter and was higher than $160 million on
seven of the period''s 64 days, the New York-based lender said in
a filing last week. The bank''s measure includes some market risk
besides trading, such as principal transactions in its chief
investment office and some mortgage fees and hedges. </p>
<p>Bank of America </p>
<p>Bank of America''s trading-related revenue was positive
every day and exceeded $25 million on 98 percent of days during
the year''s first three months, the Charlotte, North Carolina-
based company said in a filing last week. </p>
<p>Gorman said in February that his No. 1 priority is
turning around the firm''s fixed-income trading unit, hoping to
capture a 2 percentage-point gain in market share this year.
Excluding gains and losses tied to their own debt, Morgan
Stanley had about a 6 percent market share in 2010 among 11 of
the largest U.S. and European banks, according to data compiled
by analysts at JPMorgan and Nomura Holdings Inc. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley also settled a lawsuit involving a
collateralized debt obligation named Tourmaline, according to
today''s filing. The firm settled at a loss that''s
substantially less than the $273 million possible loss the
company had previously disclosed, it said. </p>
<p>Legal Appeal </p>
<p>It''s reasonably possible Morgan Stanley could lose up
to $240 million from a 2010 lawsuit brought by China Development
Industrial Bank over a $275 million credit default swap,
according to the filing. Morgan Stanley is appealing a court
order denying its motion to dismiss the case, the company said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s derivative counterparty exposure to MBIA
Inc. and other bond insurers was $782 million at March 31, after
netting for credit valuation adjustments and hedges, according
to the filing. That exposure was about negative $660 million at
Dec. 31, when CVA and hedges related to MBIA exceeded the firm''s
exposure by $1.1 billion. </p>
<p>The increase in the exposure was primarily due to a
reduction of MBIA-related hedges, Morgan Stanley said. The
firm lost $318 million related to the exposures and hedges in
the first quarter, bringing its total losses to $1.04 billion in
the past four quarters. </p>
<p>In February, Cambridge Place Investment Management Inc.
filed a lawsuit against Morgan Stanley and other defendants
alleging they made untrue statements and material omissions
in the sale of mortgage pass-through certificates, according to
the filing. Morgan Stanley said it''s accused of issuing,
underwriting or selling $102 million of the securities. </p>
<p>Cambridge Place filed a similar suit in July 2010 accusing
Morgan Stanley of issuing, underwriting or selling $242 million
of the securities, according to a previous regulatory filing. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is returning
to Australia''s bond market for the first time since 2006 to take
advantage of relative yields on financial debt hovering at about
the lowest level in three years. </p>
<p>The fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets sold A$1.25 billion
($1.35 billion) of 5 1/2-year notes yesterday, including A$500
million of floating-rate bonds priced to yield 205 basis points
more than the bank bill swap rate, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The extra yield investors demand to own Australian
dollar bank bonds instead of government debt has shrunk 37 basis
points this year to 157, compared with a drop of 31 on U.S.
financial securities to 175, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
indexes show. </p>
<p>The New York-based bank follows JPMorgan Chase  Co. and
Bank of America Corp. (BAC) in returning to the so-called kangaroo
bond market, which shut to financial issuers in 2008 after the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. spurred investors to
shun all but the safest debt. </p>
<p>It is a sign of market health that Goldman can consider
issuing in Australia, said John Sorrell, head of credit at
Tyndall Investment Management Australia Ltd. in Sydney, who
helps manage about A$14 billion of fixed-income assets. I
expect more financial kangaroo sales. </p>
<p>Basis Swaps </p>
<p>While Australia''s benchmark interest rate of 4.75 percent
compares with near zero in the U.S., the currency swaps market
is offering discounts to borrowers as they switch the proceeds
into U.S. dollars. </p>
<p>The five-year Australian dollar basis swap, which measures
the cost of switching interest based on the London interbank
offered rate, or Libor, for payments linked to Australia''s bank
bill swap rate, was at 20.3 basis points in Sydney today. </p>
<p>It peaked at 48 basis points in November 2009, and has
averaged 21.7 this month, compared with an average 8.6 for the
five years to 2007. The higher the level, the greater the
discount for overseas borrowers selling debt in Australia. </p>
<p>The spread paid by Goldman Sachs, rated A by Standard 
Poor''s, compares with the 113 basis points that Australia  New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) and Westpac Banking Corp. each paid
on five-year bonds last week, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Both Australian companies are ranked AA, three rungs higher than
Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>Previous Sale </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs paid a 51-basis-point spread over swap rates
when it issued A$200 million of 10-year 6.35 percent kangaroo
notes in March 2006, part of an offering that totaled A$1.65
billion and was the lender''s last sale of the securities, the
data show. The notes were last quoted at a spread of 182 basis
points, ANZ prices show. </p>
<p>Kangaroo bond sales surged to a record A$37.3 billion last
year as the swaps market cut funding costs for issuers once
proceeds were exchanged into U.S. dollars. The World Bank and
Germany''s Landwirtschaftliche Rentenbank were among the top
borrowers. </p>
<p>The World Bank''s International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development sold A$600 million of 5.5 percent October 2014 notes
on Jan. 18. The securities were priced to yield 49.25 basis
points more than similar-maturity government debt, Bloomberg
data show. </p>
<p>That rate equated to about 10 basis points less than Libor,
once swapped into U.S. dollars, the data show. In June, the IBRD
priced $2 billion of floating-rate bonds due July 2011 to yield
5 basis points more than Libor. </p>
<p>Hayley Morris, a Sydney-based spokeswoman for Goldman
Sachs, didn''t immediately respond to two telephone requests for
comment on yesterday''s sale. </p>
<p>Growth Forecast </p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of Australia, which kept its target rate
at 4.75 percent last week, expects the economy to expand 4.25
percent this year, the fastest pace since 1999. It''s banking on
a rising currency to help curb inflation. </p>
<p>Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan will release the
government''s budget later today amid promises of substantial
spending cuts. Swan, who delivers the budget to Parliament
beginning at 7:30 p.m. local time, said earlier this week that
the deficit in the government''s finances will widen in the
fiscal year ending June 30 before increased mining revenue and
an improving economy help bring about a surplus in 2012-13. </p>
<p>Australia''s dollar climbed 20 percent over the past year to
$1.0786 at 8:18 a.m. in Sydney today, and touched $1.1012 on May
2, the highest since exchange controls were scrapped in 1983. </p>
<p>Consumer Prices </p>
<p>Consumer prices may rise an annual 3.11 percent in the next
five years, according to the gap between yields on government
bonds and inflation-indexed notes. The RBA aims to hold
inflation between 2 and 3 percent on average. </p>
<p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond dropped
1 basis point to 5.42 percent yesterday, or 225 basis points
more than similar-maturity Treasuries. </p>
<p>The extra yield investors demand to hold Australian-dollar
bank bonds instead of government debt fell to 154 basis points
in March, the lowest since January 2008, Bank of America Merrill
Lynch indexes show. </p>
<p>Kangaroo bond sales, which total A$16.2 billion this year,
slowed from a record start after Australia''s banking regulator
ruled that notes sold by top-rated borrowers such as the World
Bank don''t qualify as assets lenders need to hold under Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision rules. </p>
<p>RBC Capital Markets leads underwriter rankings with an 18
percent market share, followed by Commonwealth Bank of Australia
with 11 percent, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>JPMorgan paid 135 basis points more than swap rates when it
sold A$600 million of five-year kangaroo bonds in March,
Bloomberg data show. It''s rated A+ by SP, the fifth-highest
investment grade. </p>
<p>Demand for the Goldman Sachs notes was very strong and
the spread was fair, said Mark Mitchell, a portfolio manager and
head of credit at Sydney-based Kapstream Capital, which manages
about A$3.9 billion and bought the bonds. </p>
<p>We would classify Goldman Sachs as being too big to fail
in terms of their systemic importance in the U.S., he said.
We''re pretty comfortable having exposure to it. </p>

<p>The commodities rout that knocked off
$99 billion of market value last week is driving out speculators
and leading Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which forecast the plunge,
to predict a possible recovery. </p>
<p>The combination of slower growth in U.S. service industries
and fewer German manufacturing orders helped drive the Standard
 Poor''s GSCI Index of 24 commodities down 11 percent in five
days, the most since December 2008, and erased all the gains
since mid-March. Wheat, zinc and gold rebounded at the end of
the week as U.S. payrolls exceeded economists'' forecasts,
reducing concern that demand will weaken. </p>
<p>Given the magnitude of the pullback, it does create an
opportunity for more upside potential, particularly in the
second half of this year, when fundamentals are expected to
tighten, Jeffrey Currie, the London-based head of commodity
research at Goldman, said in a May 6 interview. A month ago,
Currie told investors they should be underweight in
commodities. In the very near-term, we''d be a little
cautious, he says now. </p>
<p>The value of all 24 commodities tracked by the SP GSCI
index was about $805 billion on May 6, compared with $891
billion on April 29, according to data compiled by Bloomberg on
the number of outstanding contracts and prices of futures
closest to delivery. Combined holdings of exchange-traded
products backed by precious metals fell to $119 billion from
$132 billion, the data show. </p>
<p>Investment Funds </p>
<p>Speculators retreated after investment funds had made near-
record bets on price gains last month and the SP GSCI reached
the highest since August 2008. Commodities beat stocks, bonds
and the dollar for five consecutive months through the end of
April, the longest in at least 14 years, on forecasts for demand
exceeding output in everything from oil to copper to corn. </p>
<p>The most influential analysts and fund managers are divided
on where prices are headed. The last time the SP GSCI fell this
much, the index rebounded 12 percent the following week, and by
the end of last month, it had more than doubled. </p>
<p>Bulls say the expanding global economy, led by growth in
China, India and Brazil, is boosting demand at a time when
producers from BHP Billiton Ltd., the largest mining company, to
BP Plc, Europe''s second-biggest oil producer, can''t keep up. </p>
<p>Selling would be premature, and the rally will resume,
said Hussein Allidina, the head of commodity research at Morgan
Stanley in New York, reiterating comments made before the rout.
The decline we are seeing is not being driven by any
meaningful change in fundamentals, he said. </p>
<p>Not Turning Point'' </p>
<p>This is not a turning point, said Kevin Norrish, a
London-based managing director at Barclays Capital, whose
commodities research team is ranked by Bloomberg in the top
three for copper and gold. We''d expect to see a pretty good
recovery from these levels before too long. </p>
<p>The SP GSCI climbed 3.6 percent today, as silver futures
jumped 5.2 percent and crude oil in New York added 5.5 percent. </p>
<p>Brent crude should rebound about 3 percent to $115 a barrel
in coming weeks because violence in northern Africa and the
Middle East continues, Christin Tuxen, an analyst at Danske Bank
A/S in Copenhagen and the most-accurate oil forecaster tracked
by Bloomberg over eight quarters, said on May 6. The fighting
already curbed supply from Libya and increased concern that it
may spread to regional producers including Saudi Arabia. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. raised its oil-price forecasts for
this year and next on May 6 because it expects production to
fall short of demand. Brent crude will average $120 in 2011 and
2012, from previous estimates of $110 and $114, the bank said.
Oil prices should match or top their recent highs by next year,
Goldman said in a note to clients on the same day. </p>
<p>Global Recession </p>
<p>The bears say that even if the economy grows, speculation
is so excessive that prices no longer reflect supply and demand.
The SP GSCI Index is 39 percent higher than a year ago and more
than twice where it was in February 2009, when economies were
recovering from the global recession. </p>
<p>Commodities are at the start of a bear market that may last
as long as five to 10 years, said Michael Aronstein, the
president of Marketfield Asset Management in New York who
correctly predicted the 2008 slump that drove the benchmark
index down 66 percent in seven months. </p>
<p>The scale of investment means supply and demand is almost
meaningless, Aronstein said in an interview May 6. It''s
almost like the last days of the tech bubble. </p>
<p>Oil, which lost 15 percent last week in New York and 13
percent in London, became detached from fundamentals, said
Oswald Clint, London-based head oil analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein, the joint-most-accurate oil forecaster tracked by
Bloomberg in 2010. Brent could drop below $100 a barrel, he
said. That''s about 14 percent lower than now. </p>
<p>Commodity Funds </p>
<p>About $9.61 billion went into commodity funds in the first
quarter, more than triple the $2.77 billion a year earlier, EPFR
Global, a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based research firm, said in
a report in April. Energy funds attracted $10.9 billion,
compared with a year-earlier outflow of $367 million. </p>
<p>A rebound in the dollar also dimmed the appeal for
commodities that are priced in the U.S. currency. The Dollar
Index, a measure against six counterparts, rose 2.6 percent last
week, the most since August. The index has a negative
correlation of 0.89 to the SP GSCI Index. A figure of 1 would
mean they move in lockstep. The currency gauge may drop to the
lowest since July 2008 by the end of the year, estimates
compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Five-Day Slump </p>
<p>This is probably the beginning of a bear phase, even if
it''s temporary, where the dollar and bonds will be more popular
than commodities, said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist
at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in New York. It''s fitting
hand in glove with the U.S. slowdown story. </p>
<p>The SP GSCI''s five-day slump, the longest since August,
began on May 2 and accelerated on May 5 by plunging 6.5 percent,
the most since January 2009. </p>
<p>Silver led the rout after CME Group Inc., the owner of the
Comex exchange, increased the cost of making new speculative
positions by 84 percent in two weeks. Prices that advanced as
much as 61 percent to $49.845 an ounce this year tumbled 27
percent last week to $35.287 on May 6. The metal may drop as low
as $30 toward the end of the year before rebounding as gold
rallies, said Dan Smith, the London-based analyst at Standard
Chartered Plc, which predicted a decline in prices last month. </p>
<p>Gold, Soros </p>
<p>Gold also fell, declining 4.2 percent to $1,491.60 an ounce
last week, after the Wall Street Journal reported May 4 that
Soros Fund Management LLC, the hedge fund chaired by billionaire
investor George Soros, sold some of its precious-metal holdings. </p>
<p>Bullion will advance to a record $1,650 by year-end, partly
fueled by central banks buying to diversify their reserves, said
Andrew Kaleel, chief executive officer of Sydney-based H3 Global
Advisors Pty Ltd., which has a commodity hedge fund managing
about A$600 million ($642 million). </p>
<p>Mexico, Russia and Thailand bought about a combined $6
billion of bullion in February and March, International Monetary
Fund data show. Since the end of 2009, countries including
India, Sri Lanka, Mauritius and Bangladesh have bought metal.
Central banks are expanding their gold reserves for the first
time in a generation as bullion rises for an 11th consecutive
year, the longest winning streak since at least 1920. </p>
<p>The killing of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden may have
been the catalyst for this week''s slide in oil, the biggest
exchange-traded commodity by value. Crude had surged as much as
25 percent this year as violence swept through northern Africa
and the Middle East, disrupting 1.3 million barrels a day from
Libya and raising concerns of shortages from the Persian Gulf.
Since bin Laden''s death was announced, traders shifted their
focus to prospects of weaker demand. </p>
<p>Service Industries </p>
<p>Service industries in the U.S. expanded in April at the
slowest pace in eight months, the Institute for Supply
Management said May 4. Applications for jobless benefits jumped
the most since August in the week ended April 30, the Labor
Department said May 5. That was tempered by a report from the
department a day later showing payrolls increased last month by
the most since May 2010. </p>
<p>Factory orders in Germany, Europe''s largest economy,
unexpectedly dropped 4 percent in March, the Economy Ministry
said May 5. The country''s industrial production rose for a third
time the same month, the ministry said the next day. </p>
<p>Central bankers also helped drive commodities lower last
week by indicating their intention to cool growth to combat
inflation. Rates rose in more than two-dozen countries this
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Extremely Alert'' </p>
<p>European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said
May 6 that policy makers are extremely alert on inflation
after they raised interest rates on April 7, joining China,
India, Poland and Sweden in seeking to control consumer prices
with tighter monetary policy. Trichet said he may take further
decisions on rates after new economic projections in June. </p>
<p>While every commodity tracked by the SP GSCI fell last
week, some rebounded May 6. Wheat futures rose 2 percent on the
Kansas City Board of Trade as drought and flooding threatened
crops in North America, Europe and Asia. Cocoa, cattle, zinc,
gold, copper, nickel and soybeans also gained. </p>
<p>Lower prices also may spur more demand. Barclays, which
told investors in a report May 6 to use the slump to buy, is
forecasting shortfalls in production this year for copper,
nickel, tin, lead, platinum and palladium. Rabobank expects
demand to exceed output in corn and cotton, according to a
report last month. </p>
<p>Strong'' Demand </p>
<p>Ultimately, supply remains weak, and demand remains
strong, and that''s why they will eventually go higher, said
John Stephenson, who helps manage $2.6 billion at First Asset
Investment Management Inc. in Toronto. Commodities, in the
worst case, will start firming by late August, but in the
meantime, I would see this as a buying opportunity. </p>
<p>Oil demand will exceed supply this year, the U.S. Energy
Department said in a report April 12. Billionaire hedge-fund
manager T. Boone Pickens said May 3 that prices will rise. </p>
<p>If you look at the fourth-quarter projection for oil,
that''s 90 million barrels a day globally, and I don''t think the
world can produce more than 88 million, Pickens said in an
interview from Los Angeles with Willow Bay and Lisa Murphy on
Bloomberg Television''s Fast Forward. </p>
<p>For now, funds are probably still trimming bets on higher
commodity prices. Net-long positions held by managed-money funds
fell 2.4 percent to 1.45 million futures and options in the week
ended May 3, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show.
They reached a record 1.56 million contracts in October. </p>
<p>Open interest in 17 of 19 commodities tracked by the
Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index dropped 0.6 percent to 8.15
million contracts, data from the CFTC show. That compares with
an all-time high of 8.6 million on Feb. 18. </p>
<p>I don''t think the commodities boom is over, said
Robbert Van Batenburg, an analyst at Louis Capital Markets in
New York, who correctly predicted a 2007 rebound in oil. We
may see a pause in the rally, and that''s OK. Past the summer
doldrums, I think the rally picks up where we left off. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE)''s pneumonia vaccine, the
company''s fastest-growing drug by sales, was found effective in
two studies of adults over the age of 50, supporting the
company''s regulatory application to expand the product''s use. </p>
<p>The vaccine, Prevnar 13, produced a stronger immune
response against pneumococcal bacteria than an older vaccine
from Merck  Co. that''s currently recommended for adults 65 and
older, according to Emilio Emini, New York-based Pfizer''s head
of vaccine research. The results are being presented this week
at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious
Diseases in Milan. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s Prevnar is cleared for use in children up to 6
years of age. Sales of the vaccine, which includes Prevnar 13
and an older version called Prevnar 7, jumped 43 percent in the
first quarter to $1.15 billion from a year earlier. Pfizer, the
world''s biggest drugmaker, applied in December for U.S. approval
for older adults based on data from the two studies, and expects
a decision from U.S. regulators in October. </p>
<p>We''ve got the data to show that this gives rise to a very
good immune response, Emini said in a telephone interview.
The argument is that every adult, as they get older, needs to
get this vaccine. </p>
<p>Pfizer rose 5 cents to $20.60 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The stock has gained 25 percent in
the past 12 months. </p>
<p>About 50,000 people in the U.S. die from pneumonia in the
lungs and invasive infections of pneumococcal bacteria in the
bloodstream each year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Sales of Prevnar will exceed
$5.5 billion by 2015, according to the average estimate of four
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>30-Year-old Vaccine </p>
<p>A different form of pneumonia shot, called a polyvalent
polysaccharide vaccine, was first approved more than 30 years
ago and is now sold by Whitehouse Station, New Jersey-based
Merck as Pneumovax, with $376 million in sales last year. That
type of vaccine, which trains the immune system to fight 23
strains of pneumococcal bacteria, isn''t recommended for most
children because their immune systems don''t respond to it. In
adults, its protection wanes with time, and booster shots become
increasingly less effective, Emini said. </p>
<p>Prevnar attaches immune-boosting antigens to protein
carriers designed to trigger a stronger and longer-lasting
response than previous vaccines. </p>
<p>Pfizer compared Prevnar 13 to Pneumovax in a study of 938
patients ages 70 and older who had received a pneumonia shot
five years previously. Patients who were given a follow-up shot
of Prevnar 13 had significantly higher levels of antibodies in
their blood for 11 strains of pneumococcal bacteria and similar
levels for 2 strains. Prevnar 13 doesn''t protect against 10
additional rare strains that are covered by Pneumovax. A second
shot of Prevnar 13 a year later showed a similar immune system
response. </p>
<p>Pneumonia Susceptibility </p>
<p>At age 50, people become more susceptible to pneumonia.
However, Merck''s shot isn''t approved for the age group. Because
its effectiveness fades with time, doctors reserve it for people
over age 65, who are most vulnerable to infection. Pfizer aims
to target adults beginning at age 50, because patients respond
to each booster of Prevnar 13 as well as if it were their first
shot, Emini said. </p>
<p>In the second study, Prevnar 13 successfully created
antibodies in 404 patients ages 50 to 59 who had never received
a pneumonia vaccine. The company is now studying how often
adults would need booster shots to maintain protection, Emini
said. </p>
<p>Never Vaccinated </p>
<p>In a separate arm of that study, Prevnar 13 was compared
with Merck''s shot in 835 patients ages 60 through 64 who had
never been vaccinated. Prevnar 13 was more effective at mounting
a response to 9 types of the bacteria and at least as good as
Pneumovax with the four remaining strains. </p>
<p>Today''s studies measure bacteria-fighting antibodies in the
blood. Pfizer is also conducting a test in 85,000 adults in the
Netherlands to prove the drug reduces cases of pneumonia.
Results of that study may not be available for several years,
Emini said. The company earlier agreed with regulators that the
antibody studies being presented in Milan may be sufficient to
gain initial approval while the company awaits results from the
larger study of pneumonia cases. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world''s biggest
theme-park operator, said second-quarter profit fell 1.2
percent, missing estimates, as a shrinking box-office, a park
shortfall and the Japanese tsunami overshadowed gains in TV. </p>
<p>Net income decreased to $942 million, or 49 cents a share,
in the quarter ended April 2, from $953 million, or 48 cents, a
year earlier, Burbank, California-based Disney said today in a
statement. Profit missed the 58-cent average of 14 analysts''
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Profit at Disney''s theme-park unit, which collects
licensing revenue from the resort in Tokyo, fell by 3.3 percent
following the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. U.S. parks were
hurt by this year''s later Easter break. The Disney film studio
failed to match last year''s results from Alice in
Wonderland, with income down 65 percent. </p>
<p>The noisy elements, the studio and Japan, clearly were
the problem and they are hard to predict, said Matthew
Harrigan, a Wunderlich Securities analyst in Denver who
recommends investors buy Disney shares. The good news is that
the core of this company, ESPN and its TV business, still
performed very well. </p>
<p>Advance bookings at Disney parks are down 2.5 percent from
a year earlier, Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said on a
conference call. </p>
<p>Room rates have increased by a double-digit percentage,
reflecting Disney''s decision to phase out discounts as the
economy improves, Rasulo said. Excluding the impact of the
timing of the Easter holiday, domestic theme park attendance
increased by 2 percent from a year earlier, he said. </p>
<p>Mars Needs Moms'' </p>
<p>Disney fell $1.23, or 2.8 percent, to $42.68 in extended
trading. The shares rose 81 cents to $43.91 at 4 p.m. in New

this year. </p>

studio. The film cost $150 million to make and generated $20.9
million in U.S. ticket sales, according to Harrigan. Last year,
DVD sales benefited from Pixar''s film Up. </p>
<p>Disney''s total sales rose 5.8 percent to $9.08 billion,
trailing the $9.19 billion average of 20 analysts'' estimates.
Revenue was $8.58 billion a year earlier. </p>
<p>Our revenue was up nicely but we had $170 million of
factors, basically, that had an impact on where we were and
where the Street thought we would be in terms of our earnings,
Robert Iger, Disney''s president and chief executive officer,
said in an interview on CNBC. </p>
<p>Network Revenue </p>
<p>Revenue at Disney''s media networks increased 12 percent to
$4.32 billion, buoyed by advertising and affiliate revenue at
cable networks such as ESPN. Profit rose 17 percent to $1.52
billion, with cable earnings up 15 percent. </p>
<p>ABC broadcasting posted a 4.5 percent increase in revenue
to $1.5 billion on advertising growth and higher affiliate fees.
Profit gained 36 percent to $167 million. </p>
<p>Profit in consumer products increased 6.8 percent to $142
million as sales expanded 5 percent to $626 million. </p>
<p>Disney''s Interactive unit saw its loss more than double to
$115 million on a 2.6 percent gain in revenue. Results included
a $34 million cost linked to how the company accounts for the
purchase of Playdom, Iger said. </p>
<p>The company will continue to take charges for the 2010
acquisition of the social game startup. </p>
<p>That was unexpected and we''d like to hear more about
that, said Robin Diedrich, an analyst with St. Louis-based
Edward Jones  Co., who recommends investors buy Disney. But
it''s a small segment of the company. The main segments --
advertising and its parks -- are doing well. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, cut its estimated losses from legal
claims by 21 percent in the first quarter. </p>
<p>The bank''s reasonably possible losses from lawsuits
dropped to $2.7 billion as of March 31 from $3.4 billion at the
end of 2010, according to its quarterly filing today with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>
<p>The estimate, the second of its kind disclosed by the firm,
is the upper end of losses in matters where the risk is
more than remote but less than likely, New York-based
Goldman Sachs said in the filing. </p>
<p>Banks started releasing estimates of possible losses after
the SEC told corporate finance chiefs in October that they
should disclose such costs when there is at least a reasonable
possibility that they may be incurred, even if the risk is too
low to require reserves. Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the biggest U.S.
lender, has said legal and regulatory matters may cost $150
million to $1.6 billion beyond what it has reserved. </p>
<p>Staff at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission advised
Goldman Sachs Execution  Clearing LP, known as GSEC, that they
intend to recommend legal action against the unit related to its
role as clearing broker for a broker-dealer, the company
disclosed in today''s filing. </p>
<p>The CFTC staff alleges that GSEC knew or should have
known that the client''s sub-accounts maintained at GSEC were
accounts belonging to customers of the broker-dealer and not the
broker-dealer''s own accounts, according to the filing. </p>
<p>Subpoenas Omitted </p>
<p>The filing also included a reference to subpoenas that
Goldman Sachs and certain affiliates received from regulators
regarding sales of collateralized debt obligations, including
the firm''s Abacus 2007-AC1 deal. The company''s last quarterly
filing, its annual report on March 1, disclosed that it received
requests for information, omitting mention of the subpoenas. </p>
<p>In July, Goldman Sachs paid $550 million to settle a
lawsuit filed by the SEC that accused the firm of misleading
investors in the Abacus CDO. A U.S. Senate subcommittee report
on the financial crisis that used Goldman Sachs as a case study
accused the firm of misleading investors about some CDOs. The
report was referred to the Department of Justice and the SEC. </p>
<p>Washington Mutual </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs was among underwriters of securities
offerings by Washington Mutual Inc. (WAMUQ) that were accused in an Aug.
5, 2008, lawsuit of failing to accurately describe Washington
Mutual''s exposure to mortgage-related activities. Federal
regulators seized Washington Mutual on Sept. 25, 2008. The
parties reached a settlement in principle on March 30 that
would require Goldman Sachs to contribute to a settlement fund,
the firm disclosed today. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs said it has reserved the full amount of its
proposed contribution, without disclosing how much that is.
Goldman Sachs underwrote about $520 million of Washington Mutual
securities that are subject to the complaint, the company said. </p>
<p>At Goldman Sachs''s annual shareholder meeting on May 6,
General Counsel Gregory K. Palm said that the firm spent $726
million on legal fees last year and that it employs 286 full-
time lawyers, up from 252 a year ago. </p>

<p>Cogentrix Energy LLC, a unit of
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), received a $90.6 million conditional
loan guarantee from the U.S. Energy Department to build a solar
plant in Colorado. </p>
<p>The 30-megawatt Alamosa Solar Generating Project will use
concentrating photovoltaic technology that focuses the sun''s
rays to increase output, according to a statement today from the
Energy Department. </p>
<p>The concentrating solar plant near the city of Alamosa will
have optical equipment and multijunction solar cells from Amonix
Inc. that boost conversion efficiency to about 40 percent, or
nearly double that of conventional photovoltaic panels, the
agency said. It will also use a dual-axis tracking system to
follow the sun''s movement throughout the day and maximize power
production. </p>
<p>Public Service Co. of Colorado, an Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL)
utility, will purchase all of the generated electricity, which
is expected to be enough to power more than 6,500 homes. </p>
<p>Cogentrix operates 17 power plants in the U.S. and one in
Turkey, fueled mainly by natural gas and coal. It expanded into
solar with the February 2009 purchase of two solar-thermal
facilities in Daggett, California, that have 43 megawatts of

<p>Morgan Stanley and Hess Energy
Trading Co., also known as Hetco, failed to buy North Sea
Forties for a second day even after they raised their bids.
Glencore International AG sought to buy a Urals cargo in the
Mediterranean without success. </p>
<p>Daily exports of the four North Sea crude grades that
determine the price of Dated Brent are scheduled to rise 4.6
percent in June from this month, according to loading programs
obtained by Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>North Sea </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley failed to buy a cargo of Forties for loading
May 26 to June 1 at 50 cents a barrel above Dated Brent, up from
its bid of a 45-cent premium, according to a survey of traders
and brokers monitoring the daily Platts trading window. </p>
<p>Hetco was unable to buy a consignment for May 29 to June 1
at 40 cents more than Dated Brent, 10 cents above its bid
yesterday, the survey showed. </p>
<p>Reported North Sea market activity typically occurs during
the Platts window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Prior to
the window, Forties loading 10 to 21 days in the future cost 55
cents more than Dated Brent, compared with 52 cents yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Brent for June settlement traded at $117.38 a barrel on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the
window, up from $113.03 yesterday. The July contract was at
$116.88, 50 cents less than June. </p>
<p>Combined shipments of Brent, Forties, Oseberg and Ekofisk
grades will total 32.5 million barrels, or 1.08 million barrels
a day, next month, loading programs showed. That compares with
32.1 million barrels, or 1.04 million barrels a day, in May. </p>
<p>Exports of Forties for June will total 24 cargoes, one more
than this month, according to a loading program obtained by
Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>Mediterranean/Urals </p>
<p>No bids or offers were made for Urals in the Mediterranean.
In northwest Europe, Glencore failed to buy 100,000 metric tons
of Urals for May 20 to May 24 at $2.95 below Dated Brent, the
survey showed. The grade was last sold at a discount of $3.25 to
Dated Brent on May 5. </p>

<p>Morgans Hotel Group Co. (MHGC), the New
York-based operator of boutique hotels including the Royalton
and Mondrian, plans to add properties in such places as Paris,
Brazil and London, Chief Executive Officer Michael Gross said. </p>
<p>We want to be in key gateway cities, and we want to be
global, Gross said in an interview. We have good existing
penetration in the U.S. in some of the markets we''re in, but I
look at our footprint in Europe, such as London, and it is an
open slate for us. </p>
<p>Morgans, which has been selling some properties and using
the proceeds to expand its management operations, plans to
target gateway cities in Europe and South America, Gross said.
The company said last month that it''s selling hotels in New York
and Los Angeles, which it will continue to run. </p>
<p>Our asset sales have created financial flexibility,
said Gross, who was appointed CEO in March. Now that we''ve
sold these three properties, we have the luxury to really be
able to be patient and much more in control of our destiny. </p>
<p>Morgans sold the Mondrian Los Angeles, a 237-room hotel on
Sunset Boulevard that was developed by Ian Schrager, to
Pebblebrook Hotel Trust (PEB) for $137 million. Last month, it agreed
to sell the Royalton and Morgans hotels in New York to Felcor
Lodging Trust Inc. (FCH) for $140 million. </p>
<p>Morgans -- which also manages the Hudson hotel in New York,
the Delano South Beach in Miami and the Clift in San Francisco -
- will continue to pursue its asset-light strategy, Gross
said. The company is willing to acquire hotel stakes as part of
its expansion, he said. </p>
<p>In London, Morgans already operates the luxury St. Martins
Lane and Sanderson hotels. </p>

<p>Electric cars and trucks may help the
U.K. cope with erratic renewable power generation by recharging
when demand is low and supplying the network when demand is
high, the country''s grid operator said. </p>
<p>Electric vehicles may be able to balance 6 to 10 percent of
the nation''s power needs by 2020 and lower demand on fossil
fuels as backup, National Grid Plc (NG/) said in a report released
today in partnership with Ricardo Plc (RCDO), a U.K. maker of fuel-
efficient cars. The annual return to the car owner would be
around 50 pounds ($82), the companies said. </p>
<p>Britain, aiming to get 15 percent of its energy from
renewable sources by 2020, is planning $120 billion of offshore
wind projects as well as gas and nuclear plants to replace aging
generators. A surge in renewable energy projects, which is more
variable than traditional power sources, will boost the need for
back-up generators and management of energy usage, authors
including Neil Downing and Ben Smith said in the report. </p>
<p>Great Britain''s electricity grid is a highly meshed
network, the authors said. The overriding principle of
operation of the Great Britain electricity network -- and any
other large scale network -- is to match electricity supply
precisely to consumer demand on a second-by-second basis. </p>
<p>In fiscal year 2010, National Grid spent 270 million pounds
on so-called reserve services, the report said. These services,
which can supply energy within 2 seconds and 20 minutes
depending on how long they are required, are needed to manage
variations in usage and to handle unplanned events like power
plant failures. </p>
<p>Reverse Charging </p>
<p>Grid operators use demand-side management to trim usage
when there is a surge in energy use or a sudden drop in supply.
Electric car owners could be paid a fee if they are willing to
refrain from charging at times of high usage. In the future,
cars may supply power stored in their batteries to the grid when
they''re not in use. </p>
<p>Plug-in vehicles may be able to work in synergy with the
electricity market to smooth the daily demand profile, the
author said. This may help reduce the need to meet additional
balancing requirements by simply running more conventional''
generation and potentially incurring additional carbon dioxide
emissions. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the U.S.
bank that makes more than half its revenue from trading, lost
money in that business on one day during the first quarter, its
best record since posting zero days of losses a year ago. </p>
<p>After losing money on 13 days in the fourth quarter,
Goldman Sachs''s traders lost between $25 million and $50 million
on one occasion in the first quarter, according to the New York-
based firm''s quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. They generated more than $100 million on 32 days out
of 62 total days, the filing showed. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s performance beats Morgan Stanley (MS), whose
traders lost money on three days and made more than $100 million
on 10 days, according to a filing yesterday. It falls short of
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC), which both
reported zero days of losses in the quarter. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, said
last month that revenue from securities trading fell 22 percent
from a year earlier to $6.65 billion, although it climbed 83
percent from the fourth quarter. Last year, President and Chief
Operating Officer Gary D. Cohn said infrequent daily trading
losses are evidence that the firm doesn''t rely on making bets
with its own money. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs reported zero days of trading losses during
the first quarter of last year, the first such perfect quarter
in the firm''s history. It reported 10 such days in the second
quarter and two for the third quarter. </p>
<p>During 2010, Bank of America, the biggest U.S. bank by
assets, had perfect quarters in the first and third quarters,
while JPMorgan, the second-biggest, had three perfect quarters. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s figures may not be directly comparable with
other banks'' because they also include market risk besides
trading, such as principal transactions in its chief investment
office and some mortgage fees and hedges. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs said its trading risks didn''t exceed the
firm''s value-at-risk limit, a measure of how much the company
could lose in the securities markets in one day, during the
quarter. Average value-at-risk was $113 million in the quarter. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world''s biggest
theme-park operator, fell the most in two years after second-
quarter profit missed estimates, as a shrinking box-office, a
park shortfall and the Japanese tsunami overshadowed TV gains. </p>
<p>Disney, based in Burbank, California, dropped $2.39, or 5.4
percent, to $41.52 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading, the biggest decline since March 2009. The
stock has gained 11 percent this year. </p>
<p>Profit at Disney''s theme-park unit, which collects
licensing fees from the Tokyo resort, fell 3.3 percent in the
wake of the March 11 disaster. U.S. parks were hurt by this
year''s later Easter break. The film studio failed to match last
year''s results from Alice in Wonderland, with income down 65
percent on box-office letdowns such as Mars Needs Moms. </p>
<p>The noisy elements, the studio and Japan, clearly were
the problem and they are hard to predict, said Matthew Harrigan, a Wunderlich Securities analyst in Denver who
recommends investors buy Disney shares. The good news is that
the core of this company, ESPN and its TV business, still
performed very well. </p>
<p>Net income decreased 1.2 percent to $942 million, or 49
cents a share, in the quarter ended April 2, from $953 million,
or 48 cents, a year earlier, Disney said yesterday in a
statement. Earnings missed the 58-cent average of 14 analysts''
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The rise in earnings per share
reflects stock buybacks. </p>
<p>Park Bookings </p>
<p>Advance bookings at Disney parks are down 2.5 percent from
a year earlier, Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said on a
conference call. </p>
<p>Room rates have increased by a double-digit percentage,
reflecting the decision to phase out discounts as the economy
improves, Rasulo said. Excluding the impact of the timing of the
Easter holiday, domestic theme park attendance increased by 2
percent from a year earlier, he said. </p>
<p>The March 11 film release Mars Needs Moms cost $150
million to make and generated $20.9 million in U.S. ticket
sales, according to Harrigan. Last year, Disney''s home
entertainment sales benefited from Pixar''s movie Up. So far
this year, industry DVD sales are down at least 20 percent,
according to an industry group. </p>
<p>Disney''s total sales rose 5.8 percent to $9.08 billion,
trailing the $9.19 billion average of 20 analysts'' estimates.
Revenue was $8.58 billion a year earlier. </p>
<p>Factors'' </p>
<p>Our revenue was up nicely but we had $170 million of
factors, basically, that had an impact on where we were and
where the Street thought we would be in terms of our earnings,
Robert Iger, Disney''s president and chief executive officer,
said in an interview on CNBC. </p>
<p>Revenue at Disney''s media networks increased 12 percent to
$4.32 billion, buoyed by advertising and affiliate revenue at
cable networks such as ESPN. Profit rose 17 percent to $1.52
billion, with cable earnings up 15 percent. </p>
<p>ABC broadcasting posted a 4.5 percent increase in revenue
to $1.5 billion on advertising growth and higher affiliate fees.
Profit gained 36 percent to $167 million. </p>
<p>Profit in consumer products increased 6.8 percent to $142
million as sales expanded 5 percent to $626 million. </p>
<p>Disney''s Interactive unit saw its loss more than double to
$115 million on a 2.6 percent gain in revenue. Results included
a $34 million cost linked to how the company accounts for the
purchase of Playdom, Iger said. </p>
<p>The company will continue to take charges for the 2010
acquisition of the social game startup. </p>
<p>That was unexpected and we''d like to hear more about

<p>Indonesia will probably spend $250
billion on infrastructure development in the next five years,
investments that will spur the economy and ease bottlenecks that
have crimped growth, according to Morgan Stanley. </p>
<p>Public and private investment in infrastructure may be
equivalent to 5.9 percent of gross domestic product in 2015,
from 3.9 percent in 2009, Morgan Stanley economist Deyi Tan
wrote in a May 10 report. That will boost growth to 7.2 percent
by 2015, she said. </p>
<p>Indonesia is one step away from its first investment grade
rating in more than a decade as President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono targets growth of as much as 6.6 percent through the
remainder of his term ending in 2014. He plans to double
spending on roads, ports and airports to $140 billion by then
after inadequate infrastructure hampered growth. </p>
<p>Reforms have been building to a critical mass and
broadening out over the past five years, Tan said in a phone
interview in Singapore yesterday. The macro environment now is
also a lot more supportive compared to a few years ago, she
said. </p>
<p>Standard  Poor''s, which boosted Indonesia''s debt rating to
BB+ last month with a positive outlook, says infrastructure
shortfalls are among key obstacles to achieving higher growth.

million households have no access to electricity, Tan said. </p>
<p>Toll Roads </p>
<p>During Yudhoyono''s first five-year term, only 125
kilometers (78 miles) of toll roads were built. In China, 4,719
kilometers of expressways were added in 2009 alone. Indonesia
aims to build 20,000 kilometers of roads and add 15,000
megawatts of power generation by 2014. </p>
<p>We think sectors such as electricity and roads are likely
to see more increases in spending than others due to a
relatively more developed pace of reforms and comparatively
greater government focus in those areas, Tan said. </p>
<p>Banks, toll road operators and cement and steel companies
may benefit from the infrastructure spending, Hozefa Topiwalla,
a Morgan Stanley analyst in Singapore, said in a separate May 10
report. It has an overweight rating on PT Bank Rakyat
Indonesia, the nation''s largest bank by revenue, and PT
Indocement Tunggal Prakarsa, the nation''s second-largest cement
maker. </p>
<p>Investors from Japan and India in December and January
signed about $39 billion of accords for projects from mass rapid
transit systems and power plants to steel factories and ports.
South Korea''s Lotte Group said it may invest $5 billion in a
petrochemical project. </p>
<p>Indonesia''s improving public finances will enable the
government to take on a more active role in providing
infrastructure funding compared with six years ago, according to
Morgan Stanley. </p>
<p>With the public debt ratio having already fallen to 26.1
percent of GDP in 2010, one of the lowest in Asean, we think
there is scope to take fiscal deficits gradually higher in
support of infrastructure projects without jeopardizing public
balance sheet or liquidity conditions, Tan said. </p>
<p>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean,
refers to a regional group of 10 economies that include
Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore. </p>

<p>Dozens of General Motors Co. (GM)
executive retirees sued the company contending they suffered
loss of benefits after the automaker''s bankruptcy. </p>
<p>The pensioners, including former GM Vice President John G. Middlebrook, are asking a judge to rule that the company
violated the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act and
order it to pay past-due benefits with interest, plus legal fees
and expenses. </p>
<p>In erroneously administering the retirement plan, GM
contravenes the plain text of the contract, lawyers for the
executives said May 9 in a complaint filed in federal court in
Detroit. Denial of benefits constitutes an abuse of the
discretion provided in the plan, and is arbitrary and
capricious, the lawyers said. </p>
<p>GM, based in Detroit, filed the third-largest bankruptcy in
history in June 2009. The U.S. Treasury provided billions of
dollars in loans that converted into equity. </p>
<p>Sacrifices were made by every stakeholder, including
former executives, to create a foundation upon which the new GM
can thrive, James Cain, a company spokesman, said in a
telephone interview. He said the pension plan administrator
properly considered and denied the claims. </p>
<p>In a Nov. 23 letter included in court filings, plaintiffs''
lawyers allege that under a modified retirement plan, only
benefits of more than $100,000 a year are to be reduced by two-
thirds, and not benefits under $100,000. </p>
<p>In response, plan administrator Janice K. Uhlig wrote on
Feb. 8 that GM properly interpreted life-annuity reductions
under the U.S. bankruptcy code and she has the discretionary
authority to construe, interpret, apply and administer the
retirement plan. </p>
<p>GM rose 14 cents to $31.75 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading at 10:06 a.m. The shares have declined
14 percent this year. </p>
<p>The case is Tate v. General Motors LLC, 2:11-cv-12028, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Michigan (Detroit). </p>

<p>Pasquale Diana, a London-based
economist at Morgan Stanley, comments on Hungarian inflation and
interest rates. </p>
<p>The inflation rate rose to 4.7 percent in April from 4.5
percent the previous month, the statistics office in Budapest
said today. The April figure matched the December rate, the
highest since June. </p>
<p>Diana made the comments in an e-mail to clients. </p>
<p>On the inflation figure: </p>
<p>The reading was in line with our and consensus
expectations. The breakdown shows continued pressures from food
prices. On our clean core'' measure, which strips out all food
prices from core, pressures were more benign. </p>
<p>On the outlook for inflation: </p>
<p>Market services prices, a key gauge of demand pressures,
look contained, but the overall breakdown suggests to us that
the inflation threat has not diminished. We think that the
National Bank of Hungary projection for disinflation in the
coming quarters is correct in terms of direction, but it is too
ambitious in terms of scope for inflation to fall. We forecast
inflation to average 4.6 percent this year (NBH: 4 percent) and
3.9 percent in 2012 (NBH: 3.4 percent). </p>
<p>On the outlook for interest rates: </p>
<p>We continue to believe that the next move in rates is
more likely to be up than down, though any hikes will probably
be delayed until late this year. </p>

<p>Ecuadoreans whose $18 billion verdict
against Chevron Corp. (CVX) in their country was put on hold by a U.S.
judge won an appeals court ruling they say will allow them to
raise money to enforce the judgment at a later date. </p>
<p>A three-judge panel in New York today granted a request to
partially lift a lower-court order that restrained the
Ecuadorean residents'' efforts to enforce the Feb. 14 judgment
over environmental damage to the Amazon River basin. The court
refused the Ecuadorean plaintiffs'' request to put on hold a
lawsuit Chevron filed against them now pending in federal court
in Manhattan. </p>
<p>The panel also said it would expedite the schedule for
hearing the appeal of the restraining order, which blocked the
Ecuadoreans from trying to collect the judgment in a U.S. or
foreign court anywhere in the world. </p>
<p>The appeals court said the plaintiffs aren''t restrained by
the lower-court order other than commencing, prosecuting or
receiving benefit from recognition, enforcement, or prejudgment
seizure or attachment proceedings. </p>
<p>The appeals court''s decision allows the Ecuadoreans to meet
with their American lawyers and raise money to enforce the
judgment in the oil-cleanup lawsuit at a later date, Karen Hinton, a spokeswoman for the plaintiffs, said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>All Key Respects'' </p>
<p>Justin Higgs, a Chevron spokesman, said the company is
pleased with today''s ruling, which he said keeps the lower
court''s order in place in all key respects, and rejects the
defendants'' efforts to derail the November 2011 trial on the
enforceability of the fraudulent Ecuadorean judgment. </p>
<p>This injunction was never about whether denying the
defendants the right to communicate with their clients or
fundraise, Higgs said in an e-mail. It was about preventing
them from furthering enforcement proceedings and financially
benefiting from them, which the Second Circuit has now affirmed
they cannot do. </p>
<p>The appeals court case is Chevron Corp. v. Hugo Gerardo
Camacho Naranjo, 11-1150, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second

<p>Wall Street conventional wisdom holds
that a sterling reputation is crucial to winning business and
keeping clients. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) may be the exception,
according to a new Bloomberg survey. </p>
<p>Fifty-four percent of respondents to the global poll of
traders, investors and analysts conducted May 9-10 have an
unfavorable opinion of the New York-based bank, more than double
the negative rating for JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Yet a month after a
U.S. Senate report said Goldman Sachs misled clients, 78 percent
of those surveyed said the accusations will either have no
effect on the firm or will harm its reputation without driving
away customers. </p>
<p>Investors will continue to put their money with capable
institutions, regardless of their history or morality, said an
e-mail from poll participant Christian Contino, 27, who works as
a consultant for the investment-management section of the United
Nations'' International Fund for Agricultural Development. The
bank has very capable spin doctors who will be able to
downplay any negativity. </p>
<p>Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for the company, declined to
comment on the poll results and reactions. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd C. Blankfein, survived the financial crisis, unlike some
smaller rivals, and has been a target of criticism ever since.
The bank, the fifth-biggest in the U.S. by assets, agreed to pay
$550 million last year to settle a suit filed by the Securities
and Exchange Commission that alleged Goldman Sachs misled buyers
of a mortgage-linked investment the firm created in 2007. </p>
<p>Housing Bets </p>
<p>The Senate''s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, led
by Michigan Democrat Carl M. Levin, used Goldman Sachs as a case
study in its two-year examination of the financial crisis. When
the subcommittee released its 640-page report last month, Levin
said that Goldman Sachs misled clients and Congress about the
firm''s bets on the housing market. </p>
<p>The testimony we gave was truthful and accurate and this
is confirmed by the subcommittee''s own report, Lucas van Praag, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, said at the time. </p>
<p>It seems unlikely that Goldman Sachs has to expect
further consequences, said an e-mail from Daniel Horak, 26, a
trader at Erste Sparinvest KAG in Vienna, Austria, who replied
in the poll that he had a mostly unfavorable view of the
firm and that he didn''t expect Goldman Sachs to lose customers. </p>
<p>Levin and Oklahoma Senator Thomas A. Coburn, the
subcommittee''s ranking Republican, formally referred their
report to the Department of Justice and the Securities and
Exchange Commission, which are reviewing the findings. </p>
<p>Impact on Reputation </p>
<p>The company was viewed less favorably than other banks by
the 1,263 poll respondents. While 54 percent said they had an
unfavorable view of Goldman Sachs, 25 percent felt the same
about JPMorgan, 49 percent for Citigroup Inc. (C) and 48 percent for
Bank of America Corp. (BAC) Thirty-five percent had an unfavorable
view of Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), which was also singled
out in the U.S. Senate subcommittee report. </p>
<p>Blankfein, 56, has tried to burnish Goldman Sachs''s image.
After the SEC filed its lawsuit last year, he established a
committee to study the firm''s business standards. The
committee''s report in January made 39 recommendations, including
changing financial disclosures and providing simpler
explanations to clients about conflicts of interest. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs also began an advertising campaign in
September that emphasizes the firm''s role in job creation and
alternative energy. </p>
<p>Confidence Business'' </p>
<p>We have to regain the trust of the public, we have no
choice, Blankfein said in an interview with Fareed Zakaria
that aired on CNN on May 2, 2010, according to a transcript.
We can''t survive without people thinking well of us, he
said, because our business is a confidence business. </p>
<p>The firm''s shares dropped $5.13, or 3.5 percent, to $142.75
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, their lowest
closing price since Sept. 2. The price remains below the $184.27
close on April 15, 2010, the day before the SEC filed its
lawsuit. Richard Bove, an analyst at Rochdale Securities LLC,
recommended today that investors sell Goldman Sachs shares,
citing increased pressure on the U.S. Justice Department to
bring criminal charges against the firm. </p>
<p>Thirty-six percent of respondents said they were
generally bullish on Goldman Sachs stock six months from
now, while 32 percent were generally bearish. The rest had
no opinion. That divided sentiment is about where it was in June
2010. </p>
<p>Very Supportive'' </p>
<p>The company''s profit slid 38 percent last year as revenue
tumbled. Goldman Sachs ranks third this year among advisers on
global takeovers after coming in second during 2010, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Our shareholders, our clients, have been very, very
supportive, Blankfein said in the CNN interview. They know
the essence of who we are, and frankly I think we still enjoy a
reputation with those -- a good reputation with those key
constituent groups. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs was 25th, two notches below JPMorgan Chase,
in an annual ranking of the world''s most admired companies by
Fortune magazine. The results are based on a survey of top
executives and directors from Fortune 1000 companies, Global 50
companies and other major non-U.S. companies, as well as
financial analysts, between October and December, according to
the Hay Group, which conducts the survey. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s connections with government officials were
cited by some respondents to the Bloomberg survey as a reason
the firm is unlikely to be affected by the Senate report. </p>
<p>Goldman''s Alumni </p>
<p>The regulatory capture by the likes of Goldman Sachs is a
done deal -- it is an open secret that GS alum spread through
the tentacles of public office, said Arijit Banik, 42, a
senior manager in economics, pensions and hedging for RBC Dexia
in Toronto, in an e-mail. The firm remains an inexorable cog
in the machinery of campaign financing in the U.S. electoral
system, where money talks. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs and its employees donated $31.4 million to
U.S. political parties between 1989 and 2010, more than any
other financial institution and the fourth-highest amount of any
organization, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a
Washington research group. </p>
<p>The UN fund''s Contino, who like 32 percent of poll
respondents said he had a favorable view of Goldman Sachs, was
also among the 42 percent who think that Blankfein will remain
chairman a year from now. Twenty-seven percent didn''t think
Blankfein would still have the job in a year and 31 percent had
no opinion. </p>
<p>Lloyd Blankfein has done a great job over the past five
years, Contino said. If there has to be a fall guy, it won''t
be him. </p>
<p>Main Street Ire </p>
<p>Noah Shapiro, director of risk management at Optim Energy
LLC in Irving, Texas, was one of the poll respondents who said
Blankfein won''t be chairman in a year. </p>
<p>Goldman has significantly drawn the ire of Main Street as
being the poster child of the inexorable greed that fomented the
credit crisis, Shapiro, 34, said. Blankfein will need to
fall on his sword as not only the head of Goldman Sachs, but
also as a chief luminary on the Street, to blot away the stain
of manipulative financial engineering. </p>
<p>The quarterly Bloomberg Global Poll of investors, traders
and analysts who are Bloomberg subscribers was conducted by
Selzer  Co., a Des Moines, Iowa-based firm. It has a margin of
error of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points. </p>
<p>Opinions on Goldman Sachs are the same the world around,
with very little difference across the U.S., Europe or Asia,
said J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer  Co. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) closed at
its lowest level in more than eight months after an analyst told
investors to sell the stock on concern that the Department of
Justice faces growing pressure to bring claims against the firm. </p>
<p>The bank dropped $5.13, or 3.5 percent, to $142.75 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading, the biggest decline since
a 4.7 percent decrease on Jan. 19. The last time the stock
closed lower was Sept. 2. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, was
one of three banks singled out last month in a report on the
financial crisis by the U.S. Senate''s Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations. The panel, whose findings were referred to the
Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission,
said Goldman Sachs misled clients about its bets on mortgage-
related investments. </p>
<p>It now appears that the pressure on the Justice
Department to bring a criminal lawsuit against Goldman is
building to a high pitch, Richard X. Bove, an analyst at
Rochdale Securities LLC, said in a note today to investors. </p>
<p>Stephen Cohen, a spokesman at New York-based Goldman Sachs,
declined to comment on Bove''s note and the stock price decline. </p>
<p>Bove, who is based in Lutz, Florida, is one of two analysts
with a negative rating on Goldman Sachs, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The other is Christopher Wheeler, a
London-based analyst for Mediobanca SpA. Of 28 analysts
surveyed, 17 recommend that investors buy the stock and nine
call for holding it. </p>
<p>Vampire Squid'' </p>
<p>Bove cited a new article by writer Matt Taibbi in Rolling
Stone magazine that says the Justice Department should
criminally charge Goldman Sachs based on the subcommittee''s
report. In a 2009 story for Rolling Stone, Taibbi wrote an
article about Goldman Sachs that labeled the firm a great
vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity. </p>
<p>The new Matt Taibbi article in Rolling Stone magazine is
another all-out attack on the company, Bove wrote in today''s
note. However, this time the attack is backed by a 650-page
report signed by both a Democrat and a Republican. </p>
<p>Goldman''s Cohen also declined to comment on Taibbi''s
article. </p>
<p>Attorney General Eric H. Holder, testifying before the
House Judiciary Committee on May 3, confirmed that his
department is reviewing the Senate''s report, which was led by
Michigan Democrat Carl M. Levin and Oklahoma Republican Thomas A. Coburn. </p>
<p>Not Losing Sleep'' </p>
<p>The department is looking right now at the report
prepared by Senator Levin''s subcommittee that deals with Goldman
Sachs, he said. </p>
<p>When the report was released, Goldman Sachs said it never
misled anyone about its behavior. The testimony we gave was
truthful and accurate and this is confirmed by the
subcommittee''s own report, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, Lucas van Praag, said at the time. </p>
<p>Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein who
recommends that investors buy Goldman Sachs stock, said he
doesn''t share Bove''s concerns about the political risk to
Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>At this point, I''m not losing sleep over more theater
from within the Beltway, Hintz said in an e-mailed reply to
questions. GS remains the leading investment bank in the
world. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley failed to buy North
Sea Forties after a purchase yesterday. Vitol Group sold a cargo
of Urals for delivery in the Mediterranean at a higher price. </p>
<p>A total of three cargoes of Forties crude were dropped from
the export program for June, according to a revised shipping
schedule obtained by Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>North Sea </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley didn''t manage to buy a cargo of Forties for
loading May 28 to June 3 at 50 cents a barrel above Dated Brent,
according to a survey of traders and brokers monitoring the
daily Platts trading window. The New York-based bank yesterday
bought a shipment at 65 cents more than the benchmark. Statoil
ASA was unable to purchase a consignment for June 1 to June 3 at
a premium of 40 cents to Dated Brent, the survey showed. </p>
<p>Reported North Sea market activity typically occurs during
the Platts window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Before
the window, Forties loading in 10 to 21 days cost 67 cents more
than Dated Brent, the most since April 12, compared with 55
cents yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Brent for June settlement traded at $112.31 a barrel on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the
window, down from $115.32 yesterday. The July contract was at
$111.70, 61 cents less than June. </p>
<p>The shipments that were dropped are for loading in three-
day periods starting from June 11, June 13 and June 29, the plan
showed. Three other consignments originally scheduled for May
15, May 26 and May 29 were deferred to June. As a result, the
Forties program for the month will be unchanged at 24 cargoes.
Shipments for May will shrink to 20 lots from 27 after four
consignments were dropped last week, according to the programs. </p>
<p>North Sea Buzzard crude''s share in the Forties oil blend
fell to 18 percent last week, from 29 percent in the period to
May 1, BP Plc said today on its website. </p>
<p>BP is in talks to connect 15 more fields to its Forties
Pipeline System in the North Sea, Peter Mather, BP''s head of
country for the U.K., said at a conference in London today. </p>
<p>Mediterranean/Urals </p>
<p>OAO Lukoil bought 100,000 metric tons of Urals for June 1
to June 5 delivery to the Mediterranean from Vitol at $2.90
barrel below Dated Brent, the survey showed. The grade last
traded at a discount of $3.90 on April 28. No bids or offers
were made for Urals in northwest Europe. </p>
<p>West Africa </p>
<p>Indian Oil Corp. was scheduled to award its second spot
tender for sweet crude for loading in June today and the outcome
is not available, said traders participating in the market. </p>
<p>Loading programs for Angolan and Nigerian crudes for July
are likely to be released next week, they said. </p>

<p>Morgan Crucible Co., the maker of
carbon materials for medical and transportation equipment, told
a U.K. court that Deutsche Bahn AG and 30 other European rail
companies waited too long to sue over a defunct graphite cartel. </p>
<p>The deadline for including Morgan Crucible in the lawsuit,
which seeks as much as 129 million pounds ($209.5 million),
expired sooner than for other cartel members because it
didn''t join their challenge to an earlier European Union fine,
the company''s lawyers said today at the Competition Appeal
Tribunal in London. The railway companies rejected the argument,
saying all of the cartel members are jointly liable for losses. </p>
<p>It''s clear that liability is joint and losses can be
recovered from any of the cartelists, the group''s lawyer, Jon
Turner of Monckton Chambers in London, said at the hearing.
Morgan Crucible''s participation sustained the cartel, he
said. </p>
<p>The price-fixing, which lasted from 1988 to 1999, caused
customers to pay too much for graphite-based goods used for
transferring electricity in train motors, the rail companies
have claimed. While Windsor, England-based Morgan Crucible won
immunity from EU fines by being the first to cooperate, its
former Chief Executive Officer Ian Norris was sentenced to 18
months in prison in a parallel U.S. case. </p>
<p>European Union regulators in 2003 levied fines totalling
101 million euros against four of the cartel''s five members, SGL
Carbon SE (SGL), France''s Carbone Lorraine SA, Austria''s Hoffmann 
Co. and Schunk GmbH. The railway companies'' lawyers have said
the case, filed in December, may be the most significant
claim of its kind in Europe. </p>
<p>Other customers in the U.K. case include Italian train
operator Trenitalia SpA, the Dutch railway company Nederlandse
Spoorwegen and the Portuguese state railway CP-Comboios de
Portugal EPE. The London-based train leasing company Angel
Trains Ltd. withdrew from the case without saying why. </p>
<p>The case is Deutsche Bahn AG  Others v. Morgan Crucible

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-
largest U.S. bank by assets, won a challenge at the European
Union''s highest court to have a collateralized-debt obligation
dispute over $112 million heard by U.K. courts. </p>
<p>Contractual disputes are mainly about a contract''s validity
and don''t need to be heard in the country where the party
challenging the validity of the deal is based, the EU Court of
Justice in Luxembourg ruled today. </p>
<p>The ruling relates to two cases at the Luxembourg-based EU
court over whether disputes between JPMorgan and the city of
Berlin''s transportation provider BVG about a 2007 derivatives
transaction should be heard in the U.K. or Germany. JPMorgan in
2008 sued BVG in the U.K., arguing the contract said any dispute
would be handled in British courts. In 2009, BVG sued JPMorgan
in Berlin seeking to annul what it called an invalid deal. </p>
<p>The decision may influence dozens of lawsuits over losses
on swap agreements between local governments and community-owned
utilities in the U.K., Germany and Italy on one hand, and banks
including UBS AG (UBSN), Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Depfa Bank Plc on
the other. While municipalities are increasingly filing suits at
home claiming they weren''t properly advised of risks or that
swaps were unlawfully settled, the banks are turning to U.K.
courts where they expect to get swifter rulings. </p>
<p>Enforceability'' </p>
<p>The decision underpins the framework of the commercial
system, though it''s certainly not helpful to those public bodies
that are trying to have their cases heard in their home courts
after agreeing to other jurisdictions in the contracts, said
Laurence Harris, a lawyer at Edwards Angell Palmer  Dodge LLP
in London. The ruling identifies what the dispute is really
about, which is the enforceability of the contract. </p>
<p>It would be contrary to the sound administration of
justice to confer exclusive jurisdiction for such disputes upon
the courts of the EU nation in which one of the contracting
companies has its seat, the court said in a 12-page ruling. </p>
<p>Under the agreement that prompted today''s case, JPMorgan
was insured by BVG against default on debt tied to 150
companies, including Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) In 2008,
following Lehman''s collapse and the financial market turmoil it
spurred, New York-based JPMorgan enforced the agreement and is
seeking $112 million from BVG. </p>
<p>BVG sought a decision that it doesn''t have to pay JPMorgan,
in light of what it called incorrect advice about the deal from
the bank. The U.K. and Berlin courts both asked for the EU
tribunal''s guidance on which held jurisdiction. </p>
<p>Haugesund, Narvik </p>
<p>Klaus Wazlak, a spokesman for BVG said in an e-mail the

<p>Wang Qing, Morgan Stanley''s chief
China economist in Hong Kong, comments on the People''s Bank of
China''s announcement today that it will raise banks'' reserve
requirement ratios by 50 basis points effective May 18. </p>
<p>On the reasons for the increase: </p>
<p>Inflation pressure remains strong so there is a need for
a policy move that can signal the central bank''s determination
to control inflation and the reserve ratio is a high profile
policy move for this purpose. </p>
<p>The pattern of increases in the reserve requirement ratio
is once a month and that will most likely continue as long as
inflation remains elevated. </p>
<p>Inflation may rebound in May and June and that would be a
good time for the PBOC to raise interest rates, which would be
an even stronger signal of its determination. </p>
<p>Wang estimates at least one more interest-rate increase in
the first half of this year. </p>
<p>On whether the central bank is concerned about a pickup in
lending: </p>
<p>If you look at the lending trend, it''s on track to reach
the target amount for the year of 7 trillion yuan to 7.5
trillion yuan. So this has less to do with bank lending and more
to do with the need to make a policy move to signal
determination to control inflation. </p>
<p>Wang forecasts inflation will average 4.5 percent this year
compared with the government''s target of 4 percent. </p>
<p>There is an upside risk to our forecast which we made at
the beginning of the year as commodity prices have registered a
much more pronounced increase than we envisaged. </p>
<p>On the outlook for growth amid government tightening: </p>
<p>When you tighten, the economy will slow down for sure and
the authorities are prepared for this. </p>
<p>The slowdown we''ve seen so far doesn''t indicate there is
a risk of a hard landing, that''s why the policy priority at the
moment is still to control inflation as we can see from the
statement issued at the end of the Strategic and Economic
Dialogue between U.S. and Chinese officials in Washington this
week. </p>
<p>We don''t think this is overtightening and clearly the
government doesn''t think so. Controlling inflation will
definitely entail a slowdown in growth and the authorities
understand that. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) plans to set
up a yuan-denominated private equity fund in China, according to
two people with knowledge of the matter, while Morgan Stanley (MS)
said it would announce a similar fund next week. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein attended a
ceremony for Goldman Sachs in Beijing today, the people said,
declining to be identified before an announcement. The bank and
its Chinese partner will seek to raise 5 billion yuan ($769
million), another person said. Morgan Stanley plans to hold an
event on May 18 to mark the start of its first yuan fund. </p>
<p>The U.S. banks would follow Blackstone (BX) Group LP and Carlyle
Group in raising funds to compete with local rivals including
Hony Capital Ltd. as China steps up efforts to develop its own
buyout firms and strengthen capital markets. Private-equity
investments in China jumped 40 percent to $19.7 billion last
year, according to the Asian Venture Capital Journal. </p>
<p>Regulatory-wise, it is still a bit cumbersome for the
foreign players, Johnson Chng, head of financial services at
Bain  Co. in Shanghai, said by telephone today. For some of
the industries, the foreign names may be deemed to be too
sensitive, such as in strategically important industries. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs will set up the Broad Street (Beijing) RMB
Fund, its first single-country pool of investment capital, with
Beijing State-Owned Capital Operation and Management Center, a
person said. Richard Friedman, head of merchant banking for
Goldman Sachs, was also at today''s ceremony, the person said. </p>
<p>Angela Yu, a Beijing-based spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs,
declined to comment. </p>
<h2>U.S. Limitations </h2>
<p>Blackstone, the world''s largest private-equity manager, in
2009 became the first global buyout firm to announce plans for a
local-currency fund in China, followed by TPG Inc. and Carlyle.
The three firms have announced plans to raise a combined 20
billion yuan ($3.1 billion) for such funds. </p>
<p>Blankfein, who is approaching his fifth anniversary as
Goldman Sachs''s chairman and CEO, is grappling with limits on
proprietary trading and investments in hedge funds and private-equity funds imposed by the U.S.''s Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul
law. The bank''s biggest businesses, trading and investing, are
also the ones most affected by new global capital requirements. </p>
<p>In China, Asia''s biggest private-equity market over the
past three years, foreign buyout firms are facing stiffer
competition from local rivals as former executives at Goldman
Sachs and Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. set up their own funds. </p>
<h2>Local Rivals </h2>
<p>CDB Capital, a unit of China Development Bank Corp., said
in December it plans to raise about 60 billion yuan from
domestic financial institutions for investment in private equity
funds. China International Capital Corp., Citic Securities Co.
and Haitong Securities Co. won approval to raise yuan-denominated funds for their private-equity units, the Securities
Times said in February, citing an unidentified person. </p>
<p>Foreign private-equity investors face restrictions on
buying assets in China, such as capital controls and limited
access to industries designated by the government as
strategically important. </p>
<p>Washington-based Carlyle Group, the world''s second-biggest
private-equity firm, formed an investment management venture
with Beijing State-owned Capital Operation and Management
Center, it said in July. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley and Hangzhou Industrial  Commercial Trust
Co. plan to hold an opening ceremony next week for their
private-equity venture in Hangzhou, according to an e-mailed
invitation for the event that was confirmed by Noel Cheung, a
spokeswoman for the New York-based bank. Hangzhou Industrial
executives couldn''t immediately be reached for comment. </p>

<p>Jim O''Neill, chairman of Goldman
Sachs Asset Management, said China''s inflation won''t be a
problem in the second half of this year and the government
will stop tightening policies as price gains moderate. </p>
<p>China''s economy is probably slowing down more than people
realize, O''Neill, who oversees $677 billion of assets and
coined the acronym BRIC for the economies of Brazil, Russia,
India and China, told reporters in Hong Kong today. Chinese
stocks may have a big rally in the second half if his
assessment is correct, he added. </p>
<p>Inflation stayed above 5 percent for a second month in
April, exceeding Premier Wen Jiabao''s 4 percent target, a
government report showed yesterday. Daiwa Capital Markets says
policy makers face a dilemma because of the risk that
measures to curb prices will lead to a slowdown in the world''s
fastest-growing major economy. </p>
<p>China''s expansion may slow to about 8 percent in June
through December, O''Neill said. The economy grew 9.7 percent in
the first quarter from a year earlier. </p>
<p>The People''s Bank of China has raised interest rates four
times since mid-October and reined in credit growth that surged
to a record in 2009. Inflation was an annual 5.3 percent in
April, while industrial production expanded 13.4 percent, the
least since November, yesterday''s report showed. </p>
<p>It''s not surprising at all, given the importance of China,
that commodities prices are under some pressure, O''Neill said.
Copper dropped to a five-month low today on concern that the
nation''s monetary tightening may continue. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)''s nine-year-old
antitrust agreement with the U.S. Justice Department, set to
expire today, permanently changed the software marketplace,
making it more open, fair and innovative, the agency said. </p>
<p>The final judgment in the Microsoft case, in effect since
2002, prevented the company from using its monopoly Windows
operating system for personal computing to quash competition,
the department said yesterday in a statement. </p>
<p>The court''s decree helped create competitive conditions
that enabled new kinds of products, such as cloud computing
services and mobile devices, to develop as potential platform
threats to the Windows desktop operating system, the
department said. </p>
<p>The Justice Department, joined by 19 states and the
District of Columbia, sued Microsoft in 1998, alleging the
company unlawfully protected its Windows monopoly by keeping
computer makers from promoting browsers that competed with
Microsoft''s Internet Explorer. </p>
<p>The government contended Microsoft hindered access to the
Netscape Navigator browser because its Java programming language
let programmers write applications that ran on any operating
system, not just Windows. </p>
<p>Microsoft got into antitrust trouble because it fell
behind as an innovator and then tried to catch up by flexing its
Windows monopoly rather than competing on the merits, said
Andy Gavil, an antitrust professor at Howard University Law
School in Washington. It did that most extremely with Internet
browsers and media players. </p>
<p>New Software </p>
<p>The settlement protected development and distribution of
new software and barred Microsoft from continuing the behavior
that triggered the antitrust lawsuit. </p>
<p>Our experience has changed us and shaped how we view our
responsibility to the industry, Microsoft spokesman Kevin Kutz
said in an e-mailed statement. We are pleased to bring this
matter to successful resolution. </p>
<p>Microsoft submitted to court oversight of its practices
under a decree issued by U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar- Kotelly. The supervision included periodic reviews to ensure the
company complied with terms of the settlement to give computer
makers freedom to promote rival products. </p>
<p>Harry First, a professor at New York University School of
Law in Manhattan, said he questions how much was accomplished. </p>
<p>Market Share </p>
<p>Everything that was done didn''t really disrupt
Microsoft''s position, he said. It''s still a Windows world
and Internet Explorer still has a major share of the browser
market. </p>
<p>Internet Explorer has 55 percent of the browser market,
while Mozilla''s Firefox has 22 percent, according to research
firm Netmarketshare''s website. Google Inc. (GOOG)''s Chrome has 12
percent and Apple Inc.''s Safari has 7 percent, Netmarketshare
reports. </p>
<p>Still, Kollar-Kotelly said at the last oversight hearing on
April 27 that the compliance committee had worked well and could
be used as a model for cases in the future. </p>
<p>The European Commission accused Microsoft in 2004 of
abusing its dominant position by deliberately restricting the
ability of non-Microsoft software on larger computers to work
with its Windows operating system. Microsoft''s bundling of the
media player with Windows was also deemed unfair by the
Commission, which fined the company a record 497 million euros
($706 million), ordered it to share secret programming data with
competitors and offer a version of Windows without a music and
video player. </p>
<p>The most important thing about the case was that it put
Microsoft under incredible scrutiny for how it was going to
treat firms coming to life around the browser, said Timothy Wu, an information industries scholar from Columbia University
who is on leave to advise the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. </p>
<p>Wu said the antitrust case helped Internet companies such
as Google and Facebook Inc. flourish, while products such as
WordPerfect and Lotus 1-2-3 software lost momentum due to
Microsoft''s dominance. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Microsoft, 98-cv-01232, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington). </p>

<p>Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal said
it''s "extremely likely" the Morganza Floodway will be opened
this weekend, inundating the Atchafalaya River basin with enough
water to fill a football field 10 feet deep every second. </p>
<p>The Mississippi River Commission hasn''t made an official
announcement. Jindal said at a press conference in Baton Rouge
that we are proceeding on the assumption that the spillway is
going to be opened tomorrow or Sunday. </p>
<p>The spillway, built in 1954, would release 600,000 cubic
feet of water per second into central Louisiana and the
Atchafalaya, taking pressure off the Mississippi and the cities
downstream, according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. </p>
<p>Jindal said the Morganza would be opened gradually and
wouldn''t result in a wall of water running the length of the
state to Morgan City, 70 miles west of New Orleans, where the
Atchafalaya empties into the Gulf of Mexico. He stressed the
need to act quickly. </p>
<p>Now is the time to take action, Jindal said. We
wanted to give people as much advance notice as we can. </p>
<p>About 2,500 people and 2,000 structures are within the
spillway and another 22,500 and 11,000 buildings are vulnerable
to flooding when the waters rise, according to Jindal''s office. </p>
<p>Oil, Gas Production </p>
<p>Opening the spillway would also affect Louisiana''s energy
production. Inside the threatened area are 2,264 wells that
produce 19,278 barrels of crude oil a day, about 10 percent of
Louisiana''s onshore total. </p>
<p>About 252.6 million cubic feet a day of gas is produced in
the potential inundation area provided by the corps, Anna
Dearmon, a spokeswoman for the Louisiana Department of Natural
Resources, said in an e-mail. She said there is no estimate of
how much of this production would be affected. </p>
<p>We are building earthen, sandbag and Hesco basket levees
in Amelia, said Paul Naquin, St. Mary Parish president, based
in Franklin, Louisiana. In five days we should be OK. We are
working 24 hours a day trying to beat the clock. </p>
<p>A Hesco basket is a container that can be filled with dirt
to build a temporary levee. </p>
<p>Naquin said there is also a plan to sink a barge in a bayou
to slow down the rising water. </p>
<p>Exxon Baton Rouge </p>
<p>The Mississippi River has flooded Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)''s river
docks at the refinery in Baton Rouge, according to a person
familiar with the plant''s operations. </p>
<p>The refinery, on the banks of the Mississippi, had crews
working around the clock because of the river, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the information
isn''t public. The plant is operating while watching the river
conditions, Kevin Allexon, a company spokesman based in
Fairfax, Virginia, said in an e-mail today. </p>
<p>National Guard troops and local sheriffs would start going
door-to-door in the affected areas warning residents to flee,
Jindal said. It would take the water three days to travel the
length of the floodway from Morganza to Morgan City. </p>
<p>For weeks, the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, swollen by
heavy rain and melted snow, have been inundating cities and
towns, flooding cropland and disrupting shipping. The Ohio rose
to a record 61.72 feet (18.8 meters) in Cairo, Illinois, before
joining the Mississippi there. </p>
<p>Watching Flow Rate </p>
<p>The decision to open the Morganza will be made if the flow
at Louisiana''s Red River Landing north of Baton Rouge reaches
1.5 million cubic feet per second, said Ricky Boyett, a corps
spokesman. The flow was at 1.49 million cubic feet per second
today, according to the National Weather Service. </p>
<p>The Mississippi River system was engineered to absorb a
major flood while maintaining flow rates through Baton Rouge and
New Orleans to ensure the integrity of levees, according to the
corps. The corps wants to limit flow to 1.5 million cubic feet
per second at Baton Rouge and 1.25 million at New Orleans, said
Ken Holder, a spokesman. </p>
<p>When the river flows exceed that, the system is designed to
have water diverted elsewhere by using the Morganza or the
Bonnet Carre spillway outside New Orleans, he said. </p>
<p>Opening the Morganza may lower the river''s crest in Baton
Rouge by as little as a foot, said Bryan Harmon, the city''s
deputy public works director. The river is projected to crest at
47.5 feet on May 22 without the Morganza opened, according to
the weather service. </p>
<p>We think it would give us a great deal of comfort if they
open that, said William Daniel, Baton Rouge''s interim public
works director. </p>
<p>Unless the spillway is used, the river is expected to crest
at 19.5 feet in New Orleans, which is protected by levees to 20
feet, according to the corps. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Morgan
Stanley (MS), which led investment banks on General Motors Co. (GM)''s
initial public offering, probably will handle the next sale of
the automaker''s shares, said a person familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury Department, the Detroit-based automaker''s
biggest shareholder, won''t sell more shares until at least
August to wait for the stock price to climb, two people familiar
with the decision have said. </p>
<p>While the Treasury, which owns 33 percent of GM, can file
for a secondary offering as soon as May 22 using the same form
as for an IPO, which requires a lengthy regulatory review. At
Morgan Stanley''s suggestion, the department decided to wait
until July 1, when it can file a simpler document and have more
flexibility on timing, said the people. </p>
<p>You need a megabank to underwrite a deal that is the size
of what the U.S. Treasury will be selling, said Peter Bible,
GM''s former chief accounting officer who now heads the public
companies group for New York-based accounting firm EisnerAmper
LLP. Those two make the most sense given their size. They did
a tremendous job on the IPO. </p>
<p>The U.S., which invested $49.5 billion in GM during its
2009 bankruptcy and restructuring, still is talking with other
investment banks about underwriting roles, and a final decision
won''t be made until closer to a stock sale, said the person, who
asked not to be identified revealing private plans. </p>
<p>GM fell 35 cents to $31.07 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. </p>
<p>Earnings Results </p>
<p>Treasury officials put off deciding on the timing of a GM
secondary offering because the stock has mostly traded below the
$33 per-share IPO price. While the company beat earnings
expectations on May 5, the stock fell 3.1 percent that day. The
lower price affirmed the Treasury''s decision that it would be
better to wait until the second-quarter profit is announced, the
people said. </p>
<p>The longer they wait, the better the return for the
Treasury will be and for the taxpayer, Dennis Virag, president
of Automotive Consulting Group in Ann Arbor, Michigan, said in a
telephone interview yesterday. The auto market in the U.S. is
recovering, and it''s a fairly consistent recovery. </p>
<p>The Treasury doesn''t expect to sell its remaining 33
percent stake in a single secondary offering, one of the people
said. </p>
<p>Sale Options </p>
<p>If Treasury opted to file an S-1 registration statement,
the kind of document used for an IPO, the offering would have to
go through a rigorous review that could last a month or longer,
similar to an initial stock sale, Bible said in an interview
today. </p>
<p>With the simpler S-3 filing, the SEC can review GM
documents it already has, so the registration could be done in
days, Bible said. That would allow the government to better time
a sale to a higher price. </p>
<p>GM''s management and President Barack Obama''s administration
want to end the almost two-year period of government ownership,
the people said. The Treasury doesn''t expect to get the $44
average share price needed to break even on the $49.5 billion
investment, they said. Further share sales need to average $53 a
share to make up for the $33 per-share IPO price. </p>
<p>We''re going to lose money in the auto industry on net,
but we did this for the jobs we were going to save, not to
maximize return, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said
at a Detroit Economic Club event on April 28. We''re not a
private investor. Our job was to protect the country. </p>
<p>Treasury Bailout </p>
<p>The Treasury provided $85 billion of commitments to the
auto industry, which included $64 billion to GM and Chrysler
Group LLC, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The
remaining assistance was provided to auto-parts suppliers and to
finance arms Chrysler Financial Corp. and GMAC Inc., which is
now known as Ally Financial Inc. </p>
<p>The Treasury aims to get at least the $33 IPO price and
would prefer to sell shares in the high $30s or into the $40
range, where most analysts have set their target price, the
people said. The department also wants to begin selling shares
this year, they said. </p>
<p>GM raised more than $23 billion, mostly for U.S. and
Canadian governments and a union health fund, selling common and
preferred stock in its initial public offering in November. Bank
of America Corp. (BAC) and Citigroup Inc. (C) were also listed among
leaders of the investment banks. </p>
<p>Second-Quarter Profit </p>
<p>The Treasury plans to wait for GM to announce a second-
quarter profit before selling any more shares, which could be in
August or September, or it may wait until November, after third-
quarter results, the people said. </p>
<p>What Treasury does with their GM shares is entirely up to
them, Jim Cain, a GM spokesman, said yesterday. We''re
focused on growing profitably around the world, further
strengthening our balance sheet and fully funding our pension
plan. </p>
<p>Government ownership is weighing down GM shares, said David Whiston, an analyst with Chicago-based Morningstar Inc. </p>
<p>A portfolio manager who believes the GM story may stay on
the sidelines because when Treasury files to sell, the stock
could sink, he said in a telephone interview yesterday.
Other investors don''t want to invest simply because there is
government ownership. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson bought $939,900 in
shares of the automaker, GM disclosed today in a regulatory
filing. The purchase of 30,000 shares at $31.33 apiece was a
personal investment by Akerson, said Jim Cain, a GM spokesman. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Total SA (FP),
Europe''s third-largest oil company, have signed a partnership
for exploration of shale gas in Poland. </p>
<p>Under the agreement announced today, Exxon will have 51
percent and operate the Chelm and Werbkowice exploration
concessions in the Lublin Basin of southeastern Poland,
according to a statement from Paris-based Total. The French
company will have a 49 percent stake in the concessions. </p>
<p>The entry into these concessions reflects Total''s
commitment to expanding activities in unconventional gas,
notably in Europe, Total said in the statement. </p>
<p>The move into Poland to explore for unconventional gas
follows passage this week by the French National Assembly of a
bill that would ban the use of hydraulic fracturing in France, a
technique used to explore for hydrocarbons locked in shale rock.
The French government and environmental groups have said use of
the technology can harm the environment by contaminating land
and water tables. The bill still needs approval in the Senate. </p>
<p>Poland''s reserves of shale and so-called tight gas may be
as much as 3 trillion cubic meters, according to estimates by
consultant Advanced Resources International Inc. Shale
formations consist of dense rock that can be broken apart using
water, sand and chemicals to release oil or gas. </p>
<p>Exxon has already started using seismic data to explore the
Chelm concession and has drilled an exploratory well, according
to today''s statement. </p>
<p>U.S. Shale </p>
<p>Total entered the U.S. shale-gas business last year
agreeing to pay $800 million for 25 percent of Chesapeake Energy
Corp. (CHK)''s assets in the Barnett Shale field in Texas. In addition
to the U.S., Total plans to develop unconventional gas in
Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Canada, China and Denmark, Total
has said. </p>
<p>Total''s five-year Montelimar permit in France allowed the
company to search for shale gas in an area that spans 4,327
square kilometers (1,671 square miles) from south of Valence to
areas around Montpellier. The company won''t use hydraulic
fracturing on the permit, although it''s not clear whether the
license will be revoked, de Margerie said today. </p>
<p>Unconventional resources are part of the company''s strategy
to lift production by an average of 2 percent annually through
2015, a target reiterated today by de Margerie. Output will be
relatively stable this year amid a gap in new projects
starting and a halt in output from Libya. Total will add to its
production this year from its acquisition of a 12 percent stake
in Russia''s OAO Novatek. </p>

<p>Jim O''Neill, chairman of Goldman
Sachs Asset Management, said investors should shed their
pessimism and stop hoarding cash amid prospects for a global
stock rally that could start in China. </p>
<p>The view that the West is in trouble is wrong when
nations including Germany, Sweden, Australia and Canada are
performing strongly, O''Neill said in an interview with Bloomberg
Television in Hong Kong, recorded yesterday and broadcast today.
Investors should stop worrying so much, said O''Neill, known
for coining the BRIC acronym for Brazil, Russia, India and China. </p>
<p>Global investors have tempered their optimism about the U.S.
and world economies and plan to put more of their money in cash
and less in commodities over the next six months, a quarterly
survey of Bloomberg subscribers showed yesterday. The poll,
conducted May 9-10, also found that investors'' enthusiasm for
stocks is cooling. </p>
<p>O''Neill, 54, said his strongest hunch is that China''s
inflation may be close to easing, meaning the Chinese stock
market may go crazy in the second half of the year. The
central bank yesterday raised banks'' reserve requirements by
half a percentage point to lock up cash that threatens to fuel
gains in consumer prices. </p>
<p>The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index rose 1 percent today,
the biggest gain in a month. </p>
<p>Every Little Problem'' </p>
<p>In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, investors
are overly concerned at the possibility of so-called black swan
events, said O''Neill, using a term sometimes used to describe
unlikely occurrences with severe consequences. </p>
<p>Every little problem that crops up somewhere in the world
is not going to create another black swan, he said, adding
that there''s far too much conservatism, in terms of
investors holding cash. </p>
<p>O''Neill reaffirmed his view that Russian stocks are cheap,
on the same day the nation''s Micex Index (INDEXCF) slid to a five-month
low on falling commodity prices. He also said that a global
stock rally could start in China. </p>
<p>His positive comments on the outlook for China came as two
people with knowledge of the matter said Goldman Sachs plans to
set up a yuan-denominated private equity fund in the nation.
Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein attended a ceremony
for Goldman Sachs in Beijing yesterday, the people said,
declining to be identified before an announcement. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), which has settled a
third of the pending cases over its Prempro menopause drug, said
it set aside $772 million to resolve claims the medicine causes
breast cancer. </p>
<p>Officials of New York-based Pfizer, the world''s largest
drugmaker, said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission yesterday that the reserve provides the
minimum expected costs to resolve all of the other outstanding
lawsuits over its hormone-replacement drugs. The company didn''t
say how many cases would be settled. </p>
<p>I see this as an effort to clean up a long-standing
litigation so they can go forward with their business plan,
Les Funtleyder, a New York-based fund manager at Miller Tabak 
Co. in New York who holds Pfizer shares, said yesterday in a
phone interview. This is probably a good thing for the
stock. </p>
<p>More than 6 million women took Prempro and related
menopause drugs to treat symptoms including hot flashes and mood
swings before a 2002 study highlighted their links to cancer.
Wyeth''s sales of the medicines, which are still on the market,
exceeded $2 billion before the release of the Women''s Health
Initiative, a study sponsored by the National Institutes of
Health. </p>
<p>Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Premarin,
Wyeth''s estrogen-based drug, with progestin-laden Provera, made
by Pfizer''s Upjohn unit, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth
combined the two hormones in its Prempro pill. Pfizer completed
its $68 billion purchase of Wyeth in 2009. </p>
<p>10,000 Suits </p>
<p>At the height of the litigation, Pfizer faced more than
10,000 claims that its menopause drugs caused breast cancer,
according to lawyers for former users. Those cases included more
than 8,000 cases consolidated in federal court in Arkansas and
other cases in state courts in Pennsylvania, Nevada and
Minnesota. </p>
<p>The company''s announcement that it had resolved a third of
the cases over its menopause drugs means Pfizer has settled more
than 3,300 cases. </p>
<p>The decision to settle cases reflects a business decision
by the company to avoid the cost and distraction of prolonged
litigation, Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said in an
e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>We are pleased to see Pfizer finally accept
responsibility for the injuries this drug caused to women and
hope the company will compensate each woman fairly and
reasonably, Zoe Littlepage, a Houston, Texas-based lawyer who
serves as lead counsel for ex-Prempro users in the consolidated
Arkansas cases, said in a phone interview. </p>
<p>Bloomberg News reported in February that Pfizer had agreed
to pay about $330 million to resolve 2,200 cases over the
menopause drugs, according to people familiar with the accords.
Those settlements provided average payouts of about $150,000 per
woman, the people said. Pfizer officials disputed those numbers. </p>
<p>Litigation Record </p>
<p>Pfizer''s Wyeth and Upjohn units have lost eight of the 15
Prempro cases decided by juries since trials began in 2006. The
drugmaker got some of the verdicts thrown out after trial or had
the awards cut. The company has appealed its losses. Wyeth also
has won dismissals of more than 3,000 cases prior to trial. </p>
<p>In December, a jury in Puerto Rico ordered Wyeth to pay
$1.5 million in damages to a pharmacist who developed breast
cancer after taking Prempro. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s regulatory filing was reported earlier by the Wall
Street Journal. </p>
<p>The consolidated case in Arkansas is In Re Prempro
Products, 03-CV-015070-WRW, U.S. District Court, Eastern
District of Arkansas (Little Rock). </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) expects global
energy demand to increase 35 percent by 2030 compared with 2005
and demand in the Middle East to climb 85 percent during the
period as electricity needs rise to match population gains. </p>
<p>Oil, natural gas and coal will continue to meet most of
the world''s needs during this period because no other energy
sources can match their availability, versatility, affordability
and scale, said Rob Gardner, manager for the energy and
economics division of Exxon Mobil''s Corporate Strategic Planning
department. </p>
<p>Power generation will represent 55 percent of the total
growth in demand and in 2030 will account for about 40 percent
of total primary energy consumption, Gardner said today at a
seminar in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. </p>
<p>The key role oil and natural gas plays in the global
energy outlook for decades to come underlines the importance of
the Middle East region as a major supplier in meeting the
world''s needs, Gardner said, while discussing his company''s
outlook for energy to the year 2030. </p>
<p>According to Exxon''s outlook, efforts to secure reliable
and affordable energy, while limiting greenhouse gas pollution,
will lead to many countries putting a cost on carbon dioxide
emissions. As a result, natural gas will become increasingly
competitive as a source of power generation as its use results
in less CO2 releases than other energy sources, he said. </p>
<p>The cost of producing one metric ton of carbon dioxide will
reach about $60 in Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development nations over the coming years if strict policies
were applied, said Gardner, who is responsible of producing the
company''s thirty years outlook. </p>

<p>The opening of Louisiana''s Morganza
floodway today may send enough water to fill a football field 10
feet deep every second across the heart of Cajun country,
eventually filling an area almost as large as Connecticut. </p>
<p>Major General Michael Walsh, president of the Mississippi
River Commission, has told Col. Edward Fleming to open the
spillway when the river''s flow reaches 1.5 million cubic feet
per second at Louisiana''s Red River Landing, the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers said in a statement. The flow reached that
threshold this morning, according to the weather service. </p>
<p>We have not opened it yet, said Ken Holder, corps
spokesman. </p>
<p>The spillway, built in 1954, can release 600,000 cubic feet
of water per second into central Louisiana and the Atchafalaya
River at maximum capacity, taking pressure off the Mississippi
and the cities downstream, according to the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers. Corps inundation maps assume the spillway operating
at 50 percent of capacity. </p>
<p>The corps expects to release 150,000 cubic feet per second
from the Morganza, which is 310 river miles above New Orleans.
The opening of the Morganza is expected to drop crests on the
Mississippi River from 1 to 2 feet, according to the National
Weather Service. </p>
<p>Wall of Water </p>
<p>Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal said yesterday that the
Morganza would be opened gradually and wouldn''t result in a wall
of water running the length of the state to Morgan City, 70
miles west of New Orleans, where the Atchafalaya empties into
the Gulf of Mexico. He stressed the need for residents to move
quickly. </p>
<p>Now is the time to take action, Jindal said at a press
conference. We wanted to give people as much advance notice as
we can. </p>
<p>About 2,500 people and 2,000 structures are within the
spillway and another 22,500 and 11,000 buildings are vulnerable
to flooding when the waters rise, according to Jindal''s office. </p>
<p>When the Morganza Spillway is opened, an estimated 15,000
acres of farmland will be initially underwater in the south-
central part of Louisiana along the Mississippi River, Kyle
McCann, a spokesman at Louisiana Farm Bureau Federation. </p>
<p>Opening the spillway will also affect Louisiana''s energy
production. Inside the threatened area are 2,264 wells that
produce 19,278 barrels of crude oil a day, about 10 percent of
Louisiana''s onshore total. </p>
<p>Oil, Gas Production </p>
<p>About 252.6 million cubic feet a day of gas is produced in
the corps'' potential inundation area, Anna Dearmon, a
spokeswoman for the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources,
said in an e-mail. She said there is no estimate of how much of
this production would be affected. </p>
<p>We are building earthen, sandbag and Hesco basket levees
in Amelia, said Paul Naquin, St. Mary Parish president, based
in Franklin, Louisiana. In five days we should be OK. We are
working 24 hours a day trying to beat the clock. </p>
<p>A Hesco basket is a container that can be filled with dirt
to build a temporary levee. </p>
<p>Naquin said there is also a plan to sink a barge in a bayou
to slow down the rising water. </p>
<p>Exxon Dock </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) shut river dock operations at the
refinery in Baton Rouge today after the waters of Mississippi
River flooded the facility, Kevin Allexon, a company spokesman
said. The plant, second-largest in the U.S. after Exxon''s
refinery in Baytown, Texas, remains in production and can
process 525,000 barrels of oil a day, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>National Guard troops and local sheriffs would start going
door-to-door in the affected areas warning residents to flee,
Jindal said. It would take the water three days to travel the
length of the floodway from Morganza to Morgan City. </p>
<p>A voluntary evacuation notice has been issued for Melville,
Krotz Springs and Three Mile Lake, according to the St. Landry
Parish government. Automated phone messages were being sent to
people living in the area. </p>
<p>For weeks, the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, swollen by
heavy rain and melted snow, have been inundating cities and
towns, flooding cropland and disrupting shipping. The Ohio rose
to a record 61.72 feet (18.8 meters) in Cairo, Illinois, before
joining the Mississippi there. </p>
<p>Record Crest </p>
<p>Without the Morganza being opened, the Mississippi was
expected to crest at 47.5 feet in Baton Rouge on May 22 and 19.5
feet in New Orleans on May 23, according to the weather service.
The estimated crests with the spillway open are now 45.5 to 46.5
feet in Baton Rouge and 17 feet in New Orleans. </p>
<p>The record crest in Baton Rouge was 47.2 feet in 1927 and
21.27 feet in New Orleans in 1922, according to the weather
service. </p>
<p>The flooding in Tennessee has affected 650,000 acres of
cropland in the western part of the state, including 86,000
acres of wheat, said Lee Maddox, a spokesman for the Tennessee
Farm Bureau, citing numbers from the state''s farm service
agency, a unit of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Farmers
were just getting ready to harvest the wheat, and it''s probably
destroyed now, Maddox said. </p>
<p>The Mississippi River system was engineered to absorb a
major flood while maintaining flow rates through Baton Rouge and
New Orleans to ensure the integrity of levees, according to the
corps. The corps wants to limit flow to 1.5 million cubic feet
per second at Baton Rouge and 1.25 million at New Orleans, said
Ken Holder, a spokesman. </p>
<p>Spillway Use </p>
<p>When the river flows exceed that, the system is designed to
have water diverted elsewhere by using the Morganza or the
Bonnet Carre spillway outside New Orleans, he said. </p>
<p>Jindal said the corps has asked the State Police to shut
the roadway over the Morganza down at 10 a.m. The structure also
carries a Kansas City Southern (KSU) railroad line. </p>
<p>Opening the Morganza may lower the river''s crest in Baton
Rouge by as little as a foot, said Bryan Harmon, the city''s
deputy public works director. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) shut dock

<p>The refinery, located on the banks of the river, continues
to operate and produce products, Allexon, who is based in
Fairfax, Virginia said in an e-mail today. </p>
<p>We have no plans to shut down the complex at this time,
Allexon said. We will, of course, continue monitoring river
conditions and will make operational adjustments as conditions
require. </p>

company''s website. It also imports crude from Mexico, the North
Sea, West Africa, South America, Central America and the Arabian
Gulf. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is rolling out an
expansion to features on its Bing search engine that display
data from Facebook Inc., such as restaurants, brands and links
friends have recommended, aiming to make results more social. </p>
<p>The company is broadening the scope of a tool that lets
users who are searching for a restaurant, movie or news story
see if their friends have liked it on Facebook, the world''s
most popular social network. Searches for places will list
friends who live nearby, while looking for www.amazon.com shows
Amazon items liked by friends, as well as popular items
among the Facebook community, said Sean Suchter, general manager
of Microsoft''s Search Technology Center in Silicon Valley. </p>
<p>Since overhauling its search engine and releasing Bing in
June 2009, Microsoft has built the product into a credible
alternative to Google. Including traffic from a search agreement
with Yahoo! Inc., Bing now underpins about 30 percent of
searches in the U.S., according to ComScore Inc. With Google
still dominating, Microsoft is pushing forward with improvements
like social search as a way to gain more share. </p>
<p>It''s not going to be something that overnight changes
people to Bing, said Danny Sullivan, who runs the search-
analysis website Search Engine Land. He said Microsoft has
already rolled out some social features since signing an
agreement with Facebook in October. The social evolution is
important and it is growing. It''s going to be an interesting
thing, but it''s not going to blow the doors off. </p>
<p>Microsoft fell 46 cents to $24.57 at 4 p.m. New York time
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares have declined 12 percent
this year. </p>
<p>Compare With Friends </p>
<p>Bing''s travel site will add features to let customers
compare trips with Facebook friends and get their suggestions.
If a user likes a city on Bing Travel, Bing will send flight
deals to the user''s Facebook feed. The Bing search tool bar will
now include a like button to let users recommend any site
they visit. </p>
<p>Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft already lets users
friend someone on Facebook from within search results and
shows searchers things their friends have liked. The company
this week is boosting how much Facebook data Bing scans, meaning
users will see more of these kinds of social results. The
features won''t show users information from friends who have set
up their Facebook accounts to be private, Suchter said. </p>
<p>To promote the social options, Microsoft will sponsor the
Los Angeles and New York premieres of the movie Hangover 2.
The company announced the expansion in a blog post today. </p>
<p>Online Packs'' </p>
<p>Information on friends'' recommendations can make searches
more useful and help get customers comfortable with researching
and purchasing online, said Chad Stoller, executive vice
president of digital strategy at advertising agency BBDO North
America. </p>
<p>There''s a reason teenage girls shop in packs in the
mall, he said. Anything that can give people greater
confidence shopping online is a good thing, and social search
can give people that level of confidence. </p>
<p>Having the Facebook data gives Microsoft an advantage over
Google, Stoller said. If search engines don''t combine social
data, they could lose one to three searches a day per customer,
because users who are spending more time on social networks like
Facebook will get links and references there and have less need
for search engines, he said. </p>
<p>This is going to be the next big thing, said Suchter,
who previously ran Yahoo''s search technology team before joining
Microsoft in December 2008. This is one of those big sea
changes. We can make it where really your friends are always
with you. </p>
<p>Google, Twitter </p>
<p>Suchter declined to say whether the deal with Facebook is
exclusive. He said he expects Google to try to match the
Microsoft offerings. </p>
<p>Google, based in Mountain View, California, uses Twitter
data to provide searchers information on what their friends have
shared. That feature is only available to people who use
Google''s Social Circles product, while Microsoft is showing
these search results more broadly, Search Engine Land''s Sullivan
said. </p>
<p>Suchter, who has worked in the Internet search area since
1998, oversees a team of about 130 search experts housed at
Microsoft''s Mountain View campus. The team has largely been
drawn from rivals over the past two years -- when Suchter
started at Microsoft, he was the only one, he said. </p>
<p>To build the product, Suchter said his team worked long
hours with Facebook engineers. Suchter said he''s done late night
software-coding sessions at their offices, and Facebook co-
founder Mark Zuckerberg did the same at Microsoft. </p>
<p>Suchter also has to make Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates
happy. Search is one of a handful of areas Gates continues to
work on since leaving his day-to-day role, and Suchter had his
first review of the social features with Gates several weeks
ago. </p>
<p>This is an agenda for us, Suchter said. It''s much
bigger than what we are doing here. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) bolstered
the leadership of its investment-banking and merger-advisory
divisions after the company fell to third place among takeover
advisers this year. </p>
<p>Richard J. Gnodde, a 51-year-old South African based in
London, will become co-head of investment banking with David M. Solomon and John S. Weinberg, the division''s two New York-based
leaders, according to an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg.
Gordon E. Dyal, 49, will give up his role as global head of
mergers and acquisitions to become co-chairman of investment
banking with Christopher A. Cole, the memo said. </p>
<p>Investment banking, which includes mergers and acquisitions
and stock and bond underwriting, generated $1.27 billion in
first-quarter revenue, less than 11 percent of the New York-
based firm''s total. The bank lagged behind JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
and Morgan Stanley in advisory revenue during the quarter, the
first time in a decade that Goldman Sachs''s earnings press
release didn''t mention the company''s ranking among MA advisers. </p>
<p>It''s just an effort to refocus on the business, said
Benjamin B. Wallace, an analyst at Westborough, Massachusetts-
based Grimes  Co., which manages about $1 billion and doesn''t
own Goldman Sachs stock. They fell in the rankings and they''re
going to have to get more out of that business because their
other divisions are becoming less lucrative. </p>
<p>Trading Revenue </p>
<p>Revenue from trading, the firm''s biggest source of profit,
dropped 22 percent in the first quarter compared with a year
earlier, after sliding 33 percent last year from 2009. Goldman
Sachs, the top adviser on announced MA transactions from 2001
through 2008, dropped to third place this year after coming in
second to Morgan Stanley in 2009 and 2010, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Dyal will turn over his global MA responsibilities to
London-based Yoel Zaoui and Gene T. Sykes, based in Los Angeles,
according to a separate memo. Andrea Rachman, a spokeswoman for
the New York-based firm, confirmed the memos'' contents and
declined to comment further. </p>
<p>Gnodde will continue to serve as co-chief executive officer
of Goldman Sachs International, the firm''s business in Europe,
the Middle East and Africa, along with Michael S. Sherwood.
Gnodde, who joined Goldman Sachs in 1987, moved to London in
2005 after serving as co-head of investment banking in Japan and
working in Hong Kong as president of Goldman Sachs Asia. </p>
<p>These important changes reflect the continued importance
and growth of the firm''s global client franchise, said the
memo, which was signed by Chairman and CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein,
56, and by President and Chief Operating Officer Gary D. Cohn,
50. </p>
<p>European MA </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank, hired Dyal from
Morgan Stanley as a partner in 1998. He was co-head of European
mergers and acquisitions from 1999 to 2001. In 2001 he became
co-head of investment banking in Europe, and in 2004 assumed his
role as global head of MA. </p>
<p>Zaoui, 50, and Sykes, 53, will be global co-heads of
mergers and acquisitions, where they will work closely with
Timothy J. Ingrassia and Jack Levy, the MA division''s co-
chairmen, the memo said. </p>
<p>Zaoui, who joined in New York in 1988 before moving to
London in 1989, became co-head of European MA in 1999 and rose
to head of European investment banking in 2004, the memo said.
Zaoui became a managing director in 1997 and a partner in 1998.
Zaoui, like Gnodde, Solomon, Weinberg, Dyal and Cole, is a
member of the firm''s management committee. </p>
<p>Media, Telecommunications </p>
<p>Sykes, who joined the MA department in New York in 1984
and moved to Los Angeles in 1987, was co-chairman of global MA
and continues to serve as chairman of global technology, media
and telecommunications investment banking. He became a partner
in 1992 and is a member of the client and business standards
committee. </p>
<p>Yoel and Gene bring international experience, strong
sector knowledge and deep client relationships to the mergers
leadership team, said the memo, signed by Gnodde, Solomon and
Weinberg. They will position the firm to continue to provide
seamless coverage to clients who increasingly operate as cross-

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is leading banks
marketing $2.9 billion of bonds backed by commercial mortgages
as relative yields narrow amid investor demand for debt tied to
skyscrapers, offices and shopping centers. </p>
<p>The JPMorgan deal consists of 42 loans on 84 properties,
said a person with knowledge of the transaction who declined to
be identified because terms aren''t public. Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) and
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) are also selling $1.45 billion
of bonds linked to office, mall and hotel loans. </p>
<p>The securities, which may be sold as soon as next week, are
being offered as issuance in the $700 billion market
accelerates. Banks have arranged $8.6 billion of commercial-
mortgage bonds this year, compared with $11.5 billion in all of
2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales may reach
$45 billion in 2011, according to JPMorgan, as investors seek
out higher-yielding assets with the Federal Reserve holding its
benchmark interest rate at record lows. </p>
<p>We expect demand to remain strong, and upcoming deals to
be generally well-received, New York-based JPMorgan analysts
led by Ed Reardon wrote in a May 13 report. About $4.5 billion
of new offerings are in the pipeline for the next two weeks, the
analysts said. </p>
<p>The extra yield investors demand to hold top-rated
securities linked to commercial real estate has declined to 187
basis points, or 1.87 percentage points, more than Treasuries,
from 228 basis points at yearend, according to a Barclays Plc
index. </p>
<p>Largest Loan </p>
<p>Money managers are turning to commercial mortgage debt as
relative yields on investment-grade corporate debt declined 17
basis points to 149 basis points since Dec. 31, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. Spreads last month
declined to 145 basis points, the smallest gap since October
2007. </p>
<p>New issue CMBS offer attractive all-in-returns when
compared to similarly-rated, duration-matched alternatives,
the JPMorgan analysts said. </p>
<p>The largest loan in the JPMorgan deal is a $199.8 million
mortgage on the Newport Centre, a 1.5 million square-foot mall
in Jersey City, New Jersey. Macy''s is the largest tenant,
occupying 229,889 square-feet. Retail properties account for
41.1 percent of the pool, while office buildings make up 35.6
percent, the person said. </p>
<p>Riskiest Slice </p>
<p>The offering by San Francisco-based Wells Fargo and
Edinburgh-based RBS consists of 73 loans on 144 properties, said
a separate person, who also declined to be identified because
the sale isn''t public. </p>
<p>Torchlight Investors purchased the riskiest slice of the
JPMorgan pool, according to deal documents. Selling the so-
called B-pieces is a prerequisite for marketing the rest of the
deal. The pool of B-piece buyers is growing amid surging sales. </p>
<p>BlackRock Inc., Rialto Capital Management LLC and H/2
Capital Partners dominated the market for so-called B-pieces in
2010. Investors in this portion of commercial-mortgage backed
securities can kick out certain loans from the pool if they deem
them too risky, thereby policing underwriting standards. </p>
<p>Sales of commercial mortgage-backed securities are a boon
for property owners that have struggled to refinance maturing
loans amid a dearth of new lending. Sales plummeted to $3.4
billion in 2009, choking off funding to borrowers with maturing
loans, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A record $234
billion of the debt was issued in 2007, the data show. </p>

<p>Richard Gnodde, co-chief executive
officer of Goldman Sachs International, comments on competition
in financial markets. He spoke at a Cass Business School panel
discussion in London today. </p>
<p>It is very clear that we are all trying to get to the
same place. Our view of the liberalized markets is really based
on the idea of free competition and not on deregulation. I think
it''s very important to reinforce this message, and it has been
well covered this morning. </p>
<p>The openness of financial markets globally will clearly
go into reverse if the view becomes entrenched that opening your
market for financial services implies weaker supervision. It
clearly doesn''t. </p>
<p>Clearly, there has been a huge discussion over the last
number of years and the debate about the role of government and
regulation in the markets. It is critical we learn the right
lessons from the banking crisis and most importantly we
establish a framework which ensures that the cost of a future
crisis will fall where it belongs and that is on the
institutions who fail, their shareholders and not on the
taxpayer. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)''s Nigerian unit
said it will work with the country''s government to resolve
confusion about the status of three oil leases following a
media report they have been canceled. </p>
<p>Oil leases 67, 68 and 70, which together produce 580,000
barrels of crude a day, were nullified by Nigerian Petroleum
Minister Diezani Alison-Madueke in a March 4 letter to Exxon
Mobil, Lagos-based ThisDay newspaper reported today. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil will vigorously protect the rights it
acquired in 2009, Gloria Essien-Danner, a company spokeswoman,
said in by e-mail today. We will work with the Minister of
Petroleum Resources and other relevant government officials to
resolve any confusion that may exist on this matter. </p>
<p>Negotiations for 16 oil blocks operated by companies
including Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Chevron Corp.
have been under way for two years. Exxon Mobil was the only
energy company to have its licenses renewed when it signed a
deal in November 2009 covering oil leases 67, 68 and 70. Shell
and Chevron remain in talks with Nigeria on renewing their
expired oil licenses. China National Offshore Oil Corp. had
expressed an interest in taking over some of the permits,
raising concern they wouldn''t be renewed. </p>
<p>Nigeria, Africa''s top oil producer, is the fifth-biggest
source of U.S. oil imports. Shell, Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Total
SA and Eni SpA run joint ventures with the state-owned Nigerian
National Petroleum Corp., which pumps about 90 percent of the
country''s crude. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is seeking
money to bankroll fledgling hedge funds, its second attempt
since 2008 to break into a business now dominated by Blackstone
Group LP (BX), according to three people with knowledge of the plan. </p>
<p>The bank has spent the past year trying to attract clients
for a seeding fund, which provides managers with startup
investing capital in exchange for a cut of their fees, said the
people, who asked not to be identified because the effort is
private. Blackstone recently raised $2.4 billion for its second
seeding fund, the industry''s biggest. </p>
<p>Reservoir Capital Group, Larch Lane Advisors LLC and
PineBridge Investments LLC also are marketing new funds, saying
it''s a good time to back startups because after the financial
crisis investors are reluctant to trust even talented traders
going out on their own. Goldman Sachs, based in New York, shut a
fund in 2008, underscoring that betting on new managers can be
tricky even for one of Wall Street''s savviest firms. </p>
<p>Seeding isn''t an easy-money business, Alexis Graham,
co-founder of Acceleration Capital Group, a New York-based firm
that works with seed investors, said in a telephone interview.
There are only a small percentage of people out there who can
consistently outperform, build a business and scale assets. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)''s agreement to
purchase Skype Technologies SA for $8.5 billion may set a
precedent for higher acquisition premiums, lifting the cost of
other technology buyouts, an EMC Corp. executive said. </p>
<p>The premium appears to be significant, Mark Lewis,
chief strategy officer at EMC, said today at Bloomberg Link''s
Enterprise Technology Summit in New York. If we go to do
acquisitions, there will be comparables. It''s like real estate
-- it''s all based on what''s sold. It''s a starting point. </p>
<p>The price represented a 40 percent markup from what Skype
itself said the company was worth in an April regulatory filing.
Still, Robert Eatroff, managing director of investment banking
at Morgan Stanley (MS), said it''s too early to tell whether there is
a bubble in technology valuations. There is real growth in the
industry in areas such as mobile and cloud products that may be
legitimately driving up valuations, he said. </p>
<p>We have huge secular growth in data and analytics, cloud

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will make multiple

executive. </p>
<p>The version designed for Intel chips will run older Windows
programs, Renee James, head of Intel''s software business, said
today in a presentation at the company''s Santa Clara,

chips to address that market. </p>
<p>Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, is scrambling to
introduce a version of Windows that does a better job of letting
computer makers build rivals to Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s iPad. Microsoft
said personal computer shipments to consumers fell last quarter
partially because customers switched from cheap netbooks to
tablet computers. That decline also was a factor in slumping
sales for Microsoft''s Windows unit in the quarter. </p>

<p>Chevron confirmed the talks a day after BP Plc (BP/)''s $7.8

<p>Chevron continues to work with Rosneft on opportunities

<p>Chevron signed an accord with Moscow-based Rosneft in June
2010 to explore for oil and natural gas in the Russian sector of
the Black Sea. The arrangement called for initial investments by

<p>Morgan Stanley and Hess Energy
Trading Co., or Hetco, failed to buy cargoes of North Sea
Forties crude at lower premiums. </p>
<p>State-owned Saudi Aramco sold a 1 million-barrel shipment
of a new, light crude blend to Total SA for delivery in
Rotterdam, a person with knowledge of the sale said. </p>
<p>North Sea </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley sought to buy a cargo of Forties for June 4
to June 8 delivery at a premium of 45 cents a barrel to Dated
Brent. Hetco''s bid for a June 7 to June 9 shipment at 35 cents
more than Dated Brent was also unsuccessful. </p>
<p>Shell sold two consignments of Forties at 50 and 55 cents a
barrel more than Dated Brent yesterday. </p>
<p>Reported North Sea market activity typically occurs during
the Platts window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Before
the window, Forties loading in 10 to 21 days cost 51 cents more
than Dated Brent, compared with 73 cents yesterday, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>BG Group Plc said its North Sea Armada oil and gas platform
will close for planned maintenance and other work this month,
Jill Moir, a company spokeswoman in Aberdeen, Scotland, said by
e-mail today. The shutdown will begin May 29 and last 45 days. </p>
<p>Armada pumps oil into the Forties Pipeline System and sends
it to Scotland. Gas production enters the CATS natural gas
pipeline and arrives in the U.K. at Teesside. </p>
<p>BP Plc will shut its CATS riser platform at the same time
as the Armada outage for a two-phase maintenance period, Matt
Taylor, a BP spokesman, said in a separate e-mail today. </p>
<p>Brent for June settlement traded at $108.55 a barrel on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the
window, down from $112.70 the previous session. The July
contract was at $108.28, 27 cents less than June. </p>
<p>Mediterranean/Urals </p>
<p>No bids or offers were declared for Urals cargoes in
southern or northwest Europe, according to the Platts survey. </p>
<p>OAO Lukoil didn''t manage to buy a cargo yesterday at $3.10
less than Dated Brent, while Vitol Group failed to sell two
cargoes at discounts of $2.50 and $2.65. </p>
<p>Saudi Aramco sold its fifth cargo of a new, light crude
blend to Total as European refiners seek alternatives to easily
refined Libyan fuel withheld from markets, a person with
knowledge of the sale said. </p>
<p>The shipment by the world''s biggest oil exporter will be
delivered to Rotterdam, the person said, asking not to be
identified because the sale is confidential. The tanker Al Dawha
loaded the cargo at the Red Sea port of Yanbu in early April,
according to the person. Since then, the ship has sailed through
the Mediterranean to Gibraltar, according to AISLive ship-
tracking data on Bloomberg. </p>
<p>West Africa </p>
<p>July loading schedules for Angola''s Palanca and Gimboa
grades are likely to be released tomorrow, according to traders
who participate in the market. Africa''s second-largest oil
producer plans to ship 50.84 million barrels in July, or 1.64
million barrels a day, according to the provisional loading
program obtained by Bloomberg News yesterday. </p>
<p>Nigeria''s July official selling prices and loading program
will probably come out this week, according to the traders. </p>

<p>The son of a former Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) executive, Jacob Lief emulated the fundraising
strategies of charities with Wall Street ties to help schools in
South Africa. </p>
<p>He built a database of likely donors, such as hedge-fund
titan Stanley F. Druckenmiller, Nobel Peace Prize winner
Archbishop Desmond Tutu and fashion designer Donna Karan. </p>
<p>His Ubuntu Education Fund has supported education and
health care for more than 24,000 poor, orphaned or abused
children in townships near Port Elizabeth in South Africa''s
Eastern Cape Province. It also helps with exam preparation,
career guidance and college scholarships. </p>
<p>With daily interventions of medical, psycho-social,
educational and nutritional support, we take a child from
incredible hardship and get him through university, said Lief,
Ubuntu''s president and co-founder, in an interview at Bloomberg
News headquarters. </p>
<p>Tonight, Karan is donating space for an Ubuntu fundraiser
co-hosted by actor Joaquin Phoenix and author Salman Rushdie at
her Urban Zen Foundation headquarters in Manhattan''s West
Village. Other guests include actors Liv Tyler and Marisa Tomei.
The hip-hop/neo-soul group The Roots will supply the music. </p>
<p>Ubuntu''s New York gala in November drew 700 attendees and
raised a record $2 million for the charity. The South African-
American musician Dave Matthews performed before donors and
guests including Druckenmiller, Goldman Chief Financial Officer
David Viniar, actor Robert De Niro and New York Jets quarterback
Mark Sanchez. </p>
<p>No Chalk </p>
<p>Lief was studying diplomatic history at the University of
Pennsylvania and planning on a business career when his goals
shifted during a 1998 visit to South Africa. He saw poor schools
that used abandoned shipping containers for classrooms. He
visited classrooms where the blackboards were blank because the
schools couldn''t afford chalk. </p>
<p>Returning to school, he tapped his credit cards and raised
$300 with a raffle to launch the Ubuntu Education Fund the
following year. </p>
<p>My father was very supportive when I wanted to do this,
Lief said about Daniel Lief, an Ubuntu advisory board member.
People were very skeptical at first, but my dad said whatever
you do, just go into it 100 percent. </p>
<p>Earlier this month, Ubuntu raised $1.2 million at an event
in London where it has an office. The event''s co-hosts were Earl Charles Spencer, the brother of the late Princess of Wales, and
Richard Gnodde, the London-based co-chief executive officer of
Goldman''s European division. </p>
<p>Growing Budget </p>
<p>In 12 years, the charity''s budget has grown to $6.2 million
from a few thousand dollars. Lief now oversees a staff of 80 in
London, New York and Ubuntu''s headquarters in Port Elizabeth,
South Africa. </p>
<p>We''re not Robin Hood, and you''re not going to see your
name in lights, said Lief, referring to the New York-based
poverty fighting foundation supported by many hedge-fund
executives. We''re getting people who really care about this
cause. </p>
<p>The money raised tonight will be used to help Ubuntu''s
nutrition program for orphans and poor children. </p>
<p>One of Ubuntu''s first Wall Street supporters early on was
Harvard Business School professor Robert S. Kaplan, a former
Goldman vice chairman who oversaw the investment banking and
investment management units. In the past two years ago, the
charity has lured more Goldman and finance industry donors, Lief
said. </p>
<p>What our donors like about us is that we run our own
program, we know where we''re spending the money and we''re not
giving it to another organization to hand out, he said. I
look these people in the eye and I say, I won''t let you down, I
want to make this work.'' </p>

<p>General Mills Inc. (GIS), the maker of
Cheerios cereal, agreed to buy a controlling stake in French
yogurt maker Yoplait SAS for about 810 million euros ($1.15
billion) to expand the brand into developing countries. </p>
<p>General Mills will acquire 51 percent of Yoplait and 50
percent of the entity that controls the Yoplait brand from
French private-equity firm PAI Partners, according to a
statement today. French dairy cooperative Sodiaal will hold the
remaining stakes in both. </p>
<p>General Mills, which began exclusive negotiations with PAI
and Sodiaal to buy the yogurt maker in March, plans to build
Yoplait''s market share and accelerate expansion in emerging
countries. The company, led by Chief Executive Officer Ken Powell, jockeyed with rivals such as Nestle SA (NESN) for Yoplait,
people familiar with the matter have said. </p>
<p>Minneapolis-based General Mills has had the U.S. license
for Yoplait since 1977. Sodiaal had aimed to end the license in
September 2012, according to a September regulatory filing.
General Mills had sought arbitration on the matter. When the
deal is completed, both companies will end the arbitration,
according to today''s statement. </p>
<p>Yoplait, whose products are sold in 70 countries, dates
back to 1964, when French farmers joined together to sell their
products nationally, according to Yoplait''s website. </p>
<p>Barclays Capital and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer advised
General Mills, according to the statement. </p>
<p>General Mills rose two cents to $39.89 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have advanced
12 percent this year. </p>

<p>Fewer Morgan Stanley shareholders
approved the firm''s executive compensation package for Chief
Executive Officer James Gorman and other top management after
more than 90 percent voted in favor in the past two years. </p>
<p>Investors holding about 79 percent of outstanding shares
voted to approve the compensation policy in a non-binding
resolution, according to preliminary figures, Chief Legal
Officer Frank Barron said at the annual meeting today in
Purchase, New York. About 91 percent voted to make the so-called
say-on-pay approval an annual event, Barron said. </p>
<p>Institutional Shareholder Services Inc., a proxy advisory
company, recommended voting against the pay plans at both Morgan
Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), citing a pay-for-
performance disconnect. Gorman received a $14 million package
for his first year as chief executive officer, less than the $15
million he was awarded for 2009. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) said in a letter to shareholders this month
that ISS used "flawed analysis" in making its recommendation. </p>
<p>Shareholder approval for Goldman Sachs''s compensation plan,
which doubled pay for Chairman and CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein,
dropped to 73 percent at the New York-based bank''s annual
meeting earlier this month, from 96 percent a year ago. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley shareholders offered no proposals for the
first time in a decade. Last year, there were five proposals,
including one that called for an independent chairman of the
board. All five were rejected. </p>
<p>Each of this year''s 13 director nominees received at least
92 percent of the preliminary votes, Barron said. Shareholders
also approved 35 million additional shares to be used for
equity-based compensation during the next year. Morgan Stanley
said in its proxy that the shares are needed to address calls
from regulators that a greater proportion of pay be in stock. </p>
<p>Fewer than 50 outside shareholders attended the meeting,
which lasted about 40 minutes and was held at the headquarters
of Morgan Stanley''s wealth-management unit. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s biggest
drugmaker, told a federal jury that it lost billions of dollars
in sales from unauthorized copies of the epilepsy drug Neurontin
and it wants the money back. </p>
<p>Pfizer claims copies of the pill made by Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) and its Ivax unit, along with
Actavis Group hf''s Purepac unit, infringe a patent that expires
in 2017. During opening statements yesterday in federal court in
Newark, New Jersey, the generic-drug makers rejected the claim
and told jurors that the brand drug only became a blockbuster
for Pfizer because of the company''s illegal marketing activity. </p>
<p>Low-cost versions of Neurontin have been on the market
since 2004. While a district court judge initially ruled that
the low-cost versions didn''t infringe Pfizer''s patent, a federal
appeals court in 2007 overturned the ruling. </p>
<p>Neurontin, whose active ingredient is gabapentin, was a
$2.5 billion-a-year drug for New York-based Pfizer before the
copies entered the market. The patent at issue covers a process
to make gabapentin with fewer contaminants. </p>
<p>Ivax, then a standalone company, began selling a variation
of the drug in August 2004. Purepac started selling its generic
version in October 2004 with Teva after the companies agreed to
share any potential legal loss. Pfizer''s sales in 2005 plunged
to $150 million a year, according to its lawyer, Jack
Blumenfeld. </p>
<p>Ninety-four percent of the Neurontin market disappeared
within that year, he said. It had an impact of more than $2
billion that first year, and more as time went on. </p>
<p>Petah Tikva, Israel-based Teva, the world''s biggest
generic-drug company, and Iceland-based Actavis, which has U.S.
offices in Morristown and Elizabeth, New Jersey, contend the
patent is invalid because it''s an obvious variation of already
expired patents, including one that ended in 2000. </p>
<p>Pfizer didn''t want to risk good, honest competition in
the marketplace, said Elizabeth Holland, a lawyer for Ivax.
That''s what this case is really about. </p>
<p>The generic drugmakers contend that, even if they lose on
the patent question, Pfizer shouldn''t be able to recoup money it
obtained because of the unlawful promotion of Neurontin. </p>
<p>Novartis AG (NOVN)''s Sandoz generic-drug unit also was part of the
case and settled last month. Terms weren''t disclosed. </p>
<p>The case is Warner-Lambert Co. v. Purepac Pharmaceutical,
00-cv-2931, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey
(Newark). </p>

<p>Ericsson Said to Weigh Entering Contest for Nortel Patents </p>
<p>Ericsson AB is considering an offer for some patents being
auctioned off by Nortel Networks Corp., increasing the number of
potential bidders to at least four, said two people familiar
with the plans. </p>
<p>Ericsson hasn''t made a final decision on whether to make an
offer or which patents it is most interested in, said the
people, who wouldn''t be identified because the company''s plans
aren''t yet public. The Stockholm-based company is considering
teaming with another company on the bid, and has approached
Google Inc. (GOOG), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Intel Corp. (INTC), one of the people
said. </p>
<p>Nortel, a Canadian phone-equipment maker that filed for
bankruptcy in January 2009, has already attracted several
potential bidders for its portfolio of wireless and technology
patents. Google, whose Android software runs phones made by
Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co.,
offered $900 million last month in what Nortel said was a
starting point for an auction. </p>
<p>RPX Corp., a San Francisco-based patent-buying firm, is
considering a bid, an attorney for the company said this month.
Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) is also weighing an offer, two people
familiar with the company''s plans said last month. </p>
<p>The growing interest may boost the price for Nortel''s
patents to more than $1 billion, said Rich Ehrlickman, president
of Boca Raton, Florida-based patent broker IPOfferings. </p>
<p>Ericsson has a large patent portfolio and is always
looking to expand it, said Patricia MacLean, a spokeswoman for
Ericsson in Canada. She declined to comment further. </p>
<p>Aaron Zamost, a Google spokesman, and Chuck Malloy, a
spokesman for Intel, said they don''t comment on rumors. Leonardo
Ortiz Villacorta, director of corporate communications for
Microsoft, said the company has royalty-free rights to all
Nortel patents because of a 2006 cross-licensing agreement, and
wouldn''t elaborate further. </p>
<p>The Nortel patents cover telecommunications technology,
used in wireless handsets and networks, as well as Internet
search, semiconductors and social networking. Specific patents
on new touchscreen and conferencing technologies help to explain
what has attracted such a range of companies, said Akshay
Sharma, an analyst with Gartner Inc. </p>

<p>Sony Chairman Stringer Calls Hacker Attack Hiccup'' in Road </p>
<p>The hacker attack that crippled Sony Corp. (6758)''s PlayStation
Network and Qriocity entertainment services was a hiccup in
the company''s online strategy, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Howard Stringer said. </p>
<p>Nobody''s system is 100 percent secure, Stringer said
yesterday in a phone interview, his first public comments on the
attack.  This is a hiccup in the road to a network future. </p>
<p>Stringer, 69, spoke in an interview almost a month after
Sony, maker of the PlayStation console, shut down its online
movie, music and games services. Hackers obtained data on more
than 100 million users, the company acknowledged. </p>
<p>The Tokyo-based company is working to determine whether
other computer systems were invaded, Stringer said. Authorities
in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere haven''t provided Sony with
details of criminal investigations into the attacks, he said. </p>
<p>Stringer apologized on May 5 in a blog and offered U.S.
users of Sony''s PlayStation Network and Qriocity services a year
of free identity-theft protection, backed by a $1 million
insurance policy per user covering legal and ID-restoration
costs, as well as lost wages that occur after data is stolen. </p>
<p>The company yesterday also offered users a package of free
games and movie services as compensation. </p>

<p>Leahy Seeks Update of Digital Privacy Law to Add Smartphones </p>
<p>U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy unveiled legislation yesterday
that would require the government to obtain a search warrant to
access location information gathered by companies from their
customers'' wireless devices. </p>
<p>The bill seeks to update the 25-year-old Electronic
Communications Privacy Act, according to Leahy, a Vermont
Democrat who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee and wrote the
original law. </p>
<p>Updating this law to reflect the realities of our time is
essential to ensuring that our federal privacy laws keep pace
with new technologies and the new threats to our security,
Leahy said in a statement. </p>
<p>Under the bill, the U.S. government must obtain a search
warrant or a court order in compliance with the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Act to obtain or use location
information from an individual''s smartphone or other mobile
device. </p>
<p>The Leahy legislation is an effort to address government
access to locational data, which 25 years ago was not an issue
and now is subject to conflicting court rulings, Marc Rotenberg,
executive director of the Washington-based Electronic Privacy
Information Center, said in an interview. </p>
<p>Hatch Urges Intellectual Property Focus in Trade Accord </p>
<p>Senators Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican, and Maria
Cantwell, a Washington Democrat, urged President Barack Obama to
back intellectual-property protections in talks on a Pacific Rim
free-trade agreement. </p>
<p>We urge you to continue to seek the highest IP standards
as your administration finalizes its proposals in this area,
Hatch and Cantwell, joined by 26 colleagues, wrote in a letter
to Obama yesterday. They said Obama should reject efforts to
weaken intellectual property protections. </p>
<p>New Suits </p>
<p>Societe Generale (GLE) Sues Ex-Trader Alleging Theft of Secrets </p>
<p>Societe Generale SA, France''s second-largest bank by market
value, accused a former foreign-exchange trader of
misappropriating trade secrets involving clients for his future
employer, Credit Agricole SA. (ACA) </p>
<p>Societe Generale, in a lawsuit filed yesterday in federal
court in Manhattan, seeks an order to force the ex-trader, Karma
Tenzing, to return the data. The bank said Tenzing was a junior
salesperson on its foreign exchange desk from January 2010 until
April 28, when he left for Credit Agricole, France''s third-
largest bank by market value. </p>
<p>The documents Tenzing allegedly took from the bank''s New
York office and its computer server were found on the hard drive
of a computer in his New York office, according to the suit. </p>
<p>Knowing full well that his lack of a book'' and minimal
contacts made him less desirable as a candidate, he set upon a
scheme to make himself more marketable to a competitor,
Societe Generale said in the complaint. </p>
<p>Anne-Sophie Gentil, a spokeswoman for Credit Agricole,
couldn''t be reached for comment after business hours in Paris. </p>
<p>No one answered a telephone listed in Tenzing''s name in
Queens, New York. </p>
<p>Societe Generale asked the court for an injunction, or
order, barring Tenzing from disclosing the trade secrets to
others and for unspecified monetary damages. </p>
<p>Laura Schalk, a spokeswoman for Societe Generale, didn''t
immediately return a voice-mail seeking comment left at her
office after business hours. </p>
<p>The case is Societe Generale v. Tenzing, 11-CV-3366, filed
in the Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) said the Fukushima

atomic power in the next 25 years. </p>
<p>Nuclear power will be unchanged at 8 percent of the total
energy mix in 2030 compared with 6 percent in 2005 as forecast
in the company''s annual energy outlook which was published in
early January. </p>
<p>Nuclear is going to be an important power generation fuel
for the future, it is a low carbon energy source and we believe
diversification of energy sources is important, said Rob Gardner, manager for the energy and economics division of Exxon
Mobil''s Corporate Strategic Planning department, at a media
briefing in Dubai today. </p>
<p>Countries including the U.S., China and Germany are
reassessing their use of atomic power after a March 11
earthquake and tsunami destroyed power lines and flooded diesel
generators at Tokyo Electric Power Co.''s Fukushima Dai-Ichi
plant, depriving its cooling systems of electricity. Fuel rods
in four of the plant''s six reactor buildings overheated, causing
fires, explosions and radiation leaks in the world''s worst
nuclear incident since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. </p>
<p>Utilities in Britain don''t need to shut down or reduce
output at reactors after Fukushima, the U.K.''s chief inspector
of nuclear installations said. In an interim report, Mike
Weightman recommended 25 areas for review by mid-June, including
the layout of existing plants and emergency response. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil expects 19 percent of power to be generated by
nuclear energy by 2030 compared with 17 percent in 2005,
according to its outlook. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the most
profitable U.S. bank, is taking trading revenue from Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) as investments
including its $1.7 billion purchase of RBS Sempra''s commodities
business begin paying off, Deutsche Bank AG analysts said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s share of total trading revenue among the top
five broker-dealers has risen to 24 percent during the first
quarter from 21 percent a year before, Deutsche Bank analysts
Matt O''Connor and David Ho told clients in a research note after
meeting with Chief Financial Officer Doug Braunstein yesterday. </p>
<p>We came away more confident than ever that share gains in
FICC trading are sustainable as management noted that strong
relative trading results recently reflect the benefits of
investment spend over the past couple of years, the analysts
said, referring to JPMorgan''s fixed-income, interest-rate,
currency and commodities trading unit. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which had 26 percent of the trading market
last March, and Bank of America, which had 21 percent, both lost
ground to JPMorgan, according to Deutsche Bank''s data. Goldman
Sachs''s market share fell to 24 percent, while Bank of America''s
dropped to 19 percent. Run by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, </p>
<p>JPMorgan is already seeing higher revenue from individual
clients from investments in its capital markets business,
O''Connor and Ho wrote. </p>
<p>First-quarter net income for the New York-based bank
climbed to a record $5.56 billion. Almost 43 percent of that
profit came from the investment bank, where earnings fell 4
percent to $2.37 billion from a year earlier. Fixed-income and
equity markets revenue, where trading results are reported, was
$6.6 billion, or 81 percent of the investment bank''s revenue in
the first quarter. </p>
<p>Proprietary Trading Restrictions </p>
<p>Regulatory restrictions on proprietary trading and
international capital rules won''t result in a meaningful
loss in revenue for the second-largest U.S. bank by assets,
O''Connor and Ho said. They reiterated their buy
recommendation on the stock and raised their 12-month price
target to $54 from $52 a share. JPMorgan fell 87 cents to $43.13
at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </p>
<p>Expenses will remain high and JPMorgan''s mortgage book has
cost the company $22 billion since 2009, averaging $3 billion to
$4 billion a quarter, according to the note. Braunstein said
additional mortgage hits were likely and could linger for
another 12 to 24 months, O''Connor and Ho said. They estimated
the company will take another $3 billion in mortgage-related
litigation charges this year and again in 2012, although our
bias is they could be higher. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) was sued by NES
Financial Corp. for allegedly defrauding it in the purchase of a
tax-related business, leaving NES with billions of dollars in
potential liability. </p>
<p>NES Financial, in a complaint filed in federal court in
Manhattan yesterday, claimed that JPMorgan improperly hid a
lengthy history of legal violations when it sold its Section
1031 tax-deferred exchange business to NES in 2008. </p>
<p>While NESF thought it was purchasing a business that
would solidify its reputation for quality and trustworthiness,
it received a business that saddled it with potentially massive
liability, the company claimed in its complaint. </p>
<p>As a result, NES Financial said, it is unable to raise
capital from outside investors and its value dropped to
$7 million from about $41 million before the sale. </p>
<p>NES Financial helps its clients avoid U.S. taxes by
facilitating so-called 1031 exchanges, according to its website.
Section 1031 of the U.S. Tax Code permits the owners of certain
types of property used for business or investment to exchange
them for property of like kind, without recognizing a loss

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world''s largest computer-services provider, plans to
invest $100 million exploring how companies can mine data like
its game show-winning machine Watson does. </p>
<p>The company will use the money for research in the next two
to three years, studying how to find trends among words or
sentences scattered around the Web. The company will sift
through user information on sites like Facebook and Twitter,
said Rod Smith, vice president of emerging Internet technologies
at IBM. </p>
<p>I need to harvest parts of that information to improve my
products if I''m a business, Smith said in an interview. The
problem is, finding your product is like finding a needle in a
haystack, and that''s where analytics comes in. </p>
<p>By 2015, IBM projects $16 billion in revenue from business
analytics and optimization, one of Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano''s focus areas for sales growth. The amount of data in
enterprises is estimated to increase by more than 650 percent in
the next five years, and 80 percent of it will be unstructured,
or information in the form of words, sentences and video
streams, according to research firm Gartner Inc. </p>
<p>IBM, based in Armonk, New York, used the same technology in
Watson, its computer that bested humans to win the game show
Jeopardy! The machine understands words and sentences rather
than the formatted data computers normally process, according to
IBM. </p>
<p>Insight From Data </p>
<p>The process can be used elsewhere, for example, to sift
through user complaints about software malfunctions and to
discover problematic trends, said Steven Sams, a vice president
in IBM''s global technology services. It could also tell a
business which of its applications are easiest to move to the
"cloud," or delivered over the Internet, versus those that might
not be worth it, he said. </p>
<p>The company is beefing up some of its products with data

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Bristol-Myers Squibb

prevent deadly clots after surgeries to replace hips or knees. </p>
<p>It''s the first approval for the drug, to be sold under the

medicine may reach annual sales of $2.63 billion by 2015 if
broader indications are approved, according to the average
estimate of three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>About 40 percent to 60 percent of people undergoing hip or
knee surgery are at risk of developing blood clots, known as
venous thromboembolic events, if not treated preventively, the
New York-based companies said. The treatment is being studied in
60,000 patients to prevent and treat clots and strokes in a
variety of health disorders. </p>
<p>The approval of Eliquis gives European orthopedic
surgeons a new option, said Michael Rud Lassen, the lead
investigator for a late-stage trial of the drug. Apixaban is
more effective than the current standard of care. </p>
<p>There are about a half-dozen pills now in development to
replace the blood-thinners warfarin and aspirin as the standard
treatments to prevent blood clots in patients with the erratic
heart rate known as atrial fibrillation. Competing drugs include
Boehringer Ingelheim''s Pradaxa and Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) and Bayer
AG (BAYN)''s Xarelto. </p>
<p>Boehringer''s drug was approved in the U.S. in October for
patients with an irregular heartbeat. Both drugs already are
sold in Europe to prevent clots after hip and knee surgery. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) promoted
Mark Sorrell and Anthony Gutman to become co-heads of its U.K.
investment banking unit, succeeding Julian Metherell. </p>
<p>Sorrell, 37, and Gutman, 36, were formerly co-chief
operating officers of U.K. investment banking, Richard Gnodde,
co-chief executive officer of the firm''s European unit, said in
an internal memo to employees. The contents were confirmed by a
spokeswoman in London today. </p>
<p>They will replace Metherell, who left Goldman Sachs this
month to join former BP Plc CEO Tony Hayward''s planned 1
billion-pound ($1.6 billion) energy-investment fund. Sorrell,
the son of WPP Group Plc CEO Martin Sorrell, joined Goldman
Sachs in 1994 and was a former head of the European natural
resources group. Gutman joined from Citigroup Inc. in 2007 as a
managing director advising companies in the retail industry. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is revamping the leadership of its investment
banking unit after the firm lagged behind JPMorgan Chase  Co.
and Morgan Stanley in advisory revenue during the first quarter.
The firm this week named Gnodde, 51, co-head of its investment
banking division, which includes mergers and acquisitions as
well as stock and bond underwriting, alongside David M. Solomon
and John S. Weinberg. The unit generated $1.27 billion in first-
quarter revenue, less than 11 percent of the firm''s total. </p>
<p>The firm is the top-ranked adviser on mergers and

<p>After sitting on one of Mexico''s
biggest war chests, Coca-Cola Femsa SAB needs acquisitions more
than ever as its main rival''s profit increases twice as fast. </p>
<p>Mexico''s largest Coke bottler has doubled its cash hoard in
the past two years to $1.1 billion, more than all but two of the
nation''s 27 consumer-goods companies, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Coca-Cola Femsa has more cash versus debt than any
time since 2002, when the Mexico City-based company announced
its biggest takeover, the data show. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Femsa hasn''t struck a deal greater than $100
million in three years and is losing ground after Embotelladoras
Arca SAB agreed to buy Mexico''s third-largest bottler this year.
Arca''s shares have gained about three times as much as Coca-Cola
Femsa since the end of 2008. As Coca-Cola Femsa seeks takeovers,
its finance chief says Arca''s deal may spur family-owned Latin
American bottlers to sell. The company may also look at Chile''s
Embotelladora Andina SA (AKO/A), according to Corp. Actinver SAB, or
Coca-Cola Co.''s Philippines franchise, said JPMorgan Chase  Co. </p>
<p>They have a large cash position and they want to use it
for acquisitions, said Jose Miguel Garaicochea, who helps
manage about $1 billion, including Coca-Cola Femsa shares, in
Mexico City for a Banco Santander SA unit. Arca''s takeovers put
pressure on Coca-Cola Femsa, he said. Obviously, one would
want them to buy and buy cheap and that would help growth. </p>
<p>Kent Landers, a spokesman for Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co.,
declined to comment, as did Guillermo Garza, a spokesman for
Arca. Veronica Diaz, with Embotelladora Andina, did not respond
to a voice mail seeking comment. </p>
<p>Not Under Pressure </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Femsa isn''t under pressure to make acquisitions,
said Jose Castro, the company''s investor relations chief. Larger
acquisitions take a long time to negotiate, and Coca-Cola Femsa
won''t be rushed into overpaying, he said. The company didn''t buy
franchises in Ecuador and South Korea because of price, he said,
declining to comment on future potential targets. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Femsa''s cash and short-term investments increased
to $1.1 billion as of March from $445 million at the end of 2008,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Its total cash is the most for
any consumer-goods company based in Mexico after its majority
owner Fomento Economico Mexicano SAB of Monterrey with $2.31
billion and the $2.27 billion held by Grupo Modelo SAB, the
brewer of Corona beer, the data show. </p>
<p>Investors and everyone are kind of waiting for something
to happen, Lauren Torres, an analyst with HSBC Holdings Plc in
New York, said in an interview. For them to be sitting on this
cash and not putting it to good use does cause concern. </p>
<p>Net Cash </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Femsa''s cash is projected to exceed borrowings by
yearend, JPMorgan estimates. That would be the first time in
eight years, just before the company completed its largest
acquisition, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Net debt is
currently $296 million. </p>
<p>In 2002 Coca-Cola Femsa agreed to pay $3.6 billion in cash
for Panamerican Beverages Inc., then Latin America''s biggest
soft-drink distributor with operations in eight countries in the
region. The deal, which closed in May 2003, took four years to
negotiate, said Coca-Cola Femsa''s Castro. The company also
bought a Brazilian bottler in 2008 from Coca-Cola Co. (KO) for $364
million. </p>
<p>Shares of Arca, Mexico''s second-largest Coke bottler, have
surged since it agreed in January to buy Tampico, Mexico-based
Grupo Continental SAB for 27.7 billion pesos ($2.3 billion) in
stock. Arca has risen 21 percent, outstripping Coca-Cola Femsa''s
3.8 percent increase. Mexico''s benchmark IPC index fell 6.3
percent in that span. </p>
<p>Profit Growth </p>
<p>Arca and Grupo Continental, commonly known as Contal, will
form a bottler called Arca Continental that had $3.3 billion in
combined revenue last year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Coca-Cola Femsa had sales of $8.2 billion in 2010. </p>
<p>Analysts estimate that Arca''s per-share earnings will
increase 25 percent this year, versus 11 percent for Coca-Cola
Femsa, using generally accepted accounting principles. </p>
<p>Investors want to see them move this cash to do
acquisitions and continue growing the business, Karla Pena, an
analyst with the Mexico City brokerage Actinver, said of Coca-
Cola Femsa. </p>
<p>Arca''s Contal transaction adds to the two Argentine
bottlers purchased in 2008 and the $345 million cash acquisition
last year of a Coca-Cola franchise in Ecuador, which Coca-Cola
Femsa executives said they had considered. </p>
<p>Shares of Monterrey-based Arca have climbed 191 percent
since the end of 2008, almost triple the 64 percent gain for
Coca-Cola Femsa. </p>
<p>Bill Gates </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Femsa is 54 percent owned by Fomento Economico
Mexicano, known as Femsa, and the Coca-Cola Co. holds a 32
percent stake. The Bill Gates Foundation and Cascade Investment
LLC, which manages money for billionaire Gates, own 8.7 million
of Coca-Cola Femsa''s American depositary receipts as the top two
investors in the U.S. shares, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Embotelladora Andina, Chile''s largest Coca-Cola bottler,
would be an attractive acquisition for Coca-Cola Femsa,
according to Actinver''s Pena and Greenwood Capital Associates.
The Santiago-based company, which has a market value of 1.54
trillion Chilean pesos ($3.3 billion), will post record profits
this year and next, according to analysts'' estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Brazil accounted for 46 percent of Embotelladora Andina''s
sales last year, with 33 percent from Chile and 21 percent in
Argentina, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Chilean Bottler </p>
<p>If I were them, I''d focus on what I know best, which is
Latin America, said Walter Todd, who helps manage $950 million
at Greenwood Capital in Greenwood, South Carolina. The Chilean
bottler, the exposure that they have to Chile, Brazil and
Argentina, it would be very good for them. </p>
<p>Chairman Jose Antonio Fernandez said last year that Coca-
Cola Femsa won''t limit its acquisitions search to Latin America. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Femsa may seek to acquire Coca-Cola Co.''s North
America bottling franchise, according to Matt McCormick, a money
manager at Cincinnati-based Bahl  Gaynor Inc., which oversees
$3.6 billion. Coca-Cola Co. bought back the operations in
October for about $12.3 billion. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Co. may name multiple partners in North America
and Coke Femsa has to figure prominently in the list, Carlos Laboy, a New York-based analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, said
in an interview. </p>
<p>Laboy said in a report to clients in October that Coca-Cola,
the world''s largest soda maker, may ultimately break up its
newly acquired North American bottling operations into four
regional units and sell them. Coca-Cola Femsa would be a top
candidate, according to the report. </p>
<p>Philippines Franchise </p>
<p>Buying one of the units could cost Coca-Cola Femsa more
than $3 billion, if each is valued equally. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Femsa may also consider buying Coca-Cola Co.''s
bottling franchise in the Philippines, according to Alan Alanis,
an analyst with JPMorgan in New York. In 2007 Coca-Cola Co.
acquired the 65 percent of Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines Inc.
it didn''t own for $590 million from San Miguel Corp., valuing
the entire operation at about $908 million. </p>
<p>There''s an increased likelihood that they would have to
go outside of Latin America to fulfill their acquisition
plans, Alanis said. </p>
<p>If Coca-Cola Femsa were to pursue all three potential
acquisitions in Chile, North America and the Philippines, the
total price tag would be more than $7 billion. </p>
<p>Latin American Bottlers </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Femsa Chief Financial Officer Hector Trevino said
the Arca merger with Contal may prompt Coca-Cola bottlers in
Latin America to explore selling. </p>
<p>We will see a new wave of at least some curiosity from
some of the owners to look at a potential transaction, Trevino
said in an earnings conference call April 27. We''ll continue
to be active. </p>
<p>Bahl  Gaynor''s McCormick says Coca-Cola Femsa should
return more cash to shareholders rather than pursue takeovers. </p>
<p>They have a bunch of cash in their pocket, he said.
Acquisitions are one of the alternatives that people like, but
usually they take longer to impact the bottom line. Dividends
would be their best bet. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Femsa has already increased its dividend 67
percent to 4.36 billion pesos ($370 million) this year. Trevino
said last month that management would raise payouts if it can''t
find any deals. </p>
<p>They generate a lot of cash so investors want to see them
move this cash to do acquisitions and continue growing,
Actinver analyst Pena said. They simply want the money to be
used somehow. If they see it''s not doing anything, then it can
hurt the share price. </p>
<p>Overall, there have been 9,601 deals announced globally
this year, totaling $948.1 billion, a 21 percent increase from
the $786.5 billion in the same period in 2010, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>

<p>More institutions and wealthy
individuals are looking to provide startup and expansion capital
to profit from new Asian hedge funds and help them expand,
Morgan Stanley (MS) prime brokers said. </p>
<p>The New York-based bank is helping negotiate several
opportunities for investors to give money to new hedge funds 
for a share of their fee revenue and deals in which they will 
provide capital to expand assets across Asia, said Hugh Abdullah, 
its Hong Kong-based head of capital introductions in the region. 
In demand are event-driven funds and equity long-short managers 
who bet on rising and falling stocks, he said. </p>
<p>True hedge fund talent is a scarcer resource out here,
said Abdullah in an interview yesterday. People always want to
find the next winner. </p>
<p>Investors added $3.6 billion of capital to Asia-focused
hedge funds in the first three months, the largest quarterly
inflow they have attracted since Chicago-based Hedge Fund
Research Inc. started to track such data. Managers in the region
are courting seeders and those who can provide so-called
acceleration capital because the $88 billion Asian industry is
still hovering at 79 percent of its 2007 size, even after global
hedge fund assets hit a record $2.02 trillion by March,
according to HFR. </p>
<p>Investors provide seed capital to new hedge funds typically
in exchange for a share of their fee revenue and sometimes an
equity stake in the business. Acceleration capital helps small
managers which have been in operation for a few years to expand
assets to a size that could attract institutional capital. </p>
<p>Raising the Odds </p>
<p>If you can find a very good manager in Asia, and they''re
of institutional quality, and you build up the right business
around them, the probability of their success of raising
additional funds is usually a little bit higher, Abdullah said. </p>
<p>Growth in assets in the region has been concentrated in a
small group of managers, Abdullah said. </p>
<p>In Asia, a number of funds are entertaining using a
seeder to boost their assets to the $50 million to $100 million
level just to be viewed as being more investable by other
investors, Abdullah said. </p>
<p>Blackstone Group LP (BX)''s $150 million seed capital helped
former Citadel LLC trader Nick Taylor to start his own Senrigan
Capital Group Ltd. The Hong Kong-based event-driven fund --
which wagers on securities affected by mergers, acquisitions,
reorganizations, and asset spinoffs -- in April became the first
Asian hedge fund startup since 2009 to reach $1 billion in
assets, two people with knowledge of the matter said then. </p>
<p>Scouting Opportunities </p>
<p>Azentus Capital Management Ltd., a hedge fund run Morgan
Sze, a former global head of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s
principal strategies proprietary trading, started trading on
April 1 after raising $1.06 billion, the most by an Asia-based
hedge fund startup since at least 2007, said three people
familiar with the fund earlier this month. </p>
<p>There are a mixture of specialized hedge-fund seeding
companies, funds of hedge funds and high-net-worth individuals
from the U.S., Europe, and to a lesser extent from Asia,
scouting for such opportunities, Abdullah said. </p>
<p>The deals Morgan Stanley is helping to negotiate involve
investments ranging from $30 million to more than $70 million,
Abdullah said, declining to identify them as the talks are
confidential. </p>
<p>You are starting to see certain people offering much
larger tickets, he said. However, there are only a handful
of groups which can realistically write tickets of $100 million
plus. </p>
<p>Blackstone </p>
<p>Blackstone recently raised $2.4 billion for its second
seeding fund, the industry''s biggest. Goldman Sachs has spent
the past year trying to attract clients for a similar pool.
Reservoir Capital Group, Larch Lane Advisors LLC and PineBridge
Investments LLC also are marketing new funds for such
investments. </p>
<p>Pulse Capital Partners LLC, a U.S.-based provider of seed
and acceleration capital, announced earlier this month it was
backing new Asian event-driven fund Ardon Capital Management Ltd.
The amount of Pulse''s investment wasn''t disclosed in the
statement. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is making a
third attempt in 17 years to crack the Russian market, this time
by leveraging a $1 billion private-equity bet to win deals and
wooing the Kremlin for roles in asset sales. </p>
<p>The effort is paying off. The firm has jumped to second
place in advising on Russian mergers and acquisitions this year,
behind Morgan Stanley, after failing to make the top three for
more than a decade, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It has also
secured pledges from companies including Mail.ru Group Ltd. (MAIL) and
Tinkoff Credit Systems to arrange equity and Eurobond deals in
return for investing more than $1 billion of its own money. </p>
<p>The bank, led by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein,
who visited Russia twice in the past year, struggled after
opening its first office in Moscow in 1994. It scaled back soon
after as part of a worldwide retrenchment, returned in 1998
weeks before Russia defaulted, withdrew almost entirely after
the crisis and ramped up again in 2006. Since then, the firm has
more than tripled its workforce in Moscow to 150. </p>
<p>The old perception of Goldman Sachs in Russia is that we
haven''t been consistent in our efforts in this country, said
Christopher Barter, co-head of Goldman Sachs in Russia, in an
interview in Moscow May 12. This is not the reality today. </p>
<p>Advising Medvedev </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets,
jumped to fourth place in handling equity sales for Russian
companies last year, its highest position ever, behind VTB
Capital and Renaissance Capital, both based in Moscow, and
Morgan Stanley. The company has underwritten the third-largest
amount of foreign debt this year, up from 13th place in 2010. </p>
<p>While Goldman Sachs has been slower to expand in Russia
than rivals such as Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)
because of concerns about the integrity of financial markets, it
may become a co-investor alongside a new $10 billion state-owned
private-equity fund, according to two sources familiar with the
matter. Blankfein, 56, who along with other bank executives is
advising Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on transforming
Moscow into a global financial center, is also pushing to win
mandates for the Kremlin''s $30 billion privatization program. </p>
<p>The key to success has been private equity, according to
Barter, who called it a major differentiator. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, based in New York, has made more direct
investments in privately held Russian businesses than any
foreign bank, buying stakes in 15 companies totaling more than
$1 billion since 2007, Barter said. The firm''s four private-
equity bankers in Moscow made the purchases on the condition
that Goldman Sachs get mandates later, according to a person
familiar with the deals who asked not to be identified because
he wasn''t authorized to speak about them. </p>
<p>Mail.ru Stake </p>
<p>That has been a magnet for companies wanting pre-IPO
financing, said Barter, who has worked for Goldman Sachs since
1993 and became co-head of the Moscow office in 2007. A Russian
speaker, he shares the job with Jean Raby, a French-Canadian who
relocated to Moscow in January from Paris, where he headed
operations, and is just learning the language. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s investment in Moscow-based Mail.ru helped
the bank score a role in the Russian internet company''s $912
million initial public offering in London in November. The stock
surged as much as 41 percent on its first day of trading as the
IPO was more than 20 times oversubscribed. Goldman Sachs has
since helped Mail.ru founder Yuri Milner, CEO of Russian
venture-capital firm Digital Sky Technologies, and his partner,
Alisher Usmanov, raise $1 billion to finance future investments. </p>
<p>Global Behemoth'' </p>
<p>DST is an amazing case study, said Barter, whose first
client in Russia was Milner, 49. Something really small and
unknown in Russia that develops into something truly
entrepreneurial, and then grows into a global behemoth by
focusing on the Internet and not the commodity space. </p>
<p>DST Global, Milner''s first fund, owns about 10 percent of
social-networking company Facebook Inc., based in Palo Alto,
California. He and Usmanov have backed some of Silicon Valley''s
fastest-growing businesses. They led a $135 million investment
last year in Groupon Inc., the largest provider of online daily
deal coupons, and were part of a group that put $180 million
into Zynga Game Network Inc., a social-gaming service, in 2009. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs raised $1.5 billion for Facebook in January
in a round of financing that valued the firm at $50 billion. </p>
<p>Along with Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman Sachs
is also managing this week''s IPO on the Nasdaq Stock Market for
Yandex NV, the owner of Russia''s most popular search engine. </p>
<p>Private-Equity Fund </p>
<p>Goldman is a credible player in Russia, and now it has
individual success stories like Mail.ru to showcase, said
Kirill Dmitriev, a former Goldman Sachs banker appointed May 18
to run the government''s $10 billion private-equity fund. </p>
<p>The bank also acquired a stake in Tinkoff, a Moscow-based
credit-card issuer, in 2007, according to two people familiar
with the matter. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup Inc. managed the
sale of $175 million of Tinkoff bonds in April. Barter declined
to discuss the firm''s clients, and Oleg Tinkov, the owner of the
company, couldn''t be reached for comment. </p>
<p>The same month Goldman Sachs also managed the sale of $1
billion of 10-year bonds for Alfa Bank, Russia''s biggest private
lender, and $850 million of Eurobonds for Evraz Group SA, the
country''s second-largest steelmaker. </p>
<p>Foreign private-equity companies, except Forth Worth,
Texas-based TPG Capital, have avoided Russia, which remains a
difficult place to do business. The country is the world''s most
corrupt major economy, according to Berlin-based Transparency
International''s 2010 Corruption Perceptions Index. It ranked
154th among 178 countries, tied with Tajikistan and Kenya. </p>
<p>Investor Uncertainty'' </p>
<p>There''s political uncertainty for investors ahead of next
year''s presidential elections, but also uncertainty about
reasonable investor interests being upheld in many cases, said
Richard Hainsworth, CEO of RusRating, an independent credit-
ratings firm in Moscow. </p>
<p>David A. Viniar, Goldman Sachs''s chief financial officer,
expressed similar concerns to investors in February 2006, four
months before Blankfein was appointed chairman and CEO, saying
it isn''t clear to us that the Russian authorities are as set
on turning the financial markets into modern financial markets
with the rule of law as the Chinese authorities are. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs first did business in Russia in 1926, when
Western banks, including many from the U.S., helped the
Communist government raise cash for rural electrification and
other projects. The window closed in 1929 when Josef Stalin
consolidated power and the U.S. stock market crashed. </p>
<p>1994 Opening </p>
<p>The 142-year-old firm didn''t open an office in Russia until
1994, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, only to pull back
in a global retrenchment. The bank returned in June 1998, weeks
before the Russian government defaulted on ruble debt, causing
hundreds of millions of dollars in trading losses for securities
firms worldwide. While the company maintained a representative
office in Moscow after the default, it significantly scaled back
operations, according to a person familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>They didn''t see how they could make money then, said
Chris Weafer, chief strategist at UralSib Financial Corp. in
Moscow. Goldman has been accused of many things, but it has
never been confused with a charity. It''s always all about making
money, and Russia is no different. </p>
<p>Not long after Blankfein took over in June 2006, he sent
David Schwimmer, his Russian-speaking former chief of staff, to
Moscow to help run investment banking. The firm won approval
that year to become a stand-alone broker-dealer and opened an
office in 2007 to accommodate securities sales and trading. In
2008, it got permission to set up a bank. </p>
<p>Letter to Putin </p>
<p>Blankfein has been courting the Kremlin since at least
April 2007, when he wrote to then-President Vladimir Putin
seeking a meeting to discuss expanding operations. He told
investors in New York in June 2007 that the firm couldn''t afford
to miss opportunities in Russia and other developing economies. </p>
<p>If you forgo the opportunities in emerging markets,
you''re putting your global franchise at risk, Blankfein said
at the time, acknowledging that he had built his career in
part on not being seduced by certain fads of people investing in
emerging markets. </p>
<p>The bank''s board of directors travelled to Russia in June
2008 for a four-day meeting split between St. Petersburg and
Moscow. The trip included a tour of the State Hermitage Museum,
a private session with Putin and a speech by former Russian
leader Mikhail Gorbachev, according to an account in Andrew Ross Sorkin''s book about the 2008 global financial crisis. </p>
<p>BRIC Capital </p>
<p>Today, deploying capital to the so-called BRIC countries --
Brazil, Russia, India and China -- is a priority for Goldman
Sachs''s securities division, Barclays analysts wrote in a
research note on May 11 after meeting with Viniar and David B. Heller and Harvey M. Schwartz, two of four co-heads at the
bank''s securities unit. </p>
<p>Part of the allure for foreign investment banks is advisory
work on the government''s plan to sell $30 billion of assets by
2015 to replenish state coffers and improve corporate
governance. The Kremlin is auctioning companies including OAO
Sovcomflot, Russia''s biggest shipper, and OAO Russian Railways,
the rail monopoly, to help cover a budget shortfall it sees at
about 1 percent of gross domestic product this year. It expects
privatizations to generate about 1 trillion rubles ($32 billion)
in the next three years. </p>
<p>Russia''s last major IPO of a state-owned company was in
2007, when VTB Group, the country''s second-biggest lender,
raised $8 billion. Goldman Sachs, which worked alongside
Deutsche Bank and New York-based Citigroup on the offering, was
selected with 22 other lenders to be an adviser on the new round
of asset sales. </p>
<p>Greater Opportunity'' </p>
<p>Banks, such as Goldman, will have a considerably greater
opportunity to earn fees from deals and advisory work than was
the case over the past 10 years, said UralSib''s Weafer. The
next government will have to accelerate efforts to make the
economy more efficient and to raise investment spending to
create new industries and to improve infrastructure. Otherwise
the country faces a much slower growth outlook and, potentially,
a risk of social instability. </p>
<p>Russia will emerge from the global financial crisis by 2012
and must double productivity over the next decade to achieve its
goal of becoming one of the top five economies, Putin, now prime
minister, said on April 20. The economy expanded 4 percent last
year, rebounding from the worst recession since the Soviet era.
It contracted 7.8 percent in 2009, in the wake of the global
credit crunch, after posting an average annual growth rate of
almost 7 percent from 1999 to 2008. </p>
<p>Deutsche Bank Falters </p>
<p>While investment-banking competition has stiffened with the
emergence of domestic players such as VTB, Goldman Sachs is
doing better than Deutsche Bank, which has regressed since 2007,
when it was the top manager of equity sales in Russia, second in
MA and third in Eurobonds. VTB, which created a brokerage in
2008, has hired more than 100 people from its German rival. Last
year, Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank was sixth in equities and
MA and seventh in Eurobonds. </p>
<p>Andrew Chulack, head of global banking at Deutsche Bank in
Russia, said his company is well-positioned and had regained
momentum following the financial crisis. Deutsche Bank is the
second-biggest manager of equity deals this year, having worked
on a $640 million IPO for Nomos Bank and VTB''s $3 billion share
sale. In the Eurobond market, its bankers are in seventh place. </p>
<p>VTB''s emergence hurt domestic banks more than foreign ones,
Chulack said. </p>
<p>Good Niche'' </p>
<p>VTB has a good niche, is very well-positioned locally,
but is not a direct competitor to us or other foreign investment
banks on deals, he said. </p>
<p>Renaissance Capital, a Moscow-based investment bank half
owned by billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov, declined to comment, as
did Troika Dialog, Moscow''s oldest brokerage, which is being
acquired by OAO Sberbank, Russia''s largest lender. </p>
<p>The independent banks were under pressure because they
didn''t have big balance sheets, said Rustam Botashev, deputy
head of research at UniCredit SpA in Moscow. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley and Zurich-based Credit Suisse have both
profited in Russia because of consistent commitment and strong
leadership, RusRating''s Hainsworth said. </p>
<p>A great deal of work here is down to relationship with
the company or the oligarch, he said. </p>
<p>Last year was the biggest for Russian MA since 2007,
helped by 96 deals worth $50.9 billion in the fourth quarter
alone, according to Bloomberg data. Goldman Sachs, second to New
York-based Morgan Stanley last year, advised on 21 deals worth
$36 billion, including Wind Telecomunicazioni SpA''s $6.5 billion
merger in April with VimpelCom Ltd., Russia''s third-largest
mobile phone operator. </p>
<p>The bank is currently advising Russian potash producer OAO
Uralkali on its $7.8 billion acquisition of rival OAO Silvinit. </p>
<p>Bond-Sale Fees </p>
<p>Managing bond sales helps banks to increase their role in
other revenue-generating businesses, including trading the debt
and providing borrowers with hedging instruments and loans. Fees
from debt origination account at most for about 2 percent of
banks'' revenue, according to Mark Rubinstein, deputy head of
research at IFC Metropol in Moscow. </p>
<p>Banks get lower fees for underwriting ruble bonds compared
with sales in the U.S. Underwriters charge between 0.05 percent
of the issue and 0.15 percent for the most creditworthy issuers,
and as much as 0.2 percent for second-tier companies, said
Evgeny Vorobyev, a fixed-income analyst at Otkritie Financial
Corp., a brokerage in Moscow partly owned by VTB. The rates
compare with average fees of 0.593 percent for U.S. corporate
bonds sold this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which has an offshore Russian wealth-
management unit in London, plans to hire more personnel in the
Russian capital, according to Raby, co-head of the office there. </p>
<p>Hainsworth, a former Renaissance Capital banker who has
worked in Russia since 1981, remains skeptical about the bank''s
prospects, notwithstanding its recent advances. </p>
<p>Each time, Goldman has come with a big fanfare and said
they were committed before turning on their tails and running,
he said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the U.S.
bank that gets most of its revenue from trading, is facing a
widening gap between its assigned credit rating and that implied
by market performance, Moody''s Capital Markets Research said in
a note to clients. </p>
<p>The ratings implied by the performance of Goldman Sachs''s
securities in the stock, bond and credit-default swap markets
are each at least four grades below the firm''s credit rating of
A1, analyst Allerton Smith said today. Moody''s Capital Markets
Research is separate from the Moody''s ratings company that has
assigned Goldman an A1 rating and negative outlook. </p>
<p>Goldman''s equity-implied rating has fallen two grades to
Ba2, below investment grade, and seven grades below its actual
rating, as its shares have dropped 19 percent this year.
Investors are concerned about the firm''s reputation after
investigations into its collateralized debt obligations
business, Smith wrote. </p>
<p>Given Goldman''s current franchise issues and reputational
challenges, as well as its negative rating outlook, investors
should be wary of additional headline driven spread
deterioration and the company''s continued decline in market-
implied ratings, which signal underperformance in the credit
markets, Smith said in the note. </p>
<p>CDS contracts on Goldman Sachs have widened the most of any
major U.S. bank this year, leading to its CDS-implied rating
dropping one grade to Baa3, according to the note. The firm''s
bond-implied rating also has dropped one grade this year to
Baa2. Those implied ratings were the same as Citigroup Inc. (C),
Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) as of May 18, according
to the note. </p>
<p>Government Backing </p>
<p>Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, didn''t immediately return a call for comment. </p>
<p>Goldman''s A1 rating from the Moody''s ratings company
includes a one-grade increase from the assumption of government
support, and the negative outlook reflects the possibility that
assumption may be removed, according to the note. </p>
<p>The U.S. Senate''s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations,
led by Michigan Democrat Carl M. Levin, used Goldman Sachs as a
case study in its two-year examination of the financial crisis.
When the subcommittee released its 640-page report last month,
Levin said that Goldman Sachs misled clients and Congress about
the firm''s bets on the housing market. </p>
<p>The testimony we gave was truthful and accurate and this
is confirmed by the subcommittee''s own report, Lucas van Praag, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, said at the time. </p>
<p>Levin and Oklahoma Senator Thomas A. Coburn, the
subcommittee''s ranking Republican, formally referred their
report to the Department of Justice and the Securities and
Exchange Commission, which are reviewing the findings. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the largest U.S.
oil company, had an upset that caused flaring at the Joliet,
Illinois, refinery, according to a filing with state regulators. </p>
<p>The upset began May 21 before midnight local time and the
release of gases was ongoing, the company said in a filing with
the Illinois Emergency Management Agency. </p>
<p>Kevin Allexon, a Fairfax, Virginia-based spokesman for
Exxon, couldn''t immediately be reached by e-mail for comment. </p>
<p>Refinery outages can increase prices for refined products
as refiners turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts. Operational disruptions can also depress prices for
crude oil because less feedstock is needed. </p>
<p>The 248,000-barrel-a-day refinery processes primarily
Canadian crude and produces gasoline, diesel, liquefied
petroleum gas and asphalt among others, according to the Exxon

<p>HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) lost a bid to
dismiss a lawsuit by a group of Taiwanese banks that accuse HSBC
Bank USA of helping deceased financier Danny Pang''s PEMGroup
defraud them of more than $500 million. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Philip Gutierrez on May 19 rejected
HSBC''s arguments that the banks should have brought their claims
in the British Virgin Islands, where the PEMGroup entities that
issued the securities were based, rather than in Los Angeles. He
also dismissed contentions that the banks didn''t provide enough
facts to support their fraud and conspiracy claims. </p>
<p>These allegations, taken together, create a reasonable
inference that, based on the close business relationship between
HSBC and PEM Group, as well as the material incentives HSBC
stood to gain by providing investors with misleading or
inaccurate data regarding the investments, HSBC had sufficient
knowledge of PEM Group''s fraud, Gutierrez said in his order. </p>
<p>Hua Nan Commercial Bank claimed $191 million in losses; Hua
Nan Investment Trust, $48 million; Cosmos Bank Taiwan (2837), $45
million; EnTie Commercial Bank (2849), $50 million; Bank SinoPac, $122
million; and Taichung Commercial Bank (2812), $70 million, according to
their October complaint. </p>
<p>The banks said HSBC, the cash and asset custodian for the
PEMGroup securities, lied to investors about how long the bank
had serviced PEMGroup''s investments and falsely represented that
PEMGroup''s prior investment products had been performing in
conformity with their offering memoranda. </p>
<p>Gutierrez dismissed fraud and negligent misrepresentation
claims by EnTie and Taichung. The banks were allowed to restate
their claims in an amended complaint. </p>
<p>Juanita Gutierrez, a spokesman for HSBC in New York, said
the bank wouldn''t comment on pending litigation. </p>
<p>Pang committed suicide in September 2009. </p>

<p>Strauss-Kahn Lawyer Says Accusations Will Be Proven False </p>
<p>Dominique Strauss-Kahn''s lawyer said the first findings of
his investigation show that accusations by a hotel maid that the
former International Monetary Fund chief tried to rape her are
false. </p>
<p>Benjamin Brafman, the lawyer, said he is confident
Strauss-Kahn will be acquitted after a trial. Brafman spoke in
an interview with France''s national TF1 television from Israel,
where he was staying for personal reasons, according to the
French broadcaster. </p>
<p>From what I have seen already in the file, I am
confident, said Brafman, whose comments in English were
translated into French for broadcast. If he can have a fair
trial, at the end of the hearings he will be acquitted. From the
investigations we have carried out, I believe the accusations
will prove false. </p>
<p>Strauss-Kahn, 62, is charged in state court in New York
with sexual assault and attempted rape of a hotel housekeeper in
Manhattan on May 14. Strauss-Kahn, who resigned as IMF managing
director on May 18, was released from the Rikers Island jail
complex on May 20 after posting $1 million to the court as part
of his bail agreement. He also posted a $5 million bond as a
guarantee that he will appear for trial. </p>
<p>The former French finance minister is staying temporarily
at a building in lower Manhattan that includes residential
units. </p>
<p>In an indictment filed May 19, Strauss-Kahn is charged with
criminal sex acts, attempted rape, sexual abuse, unlawful
imprisonment and forcible touching. While he has denied the
accusations, he hasn''t entered a formal plea to any of the
charges. He is scheduled to be arraigned June 6. </p>

<p>New Suits </p>
<p>Banque Syz Sued by Madoff Trustee for $73.3 Million </p>
<p>Banque Syz  Co. was sued for $73.3 million by the trustee
liquidating Bernard L. Madoff''s firm. </p>
<p>The Swiss bank, which received the money from so-called
feeder funds, knew or should have known of numerous
irregularities about the con man''s firm because of its
expertise in private banking and institutional asset management,
trustee Irving Picard said in a May 20 bankruptcy court filling. </p>
<p>Calls to the Geneva bank''s main number went unanswered
outside of regular business hours. </p>
<p>Banque Syz, which had an account in New York with Madoff''s
firm, filed a customer claim seeking to recover funds it said it
lost on Madoff investments, according to Picard''s filing. In the
process, the bank submitted to the jurisdiction of the
bankruptcy court and should reasonably expect to be subject to
New York jurisdiction, the trustee said. </p>
<p>The case is Irving H. Picard v. Banque Syz  Co., 11-02149,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>
<p>JPMorgan Sued by NES Financial Over 2008 Sale of Business </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) was sued by NES Financial Corp. for
allegedly defrauding it in the purchase of a tax-related
business, leaving NES with billions of dollars in potential
liability. </p>
<p>NES Financial, in a complaint filed in federal court in
Manhattan May 19, claimed that JPMorgan improperly hid a
lengthy history of legal violations when it sold its Section
1031 tax-deferred exchange business to NES in 2008. </p>
<p>While NESF thought it was purchasing a business that
would solidify its reputation for quality and trustworthiness,
it received a business that saddled it with potentially massive
liability, the company claimed in its complaint. </p>
<p>As a result, NES Financial said, it is unable to raise
capital from outside investors and its value dropped to $7
million from about $41 million before the sale. </p>
<p>NES Financial helps its clients avoid U.S. taxes by
facilitating so-called 1031 exchanges, according to its website.
Section 1031 of the U.S. Tax Code permits the owners of certain
types of property used for business or investment to exchange
them for property of like kind, without recognizing a loss
or gain for tax purposes. </p>
<p>Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan Chase spokeswoman, didn''t

<p>Trials/Appeals </p>
<p>Wal-Mart, CVS Drug Case Sent Back to West Virginia Court </p>
<p>Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS) and four other
drug retailers lost their bid to move to federal court a lawsuit
by the state of West Virginia over pricing of generic drugs on
claims the case was a class action. </p>
<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, said May
20 that the drug retailers failed to show that the state was
pursuing a group lawsuit, or class action, which would have
required the litigation to be handled by a federal court. The
four other defendants are Target Corp. (TGT), Walgreen Co. (WAG), Kroger Co. (KR)
and Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD)''s Kmart chain. </p>
<p>The lawsuit was brought under a West Virginia statute
regulating the practice of pharmacy and the West Virginia
Consumer Credit Protection Act, neither of which includes
provisions providing for a typical class action, the appeals
court wrote in its 2-1 decision. </p>
<p>West Virginia Attorney General Darrell McGraw sued the
retailers in state court in Boone County, alleging the stores
overcharged state residents while filling prescriptions in
violation of two state laws. West Virginia law requires
substitution of generic drugs when available and requires
pharmacies to pass on the savings from using generics to
consumers, according to the state''s lawsuit. </p>
<p>The defendants sought to move the case to federal court in
Charleston, West Virginia, claiming the lawsuit was a
disguised class action. </p>
<p>In a dissent, U.S. appeals judge Ronald Lee Gilman, said
West Virginia''s case has the elements of a class action and
should remain with the federal court. </p>
<p>There is a saying that if something looks like a duck,
walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it is probably a
duck, Gilman said. </p>
<p>Greg Rossiter, a spokesman for Bentonville, Arkansas-based
Wal-Mart, said Gilman''s dissent sums up the company''s view
nicely. </p>
<p>Molly Koenst, a spokeswoman for Minneapolis-based Target,
declined to comment. </p>
<p>Kimberly Freely, a spokeswoman for Sears, based in Hoffman
Estates, Illinois, and Keith Dailey, a spokesman for Cincinnati-
based Kroger, declined to comment. Tiffani Washington, a
spokeswoman for Deerfield, Illinois-based Walgreen, and
Christine Cramer, a spokeswoman for Woonsocket, Rhode Island-
based CVS Caremark, also declined to comment. </p>

<p>Verdicts/Settlement </p>
<p>JJ Unit Ordered to Pay $10 Million Over Motrin Injuries </p>
<p>A Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) unit must pay $10 million in damages to
the family of a 13-year-old girl who suffered skin burns and eye
damage after she took Children''s Motrin to treat a fever and
cough, a Pennsylvania jury ruled. </p>
<p>Jurors in state court in Philadelphia deliberated for 10
hours over two days before holding JJ''s McNeil Consumer
Products unit liable for Brianna Maya''s injuries. Maya, now 13,
was left blind in one eye and suffered burns over 84 percent of
her body after taking Motrin in 2000 when she was 3 1/2. </p>
<p>The ruling means that JJ and McNeil will be called to
task for failing to properly warn parents about Motrin''s
risks, Keith Jensen, a lawyer for Maya and her family, said in
an interview after the verdict was announced May 20. </p>
<p>JJ, the world''s second-biggest seller of medical products,
recalled more than 40 consumer brands last year, among them
varieties of children''s and infants'' Tylenol, Motrin and St.
Joseph Aspirin, over fears they had been tainted by production
problems. The withdrawals cost the New Brunswick, New Jersey-
based company $900 million in sales and prompted regulators to
exercise more oversight at McNeil plants. </p>
<p>The drugmaker strongly disagrees with today''s verdict and
we are considering out legal options, Marc Boston, a McNeil
spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>The case is Maya v. Johnson  Johnson, 002879, February
Term 2009, Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County
(Philadelphia). </p>

<p>Sirius XM Wins Preliminary Approval of Class-Action Accord </p>
<p>Sirius XM Radio Inc. (SIRI) won a judge''s preliminary approval to
settle a class-action lawsuit by a group of subscribers who
claimed the satellite-radio company violated antitrust law by
boosting prices after acquiring its only rival. </p>
<p>A hearing will be held Aug. 8 to determine whether the
settlement, valued at $180 million, is fair, reasonable and
adequate to the class, U.S. District Judge Harold Baer said,
according to a filing May 20 in Manhattan. No cash payments will
be made under the deal, court papers show. </p>
<p>Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. bought XM Satellite Holdings
Inc., its only competitor, in 2008. A subscriber, Carl Blessing,
sued in December 2009 claiming the company abused its monopoly
power after the merger by raising prices, breaching subscriber
contracts and making false and misleading statements to the
public. </p>
<p>Baer certified the complaint as a class action in March. A
settlement was reached before the judge ruled on whether New
York-based Sirius XM violated antitrust law. </p>
<p>Patrick Reilly, a Sirius XM spokesman, and James Sabella, a
lawyer for the subscribers, didn''t respond to e-mails seeking
comment. </p>
<p>Under the settlement, Sirius agreed to not raise prices
this year, deferring a plan to boost the monthly price by $2.
Many class members paid a monthly multiradio charge of $8.99,
according to court filings. </p>
<p>The case is Blessing v. Sirius XM Radio Inc., 09-10035,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan.) </p>
<p>Hong Kong''s Lehman Minibond Holders Approve Settlement Offer </p>
<p>Hong Kong investors in notes tied to failed Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) approved a settlement agreement that would return
as much as 96.5 percent of their original investment. </p>
<p>More than the required 75 percent of holders of the
structured notes, or so-called minibonds, passed the accord
following three days of meetings in Hong Kong, according to a
statement from receiver PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP May 20. The
payments may be made in June, it said. </p>
<p>A successful settlement would help end discontent that led
investors to hold almost daily protests outside bank branches in
Hong Kong, featuring banging of cymbals and bullhorns blaring,
after New York-based Lehman''s collapse in September 2008 wiped
out their investments. About 43,000 Hong Kong investors had
bought an estimated $1.8 billion of the minibonds from lenders. </p>
<p>The agreement covers about 31,000 buyers. Investors in the
24 series of bonds will get 70 percent to 93 percent of their
money back, PwC said in March. Banks distributing the minibonds
offered an additional payment that would bring eligible
investors'' recovery levels to as much as 96.5 percent. </p>
<p>A July 2009 repayment offer from 16 banks of at least 60
cents on the dollar for a total of HK$6.3 billion ($810 million)
failed to mollify some investors. Bank of China Ltd. (3988)''s Hong Kong
unit was the biggest seller of the notes on the island, while
HSBC Holdings Plc is the trustee for the minibonds program. </p>
<p>The notes were sold to investors including the elderly and
poorly educated people as well as mentally ill individuals,
according to an investigation by the city''s de facto central
bank that was made public by lawmakers in April 2009. </p>
<p>The current settlement, reached between HSBC and the Lehman
estate, is conditional upon the court order being valid. </p>
<p>BP Says Mitsui Will Pay $1 Billion in Gulf Spill Settlement </p>
<p>BP Plc (BP/) said a unit of Mitsui  Co. will pay $1.065 billion
to settle claims from last year''s Gulf of Mexico spill, the
first payment by one of the U.K. oil producer''s partners in the
failed Macondo well. </p>
<p>BP reached an agreement with MOEX Offshore 2007 LLC, which
had a 10 percent stake in the well, covering all claims between
the companies related to the spill, the London-based company
said May 20 in a statement. Mitsui said BP had claimed about
$2.1 billion. BP shares rose the most since January. </p>
<p>To have one, admittedly the smaller of the two partners,
settling and joining sides is significant from the moral
point of view, David Stedman, a London-based analyst at Daiwa
Securities, said by phone. It looks on paper as a reasonably
good deal for Mitsui, </p>
<p>The Macondo well blowout, which killed 11 workers and
caused the biggest U.S. oil spill, led to hundreds of lawsuits
against BP and its partners and contractors. BP said it''s
working to ensure other parties, including Anadarko Petroleum
Corp. (APC), which held 25 percent in Macondo, rig owner Transocean
Ltd. (RIG) and cement provider Halliburton Co. (HAL), contribute
appropriately. </p>

<p>SEB, HVB Lose Asia Pacific Breweries Gambler Fraud Appeal </p>
<p>Bayerische Hypo-und Vereinsbank AG and SEB AB lost an
appeal to Singapore''s top court seeking to recover $58.6 million
in loans taken out by a former Asia Pacific Breweries Ltd. (APB)
executive to fund his gambling habits. </p>
<p>Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, also known as SEB, and HVB
were among four banks that had handed out S$117.1 million ($94.6
million) in loans in an elaborate fraud engineered by Chia
Teck Leng, the brewer''s former finance manager, Chief Justice
Chan Sek Keong wrote in a 99-page ruling May 20. </p>
<p>Japan''s Mizuho Financial Group Inc. and Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group Inc. withdrew their case against Singapore-based
Asia Pacific Breweries, which makes Tiger Beer, and Chia on the
seventh day of the trial. </p>
<p>They tell a cautionary tale of how two foreign banks in
their eagerness to secure a banking relationship with Asia
Pacific Breweries failed to exercise due diligence, Judge Chan
wrote. Chia, called a compulsive gambler, was jailed for 42
years in 2004 for cheating and forgery. </p>
<p>Asia Pacific Breweries was itself a victim of fraud and
is not responsible to repay loans, Chief Executive Officer
Roland Pirmez said in a statement to the Singapore Exchange May
20. </p>
<p>Both European banks had argued that Asia Pacific Breweries
should be liable for their losses as Chia was the most senior

<p>Sirius XM Wins Preliminary Approval of Class-Action Accord </p>
<p>Sirius XM Radio Inc. won a judge''s preliminary approval to
settle a class-action lawsuit by subscribers who claimed the
satellite-radio company violated antitrust law. </p>
<p>A final hearing will be held Aug. 8 to determine whether
the settlement, valued at $180 million, is fair, reasonable
and adequate to the class, U.S. District Judge Harold Baer
said, according to a filing May 20 in Manhattan. No cash
payments will be made under the deal, court papers show. </p>
<p>Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. bought XM Satellite Holdings
Inc., its only rival, in 2008. A subscriber, Carl Blessing, sued
in December 2009 claiming the company abused its monopoly
power after the merger by raising prices, breaching subscriber
contracts and making false and misleading statements to the
public. </p>
<p>Baer certified the complaint as a class action in March. A
settlement was reached before the judge ruled on whether New
York-based Sirius XM violated antitrust law. </p>
<p>Patrick Reilly, a Sirius XM spokesman, and James Sabella, a
lawyer for the subscribers, didn''t respond to e-mails seeking
comment. </p>
<p>Under the settlement, Sirius agreed to not raise prices
this year, deferring a plan to boost the monthly price by $2.
Many class members paid a monthly multiradio charge of $8.99,
according to court filings. </p>
<p>Former subscribers who canceled service would be entitled
to one month of free service. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan
Stanley increased their forecasts for crude-oil prices by more
than 20 percent, signaling a bullish outlook for commodities. </p>
<p>Goldman, which correctly advised investors to sell oil and
copper last month before a price slump, boosted its 12-month
prediction for Brent crude to $130 a barrel from $107, analysts
led by Jeffrey Currie said today in a report. Morgan Stanley
raised its estimate by 20 percent to an average $120 this year
and by 24 percent to $130 in 2012. </p>
<p>While Goldman and Morgan Stanley join JPMorgan Chase  Co.
in saying price declines may present a buying opportunity,
interest-rate increases and the European debt crisis have raised
concerns that global growth may slow. China, the world''s biggest
consumer of everything from energy to copper and soybeans, has
increased borrowing costs four times since mid-October to cool
the fastest inflation since 2008. </p>
<p>Economic growth will likely be sufficient to tighten key
supply-constrained markets in the second half, leading to higher
prices from current levels, the Goldman analysts said. They
also advised buying copper and zinc. </p>
<p>Brent advanced as much as 2.3 percent to $112.65 on ICE
Futures Europe Exchange. Copper for delivery in three months
climbed 0.8 percent to settle at $8,861 a metric ton on the
London Metal Exchange. </p>
<p>Commodities Decline </p>
<p>The Standard  Poor''s GSCI index of 24 raw materials
dropped about 10 percent through yesterday since New York-based
Goldman told investors on April 11 to sell a basket of
commodities including oil, copper and cotton. The gauge rose 1.2
percent today. </p>
<p>We are substantially more confident when the market is
focused on demand growth relative to forward supply constraints
as opposed to near-term transient supply shocks, Currie said
today in a telephone interview in London. </p>
<p>Brent jumped 31 percent this year through April 11 amid
concern that supplies from the Middle East would be disrupted as
protests spread from Tunisia and Egypt. Rising oil prices may be
sowing the seeds of future demand destruction,, the Paris-
based International Energy Agency said on April 12. </p>
<p>Prices of metals and energy dropped more in line with
near-term fundamentals, Goldman said. A sustained loss of
Libyan crude production because of the conflict there and
disappointing output from non-OPEC nations will tighten the oil
market to critical levels in early 2012, the report said. </p>
<p>Gasoline Costs </p>
<p>A pullback in U.S. gasoline prices makes us much more
comfortable about demand as we go into the summer driving season
that kicks off with the Memorial Day this weekend, Currie said
in the interview. </p>
<p>The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will
very likely raise production to make up for an estimated 1.5
million barrels a day shut in by Libya''s civil unrest, Morgan
Stanley analysts led by New York-based Hussein Allidina and
Chris Corda said today. The group has an estimated 2 million
barrels a day that can be brought to the market quickly, the
U.S. bank said. </p>
<p>We see flat prices moving higher as spare capacity
continues its fall to untenable levels, the Morgan Stanley
analysts said. </p>
<p>Sovereign debt in Europe, the contraction in Japan''s
economy and the end of the second round of quantitative easing
in the U.S. are among potential triggers for a loss of
confidence that pose a risk to oil, Goldman said. </p>
<p>Net Longs Drop </p>
<p>Money managers reduced their net-long positions in U.S.
commodity futures and options by 11 percent in the week ended
May 17 to the lowest since July, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. They also reduced bullish bets on oil to a three-
month low. </p>
<p>Yesterday, the MSCI All-Country World Index dropped 1.8
percent to the lowest in two months on signs that Europe''s
credit crisis had deteriorated as costs to protect Greek debt
from default surged to a record. Global manufacturing measured
by a JPMorgan index slowed for two consecutive months and stood
at 55 in April. A reading of 50 and above suggests expansion. </p>
<p>Oil and gold will lead a rally in raw materials as
production fails to keep pace with demand, Ray Eyles, the chief
executive officer of JPMorgan''s Asia commodity business, said in
an interview last week. Oil supplies will trail consumption in
the second half as OPEC and other producers won''t increase
output fast enough, the bank said in a report on May 6. </p>
<p>Copper has declined 13 percent from a record $10,190 a ton
on Feb. 15. Goldman analysts recommended buying futures for June
2012 delivery. </p>
<p>The bank also favors zinc for delivery in December 2012,
forecasting demand to outpace supply next year. The metal, used
in production of galvanized steel, has dropped 11 percent this
year. </p>
<p>Although we do not see the zinc balance as tight as
copper next year, given how low current prices are relative to
industry economics, we believe that zinc price risk is
substantially skewed to the upside, according to the report. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will introduce a new
version of its Windows Phone software by this fall that includes
an enhanced Twitter connection, hands-free messaging and an in-
box for multiple e-mail accounts. </p>
<p>Code-named Mango, the software has 500 added features and
will come out on phones produced by new partners Acer Inc. (2353),
Fujitsu Ltd. (6702) and ZTE Corp. (000063), Microsoft said today in a statement.
Previously announced partners, including Nokia Oyj (NOK1V), also will
produce phones with the new software. </p>
<p>Microsoft is rushing to bolster its phone features after
handsets with the current operating system -- Windows Phone 7 --
didn''t sell as well as analysts projected. The Redmond,
Washington-based company, an early entrant to the smartphone
software field, has lost market share to Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s iPhone and
Google Inc. (GOOG)''s Android in recent years. </p>
<p>What Microsoft introduced looks great -- from a
technology perspective, this is probably what Windows Phone 7
should have launched with, said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst
at Stamford, Connecticut-based Gartner Inc. The problem is
it''s not something shipping immediately. Users aren''t going to
see it until fall. </p>
<p>Bigger Market </p>
<p>Microsoft is banking on reaching more users than it could
before. Mango will be available in additional countries, at
lower prices than the current Windows Phone 7, opening up a
potential market that''s four times larger than its current
opportunity, Andy Lees, president of Microsoft''s mobile
business, said today at a company event. Microsoft is adding
support for languages, including simplified and traditional
Chinese, Japanese, Russian and Korean. </p>
<p>The software will have an e-mail in-box that can combine
messages from several different accounts. It also will include
better integration with Twitter Inc. and LinkedIn Corp.''s social
networks, as well as speech-to-text features that let users
write messages and chat without using their hands. </p>
<p>Mango has facial-recognition software, so users can easily
tag who is in the picture when they post it on Facebook Inc.''s
site. Customers also can switch between text messages, Facebook
chat and Windows instant messages within the same conversation. </p>
<p>Users can group contacts into a personalized tile on their
main phone screen. The tile will then show updates about those
contacts on that screen, without opening any programs. </p>
<p>Current Windows Phone manufacturers HTC Corp., Samsung
Electronics Co. and LG Electronics Inc. also will make phones
with Mango, Microsoft said. </p>
<p>Dell''s Plans </p>
<p>Dell Inc., which also currently makes a Windows Phone, has
nothing to announce at present about a Mango version, said Ellen
Murphy, a spokeswoman for the Round Rock, Texas-based company.
Melissa Havel, a Microsoft spokeswoman, declined to comment on
Dell''s plans. </p>
<p>Microsoft previously discussed the Mango software last
month, saying it would let users run several programs at once
and allow developers to write programs that call up information
about a place or item when it''s viewed through the handset''s
camera. </p>
<p>Microsoft said it shipped more than 2 million copies of its
Windows Phone software in the December quarter, a figure that
fell short of some analysts'' estimates. The company declined to
provide a similar figure for the recent quarter and has refused
to provide sales information, rather than shipments. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s share of the mobile operating system market
fell to 3.6 percent in the first quarter, from 6.8 percent in
the year-earlier period, according to Gartner Inc. Android rose
almost fourfold to 36 percent from 9.6 percent, while Apple''s
iOS climbed to 17 percent from 15 percent. </p>
<p>Microsoft, the world''s largest software maker, fell 2 cents
to $24.15 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
The shares have dropped 13 percent this year. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) hired Huw Pill of the European Central Bank to replace Erik Nielsen as its
chief European economist. </p>
<p>Pill will join the investment bank on Aug. 22 in London
after a decade at the Frankfurt-based ECB, where he was most
recently deputy director general of research, according to an
internal Goldman Sachs memo sent to employees today and obtained
by Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>The recruiting of Pill comes a week since UniCredit SpA (UCG)
named Nielsen its global chief economist after 15 years at
Goldman Sachs. It marks a further revamping of the U.S. bank''s
economic division following Jim O''Neill''s departure as its chief
at the end of last year to chair Goldman Sachs Asset Management. </p>
<p>Pill has also led the ECB''s monetary policy stance division
as well as working at the Bank of England and teaching at
Harvard University, the memo said. He holds a degree from Oxford
University and a Ph.D from Stanford University. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s economics team, which already includes
former ECB economist Natacha Valla, currently expects the
central bank to raise its key interest rate to 1.75 percent by
the end of this year from 1.25 percent. It predicts the euro
area economy will grow 2.1 percent this year with inflation
averaging 2.6 percent. </p>

<p>General Electric Co. (GE) plans to buy $15
million of shares in the initial public offering of Huaneng
Renewables Corp., the wind unit of China''s biggest power
producer, two people with knowledge of the matter said. </p>
<p>A Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) unit and CSR Corp., China''s
largest listed trainmaker, plan to invest $50 million each in
the offering, said the people, who declined to be identified
before an announcement. The three companies are among key
investors who have committed to buying about $300 million of the
IPO stock in total, they said. </p>
<p>The unit of China Huaneng Group Corp. is seeking to raise
as much as $1 billion after cutting the size of the IPO by about
20 percent, the people said. Huaneng Renewables plans to sell
about 2.5 billion shares at as much as HK$3.09 (40 cents) apiece,
they said. </p>
<p>Xinjiang Goldwind Science  Technology Co., another key
investor, plans to subscribe to as much as $15 million worth of
shares in the offering, the Urumqi-based company said in a
statement to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange yesterday. </p>
<p>Beijing-based Huaneng Renewables scrapped an earlier IPO
plan because of unexpected and excessive market volatility, the
company said on Dec. 13. In the earlier attempt, it offered
about 2.5 billion shares at as much as HK$3.98 each, according
to the prospectus for the sale. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, China International Capital Corp. and
Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) are managing the IPO for Huaneng Renewables,
which plans to start trading in early June, the people said. Hu
Xiaoyu, a director at China Huaneng Group''s news office in
Beijing, declined to comment. Two phone calls to GE''s U.S. media
inquiry line outside regular business hours went unanswered. </p>
<p>China Datang Corp. Renewable Power Co., the wind unit of
the nation''s second-largest power producer, raised HK$5 billion
in a Hong Kong IPO in December. The shares have since lost 1.7
percent. The stock closed at HK$2.29 today. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the largest U.S.
natural-gas producer since its acquisition of XTO Energy Inc.
last year, is slowing drilling in Texas gas fields amid a supply
glut that slashed prices for the fuel. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson may be pressed at
tomorrow''s annual meeting in Dallas to show that the $34.9
billion XTO purchase -- Exxon''s largest transaction since he
became CEO in January 2006 -- hasn''t been a bust, said Manuj Nikhanj of Ross Smith Energy Group Ltd. </p>
<p>Since Exxon completed the XTO acquisition on June 28, Exxon
shares have lagged Chevron Corp., ConocoPhillips and even BP Plc (BP/),
operator of the deep-sea well that triggered the worst-ever U.S.
marine oil spill last year. All those companies have benefited
to a greater degree than Exxon from rallying crude prices. </p>
<p>It''s a gas bet that obviously hasn''t worked yet,
Nikhanj, an analyst at Calgary-based Ross Smith, said in a
telephone interview. Exxon isn''t making any money off the
commodity that XTO was known for. </p>
<p>North American energy markets were flooded with gas after
new drilling techniques allowed producers to tap into previously
inaccessible geologic formations. U.S. gas futures tumbled as
much as 30 percent in the months after the acquisition closed in
June, and remain down 7.7 percent. </p>
<p>Engineers and Scientists </p>
<p>In the XTO purchase, Exxon gained gas and oil fields from
the Texas-Mexico border to North Dakota, as well as a workforce
of 3,000 that includes engineers and geoscientists who pioneered
techniques for tapping gas encased in shale rock. The acquired
assets helped drive a 24 percent increase in first-quarter gas
output for Exxon, compared to a 0.6 percent decline in crude
production. </p>
<p>The merger also tilted Exxon''s proved reserves from 51
percent oil at the end of 2009 to 53 percent gas a year later, a
shift that may signal lower earnings in years to come because
gas is 75 percent cheaper than oil, on an energy-equivalent
basis. </p>
<p>Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, is taking steps to curb its
exposure to low natural-gas prices. XTO, which now operates as
an Exxon unit, filed 371 applications to drill wells in Texas
during the first four months of this year, a 16 percent decline
from the same period in 2010, according to the Texas Railroad
Commission, which oversees drilling in the largest oil-and gas-
producing state. </p>
<p>Holding Steady </p>
<p>Exxon doesn''t plan to reduce the number of rigs drilling
wells on XTO projects this year, David Rosenthal, Exxon''s vice
president of investor relations, said during an April 28
conference call to discuss the company''s first-quarter results.
Drilling will concentrate as much as possible on oil-rich areas
to make sure that we''re maximizing the value of that
program, Rosenthal said. </p>
<p>The Exxon Mobil and XTO merger brought together two
highly complementary organizations whose combined strengths
deliver strong shareholder value and open new opportunities for
the production of clean-burning natural gas, Karen P. Matusic,
spokeswoman for Exxon, said in an e-mailed statement. I do not
think you can jump to any conclusions based on a couple months
of rig data in one state. </p>
<p>Gas prices have averaged $4.23 per million British thermal
units this year, after production from U.S. wells rose 4.8
percent to 21.58 trillion cubic feet in 2010, the highest since
1973, according to the Energy Department in Washington. </p>
<p>Prices would need to come up to the $5.50 or $6 range for
a sustained period to allow for perpetual drilling, said Rick
Smead, a Houston-based energy analyst at Navigant Consulting Inc. (NCI)
who has advised gas producers such as Chesapeake Energy Corp. on
strategy. </p>
<p>Competing Fuels </p>
<p>Natural gas has benefited in recent months from rising
prices for coal, a competing fuel for power plants and steel
mills, said Robert Ineson, senior director of global gas at IHS
Inc.''s Cambridge Energy Research Associates. Surging demand for
coal in expanding economies such as China pushed prices to a 26-
month high, and is prompting some electricity generators to
switch to lower-cost gas, he said. </p>
<p>Tillerson, 59, told analysts in March that he intends to
dispatch XTO engineers worldwide to assess fields considered
unconventional because of the intensive techniques required to
harvest the gas or crude. Gas fields in Asia, Europe or Latin
America have the potential to generate higher profits than U.S.
finds because demand has outpaced local production in those
markets, elevating prices, said Brian Youngberg, an analyst at
Edward Jones  Co. in St. Louis. </p>
<p>The XTO transaction has brought Exxon new expertise to
produce fuels from unconventional formations such as shale or
dense sandstone, known as tight sands, said Douglas Ober, chief
executive officer at Petroleum  Resources Corp. (PEO), for whom Exxon
is the largest holding among $837 million under management. </p>
<p>Unconventional Expertise </p>
<p>Exxon already is benefiting from XTO''s expertise, Rosenthal
said in the April earnings conference call. If you look at the
objectives we have of improving capital efficiency, improving
productivity, and lowering operating costs, we are making good
progress and are very pleased with how that''s going, he said. </p>
<p>In November 2009, Exxon abandoned a $75 million effort to
crack open a tight-sand formation in Hungary after striking more
water than gas. Exxon''s geologists and engineers had failed to
detect an underground aquifer on seismic maps of the prospect,
Stephen Schultz, a spokesman for Exxon''s partner in the project,
Falcon Oil  Gas Ltd., said at the time. </p>
<p>The Hungarian prospect involved tight sands similar to
those in the Freestone Trend in Texas that accounted for 28
percent of XTO''s pre-merger production. </p>
<p>Shale formations have the potential to more than double the
world''s gas reserves, the U.S. Energy Department''s Energy
Information Agency said in an April 5 assessment, adding 6,622
trillion cubic feet to 6,609 trillion of conventional gas. </p>
<p>Mobil Acquisition </p>
<p>The XTO transaction has been more positively received by
investors than the $87.7 billion Mobil Corp. transaction in 1999
that was the largest-ever oil industry merger. Exxon''s 16
percent increase since the XTO agreement was announced 17 months
ago is more than double the 8.9 percent gain during the same
time span after the Mobil deal. </p>
<p>Buying XTO was smarter than spending years trying to build
an unconventional drilling business from the ground up and
risking failure, Ober said. </p>
<p>From a financial-returns basis, it''s difficult to say
what kind of result they''re getting at this point from XTO,
Ober said. But from an intellectual-returns perspective, it''s
already paying off. This was never really about XTO''s gas fields
as much as it was about getting hold of their technology and
their people. </p>

<p>The eruption is waning day by day and problems arising in
our neighboring countries as a result of volcanic ash should be
resolved quickly, Icelandic Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir said today in a statement. </p>
<p>Gasoil, the European equivalent of heating oil, advanced in
London. The contract for June delivery gained $17, or 1.9
percent, to $936.25 a ton on the ICE exchange. </p>
<p>The fuel is trading in contango, meaning contracts for
sooner delivery cost less than those expiring later. June
futures traded at a discount of $3.25 a ton to July. A contango
usually reflects a surplus of immediate supplies or declining
demand. </p>
<p>Gasoil barges traded at discounts of $3.75 to $5.50 against
June futures, the survey showed. That compares with deals at
$1.75 to $6 less than June gasoil yesterday. Morgan Stanley was
the main vendor. The bank has sold gasoil barges in every
trading session since May 12. Petrobras International Braspetro
BV, a unit of Petroleo Brasileiro SA, also sold, while Total,
Noble Group and Glencore International Plc. bought. </p>
<p>Ultra-low-sulfur diesel''s premium over June ICE gasoil rose
to $23 a ton, compared with $20 and $22 a ton in the previous
session. Shell was the only vendor, selling four lots to
Mabanaft BV and Total SA. </p>
<p>Residues </p>
<p>High-sulfur fuel oil traded from $616 to $619, up from $603
to $605 a ton yesterday, according to the survey. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the largest U.S.

according to a filing with state regulators. </p>
<p>A compressor trip led to flaring of SO2, Kevin Allexon,
an Exxon spokesman based in Fairfax, Virginia, said in an e-mail
late yesterday. Allexon declined to comment on operational
details like run rates nor will we speculate on when repairs
might be completed. Exxon expects to meet customer commitments
while repairs are made, he said. </p>
<p>The refinery started flaring gases yesterday at 1:30 a.m.
local time, according to a filing with the Illinois Emergency
Management Agency. </p>
<p>The refinery reported an upset late May 21 and said more
than 500 pounds of sulfur dioxide was released, according to an
earlier filing with the agency. The plant started a unit and
flared gas May 23, according to another filing made available
yesterday. </p>
<p>Outages can increase prices for refined products as
refiners turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts. Operational disruptions can also depress prices for
crude oil because less feedstock is needed. </p>
<p>The Joliet refinery is 42 miles (68 kilometers) southwest
of Chicago on the Des Plaines River. </p>

<p>International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
has closed the gap in market value with Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), giving
it the potential to become the second-most valuable technology
company as its bet against personal computers pays off. </p>
<p>The CHART OF THE DAY shows how IBM''s market value has
climbed to nearly that of Microsoft, which was worth three times
as much as IBM in 2000. Microsoft had a market capitalization of
$203.7 billion when markets closed yesterday, compared with
IBM''s $203.5 billion, according to Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>Microsoft, whose Windows and Office software are used
primarily on PCs, lost its spot as the most valuable technology
company last year to Apple Inc. (AAPL), as sales of iPad tablets and
iPhones crimped PC demand. IBM Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano divested the company''s PC business six years ago,
calling it commoditized, to invest in software and services. </p>
<p>IBM, now the world''s largest computer-services provider,
topped Microsoft''s value in intraday trading last week. It
hasn''t closed with a value above its rival since 1996, according
to Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>IBM gained 2 cents to $168.01 at 9:42 a.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading, while Microsoft gained 9 cents
to $24.24 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The companies had
gained 14 percent and lost 13 percent, respectively, this year
before today. </p>

<p>Morgan Crucible Co. (MGCR), the maker of
carbon materials for medical and transportation equipment, won
its dismissal from a U.K. lawsuit filed by Deutsche Bahn AG and
30 other European rail companies over a defunct graphite cartel. </p>
<p>The group needed to sue Morgan Crucible sooner than the
other cartel members because it was a whistleblower in the
underlying European Union case and wasn''t involved in a
challenge to EU fines, the Competition Appeal Tribunal ruled
today. The rail companies waited to sue until after the EU
appeal was finished. </p>
<p>The claims against Morgan Crucible in these proceedings
have not been brought within the time limit, the London court,
which handles U.K. antitrust cases, said in its decision. </p>
<p>The price-fixing, which lasted from 1988 to 1999, caused
customers to pay too much for graphite-based goods used for
transferring electricity in train motors. While Windsor,
England-based Morgan Crucible won immunity from EU fines by
being the first to cooperate, its former Chief Executive Officer
Ian Norris was sentenced to 18 months in prison in a parallel
U.S. case. </p>
<p>One of the rail companies'' lawyers, Lianne Craig of
Hausfeld  Co. LLP, declined to comment when reached today by
phone. </p>
<p>European Union regulators in 2003 levied fines totaling 101
million euros ($142 million) against four of the cartel''s five
members, SGL Carbon SE (SGL), France''s Carbone Lorraine SA, Austria''s
Hoffmann  Co. and Schunk GmbH. The railway companies'' lawyers
have said the case, filed in December, may be the most
significant claim of its kind in Europe. </p>
<p>The case is Deutsche Bahn AG  Others v. Morgan Crucible

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will preview its
Windows operating system designed for tablet computers in
demonstrations planned for next week, according to three people
with knowledge of the company''s plans. </p>
<p>The company will showcase the software''s touch-screen
interface running on hardware with an Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) Tegra chip,
said the people, who declined to be identified because the plans
are confidential. Windows President Steven Sinofsky is scheduled
to present at the All Things D conference, while Vice President
Steve Guggenheimer will address the Computex show in Taipei. </p>
<p>Microsoft is rushing to adapt Windows to better support
devices that can compete with Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s iPad, which dominates
the tablet market. The new operating system won''t be out until
next year, people familiar with the plans said in March. Still,
the company is eager to show it is moving forward, seeking to
generate demand among computer makers and chip suppliers. </p>
<p>Nvidia''s Tegra microprocessor is based on the ARM Holdings
Plc (ARM) technology that dominates the smartphone market. ARM-based
chips are also used in the iPad and tablets that run Google
Inc. (GOOG)''s Android operating system. </p>
<p>Mark Martin, a spokesman for Microsoft, declined to
comment. The company''s shares rose 48 cents, or 2 percent, to
$24.67 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
Nvidia gained 46 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $18.82. </p>
<p>Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said
earlier this week that machines with the new operating system,
which he referred to as Windows 8, would be released in 2012. </p>
<p>In a Race'' </p>
<p>Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, later retracted
the comments, claiming they were a misstatement. The company is
scrambling to expand Windows to computing devices such as phones
and tablets, Ballmer said in a speech in New Delhi today. </p>
<p>We are in a race, he said. We are not doing that
badly, frankly. We are doing pretty well in that race. But the
race is on to continue to push Windows to a variety of new form
factors. </p>
<p>Apple sold 4.69 million iPads in the most recent quarter,
for a total of 19.5 million since the device''s April 2010
release. If the next version of Windows does come out on tablets
in 2012, Apple will likely be selling its third generation of
iPad hardware by then, according to Michael Gartenberg, an
analyst at researcher Gartner Inc. </p>
<p>While Microsoft works on the new Windows software, sales in
the operating-system business are taking a hit as some consumers
choose iPads instead of less-expensive netbook computers that
run Windows. </p>
<p>PC Shipments Slip </p>
<p>Consumer personal-computer shipments dropped 8 percent in
the quarter, Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein said
last month. Sales of netbooks plunged 40 percent, partially
because of defections to tablet computers, he said. </p>
<p>That helped make last quarter the second in a row in which
Windows revenue fell short of analyst estimates. </p>
<p>The demonstration may be a boon to Nvidia, a maker of
graphics processors for PCs, which is trying to break into the
market for tablet computer chips with Tegra. Most tablets are
now built with mobile-phone processors made by Texas Instruments
Inc. (TXN), Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) and Samsung Electronics Co. </p>
<p>Intel Corp. (INTC), whose processors lead in PCs, has been unable
to parlay that dominance into design wins in phones and tablets. </p>
<p>Technology website WinRumors reported earlier that
Microsoft will demonstrate the tablet software design at All
Things D, which is being held in Rancho Palos Verdes,
California. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) lowered its
year-end forecast for the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index to 1,450
from 1,500 and reduced its 2012 earnings projection, citing
weakening economic estimates. </p>
<p>SP 500 companies will post combined profit of $104 a share
next year, compared with Goldman Sachs''s prior estimate of $106,
according to David Kostin, the New York-based equity strategist.
He maintained his 2011 earnings forecast for the SP 500 of $96
a share. </p>
<p>Our adjustments reflect a combination of developments
including recently lowered GDP growth estimates by our
economists in the U.S. and Asia and a significant increase in
our Brent oil price forecast, Kostin wrote today in a note to
clients. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is forecasting U.S. real gross domestic
product growth of 2.6 percent in 2011 and 3.2 percent in 2012,
while it predicts global expansion will be 4.4 percent and 4.8
percent, respectively. The New York-based bank estimates that
the price of Brent crude will reach $120 by the end of this year
and $140 in 2012. </p>
<p>The SP 500 fell 3.2 percent from an almost three-year high
on April 29 through yesterday amid concern about Europe''s debt
crisis and weaker-than-forecast economic data. Still, the
benchmark gauge rose 5 percent since the end of 2010 on
government stimulus measures and higher-than-forecast profits. </p>
<p>The U.S. economy grew at a 1.8 percent annual rate in the
first quarter, less than forecast, reflecting a smaller gain in
consumer spending than previously calculated. The revised rise
in GDP was the same as estimated last month and compared with a
3.1 percent gain in the prior quarter, Commerce Department
figures showed. The median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for a 2.2 percent increase. </p>
<p>Before today, the average estimate of 13 strategists
tracked by Bloomberg called for the SP 500 to rise 6.5 percent
in the last seven months of 2010 to 1,406. Corporate profits in
the benchmark index for U.S. equities may reach $104.73 a share
in the next 12 months as consumer demand pushes sales up 13
percent, according to data from about 9,000 analysts compiled by
Bloomberg. The income estimate rose 2.8 percent in the four
weeks ended May 2. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will support higher
prices on mobile-phone applications from outside developers to
encourage better products, rather than embracing the free or 99-
cent apps common in other companies'' stores. </p>
<p>I''d rather developers sell fewer than a million downloads
and get to a million dollars, Brandon Watson, director of an
apps developer program for Microsoft, said in a press briefing
in Helsinki. If we can support a higher price point that''s good
for developers. </p>
<p>Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) adopted Windows Phone 7 as its primary smartphone
platform in February, saying that it will give the Finnish phone
company and its developers more opportunities to produce
distinctive products than Google Inc. (GOOG)''s Android, which was also
considered. Microsoft on May 24 announced handset agreements
with Acer Inc., Fujitsu Ltd., and ZTE Corp., as well as 500
features to be added in the fall release of Windows Phone 7. </p>
<p>Nokia expands distribution quite a bit, including China,
India, Russia -- it''s very important to have a marketplace in
those countries where developers can sell local apps, Watson
said in an interview. China is going to be very, very big. </p>
<p>Nokia intends to release its first Windows phones in the
fourth quarter, Watson said, adding that he was reiterating
guidance from Nokia''s smartphones chief, Jo Harlow. Along with
the handsets, Nokia will open its own app store for Windows
Phone and is working with Microsoft to convince the thousands of
developers for its Symbian software to write for Windows Phone
as well, he said. </p>
<p>Different Look </p>
<p>It will look slightly different on the phone from the one
that''s for all the other vendors, and they will have more
control over the merchandising, he said. Nokia''s invested
tons of money around building apps, so one of my main jobs right
now is ensuring that we don''t lose a single developer to Android
or iOS, he added, referring to Apple Inc.''s mobile-phone
operating system. </p>
<p>Further features beyond those already introduced, such as
face-recognition software and voice dictation for messages, will
be announced in the coming weeks for the fall release, code-
named Mango, Watson said. </p>
<p>We announced most of the major stuff, but there are more
delighters coming, he said at the briefing, which took place
at an event for app developers. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley agreed to invest $50
million in Yongye International Inc. (YONG), the U.S.-traded producer
of plant nutrients in China that is the target of a short seller
who says the company has misrepresented its business. </p>
<p>Yongye shares surged 42 percent, the most in more than two
years, to $5.33 as of 4 p.m. New York time after Morgan Stanley,
the sixth-largest U.S. bank by assets, said it will invest in
Beijing-based Yongye through its Asian private equity unit. The
stock, which began trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market in 2009
following a 2008 takeover of a U.S. company, is down 37 percent
this year. </p>
<p>After extensive due diligence, we believe Yongye to be an

in China''s agriculture industry, said Homer Sun, managing
director of Morgan Stanley (MS) Private Equity Asia, according to a

<p>Morgan Stanley is offering a vote of confidence to a
company whose stock was down 55 percent in 2011 through last
week amid a hedge fund''s accusation that it manipulated

increase to $15 a share if the company reaches certain
undisclosed profit targets. </p>
<p>Proceeds from the investment will be used to expand

<p>Yongye fell 19 percent on May 19 after Absaroka Capital
Management LLC, a Wyoming-based hedge fund, called the company
a fraud in a report that claimed it has manipulated its
earnings and the stock should be at $1. Yongye defended itself
against the charges, saying Absaroka''s accusations are false and
based on unwarranted inferences from documents that were filed
by third parties with the Chinese government, according to a
statement. </p>
<p>Chinese companies trading in the U.S. through takeovers
have come under growing scrutiny by regulators and investors
amid speculation financial statements from companies such as
China MediaExpress Holdings Inc. (CCME) can''t be trusted. Transactions
called reverse mergers have given hundreds of Chinese
corporations access to the world''s largest capital market,
avoiding the inspection of initial public offerings as hunger
grows for investments in an economy that became larger than
Japan''s last year. </p>
<p>Short Interest </p>
<p>Absaroka Capital Management firmly stands behind the
conclusions of its May 18, 2011, Yongye International report,
said Kevin Barnes, an equity analyst at Absaroka, which holds a
short position against the company. </p>
<p>Short selling, or selling borrowed shares with the hope of
profiting when they fall, accounts for 5.1 percent of Yongye''s
outstanding shares, according to Data Explorers, a New York-
based research firm. That compares with a record of 9.4 percent
at the beginning of April and 6.4 percent at the end of 2010.
The average short interest for stocks in the Standard  Poor''s
500 Index is 2.7 percent. </p>
<p>Yongye is among the most expensive U.S. equities to short.
The cost to borrow the stock to short is rated a 10 by Data
Explorers, the most-expensive level on the research firm''s
scale. </p>
<p>Jim Chanos, the hedge-fund manager known for predicting
Enron Corp.''s 2001 collapse, said last week he''d short sell
Chinese companies listed in the U.S. if it were feasible to
borrow shares to open the bearish positions. The Securities and
Exchange Commission began an investigation last year into the
use of reverse takeovers, in which a closely held firm becomes
public by purchasing a shell company that already trades. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) said it is keeping

because of high water. </p>
<p>The pipelines are still shut down, the water is still
high in area, Patricia Errico, a spokeswoman for ExxonMobil
Pipeline Co. in Houston, said in an e-mail. Exxon said on May 13
it was shutting two 12-inch crude oil lines and a 16-inch

the Mississippi River. </p>
<p>The crude line segments supply Exxon''s Baton Rouge refinery

pipeline originates at the Baton Rouge refinery, according to
Exxon''s website. </p>
<p>Alon shut its 83,000-barrel-a-day refinery near Krotz

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, may boost return on equity by
taking capital from the businesses that invest the firm''s own
money, according to an analyst at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) </p>
<p>Kian Abouhossein raised his recommendation on Goldman Sachs
stock to overweight from neutral because he thinks the
company can release $28 billion of capital from the investing
and lending segment, he said today in a note to investors. The
changes won''t take place immediately, said London-based
Abouhossein, who also lowered his estimate for 2011 earnings per
share to $12.80 from $13.50. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the world''s most profitable securities firm
before converting to a bank during the 2008 financial crisis, is
grappling with new rules that restrict the company''s ability to
make investments on its own behalf. Investing and lending, the
segment that includes the firm''s proprietary trades and its
principal investments in companies and other assets, contributed
30 percent of pretax profit last year. </p>
<p>What we believe is there''s a transformation of the
business from a client-plus-investing business to a client
business and that will allow the group to release quite a bit of
capital, Abouhossein said in a telephone interview. It will
not happen this year clearly as the New York-based firm waits
to see how regulations are implemented, he said. </p>
<p>Abouhossein estimates that after new regulations kick in,
Goldman Sachs''s investing businesses will be using $30 billion
of capital. About $27 billion of that can be returned to
shareholders, shrinking Goldman Sachs''s business and making it
possible to generate 16 percent annual return on equity, an
increase from an estimated 12 percent to 13 percent, he said. </p>
<p>Compensation Expenses </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s shares rose $2.53, or 1.8 percent, to
$141.19 at 10:20 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading and have dropped 16 percent this year. The company had
$119.63 of tangible book value per common share at the end of
March, according to the firm''s most recent quarterly filing. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs can further enhance profit by paying a
smaller percentage of revenue as compensation, Abouhossein
wrote. Goldman Sachs has already cut its so-called compensation
ratio to about 40 percent of revenue from an average of 47
percent in the years 1999 to 2008, Abouhossein said. </p>
<p>It''s very highly likely that comp ratios will further
decline, he said. Goldman can cut more than others on the
comp ratio and still be the most attractive employer for
bankers and traders, he added. </p>
<p>Concerns about Goldman Sachs''s potential legal liabilities
in the wake of the financial crisis and a U.S. Senate
subcommittee report are already discounted by the stock price
and don''t pose significant further risk, Abouhossein wrote.
Goldman Sachs, which Abouhossein said operates as a machine,
can withstand any management changes, he said. </p>
<p>Buying Opportunity </p>
<p>We believe the market is again over-reacting to the
negative news flow, he said. In our view, the price weakness
is a buying opportunity. </p>
<p>Abouhossein''s note said that he had attended a group
meeting with Michael S. Sherwood, Goldman Sachs''s London-based
vice chairman, who serves as co-chief executive officer of the
firm''s business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
Abouhossein didn''t attribute any of the views in his note to
Sherwood and said in the telephone interview that all of his
estimates and opinions on the firm''s future were his own. </p>
<p>Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York,
declined to comment on Abouhossein''s note. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), ranked
first globally in advising on mergers, said takeovers involving
South Korean companies may climb by as much as 27 percent on
government stake sales and local firms buying overseas assets. </p>
<p>Annual deal volumes may expand to $60 billion to $70
billion over the next three to four years, John Kim, Goldman
Sachs''s head of South Korea investment banking and co-country
head, said in an interview in Seoul on May 30. The Asian nation
had about $55 billion in such transactions last year, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Local companies ambitious to expand beyond the domestic
market and those seeking access to resources are stepping up
bids for overseas assets, Kim said. The divesting of stakes in
firms that were bailed out following the 1997-98 Asian financial
crisis has also helped fuel the most takeovers in the first five
months since the same period in 2008, the data show. </p>
<p>More Korean companies are teaming up with private equity
funds and other partners to buy overseas assets, a trend not
many would have imagined five years ago, Kim, 44, said.
Korean buyers have become much more sophisticated about going
abroad. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs vaulted to No. 2 among banks involved in
mergers linked to Korean companies, from No. 10 last year, after
advising buyers of a combined 4.96 trillion won ($4.6 billion)
of stakes in Hyundai Engineering  Construction Co. in the
nation''s largest deal this year. Local rival Korea Development
Bank is ranked first and Seoul-based Woori Investment 
Securities Co. is No. 3, data show. </p>
<p>The New York-based firm also advised a group including
Posco (005490), the world''s third-biggest steelmaker, on buying a stake
in a Brazilian rare-metal producer. </p>
<p>Mid-Sized Clients </p>
<p>The Wall Street firm, which has invested more than $1.5
billion in the nation since 1999, established a representative
office in Seoul in 1992 and made it into a branch in 1998,
according to the company. It got a local banking branch license
in June 2006, and now employs about 180 people in Seoul at the
bank, securities unit and an asset management service. </p>
<p>Kim, who joined the New York-based firm in 2000 after
stints at Merrill Lynch  Co., Salomon Smith Barney and Credit
Suisse First Boston, said Goldman Sachs would consider extending
services to mid-sized Korean companies if they become more
active in overseas acquisitions. </p>
<p>Sales of companies such as Woori Finance Holdings Co. and
Hynix Semiconductor Inc. (000660) are likely to dominate domestic
takeovers, according to Kim. The Financial Services Commission
in May revived a plan to divest the government''s 57 percent
holding, worth 6.4 trillion won based on yesterday''s closing
price, in Woori. </p>
<p>Sheer Size'' </p>
<p>Shareholders of Hynix, the chipmaker that was bailed out by
creditors after the Asian crisis, held meetings in May to resume
attempts to sell their stakes. </p>
<p>The sheer size of large deals, like the sale of Hynix
Semiconductor, will eclipse smaller transactions in terms of
prominence, but the number of overseas acquisitions by South
Korean companies will continue to grow, Kim said. </p>
<p>South Korean companies purchased $13.9 billion worth of
overseas assets last year, 35 percent more than a year earlier,
led by state-run Korea National Oil Corp.''s $2.8 billion
acquisition of U.K.-based Dana Petroleum Plc, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>This year, local companies have announced $4.57 billion of
outbound transactions, the data show. </p>
<p>Overseas Acquisitions </p>
<p>The biggest is the bid by a group led by Seoul-based
sportswear company Fila Korea Ltd. (081660) to buy U.S.-based Acushnet
Co., the maker of Titleist golf balls and clubs, from Fortune
Brands Inc. (FO) for $1.23 billion in cash. The National Pension
Service, Mirae Private Equity and KDB Financial Group Inc. were
among buyers. </p>
<p>More Korean companies may choose to bid for targets abroad
as part of a consortium to reduce the financial burden or gain
access to commodities or energy supplies without owning a
majority stake, Kim said. </p>
<p>Korean firms making outbound acquisitions will be a
notable trend, Kim said. Armed with past experiences and the
financial firepower, they have become more confident and capable
of doing such deals. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is putting
troublesome restrictions on makers of processors used to run
the coming Windows tablet-computer operating system, Acer Inc. (2353)
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer J.T. Wang said. </p>
<p>They''re really controlling the whole thing, the whole
process, Wang said at the Computex trade show in Taipei
without identifying the restrictions. Chip suppliers and PC
makers all feel it''s very troublesome, he said. </p>
<p>Microsoft will unveil a Windows operating system with a
touch-screen interface for tablet computers this week, three
people familiar with the company''s plans said last week. Acer,
the No. 3 maker of personal computers in 2010, is among PC
makers that expect to sell more tablet computers once the
operating system is introduced to narrow the gap with Apple
Inc. (AAPL)''s iPad. </p>
<p>Windows President Steven Sinofsky is scheduled to make a
presentation at the All Things D conference in Rancho Palos
Verdes, California, this week while Vice President Steve Guggenheimer will address Computex. </p>
<p>Microsoft, the world''s largest software maker, will
showcase the interface running on hardware with an Nvidia Corp. (NVDA)
Tegra chip, the people said last week, declining to be
identified because the plans are confidential. </p>
<p>Mark Martin, a spokesman for Microsoft, couldn''t
immediately be reached for comment today. </p>
<p>Tighter controls on how hardware makers use Windows may
enable Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft to bring devices to
the market more quickly and ensure they run smoothly. </p>
<p>Microsoft is rushing to release a version of Windows
compatible with chip technology from ARM Holdings Plc (ARM) so
Windows-based tablet computers can compete with Apple''s iPad,
which controls an estimated 64 percent of the tablet market. </p>
<p>The global market will almost quadruple this year to 70
million units from 18 million in 2010, according to estimates in
a May 17 report by Jefferies Group Inc. Apple will control about
64 percent of the tablet market this year, dropping to 41
percent in 2012, when 158 million units probably will be sold,
according to the report. </p>

<p>     June 1 (Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN) lead dealers purchasing mortgage bonds sold by
the U.S. Treasury since the department began disposing of its
holdings in March. </p>
<p>Sales totaled $10 billion in May, bringing the amount off-
loaded to $23.7 billion, the department said today in an e-
mailed statement from Washington. The Treasury has said it plans
to sell as much as $10 billion a month. </p>
<p>Today is the first time the Treasury disclosed buyers of
the securities, which are guaranteed by government-supported
mortgage-finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. New York-
based JPMorgan bought 17.8 percent of the securities sold since
March, while Zurich-based Credit Suisse bought 11.8 percent,
according to the department''s rankings. </p>
<p>We believe that the publication of this scorecard will
help both maximize taxpayer returns and provide additional
transparency, Mary Miller, the Treasury''s assistant secretary
for financial markets, said in a May 2 statement. </p>
<p>The department began buying Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
mortgage securities after seizing the companies in September
2008 as then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson sought to
stabilize markets and reduce the cost of mortgages amid the
worst global financial crisis and U.S. housing slump since the
Great Depression. </p>
<p>Fed Program </p>
<p>The Federal Reserve the next year started its own program
to purchase $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage securities.
Acquisitions in the $5.4 trillion market ended in March 2010. </p>
<p>The Treasury''s holdings of mortgage bonds fell to $106
billion at the end of May, down 45 percent from a peak of $192
billion in December 2009, according to the department''s data.
Refinancing and home sales tied to loans underlying the bonds
have also shrunk the portfolio. </p>
<p>Barclays Capital and Royal Bank of Canada ranked as the
third- and fourth-largest purchasers from the Treasury since its
sales began, according to the data. Each bought 10 percent, the
data showed. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) won''t face
criminal prosecution related to sales of mortgage-linked
securities because such a move could threaten the U.S. financial
system, according to Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein  Co. </p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice, which is reviewing a Senate
subcommittee report that alleged Goldman Sachs misled clients
before the financial crisis, will avoid jeopardizing the fifth-
largest U.S. bank by assets because it''s viewed as too big to
fail, Hintz wrote in note to clients today. </p>
<p>If an alleged violation is identified during a Goldman
investigation, we expect a reasoned response from the Justice
Department, Hintz wrote. In a worst case environment, we
would expect a too big to fail'' bank such as Goldman to be
offered a deferred-prosecution agreement, pay a significant fine
and submit to a federal monitor in lieu of a criminal charge. </p>
<p>Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment on Hintz''s note. Laura Sweeney, a
spokeswoman for the Justice Department in Washington, didn''t
immediately reply to requests for comment. </p>
<p>Under a deferred-prosecution agreement, the U.S. files
charges against a company and agrees to dismiss them after a
certain period, typically if the company pays a fine or penalty
and improves its governance or other practices. In October, the
Justice Department dismissed a conspiracy case against UBS AG (UBSN),
Switzerland''s biggest bank, after the expiration of an 18-month
deferred prosecution agreement with the Zurich-based bank. </p>
<p>Litigation Risk Manageable'' </p>
<p>Hintz, ranked the No. 1 analyst covering brokerage firms in
a survey by Institutional Investor last year, said that the
Justice Department''s approach to criminal charges against
companies has changed since accounting firm Arthur Andersen
LLP''s business collapsed following a felony charge. </p>
<p>A 2003 Justice Department policy document stated that
prosecutors can reward cooperation by offering a negotiated
settlement to a targeted company that can range from immunity
from criminal indictment to a deferred prosecution agreement,
Hintz wrote. Ultimately, the targeted company is treated not
as a hardened criminal but as the equivalent of a juvenile
offender that can be reformed. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s potential civil litigation risk related to
sales of mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt
obligations is manageable, Hintz wrote, because the statute
of limitations for many of the claims has already passed. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley said U.K. house prices
will continue to decline through 2012 as a squeeze on consumers''
incomes and higher interest rates restrain property demand. </p>
<p>Home values will fall a total of 10 percent in the two
years through 2012, compared with a previous estimate of a 7
percent decline to the end of this year, Morgan Stanley
economists including London-based Melanie Baker and Cath Sleeman
said in a note to clients dated yesterday. The declines will
cause U.K. banks to post larger loan losses, with Lloyds Banking
Group Plc (LLOY) the most exposed to price drops, they said. </p>
<p>Housing demand looks set to be relatively unsupportive
for prices over the next year and a half or so given our
expectation for weak real household disposable income and rising
mortgage rates, Baker and Sleeman said. We don''t expect any
significant further increase in availability of higher loan-to-
value mortgages and expect only modest improvements in credit
availability more broadly. </p>
<p>Bank of England data today showed mortgage approvals fell
more than economists forecast to 45,166 in April. The property
market may come under further strain as the government cuts
spending to reduce the budget deficit and inflation at more than
double the Bank of England''s 2 percent target pressures policy
makers to raise interest rates. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley said rising home-loan arrears will see
Lloyds, whose Halifax unit is the U.K.''s largest mortgage
lender, post cumulative loan losses of 1.4 billion pounds ($2.3
billion) this year and next, compared with 300 million pounds in
2010. By December next year, Lloyds will have 90 billion pounds
of mortgages in negative equity, where the property is worth
less than the loan, the economists said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley expects British home values to drop 3
percent this year and 7 percent in 2012. The forecast is based
on the Bank of England increasing its benchmark interest rate
from its current 0.5 percent to 2 percent in the period. If the
central bank delays raising borrowing costs, that will push back
house-price declines by a year, the U.S. bank said. </p>
<p>The U.K. economy will expand 1.2 percent this year before
growth accelerates to 1.8 percent next year, Morgan Stanley
said. Its predicted house-price declines increase the downside
risk to the 2012 growth forecast, Baker and Sleeman said. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s biggest
drugmaker, settled claims against Teva Pharmaceutical Industries
Ltd. (TEVA) over generic versions of the Neurontin epilepsy drug,
ending a trial in federal court. </p>
<p>Financial terms are confidential, Teva, the world''s biggest
generic-drug company, said in a statement. Teva will be able to
continue selling the copy under a license from Pfizer, according
to a filing in the case. U.S. District Judge Faith Hochberg in
Newark, New Jersey, who was presiding over the trial that began
May 17, dismissed the suit yesterday, according to the court
docket. </p>
<p>Pfizer claimed that copies of the pill made by Teva and its
Ivax unit, along with Actavis Group hf''s Purepac unit, infringe
a patent that expires in 2017. The drugmaker was seeking
compensation for profit it lost when sales plunged to $150
million in 2005 from $2.5 billion the previous year because of
the low-cost competition. </p>
<p>The agreement covers Teva, its Ivax unit and Actavis Group
hf''s Purepac unit, which had an agreement with Teva over its
Neurontin copy, said Chris Loder, a spokesman for New York-based
Pfizer. He declined to provide any financial details. </p>
<p>Low-cost versions of Neurontin have been on the market
since 2004. A federal appeals court in 2007 overturned a U.S.
judge''s ruling that Teva and Ivax didn''t infringe Pfizer''s
patent. </p>
<p>The generic-drug companies also argued that Warner-Lambert
Co., which Pfizer purchased in 2000, turned Neurontin into a
blockbuster drug by illegally marketing it for uses not approved
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In 2004, Warner-
Lambert pleaded guilty and agreed to pay $430 million to resolve
U.S. criminal and civil allegations that it marketed Neurontin
for so-called off-label uses. </p>
<p>The subject of the trial is patent 6,054,482, which covers
a process to make gabapentin, the active ingredient in
Neurontin, with fewer contaminants. </p>
<p>The case is Warner-Lambert Co. v. Purepac Pharmaceutical,
00-cv-2931, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey
(Newark). </p>
<p>Patent Fee Changes Critical'' to Economy, Commerce Tells House </p>
<p>Letting the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office set its own
fees and keep all the money it collects is critical to
promoting innovation, according to the Commerce Department,
which oversees the agency. </p>
<p>The House is considering a measure known as the America
Invents Act that would mark a fundamental change in how patents
are reviewed and the biggest revision to U.S. patent law since
1952. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke wrote in support of the
proposed legislation in letters yesterday to Representative
Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican who chairs the House Judiciary
Committee, and Michigan Representative John Conyers, the panel''s
top-ranking Democrat. </p>
<p>The Senate passed a similar measure in a 95-5 vote on March
8. Locke said the administration, which supported the Senate
version, wants prompt passage of legislation, saying it may
help promote job creation. </p>
<p>Enactment of a balanced bill is an important part of the
administration''s goal of out-innovating'' our economic
competitors and winning the future -- and it can be done with no
cost to taxpayers and no addition to the deficit, Locke wrote. </p>
<p>The House may take up the measure next month, according to
the office of Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a Virginia
Republican. </p>
<p>A key provision of the legislation would give the patent
office more power over its funding by allowing the agency to
alter its fee structure and keep Congress from diverting fees
for non-patent purposes. </p>
<p>This structure is critical to enable the USPTO to better
meet the needs of America''s innovators, Locke wrote,
suggesting there should be technical changes to allow the patent
office to make interim fee adjustments so it can best use this
new authority on day one. </p>
<p>The measure also calls for granting patents to the first
inventor to file an application, eliminating an often years-long
procedure to determine who first came up with an idea. The
first-to-file system is used in most countries. </p>
<p>The House patent bill is H.R. 1249. </p>
<p>SEB Wins U.S. Supreme Court Patent Fight With Global-Tech </p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court, in a decision limiting the rights
of some patent holders, upheld a $5 million award against a
home-appliance maker for persuading retailers to sell a copycat
version of an SEB SA (SK) deep fryer. </p>
<p>The 8-1 ruling set a high bar for claims that one company
induced another to infringe a patent, while saying SEB met that
standard in its suit against Hong Kong-based Global-Tech
Advanced Innovations Inc. (GAI) The majority said the patentholder
must prove the defendant knew about the infringement or at least
was willfully blind to it. </p>
<p>The ruling will help companies that make mobile phones or
design software, said Edward Reines, a patent lawyer with Weil
Gotshal  Manges LLP.  This is a big deal, said Reines, who
filed a brief on behalf of companies including Red Hat Inc. (RHT),
General Motors Co., Yahoo! Inc., EBay Inc. (EBAY) and Hewlett-Packard
Co. (HPQ) In a world with products that are so versatile and
flexible, a higher standard to prove inducement of infringement
makes sense. </p>
<p>The case divided businesses along what have become familiar
lines in patent cases -- with large technology companies
including Google Inc. (GOOG) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) urging limits on
infringement suits, and the drug industry arguing for robust
patent protection. </p>
<p>Writing for the Supreme Court, Justice Samuel Alito said a
lower court standard made it too easy for patentholders to win
suits alleging inducement to infringe. </p>
<p>At the same time, Alito said SEB met the Supreme Court''s
new standard. SEB proved to a jury that a Global-Tech unit
took deliberate steps to avoid knowing that it was selling a
knockoff version of a patented SEB fryer, Alito wrote. </p>
<p>In developing its fryer, Pentalpha bought an SEB fryer in
Hong Kong and copied its cool touch features, Alito said.
Pentalpha never told its lawyer that it had copied the design,
and the lawyer later issued a written opinion that the fryer
didn''t violate any of the patents he had uncovered, Alito said. </p>
<p>Justice Anthony Kennedy was the lone dissenter. </p>
<p>The case is Global-Tech Appliances v. SEB SA, 10-6. </p>

<p>College Bookstore Association Seeks Dismissal of Amazon Suit </p>
<p>A trade group for college bookstores that has challenged
Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)''s advertising claims for discounted textbooks
asked a federal judge to dismiss the online retailer''s lawsuit
against it. </p>
<p>The National Association of College Stores Inc. was sued by
Amazon.com May 3 in a complaint seeking a court order declaring
that its advertised 30 percent discounts on new textbooks and 90
percent discounts on used books aren''t false or misleading.
Amazon asked the court to say those ads didn''t violate federal
trademark law. </p>
<p>In March, the Oberlin, Ohio-based group asked the Better
Business Bureau''s national advertising division to review the
ads, which it says are deceptive and haven''t been substantiated.
Amazon.com hasn''t been harmed by the association or its request
for a review, so the complaint should be thrown out, the group
said in a May 27 filing in federal court in Seattle. </p>
<p>The lawsuit appears to have been filed to thwart the
college store group''s effort to have the Amazon.com ads reviewed
by the bureau, the filing says. The complaint was closed because
the bureau doesn''t accept cases that are the subject of
lawsuits, the filing says. </p>
<p>A voice-mail message left at Seattle-based Amazon.com''s
media office wasn''t immediately returned. </p>
<p>The case is Amazon.com v. National Association of College
Stores Inc., 11-754, U.S. District Court, Western District of
Washington (Seattle). </p>
<p>NCR Sues Blockbuster Trust Over Movie-Rental Kiosks </p>
<p>NCR Corp. (NCR) sued a trust set up by Blockbuster Inc. (BLOAQ) in a bid
to continue licensing the company''s name for movie-rental
kiosks. </p>
<p>The Blockbuster Express name, design and related trademarks
are held by the BB 2009 trust, NCR said in the lawsuit filed in
U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Delaware. Blockbuster, once
the largest video-rental chain, sold its assets to Dish Network
Corp. in April for about $320 million. </p>
<p>Dish rejected the NCR contract and sent the company a
termination letter, NCR said. NCR, based in Duluth, Georgia,
builds kiosks, often placed in grocery and convenience stores,
where customers can rent and drop off movies. The company, which
branded more than 9,000 kiosks with the Blockbuster name, pays
for use of the brand and collects all revenue from rentals. </p>
<p>NCR has undertaken significant time and expense in
establishing and operating kiosks throughout the United States
branded with the trademarks, and has earned substantial revenues
from those operations, Melanie Sharp, an attorney representing
NCR, said in court papers filed May 27. </p>
<p>Blockbuster transferred its interest in the trust to Dish
as part of its asset sale, according to court papers. NCR
contends that the trust wasn''t included in the sale because it
wasn''t part of Blockbuster''s bankruptcy filing. In addition,
only the trust has the right to terminate the license, not Dish,
NCR claims. </p>
<p>Marc Lumpkin, a Dish spokesman, didn''t immediately respond
to an e-mail seeking comment. Dish, based in Englewood,
Colorado, is the second-largest satellite-television provider in
the U.S. </p>
<p>The case is NCR Corp. v. BB 2009 Trust, 11-cv-481, U.S.
District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). </p>
<p>St. Laurent Tells Court Red Shoe Soles Neither New Nor Unique </p>
<p>Yves Saint Laurent America Inc. responded to a trademark-
infringement case brought by Christian Louboutin SA by saying
there is nothing particularly distinctive about putting a red
sole on a pair of shoes. </p>
<p>Louboutin sued St. Laurent in federal court in Manhattan
April 7, accusing the French fashion house of misleading the
public and tarnishing the shoemaker''s reputation. The shoemaker
introduced the red soles in 1992 and since then they have been
on all of the company''s luxury shoes, according to the lawsuit. </p>
<p>On Barneys''s website, Louboutin red-sole shoes are priced
from $445 to more than $4,000 a pair. </p>
<p>Saint Laurent has been selling red-sole shoes under brand
names such as Tribute, Palais and Woodstock at high-end fashion
stores that also sell Louboutin footwear, including Saks Fifth
Avenue, Barneys New York and Bergdorf Goodman, according to the
complaint. </p>
<p>In its response to the complaint, St. Laurent said red
soles have been used for centuries, including those worn by
France''s King Louis XIV in the 17th century. Dorothy, the
heroine of Wizard of Oz clicked together the heels of her
red-soled ruby slippers and was transported home at the end of
the 1939 film, St. Laurent said in its pleadings. </p>
<p>Louboutin cannot plausibly assert that red outsoles are
singularly associated with the Louboutin brand, the French
fashion house said. St. Laurent accused Louboutin of making a
demonstrably false statement to the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office when the shoemaker claimed in a trademark
filing that its use of the red sole was exclusive. </p>
<p>St. Laurent also said that it isn''t using a red sole as a
signature element. It colored the soles of all its shoes to
match the uppers, achieving a monochromatic effect, the company
claims. Yves Saint Laurent, the Algeria-born French fashion
designer for whom the fashion house is named, died in 2008. </p>
<p>In addition to seeking a judicial declaration that it isn''t
infringing, St. Laurent asked the court to order the
cancellation of the Louboutin red-sole trademark and for awards
of money damages, attorney fees and litigation costs. St.
Laurent asked for extra damages because of what it called
Louboutin''s malicious, willful, tortuous interference and
unfair competition. </p>
<p>The case is Christian Louboutin SA v. Yves Saint Laurent
America Inc., 11-2381, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world''s largest
soft-drink maker, is in talks with China''s government to list
shares in Shanghai as the company accelerates expansion in the
world''s most populous nation. </p>
<p>We are interested in exploring the opportunity of
listing our stock on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, Geoff Walsh,
Coca-Cola''s Hong Kong-based public affairs and communications
director for Asia, said in an e-mailed reply to queries. We
continue to have positive discussions with Chinese government
officials as we look at this opportunity. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola, whose Sprite is China''s top-selling soft drink,
will probably raise spending in the country as it invests a
planned $2 billion faster than expected, Chief Executive
Officer Muhtar Kent said in November. China has the world''s
third-biggest stock market, and companies including HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA) are seeking permission to list on its bourses to
raise funds in the Chinese currency. </p>
<p>This would be attractive for Chinese domestic investors
as it would give them more diversity in the type of companies
they can invest in, said Arjuna Mahendran, Singapore-based
head of investment strategy for Asia at HSBC Private Bank,
overseeing $460 billion globally. It also makes a lot of
sense for Coca-Cola as it gives them access to international
activities to fund their Chinese expansion and allows them to
raise funds in yuan. </p>
<p>Building Factories </p>
<p>About 14 percent of Coca-Cola''s $35 billion in sales last
year were made in the Pacific region, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The maker of Minute Maid juice is
building plants in China at a faster pace than it expected as
it jostles for market share with rivals including PepsiCo Inc. </p>
<p>We''ve been ahead on that commitment to invest $2
billion in China from 2009 to 2011, Walsh said in a phone
interview today. He declined to comment further on any plans to
sell shares in Shanghai. </p>
<p>While overseas companies can sell stock in Hong Kong,
they''re barred from doing so in mainland China. The government
may approve a board for overseas companies on the mainland by
the end of June and the first listing may occur as soon as
October, Caixin Century magazine reported May 30, citing an
unidentified investment banker. </p>
<p>Mainland China doesn''t include Hong Kong, Macau or Taiwan. </p>
<p>HSBC, LSE </p>
<p>HSBC, Europe''s largest bank by market value, aims to raise
a significant amount through a Shanghai listing, Michael Geoghegan, chief executive officer at the time, said last year. </p>
<p>London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE) wants to list in Shanghai
by the end of 2011, Chief Executive Officer Xavier Rolet said
last year. </p>
<p>Most of the impact from a Coca-Cola listing will be in
terms of improving its brand in China, Charles Yan, Hong
Kong-based greater China consumer analyst for Yuanta Securities
Co., said in a phone interview today. In China, if you''re a
public firm, it helps your brand. It''s also much easier to get
a loan from local banks, and some local governments treat
listed companies better. </p>
<p>China controls capital flows and only allows citizens to
buy overseas-listed shares through institutions under its
Qualified Domestic Institutional Investors program. </p>
<p>China''s yuan rose 0.02 percent to 6.4780 per dollar,
earlier touching a 17-year high of 6.4777. Twelve-month non-
deliverable forwards gained 0.05 percent to 6.3575, a 1.9
percent premium to the onshore spot rate. </p>
<p>China''s stock market had a combined market value of $3.7
trillion for the Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses as of yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The U.S. is the
largest with a market value of $16.6 trillion, while Japan is
ranked No. 2. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) has asked chipmakers
that want to use the next version of Windows for tablets to work
with no more than one computer manufacturer, three people with
knowledge of the plan said. </p>
<p>Chipmakers and computer makers that agree to the terms will
get incentives from Microsoft in exchange for accepting the
restrictions, which tie a single chipmaker to one tablet design,
said the people, who declined to be identified because the new
program hasn''t been made public. </p>
<p>Seeking to limit variations may help Microsoft speed the
delivery of new Windows tablets by keeping tighter control over
partners and accelerating development and testing. Though the
program isn''t mandatory, the restrictions may impede chip- and
computer makers from building a variety of Windows-based models
to vie with Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s iPad, the people said. In past versions
of Windows software, chipmakers could work with multiple
computer manufacturers. </p>
<p>Microsoft is still in the development process on the next
version of Windows, continuing the engineering work with our
silicon partners as part of the technology preview we talked
about in January, Microsoft said in an e-mailed statement.
We continue to talk regularly with hardware partners around
the world as part of our development process. </p>
<p>Sole Alliances </p>
<p>Under the plan being proposed by Microsoft, a given
chipmaker would have to ally itself with a single PC
manufacturer in order to qualify for certain incentives. Those
may include features that ensure the device runs better or lower
prices for the software, one of the people said. </p>
<p>Acer Inc. (2353) Chief Executive Officer and Chairman J.T. Wang,
in an interview yesterday at the Computex trade show in Taipei,
said Microsoft was trying to set limits on other companies. He
didn''t specify the restrictions. </p>
<p>They''re really controlling the whole thing, the whole
process, Wang said of Microsoft. They try to set the game
rules, he said, and chip suppliers and PC makers all feel
it''s very troublesome, he said. </p>
<p>This is the first time Microsoft has produced a Windows
operating system that works with ARM Holdings Plc (ARM)''s technology,
increasing the number of potential chip suppliers. The program
seeking to pair one chipmaker with one computer maker might
increase the chances of initial success by enabling the company
to focus efforts on a smaller number of designs. </p>
<p>Design Limits </p>
<p>Still, the rules may constrain chipmakers'' ability to have
their products featured in a range of devices. Computer makers
whose designs aren''t chosen may be left out, one of the people
said. </p>
<p>Under Microsoft''s program, chip suppliers will also be able
to select a second computer maker for clamshell-style notebook
computers that use the new operating system, one of the people
said. Chipmakers for the new version of Windows, including Intel
Corp. (INTC), Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD), Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM)
and Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN), can also decline to be part of the
program and work with whichever computer makers they want. </p>
<p>The program only applies to the version of Windows that''s
being tailored for mobile computers, the person said. The
regular version of Windows for desktop PCs will have no such
limits, as with past versions of Windows. </p>
<p>Preview Tomorrow </p>
<p>Microsoft Corp. will preview the next generation of the
company''s Windows operating system to clients and media tomorrow
in Taipei, Steven Guggenheimer, a corporate vice president at
Microsoft, said at the Computex trade show today. </p>
<p>Microsoft, the world''s largest software maker, has failed
to gain traction in the market for tablets dominated by Apple,
which develops the hardware and software that runs the iPad,
introduced in 2010. </p>
<p>Acer was the No. 3 maker of PCs in 2010, according to
researcher IDC. The company is among those hoping to boost sales
by selling tablet devices, a faster-growing slice of the
computer market. </p>
<p>The global tablet market will almost quadruple this year to
70 million units from 18 million in 2010, according to estimates
in a May 17 report by Jefferies Group Inc. Apple will control
about 64 percent of the 2011 tablet market, dropping to 41
percent in 2012, when 158 million units will probably be sold,
according to the report. </p>
<p>Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said last
week that machines with the new operating system, which he
referred to as Windows 8, would be released in 2012. </p>
<p>Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft later retracted the
comments, claiming they were a misstatement. The company is
eager to expand Windows to computing devices such as phones and
tablets, Ballmer said in a speech in New Delhi last week. </p>
<p>We are in a race, he said. We are not doing that
badly, frankly. We are doing pretty well in that race. But the
race is on to continue to push Windows to a variety of new form
factors. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, was subpoenaed by the Manhattan
District Attorney''s office for information on the firm''s
activities leading into the credit crisis, two people familiar
with the matter said. </p>
<p>The subpoena relates to the U.S. Senate''s Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations report on Wall Street''s role in
the collapse of the financial markets, which accused New York-
based Goldman Sachs of misleading buyers of mortgage-linked
investments, the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity
because the inquiry isn''t public. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs has dropped 16 percent in New York trading
since the Senate subcommittee, led by Michigan Democrat Carl M. Levin, used the firm as a case study in a 640-page report on its
findings released in April. At the time, Levin said Goldman
Sachs had also misled Congress about the company''s bets on the
housing market. The firm has said its testimony was truthful. </p>
<p>We don''t comment on specific regulatory or legal issues,
but subpoenas are a normal part of the information request
process and, of course, when we receive them we cooperate
fully, said David Wells, a company spokesman. </p>
<p>A subpoena is a request for information and doesn''t mean
the company is a target of a criminal investigation. Analysts
including Sanford C. Bernstein  Co.''s Brad Hintz have said they
don''t expect the firm to be criminally prosecuted. </p>
<p>Erin Duggan, chief spokeswoman for Manhattan District
Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., declined to comment. </p>
<p>Shares Decline </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs dropped 1.3 percent to $134.38 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. </p>
<p>The Senate report was referred to the U.S. Department of
Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are
also investigating. </p>
<p>Levin said when his report was released that federal
prosecutors should review whether to bring perjury charges
against Goldman Sachs Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 56, and other current and former employees who
testified to Congress last year. Levin said they denied under
oath that Goldman Sachs took a financial position against the
mortgage market solely for its own profit, statements the
senator said were untrue. </p>
<p>Schneiderman''s Probe </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs met last month with New York Attorney General
Eric Schneiderman''s office as part of his examination of
mortgage securitization before the housing collapse, according
to a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition
of anonymity because the probe isn''t public. The meeting took
place within the past two weeks, the person said. </p>
<p>Schneiderman has been conducting a broad examination of
mortgage practices and the packaging and sale of loans to
investors, according to the person. JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), UBS
AG (UBSN), Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Morgan Stanley (MS) and
the Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) also are part of that
investigation, the person said. Four bond insurers have been
subpoenaed as well. </p>
<p>Lauren Passalacqua, a spokeswoman for Schneiderman,
declined comment, as did Goldman Sachs''s Wells. </p>
<p>Last year Goldman Sachs paid $550 million to settle SEC
claims related to its marketing of the complex securities known
as collateralized debt obligations. The settlement resolved
claims that the company failed to disclose that hedge fund
Paulson  Co. was betting against, and influenced the selection
of, CDOs the company was packaging and selling. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Icecek AS (CCOLA), the bottler of
Coke drinks in 10 countries including Turkey and central Asia,
predicted sales volumes will climb more than 10 percent this
year. The stock rose as much as 3.6 percent in Istanbul trading. </p>
<p>Sales volumes will increase at high single digits in
Turkey and in the mid-to-high teens in other countries this
year, Chief Executive Officer Michael O''Neill said in an e-
mailed response to Bloomberg questions yesterday. Thus we
expect to deliver low-teen growth on a consolidated basis. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Icecek, in which Coca-Cola Co. (KO) holds a 20.1
percent stake, is the fifth-largest bottler of Coca-Cola Co. in
the world, according to an investor presentation on its website.
The Istanbul-based company''s Turkish sales totaled 74 percent of
the 665.4 million unit cases sold in 2010. Total Sales advanced
14 percent to 2.75 billion liras ($1.7 billion) in 2010. </p>
<p>Per capita consumption of sparkling beverages is 44 liters
a year in Turkey and this is still way below that of
neighboring countries and the European Union average, O''Neill
said. Bulgaria''s consumption is 89 liters per person a year, he
said. Our long-term guidance for Turkey operations is high
single-digit growth and mid-to-high-teens growth in
international markets, O''Neill said. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Icecek rose as much as 80 kurus to 22.85 liras
and traded 2 percent higher at 22.50 liras as of 12:29 p.m. </p>
<p>Growth Opportunities </p>
<p>The company sells products in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan,
Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Syria, Iraq, Jordan and
Turkey, with bottling plants in 20 locations, including eight in
Turkey. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Icecek expects the pace of growth to decelerate
in the second half of 2011, after the high growth in
volumes of 17 percent in the second half of 2010, O''Neill said.
We expect the growth momentum to normalize throughout the
year. We also expect net revenue growth to normalize in the
second half in line with volume growth. </p>
<p>About 62 percent of people in Coca-Cola Icecek''s market of
363 million are aged below 29 and this presents tremendous
growth opportunities for companies operating in the region,
O''Neill said. You will see more countries becoming a part of
CCI in the future, he said. </p>
<p>As we look at the next 10 years, we see a more positive
demographic picture, O''Neill said. There is no reason why
Turkey can''t match the Bulgarian per capita consumption and no
reason Pakistan can''t reach the Turkey per capita figure over
time, he said. </p>
<p>Central Asia, Iraq </p>
<p>The company expects central Asian operations to lead growth
this year as consumer spending in these markets is rising,
O''Neill said. Central Asian sales volume grew 25 percent in the
first quarter, he said. </p>
<p>Iraq operations will be an important growth driver for
CCI, O''Neill said. Iraq operations delivered over 30 percent
sales growth for the fifth consecutive quarter, he said. Coca-
Cola Icecek bought a 70 percent stake in the Iraqi bottler CC
Beverage Ltd. for $36.9 million in March, raising its stake to
100 percent. </p>
<p>Pakistan, which has a population of 185 million and

<p>A federal judge refused to grant Walt
Disney Co. (DIS) an injunction that would prevent satellite television
provider Dish Network Corp. (DISH) from giving its subscribers free
access to Disney movies. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge George Daniels in New York denied the
motion by Disney Enterprises Inc. for a preliminary injunction
in a one-page order signed June 1 and filed yesterday. </p>
<p>Disney sued Dish, the second-largest satellite TV company,
in May, accusing it of distributing Disney movies over the Starz
movie channels without charging subscribers an additional
premium, as is done with a service such as HBO. Starz is a unit
of Liberty Media Corp. Disney accused Dish of copyright
infringement. </p>
<p>Dish Network pays hundreds of millions of dollars for the
right to distribute Starz content to our customers, which
includes the rights to a number of Disney movies, Englewood,
Colorado-based Dish said May 3 in a statement. </p>
<p>Dish said the contract is between Starz and Disney, and
that we will vigorously defend our rights against any attempt
to drag our customers into the middle of their dispute. </p>
<p>Marc Lumpkin, a spokesman for Dish, said today the company
has no comment on the judge''s ruling. </p>
<p>Zenia Mucha, a spokeswoman for Burbank, California-based
Disney, didn''t immediately return a call seeking comment. </p>
<p>Disney dropped 68 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $39.38 at 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Dish fell
53 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $29.03 in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading. </p>
<p>DirecTV, based in El Segundo, California, is the largest
satellite TV provider in the U.S. </p>
<p>The case is Disney Enterprises Inc. v. Dish Network LLC,
11-2973, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS)''s ABC is close to an
agreement with Katie Couric for a syndicated talk show, two
people with knowledge of the situation said. </p>
<p>The parties may announce an accord as soon as Monday, said
the people, who declined to be identified because they weren''t
authorized to speak publicly. </p>
<p>An agreement with Couric would give ABC and its affiliate
stations a brand name replacement for Oprah Winfrey, whose
syndicated afternoon program ended a 25-year run on May 25.
While distributed by CBS Corp. (CBS), Winfrey''s program was carried by
ABC stations covering almost half of the U.S. TV households,
according to information provided by the networks. </p>
<p>Zenia Mucha, a spokeswoman for Burbank, California-based
Walt Disney Co., didn''t immediately respond to requests for
comment. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier today the two
sides were finalizing an agreement. </p>
<p>Couric, 54, was anchor of the CBS Evening News for five
years before stepping down last month. Prior to that she was co-
host of the Today show on NBC. </p>
<p>Disney fell 68 cents to $39.38 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have gained 5
percent this year. </p>

<p>General Motors Co. (GM) executives have
discussed buying shares from the U.S. Treasury Department to
reduce the government''s 33 percent stake in the automaker, three
people familiar with the matter said. </p>
<p>No decisions have been made on a share purchase, said the
people, who didn''t want to be identified revealing internal
discussions. Detroit-based GM is weighing uses for its cash,
such as shoring up its underfunded pension plans, paying off
debt and funding new vehicle programs, the people said. </p>
<p>Using some of the $30.6 billion in cash and marketable
securities GM had at the end of the first quarter to reduce the
government''s stake would relieve investors'' concerns that a
share sale by the U.S. Treasury Department would hurt the stock,
said David Whiston, an analyst with Morningstar Inc. in Chicago. </p>
<p>There is an overhang on the stock because of government
ownership, Whiston said in a telephone interview. GM may
think that buying down Treasury''s stake will remove some of the
overhang. </p>
<p>GM fell 48 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $29.12 at 4:15 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading after earlier dropping
as much as 2.4 percent. The shares have declined 12 percent
since their initial public offering in November. </p>
<p>The government''s 500 million shares in Detroit-based GM
would be valued at about $14.6 billion at today''s closing price. </p>
<h2>Immediate Priorities'' </h2>
<p>In terms of uses of cash, we have clear, immediate
priorities, which include further strengthening our balance
sheet and fully funding our pensions, Jim Cain, a GM
spokesman, said in a telephone interview. Our objective is to
fund our operations with cash and then return any excess cash to
our shareholders. Nothing has been ruled in or out. </p>
<p>Mark Paustenbach, a spokesman for the U.S. Treasury,
declined to comment. </p>
<p>GM''s U.S. hourly worker pension plan was underfunded by
$11.2 billion at the end of the first quarter. The company also
had $5 billion in debt and $5.5 billion in preferred stock
outstanding. The company may decide to use its cash for those
obligations first, so no buyback is imminent, the people said. </p>
<p>While GM would want to buy the shares because the stock is
cheap, President Barack Obama would be criticized for selling
at a significant loss, one of the people said. </p>
<p>The Treasury has decided to wait until at least July 1 to
prepare for a secondary offering, a person familiar with the
matter has said. By filing an S-3 after July 1, the government
would be able to sell shares more quickly and with a less-thorough review. In that case, the Treasury likely would wait
until GM reports second-quarter earnings before selling more
stock, delaying the sale until August, the person said. </p>
<p>The Treasury may make a third offering in November or
December and doesn''t need to sell all of the shares this year,
the person said. </p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury Department yesterday announced an
agreement with Fiat SpA (F) to sell the government''s remaining 6
percent stake in Chrysler Group LLC. The sale would bring Fiat''s
stake in Chrysler to 52 percent. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE)''s Aromasin, used to treat
breast cancer and stop it from returning, also prevents tumors
from developing in healthy women at risk for the disease, with
fewer side effects than existing options, a study found. </p>
<p>Women at least 60 years old or with a previous diagnosis of
precancerous lesions who took Aromasin for three years were 65
percent less likely to have invasive breast cancer than those
given a placebo, research showed. A report on the data, funded
by New York-based Pfizer, was presented today at the American
Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago. </p>
<p>Breast cancer strikes 1.3 million women worldwide a year,
researchers said. While generic tamoxifen and Evista, made by
Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly  Co., are approved for prevention,
rare and sometimes deadly side effects such as stroke and blood
clots limit their use, said Paul Goss, head of breast cancer
research at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. There were
no serious side effects in the study of 4,560 women, he said. </p>
<p>This drug is a major step forward in terms of side
effects and removes one of the major obstacles to prevention,
Goss said in a telephone interview. The pool of women who are
eligible for this may be even larger than the group we studied
because the toxicity profile is so favorable. </p>
<p>Goss said that while follow-up for the study was short, the
researchers were optimistic that with further data it will be
maintained. </p>
<p>Aromasin generated $483 million in sales last year for
Pfizer, the world''s biggest drugmaker. The company lost U.S.
patent protection for the treatment in April, and will lose
marketing exclusivity in Europe and Japan in July, said Chris Loder, a company spokesman, in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>Mixed Blessing'' </p>
<p>The result is that Pfizer isn''t expected to file for U.S.
Food and Drug Administration approval of the drug for breast
cancer prevention, Goss said. </p>
<p>It''s a mixed blessing not having regulatory approval
pending, Goss said. It would imply a drug company would be
pushing it, and the cost would be beyond the reach of many
women. The price has already come down dramatically. </p>
<p>Doctors can prescribe approved drugs for any indication. </p>
<p>Aromasin, along with AstraZeneca Plc (AZN)''s Arimidex and
Novartis AG (NOVN)''s Femara, work by blocking the production of the
hormone estrogen that can fuel cancer growth. This was the first
study to examine the use of the drugs, called aromatase
inhibitors, for preventing cancer. </p>
<p>Tamoxifen prevents tumor cells from using estrogen. Two-
thirds of all breast cancers rely on estrogen to grow, according
to the National Institutes of Health. </p>
<p>Invasive Breast Cancer </p>
<p>Invasive breast cancer was diagnosed in 11 women taking
Aromasin, compared with 31 of those given placebo. There were no
differences in fracture rates, cardiovascular complications or
other cancers, according to the study that was simultaneously
published by the New England Journal of Medicine. </p>
<p>The findings should lead to more breast cancer prevention
efforts, wrote Nancy Davidson and Thomas Kensler, from the
University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, in an editorial that
accompanied the study in the New England Journal of Medicine. </p>
<p>Breast cancer is the second most common cause of death
from cancer and one of the most feared diagnoses for women in
the United States, they wrote. We have the knowledge and
tools to reduce its incidence today. We have run out of excuses.
What are we waiting for? </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. sought to
dismiss a $6.4 billion lawsuit by the trustee liquidating
Bernard Madoff''s firm, saying he doesn''t have the right to sue
the bank on behalf of the con man''s investors. </p>
<p>Trustee Irving Picard sued JPMorgan in U.S. Bankruptcy
court in Manhattan in December, alleging it ignored signs of
fraud as billions of dollars flowed from Madoff''s account at the
bank to investors. JPMorgan was Madoff''s primary banker. The
lawsuit seeks $1 billion in fees and transfers, and $5.4 billion
in damages, alleging that JPMorgan defrauded federal regulators
and violated banking law. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank, asked in a filing
yesterday that a U.S. District Court judge to dismiss the suit.
The trustee''s complaint never alleges facts showing that
anyone at JPMorgan knew that Madoff was a crook, the bank said
in the filing. </p>
<p>Picard was hired to liquidate Madoff''s firm and doesn''t
have the legal right to sue on behalf of investors in the
$17 billion Ponzi scheme, New York-based JPMorgan said. </p>
<p>Amanda Remus, a Picard spokeswoman, didn''t immediately
return a call to her office after regular business hours. </p>
<p>The bank''s case is one of at least three that has been
moved from bankruptcy court to district court, in a challenge to
Picard''s authority. U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in New
York in May took JPMorgan''s case from U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Burton Lifland, saying she would determine whether Picard had
standing to sue the bank and decide other questions of federal
non-bankruptcy law. </p>
<p>HSBC, UniCredit </p>
<p>District Court Judge Jed Rakoff said he would review some
issues in Picard''s $9 billion suit against HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) and
feeder funds, as well as laws used by the trustee to sue Italian
bank UniCredit SpA (UCG), named in a $59 billion suit against Bank
Medici AG, its founder Sonja Kohn and other defendants. </p>
<p>Picard has filed more than 1,000 suits seeking $90 billion
for Madoff investors. Lifland has approved fees of almost
$180 million for the trustee and his firm, Baker  Hostetler
LLP, since the Ponzi scheme operator''s 2008 arrest, according to
court filings. </p>
<p>Taking the HSBC case temporarily, Rakoff agreed with the
U.K. bank that Picard''s lawsuit raised issues beyond the
jurisdiction of bankruptcy court. He said he would decide
whether Picard can bring common-law claims such as unjust
enrichment and can sue on behalf of customers, since his job is
to liquidate the Madoff firm. </p>
<p>Picard, who said in court this week that he was getting a
percentage of his firm''s fees from the Madoff case, fought
to keep his cases in bankruptcy court. JPMorgan no doubt hopes
to distance itself both from the thousands of victims of that
scheme and from other alleged wrongdoers by going to district
court, Picard said in a March filing. </p>
<p>The appeal is Picard v. JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), 1:11-cv-
00913, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>
