&lt;p&gt;Alain Grisay, a former JPMorgan Chase
 Co. (JPM) managing director who later oversaw a series of mergers as
chief executive officer at FC Asset Management Plc, operator of
the U.K.&#8217;s oldest investment fund, has died. He was 59. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He died over the weekend, according to a statement from
Darty Plc, a London-based home-appliance retailer of which
Grisay was a nonexecutive director. No cause was given. He lived
in London for almost three decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Belgian-born fund manager who spent 22 years at
JPMorgan and raced a 1931 Invicta sports car as a hobby, moved
through the ranks of the New York-based investment bank,
eventually heading its European fixed-income division, according
to a 2010 article in the Financial Times. In 2001, he joined FC
as head of its European institutional business in London and was
CEO from 2006 to 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Bank of Montreal agreed to buy the company for
708 million pounds ($1.2 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FC traces its roots to 1868, when Foreign  Colonial
Investment Trust became the world&#8217;s first publicly listed pooled
investment vehicle, according to FC&#8217;s website. FC Management
became a stand-alone asset manager in 1972 to oversee the
portfolio of Foreign  Colonial Investment Trust. The parent
company gained its stock listing in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Alain was a visionary executive and business leader,&#8221;
the company said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;Alain will be sadly
missed by all of us who had the privilege of both knowing him
and of working together.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;FC Years &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Grisay&#8217;s appointment as CEO, he presided over FC&#8217;s
merger with real-estate investment firm REIT Asset Management in
2008; its breakup the following year with U.K. life insurer
Friends Provident Plc, which distributed its 52 percent stake in
FC to shareholders; and the purchase of Thames River Capital in
2010. He also supervised FC&#8217;s agreement to start a joint-venture in China with Hua Xia Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grisay stepped down in 2012, handing over management duties
to Edward Bramson, founder of activist shareholding company,
Sherborne Investors LLC, who replaced Nick MacAndrew as FC
chairman in 2011. Bramson had criticized FC&#8217;s costs, levels of
debt and acquisitions. Grisay had urged investors to reject
Sherborne&#8217;s plans to develop a new strategy for the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement on Grisay&#8217;s departure, Bramson said the
former CEO had &#8220;achieved the successful acquisition of Thames
River and steered the company through the most tumultuous period
of market upheaval for 60 years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Johns Hopkins &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A self-described Anglophile, Grisay shook up FC by
removing six layers of management, reduced the number of
investment committees and transferred some of the powers of the
chief investment officer to the fund managers themselves,
according to a 2006 profile in the U.K.&#8217;s Independent newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alain Leopold Grisay was born on April 5, 1954, according
to Who&#8217;s Who of Company Directors. He earned a master&#8217;s in law
from the University of Louvain in Belgium, and a Master of Arts
degree in international affairs from Johns Hopkins University in
Baltimore, the Independent said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grisay joined J.P. Morgan  Co. in 1979 as a financial
analyst in New York. In 2000, the bank merged with Chase
Manhattan Corp. to become JPMorgan Chase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After moving to FC, Grisay became deputy CEO and chairman
of the company&#8217;s Dutch unit, where he remained until 2004, when
FC merged with the U.K. asset-management company Isis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It required some reasonably tough management to sort that
out,&#8221; Grisay said of the Isis merger, according to the
Financial Times. &#8220;I was asked to run the business in 2006 with
a clear view to clean up the damage.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. has reduced its tax rate to a two-decade low with help from a tax strategy that sends profits through a Dutch subsidiary. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The approach, which involves routing almost all sales in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and some of the Americas through the Netherlands unit, helped IBM as it gradually reduced its tax rate over 20 years at the same time pretax income quadrupled. Then last year, the rate slid to the lowest level since at least 1994, lifting earnings above analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM is aiming for $20 a share in adjusted earnings by 2015, up from $11.67 in 2010 -- a goal made more difficult as the company posted seven straight quarters of declining revenue. To stay on target, IBM has bought back shares, sold assets, and fired and furloughed workers. A less prominent though vital role is played by its subsidiary in the Netherlands, one of the most important havens for multinational companies looking for ways to legally reduce their tax rates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;ve got a lot of ways to beat earnings and they definitely take advantage of it,&#8221; said Josh Olson, an analyst at Edward Jones  Co. &#8220;It&#8217;s part of how IBM operates.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM ended 2013 with a tax provision $1.84 billion lower than it initially projected, thanks to a tax rate of 15.6 percent -- compared with its forecast of 25 percent. Without the lower rate, the company&#8217;s earnings per share would have fallen from the previous year instead of rising, and net income would have missed analysts&#8217; estimates by about 14 percent instead of 2.9 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty has stuck with IBM&#8217;s profit goals. To stay on track for her $20-a-share earnings target, the company spent $1 billion last year to restructure its workforce -- shedding 3,300 employees in the U.S. andCanada, according to employee group Alliance@IBM. Close

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets, named Dina H. Powell, who leads the
firm&#8217;s charitable efforts, to also head its urban investment
group that makes socially minded deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Powell will retain her role as head of the office of
corporate engagement and join the management team of the bank
subsidiary, according to an internal memo sent by Goldman Sachs
Chief of Staff John Rogers and Esta Stecher, the head of Goldman
Sachs Bank USA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Powell has helped Goldman Sachs develop its 10,000 Small
Businesses initiative that provides training and loans to
entrepreneurs. The urban investment group, or UIG, has created
the Goldman Sachs Social Impact Fund, which provided financing
to a program announced last week to cut recidivism among youth
in Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;UIG has evolved its mission to focus on impact investing,
deploying more than $3 billion in loans and equity investments
to revitalize neighborhoods and support underserved
communities,&#8221; Rogers and Stecher wrote in the memo. &#8220;More
recently, UIG has led the way in developing creative market-based solutions to help address significant economic and public
policy challenges.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Powell joined New York-based Goldman Sachs in 2007 and was
named a partner in 2010. She previously served as U.S. assistant
secretary of state for educational and cultural affairs in
George W. Bush&#8217;s administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Powell&#8217;s expanded duties were reported earlier today by the
New York Times. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as Bill Gates weighs giving up his title of chairman of Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), he&#8217;s poised to remain involved at the company he co-founded in an area of its deepest need: crafting must-have products. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the board prepares to appoint Satya Nadella as Microsoft&#8217;s next chief executive officer, it&#8217;s considering replacing Gates as board chairman, people with knowledge of the matter have said. Gates would remain a director and be involved in product development, focusing less on administration, the people said. He&#8217;s weighing going to work at Microsoft at least one day a week, a person briefed on the matter said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gates championed Nadella&#8217;s candidacy during the months-long CEO search, a person briefed on the matter said, suggesting that the two will be able to collaborate well. Nadella is an insider who&#8217;s well-versed in Microsoft&#8217;s tools for businesses, while Gates was instrumental in building innovative products that ushered in the personal computing age. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even so, the company under his chairmanship has struggled to replicate those early successes in new areas, including mobile devices and Internet services, falling behind Google Inc. (GOOG), Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Facebook Inc. (FB) in making things people want to buy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (G) and VTB
Capital bought a 50 percent stake in Russian Fitness Group for
an undisclosed amount to invest in the country&#8217;s growing
enthusiasm for working out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, a minority investor since 2006, will
&#8220;substantially&#8221; increase its holding with the deal, managing
director Anton Schreider said in an an e-mailed statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction is &#8220;a further demonstration of Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s long-term commitment to investing in Russia as well as
our flexible investment mandate allowing us to back strong local
businesses over extended time horizons,&#8221; Schreider said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian Fitness Group, which runs the World Class and
FizKult chains, has grown to 60 clubs in 22 cities in 21 years.
The clubs have 109,000 members with 2,700 training and
administrative staff, according to its website. Pop star Madonna
came to Moscow in 2012 to open a branch of her Hard Candy
fitness clubs near the Kremlin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olga Sloutsker, president of World Class and a former
Russian fencing champion, said the company plans to open nine
more clubs this year in Russia and the Commonwealth of
Independent States. Sloutsker, the chain&#8217;s founder, will remain
with the company, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, based in New York, said in 2011 it has made
more direct investments in closely held Russian businesses than
any foreign bank, buying stakes in 15 companies totaling more
than $1 billion since 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of those was lender Tinkoff Credit Systems, which did
an initial public offering in London last year. Goldman helped
to organize the October IPO and raised $226 million from selling
stock, cashing out almost two-thirds of its stake. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ValueAct Holdings LP President Mason Morfit, the investor set to join Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s board as it
prepares to make Satya Nadella chief executive officer, will
seek another break with tradition: how the company sells its
flagship products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morfit, 38, and ValueAct want the world&#8217;s largest software
maker to reduce its focus on Windows, the operating system that
underlies most of the company&#8217;s offerings, according to people
familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because
the information is private. For two decades, Microsoft has
focused on selling applications and server software designed to
work specifically for Windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now ValueAct wants Microsoft to accelerate efforts to
unchain products and services from Windows so that they can be
more widely adopted on smartphones and tablets. Microsoft
programs like Office, which typically run on Windows, could then
also be used on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Samsung Electronics Co. gadgets
that have other operating systems, the people said. The moves
are intended to reinvigorate growth at a company that&#8217;s
struggled to adapt to the rise of mobile devices, away from the
shrinking personal computing arena. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morfit also wants to emphasize enterprise and cloud
businesses and push Microsoft to look at jettisoning or scaling
back hardware and consumer products such as the Xbox game
console, which carry expensive marketing and manufacturing
costs, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) named Satya Nadella chief executive officer, tapping an insider steeped in business technology to speed up a turnaround at a software maker that helped usher in the personal-computing age, only to be left behind as the world embraced the Web and mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nadella, 46, is replacing Steve Ballmer effective immediately after a five-month search, Microsoft said in a statement today. Bill Gates, the company&#8217;s first CEO, will step aside as chairman, devote more time to product development as a director and continue running his philanthropic foundation. John Thompson, the director who led the CEO search, becomes chairman. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new CEO, who was born in India and joined Microsoft in 1992, takes over at a critical juncture. Consumers and businesses are shunning PCs in favor of handheld devices made by rivals, sapping demand for Microsoft&#8217;s flagship products. Besides playing catchup to the likes of Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG), Nadella will be tasked with completing strategy changes, begun by Ballmer last year, that include integrating the $7.2 billion integration of Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)&#8217;s handset unit and turning Microsoft into a provider of services and hardware. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s new leadership could almost double the company&#8217;s valuation by parting with a good chunk of the businesses it uses to court consumers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jettisoning units such as Xbox video-game consoles and the Bing search engine may be the change Microsoft needs to rejuvenate growth as Satya Nadella takes over as chief executive officer, said Schwartz Investment Counsel Inc., which owns Microsoft shares. The world&#8217;s biggest software maker should go further by also splitting off Windows and smartphones to focus on providing services to business customers, said Stifel Financial Corp. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;They need to decide whether it still makes sense to have those assets,&#8221; said Todd Lowenstein, a Los Angeles-based fund manager at HighMark Capital Management Inc., which oversees about $17 billion including Microsoft shares. &#8220;Eighty percent of the value of Microsoft is on the enterprise side and it&#8217;s not being valued that way today. The consumer side of the business gets a disproportionate amount of attention.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nadella, named CEO today by Microsoft&#8217;s board, would inherit a company whose inroads in providing cloud-based enterprise software and services have been overshadowed by disappointments in tablets, smartphones and its search engine. Microsoft&#8217;s price-earnings ratio is about half the median for software makers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, implying that the company&#8217;s valuation could almost double if it focused just on software and services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) invested $15 million in Foursquare Labs Inc., forging a partnership that will help Windows-powered phones offer restaurant and entertainment suggestions to consumers on the move. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The investment, confirmed in an interview by Foursquare Chief Executive Officer Dennis Crowley, is part of a funding round from late last year that valued New York-based Foursquare at more than $600 million, people with knowledge of the terms said in December. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft is adding features to its Windows Phone software in an effort to compete with Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPhone and Google Inc.&#8217;s Android software, which together dominate the smartphone market. Location data from Foursquare will appear in a voice-activated assistant, code-named Cortana, that has yet to be released and will go up against Apple&#8217;s Siri technology, according to a person with knowledge of the plans. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is huge validation for the stuff we&#8217;ve been working so hard on,&#8221; Crowley said. &#8220;It&#8217;s one of the leaders in the space we work in looking at us and saying we can really help power the next generation of devices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Foursquare, which has struggled to generate sales in almost five years on the market, will get a new stream of data licensing revenue from the partnership, Crowley said. Foursquare&#8217;s valuation has been stagnant since 2011. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News reported in August that Microsoft and American Express Co. were both vying for a stake in Foursquare. Microsoft has been courting startups to add features to its phones and tablets, which lag behind Apple and Android products in the number of applications available to users. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cortana Coming &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cortana, named for the artificially intelligent character in Microsoft&#8217;s popular &#8220;Halo&#8221; video game series, is scheduled to be part of the Windows Phone 8.1 release, to be shown within several months, according to a person familiar with the project and Foursquare agreement, who asked not to be identified because details haven&#8217;t been made public. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As part of the deal, Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft will gain access to more of Foursquare&#8217;s data than the company makes available publicly and to other partners. That data would allow Microsoft, with a user&#8217;s permission, to push out tips, suggestions and discounts tied to a person&#8217;s location, said Zig Serafin, a vice president in Microsoft&#8217;s Bing search unit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re building some contextually aware experiences to power some upcoming products in Windows Phone,&#8221; Serafin said. &#8220;This will be for anywhere you get a Bing-powered experience.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Crowley and Serafin, along with other employees from the two companies, began working on a deal last year to collaborate on products, which eventually led to an investment, said the person familiar with the agreement. The companies did not discuss an acquisition, the person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Uphill Struggle &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brendan Lewis, a spokesman for Foursquare, declined to comment on negotiations with Microsoft or plans for Cortana. Adam Sohn, a Microsoft spokesman, couldn&#8217;t immediately be reached for comment and the company hasn&#8217;t publicly commented on Cortana. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In December, Foursquare raised $35 million led by venture fund DFJ Growth. The company spent the year adding products for businesses to advertise to its users as well as ways to send instant and relevant recommendations to people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Foursquare has 45 million users, compared with more than 230 million for Twitter Inc. and 1.2 billion for Facebook Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Sarah Frier in San Francisco at sfrier1@bloomberg.net; Dina Bass in Seattle at dbass2@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Pui-Wing Tam at ptam13@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that there&#8217;s a winner for the chief executive officer position at Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), those who lost out on the job will need to decide whether to stick around. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With Microsoft&#8217;s board disclosing today that it picked Satya Nadella as CEO, that leaves internal candidates such as Executive Vice President Tony Bates and Chief Operating Officer Kevin Turner among those who failed to get promoted, people with knowledge of the search have said. Stephen Elop, the former CEO of Nokia Oyj who was set to join the software maker after it closes a $7.2 billion deal for Nokia&#8217;s handset unit, was also on the shortlist, among others. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While there&#8217;s no telling how long some executives might stick around were a better offer to come along, the conclusion to Microsoft&#8217;s search may not spark an immediate exodus, said people with knowledge of the matter. The CEO candidates were informed that they didn&#8217;t get the role last week, said people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the information is private, giving the executives time to work out some next steps. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Turner plans to stay at the Redmond, Washington-based company, said a person close to the COO. And while Bates and Elop both have ambitions to be CEO, they are also set to continue at Microsoft for the time being since success in their current jobs may be the best way to attract other offers, said people close to the executives, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. &lt;/p&gt;

The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index slid 2.3 percent yesterday, capping its first 5 percent retreat in eight months, while Japan&#8217;s Topix index plunged 4.8 percent for its biggest decrease since June. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related: Market&#8217;s 19th Breakdown Sees Bulls Unmoved&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We didn&#8217;t expect the U.S. would be this weak,&#8221; Kathy Matsui, chief Japan strategist for Goldman Sachs in Tokyo, said by e-mail. &#8220;Since we do not see sufficient reason to change our fundamental earnings outlook and stock prices have fallen, the market still appears attractive to us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s appointment of John Thompson as chairman to replace co-founder Bill Gates, the world&#8217;s largest software maker is looking to the veteran technology executive as the main outside voice in its new leadership structure. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thompson was the lead independent director heading the board&#8217;s search for a new chief executive officer, resulting in the appointment of Microsoft insider Satya Nadella to replace Steve Ballmer, the Redmond, Washington-based company said in a statement today. While the naming of Thompson and Nadella, who were already involved in Microsoft&#8217;s transition, signal continuity, it&#8217;s also the biggest break in the company&#8217;s history as the Gates-Ballmer duo who have been in charge for more than three decades step aside. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former CEO of Symantec Corp. (SYMC), Thompson, 64, is stepping in at a crucial point as Microsoft remakes itself to better compete with rivals including Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG) In picking Thompson, the board is betting that he&#8217;ll be able to use his experience running a security-software company to help turn around Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Thompson&#8217;s going to be a major voice for the company,&#8221; James Staten, an analyst at Forrester Research, said in an interview. &#8220;They wouldn&#8217;t have made him chairman, if he didn&#8217;t have strong opinions about how to drive the company forward. And Satya is looking for strong partners on the board.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Board Responsibilities &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a video that Microsoft posted online, Thompson said he was &#8220;looking forward to working closely with Satya and other members of the board. The board is always focused on long-term success of this great company and takes seriously its responsibilities to shareholders to ensure long-term success.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As Microsoft&#8217;s key products face decline, Thompson and Nadella will oversee a transition to a new organizational structure and integrate the $7.2 billion acquisition of Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)&#8217;s handset unit. The management transition at Microsoft follows the worst decline on record for personal computers in 2013, when shipments dropped 10 percent and are projected to languish through 2017. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thompson knows what it&#8217;s like to be at the head of a struggling incumbent. While at Symantec in 2005, he orchestrated the ill-fated $10.2 billion purchase of Veritas Software Corp., in an effort to push into data storage. When Thompson stepped down as CEO four years later, Symantec was contending with slowing growth amid an economic downturn and rising competition. Thompson joined Microsoft as a director in 2012 as part of an expansion of the board. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Florida Roots &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The son of a Florida postal worker and a teacher, Thompson joined International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) straight out of Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University in 1971. The IBM interviewer said he was interested in a stereo, so Thompson spent the session trying to sell him one, Thompson wrote in a New York Times column in 2012. He wound up with a job as a sales representative for IBM in Tampa, Florida. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thompson likes to tell people he spent &#8220;27 years, 9 months and 13 days at IBM&#8221; before joining technology security company Symantec as CEO in 1999. He took the company from $600 million to $6 billion in sales over his decade-long tenure, before stepping down in 2009. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s new chairman also currently runs Virtual Instruments Inc., a San Jose, California-based maker of software that tracks application and hardware performance. In an interview late last year, Thompson said he was determined to take the company public, something he has never done in his career. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Performance Management &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;After joining Microsoft&#8217;s board in February 2012, Thompson was involved in discussions about the company&#8217;s performance under Ballmer, regulatory filings show. The board, in annual reviews, rebuked the CEO for poor results in Windows and tablets machines, even as it lauded areas such as server software and expense cutting. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thompson helped to create an environment that sped Ballmer&#8217;s decision to retire, according to people with knowledge of the matter, and the director led the board in pressing the CEO on his strategy. Thompson listened to each board member and made sure Ballmer heard them, improving lines of communication and making strategy talks more productive, the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Board Moves &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new chairman is only Microsoft&#8217;s second since the company was founded by Gates and Paul Allen in 1975. Some external candidates who discussed the CEO job with Microsoft expressed concerns they would lack independence if both Ballmer and Gates stayed on as directors, people familiar with their thinking have said. Gates and Ballmer together own 8.3 percent of the stock; Gates is Microsoft&#8217;s largest individual shareholder with a 4.3 percent stake. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A new director set to join the board next month is Mason Morfit, president of activist shareholder ValueAct Holdings LP. He&#8217;s eager to see Microsoft emphasize its business software and Internet-based cloud services rather than consumer technology, people familiar with the situation have said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The board, which is expanding to 10 members with the addition of Nadella, includes seven independent directors. Three of the seven have been on the board for more than eight years, including 33 years for David Marquardt, an early investor in the software maker. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Dina Bass in Seattle at dbass2@bloomberg.net; Peter Burrows in San Francisco at pburrows@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Pui-Wing Tam at ptam13@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;
</body></entry><entry author="By Alex Wayne" date="Feb 04, 2014 12:16 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-04/pfizer-among-10-drugmakers-in-new-government-project.html"><headline>Pfizer Among Drugmakers in U.S. Chronic Disease Project</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY) and
eight other large drugmakers will partner with the U.S.
government in a $230 million effort to identify new approaches
to treat Alzheimer&#8217;s, diabetes, lupus and arthritis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data generated from the work will be made public for other
scientists to use, a move the U.S. National Institutes of Health
called groundbreaking. The targeted diseases are some of the
most prevalent conditions among Americans, costing the nation
billions of dollars in treatment and lost productivity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The venture may be particularly important in Alzheimer&#8217;s
research. Since 1998, there have been more than 100 attempts to
develop a treatment, and all have failed. The last two years
have featured setbacks by Pfizer and Johnson  Johnson. Sanofi (SAN)
Chief Executive Officer Chris Viehbacher has said his company
won&#8217;t pursue therapies there because the science isn&#8217;t advanced
enough to justify the risks and cost to develop a drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;We are going to try to increase the odds of picking the
right targets to go after for the next generation of drug
development,&#8217;&#8217; Francis Collins, the NIH director, said today at
a press conference in Washington. &#8220;We want to pick them at the
very beginning of the development process and thus avoid wasting
precious time and money chasing down drugs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies and the NIH will split the $230 million cost
about equally, Collins said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 5 million Americans suffer with Alzheimer&#8217;s
disease, and the number is expected to triple by 2050. The only
drugs approved for the condition ease symptoms for a few months
while the debilitating brain disease rampages on. Still, the
treatments generate more than $5 billion annually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Biomarker Research &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research coordinated by the NIH will include collecting
tissue samples from thousands of patients to look for common
&#8220;biomarkers&#8221; that might be good targets for new drugs, the
agency said in a statement. The first projects are expected to
last three to five years, and may lead to collaborations on
other diseases if the research is successful, NIH said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coordinated effort &#8220;rallies scientific key players of
the innovation ecosystem in a more unified way,&#8221; Mikael Dolsten, president of worldwide research and development for New
York-based Pfizer, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rupert Vessey, senior vice president at Whitehouse Station,
New Jersey-based Merck  Co. (MRK), identified new, innovative ways to
develop drugs as the most critical health challenge facing the
industry. The collaboration &#8220;will be important to unraveling
the mysteries of the diseases that cause suffering for
individuals and are a burden to our society,&#8221; he said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AbbVie, Biogen &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other companies involved are AbbVie Inc., Biogen Idec Inc. (BIIB),
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK), JJ (JNJ), Sanofi and
Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
will also participate, as well as nonprofit advocacy groups
representing patients suffering from the diseases, the
government said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We exited mental illness and largely Alzheimer&#8217;s about
four years ago, but not because we weren&#8217;t interested in it, but
because we thought it was so difficult alone,&#8221; said Lon Cardon,
senior vice president of alternative discovery and development
at London-based Glaxo. &#8220;Now we&#8217;re interested in the Alzheimer&#8217;s
space because we can join forces.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NIH is the largest source of funding for biomedical
research in the world, with an annual budget of more than $30
billion. Much of that money is consumed by basic research into
human biology and the study of the major causes of death,
including cancer and infectious diseases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency expects to spend about $1.1 billion on diabetes
this year; $562 million on Alzheimer&#8217;s; $260 million on
arthritis and $109 million on lupus. The agency will spend $3.1
billion researching HIV and AIDS, by comparison, the most of any
single disease. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s $543 million settlement with the trustee for Bernard Madoff&#8217;s defunct firm was approved by the judge overseeing its liquidation, ending a case in which thousands of investors accused the bank of turning a blind eye to the U.S.&#8217;s biggest Ponzi scheme. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The accord, reached Jan. 7, was approved today by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart Bernstein in New York. The deal resolves a lawsuit by the trustee, Irving Picard, and two related class-action cases filed by Madoff victims who accused the bank of negligence. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The settlements are fair, reasonable and in the best interest of the Madoff estate,&#8221; Bernstein said. The deals provide &#8220;substantial benefit&#8221; to victims, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related: Madoff Ex-Aides Seen Facing Hurdle With &#8216;Duped&#8217; Defense&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the JPMorgan deal, Picard&#8217;s recoveries for victims topped $10 billion, or 59 percent of the $17 billion in principal lost by thousands of customers in Madoff&#8217;s investment advisory business. Picard alleged the bank helped perpetuate Madoff&#8217;s scam for years by ignoring signs of fraud. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Madoff deposited money from new customers into the account instead of investing it in securities, and made withdrawals to pay back earlier investors. The Ponzi scheme collapsed after Madoff&#8217;s confession and arrest in December 2008. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Picard said New York-based JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, ignored signs of wrongdoing to benefit financially from the con man&#8217;s business. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Class Actions &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan agreed to pay Picard $325 million to settle his lawsuit on behalf of thousands of victims, and another $218 million to resolve two related class-action lawsuits that were filed with Picard&#8217;s assistance after an appeals court barred him from bringing common-law claims against the bank. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Picard had appealed the JPMorgan decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, which hasn&#8217;t decided whether it will hear the case. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The amount of the accord &#8220;indicated there was a value to the claims and the compromise made good sense,&#8221; David Sheehan, a lawyer for Picard, said at today&#8217;s hearing. There is no guarantee Picard will win at the Supreme Court, Sheehan said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A group of about 200 Madoff victims who are &#8220;net winners&#8221; -- customers who withdrew more money from the scam than they deposited -- get nothing under the deal and have said in court filings they will sue the bank. They advised Bernstein in court papers that they were declining to be part of the JPMorgan accord. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Opting Out &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;re opting out of a class you&#8217;re not a member of -- sounds like a Groucho Marx joke,&#8221; Bernstein said to a lawyer for the group at today&#8217;s hearing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Picard is pursuing claims totaling about $3.5 billion from UBS AG (UBSN), HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) and UniCredit SpA (UCG), which the trustee has also accused of benefiting from Madoff&#8217;s fraud. The banks have denied the claims. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the same time Picard reached the deal with JPMorgan, the bank agreed to pay $1.7 billion to the U.S. to resolve related criminal allegations, and $350 million in a case by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The parallel efforts by the trustee and federal investigators have resulted in a total recovery for victims of almost $14 billion, or 82 percent of the lost principal. Picard has distributed about $4.9 billion to victims, with billions more held in reserve until legal issues are resolved. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Madoff, 75, pleaded guilty to fraud in 2009 and is serving a 150-year sentence at a federal prison in North Carolina. At least seven others pleaded guilty, including his brother Peter Madoff, who is serving a 10-year term. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Picower Estate &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before the JPMorgan accord, Picard&#8217;s team had recovered $9.5 billion through lawsuits and out-of-court settlements, including $5 billion from the estate of Jeffry Picower, who began investing with Madoff in the 1970s. Picower, whom Picard called the biggest beneficiary of Madoff&#8217;s scheme, had a heart attack and drowned in a pool in Florida in October 2009. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. investigators had recovered about $2.3 billion for Madoff investors before reaching their deal with JPMorgan, including $2.2 billion from Picower&#8217;s estate and $100 million from Madoff&#8217;s Midtown Manhattan penthouse apartment and other belongings. The JPMorgan deal brings total U.S. recoveries to $4 billion -- a sum it will distribute through a separate process from the one used by Picard. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The liquidation case is Securities Investor Protection Corp. v. Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, 08-bk-01789, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Erik Larson in New York at elarson4@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Andrew Dunn at adunn8@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sold C$600
million ($541.5 million) of Canadian dollar-denominated debt in
the year&#8217;s initial sale of what are known as Maple bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank, which had initially come to market
with C$350 million of notes, increased the size of its seven-year offering and priced the debt to yield 173 basis points over
benchmark Canadian government bonds, according to a term sheet
seen by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coupon was 3.55 percent and the securities yielded
3.568 percent with ratings of Baa1 from Moody&#8217;s Investors
Service and A- from Standard  Poor&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notes&#8217; yielded more than the 2.3 percent average
effective yield in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Single-A
U.S. Banking Index, where the average maturity is 6.1 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was Goldman&#8217;s first Canadian issue since January 2013,
when it&#8217;s C$650 million of notes were sold with a coupon of
3.375 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Maple bond market, nicknamed for the nation&#8217;s maple-leaf flag, regained some investor acceptance after deal-making
froze in 2008 following government bailouts of banks that were
among the biggest issuers, reaching C$6 billion in 2012 and C$5
billion last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Canadian subsidiary of Wells Fargo  Co., sold C$1.25
billion of seven year notes Jan. 23, with a coupon of 3.04
percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is seeking
to sell bonds backed by Colombian highways, to help construction
companies raise money for the country&#8217;s 47 trillion-peso ($23
billion) road-building program, a government official said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luis Andrade, head of the Colombian infrastructure agency
ANI, said in an interview in Bogota that Goldman Sachs is
proposing the bond sales to supplement the costs that builders
are willing to bear and what banks are willing to lend. The New
York-based bank would package the bonds so they&#8217;re backed by
future proceeds from the highways, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The bottleneck for these projects is going to be
financing,&#8221; Andrade said. &#8220;Of the investment banks, the one
that&#8217;s been most attentive, and has put in time coming up with
ideas, is Goldman Sachs.&#8221; The New York-based firm is talking
directly with builders, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, didn&#8217;t
respond to an e-mailed request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has promised
the road projects as a way to stimulate economic growth,
builders have struggled to line up financing. Last week, ANI
extended the bid-submission deadline for the first project by a
month to March 7, after the country&#8217;s banking association said
project bidders needed more time to complete their proposals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the new program, builders must finance projects
themselves and recoup their investments later through toll-road
collections and government payments. The country previously had
made upfront payments to builders, a practice that led to
allegations of corruption and inefficiency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Extra Month &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the 10 approved bidders for the first project -- a
road from Puerto Salgar to Girardot in central Colombia -- were
ready to submit proposals by the original Feb. 7 deadline,
according to Andrade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A couple of the firms told us they were ready and even
that they were interested in going ahead because they knew that
others weren&#8217;t,&#8221; Andrade said. &#8220;We want ample participation
and of good quality, and if we see that because of timing we
won&#8217;t get it, then we&#8217;ll give a little bit more time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ANI will use the extra month to make &#8220;small
adjustments&#8221; to the contracts on the concessions, and the
government is studying whether to increase the fraction it pays
builders in dollars instead of the local currency, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re considering offering to pay more of it in dollars,
so that they can take on more debt from outside sources,&#8221;
Andrade said. &#8220;It varies from project to project. We&#8217;re seeing
how we can get it higher so that more or less 30 percent of the
project can be financed in dollars.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;World Bank &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombia&#8217;s development bank, Fondo de Desarrollo Nacional,
is also planning to announce by Feb. 14 the prices and
conditions under which it will lend to the projects, Andrade
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombia is expecting banks and institutional investors to
finance a combined 28 trillion pesos, Andrade said, with the
government willing to fund 6 trillion pesos through its
development bank. Another 4 trillion pesos would come from
multilateral agencies such as the World Bank&#8217;s International
Finance Corp., he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Colombian development bank may provide subordinated
loans to the projects for as much as 15 percent of the total
cost, Clemente del Valle, the bank&#8217;s president, said last week
in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eleven Indian regional parties said
they were forming a bloc to coordinate positions in the current
session of parliament, a precursor to a possible coalition in
national elections due by May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The bloc has been set up primarily to raise issues
affecting the people in parliament,&#8221; Sitaram Yechury, a leader
of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), told reporters in New
Delhi yesterday after a meeting of regional-party leaders. &#8220;A
joint program will be launched later&#8221; on campaigning together
in the general election, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regional parties seek to emerge as an alternative to
the ruling Congress party and the main opposition Bharatiya
Janata Party, with polls indicating no single group will be able
to form a majority. Rahul Gandhi&#8217;s Congress and Narendra Modi&#8217;s
BJP are wooing smaller parties to try to ensure victory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is the first step toward a formal non-Congress, non-BJP national coalition, and it will emerge in some form closer
to the elections,&#8221; said A.S. Narang, professor of political
science at the New Delhi-based Indira Gandhi National Open
University. &#8220;There are parties that sense there won&#8217;t be a
clear mandate, and such a scenario serves as a chance for
regional chieftains to grab power at the federal level.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regional parties are modeling themselves on the United
Front, which ran India&#8217;s government from 1996 to 1998 after
neither of the two main parties was able to form a coalition. A
similar alliance took power in 1989. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Third Front &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither of these so-called third-front governments survived
a full five-year term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 11 parties in the new formation hold 92 seats in the
545-member lower house of the Indian parliament. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regional parties that banded together yesterday
included the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the Communist
Party of India, Janata Dal (United), Samajwadi Party, Biju
Janata Dal and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazagham. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking aim at the new bloc in remarks in West Bengal state
today, Modi said yesterday that politically left parties had
&#8220;destroyed&#8221; the eastern region of India and that voters must
&#8220;banish them forever,&#8221; Press Trust of India reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BJP is set to win 188 seats in the 545-member lower
house, surpassing the 182 seats it won in 1999, according to a
C-Voter poll for India Today published Jan. 23. Congress may get
as few as 91 seats versus 210 now, dropping to its lowest on
record, the poll indicated. A separate survey on Jan. 24 showed
the BJP winning as many as 210 seats, with a maximum of 108 for
Congress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BJP and its allies would win 212 seats, more than the
159 seats they took in the 2009 elections, while the Congress-led alliance would get 103 seats, the C-Voter poll found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yechury said the future program of the regional parties
will contain issues related to the livelihood of the people,
upholding federalism and combating corruption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two houses of parliament yesterday faced repeated
disruption over a bill to create a new southern Indian state. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steven Cho and Leland Lim, Goldman
Sachs (GS) Group Inc. partners in its currency-trading business, have
left the firm, according to a person briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cho was global head of spot and forward trading of G-10
currencies in New York, while Lim was co-head of macro trading,
which includes interest-rates and currencies, for Asia ex-Japan,
said the person, who asked to remain anonymous because the
departures weren&#8217;t public. Cho and Lim were both named partners
in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators are probing whether traders at the world&#8217;s
largest banks colluded through instant-message groups to
manipulate benchmarks such as the WM/Reuters rates. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman Sachs, declined
to comment on whether the departures were related to any probe.
Cho didn&#8217;t return a call for comment, while Lim didn&#8217;t respond
to an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currency-trading revenue at the 10 largest global
investment banks declined 6 percent in the first nine months of
2013, according to industry analytics firm Coalition Ltd.
Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said the
currency business had &#8220;difficulty managing inventory&#8221; in the
third quarter as the firm posted its worst fixed-income trading
revenue since the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cho worked under Guy Saidenberg, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s global
head of foreign-exchange trading, who remains in his role, the
person familiar with the matter said. Cho joined the firm in
1996 after previously working at Citigroup Inc., according to a
biography on the website of the nonprofit organization Apex for
Youth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dow Jones Newswire reported Cho&#8217;s departure earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) entered
exclusive talks to sell its physical commodities unit to
Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. as the bank seeks to end a five-year
foray into owning and storing materials such as metals and oil,
according to two people briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bid from Geneva-based Mercuria beat offers from
Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) and Blackstone Group LP (BX), said one person,
who asked not to be identified because the discussions are
private. Blythe Masters, JPMorgan&#8217;s commodities chief, probably
won&#8217;t join Mercuria as part of the deal, which is still being
negotiated, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is selling the unit as regulators examine whether
catastrophic losses at federally backed banks could endanger the
financial system and lawmakers question whether firms have the
power to manipulate some prices. The Federal Reserve said in
July it might force insured lenders to get out of the business,
and New York-based JPMorgan agreed later that month to pay $410
million for claims that it manipulated power markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for Mercuria and JPMorgan declined to comment, as
did spokesmen for New York-based Blackstone and Sydney-based
Macquarie. Reuters reported on the exclusive talks earlier
today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right from the start, new Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella is showing that he will operate differently from predecessor Steve Ballmer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On his first day leading the world&#8217;s largest software maker, Nadella, a 22-year Microsoft veteran who was yesterday named CEO, exuded an understated calm during a less than 20-minute webcast for customers and employees. Rather than the customary press conference, the 46-year-old used the event to introduce himself and take questions from Microsoft Vice President Susan Hauser. The first line in his memo to employees started with &#8220;today is a very humbling day for me.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That contrasts with Ballmer, who for 14 years as Microsoft CEO was famous for his oversized personality. Ballmer, 57, once jumped out of a cake at Microsoft&#8217;s 25th anniversary party at Seattle&#8217;s Safeco Field and ran through the crowd giving high-fives as if he&#8217;d won the Super Bowl. In a memo to employees yesterday, Ballmer said he was &#8220;pumped.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If jarring, the change in style will be one of the advantages of choosing Nadella as Microsoft&#8217;s third CEO, said David Yoffie, a professor at Harvard Business School. Ballmer&#8217;s aggressive salesmanship during the boom days of the personal-computer industry exemplified how Microsoft became the world&#8217;s most valuable company. Now the software maker needs a new approach as it plays catch-up in areas including tablets, smartphones and cloud services. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nadella&#8217;s obviously a deep technologist, and he&#8217;s going to bring that back to a Microsoft that hasn&#8217;t had it in the CEO office for years,&#8221; Yoffie said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Changing Guard &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nadella&#8217;s low-key manner is also a sign of a changing of the guard in technology, as larger-than-life founders and near-founders such as Ballmer leave the scene. As part of yesterday&#8217;s changes, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates also stepped aside as chairman and was replaced by lead independent director John Thompson. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft isn&#8217;t the only technology company that has hired a product-focused CEO in recent years. Yahoo! Inc. recruited engineer Marissa Mayer from Google Inc. in 2012 to be CEO, while networking-equipment maker Juniper Networks Inc. recently appointed Shaygan Kheradpir, who had built networks for Verizon Communications Inc. and others, as CEO. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Opinion: Why Microsoft and Everyone Else Loves Indian CEOs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This industry goes through cycles, and we&#8217;re in a cycle where customers are looking for new products,&#8221; Kheradpir said in an interview yesterday. &#8220;It&#8217;s not a sales or a marketing thing right now.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s decision to forgo a press conference on Nadella&#8217;s ascension may also be an effort to show that &#8220;the business isn&#8217;t about one person or personality,&#8221; said Carol Blymire, a communications consultant. &#8220;Maybe we&#8217;ve come to the end of the era of the rock star technology CEO.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Frank Shaw, a spokesman for Microsoft, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Employee Rally &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;At a rally with employees yesterday at the atrium in Studio D, one of the newer buildings at Microsoft&#8217;s corporate campus in Redmond, Washington, Nadella demonstrated some continuity with the Ballmer-Gates era. Amid a standing-room-only crowd, Nadella appeared with Gates and Ballmer, who have been Microsoft&#8217;s only other two CEOs. Nadella emphasized the importance of software and talked about how the company is moving into devices and cloud services, according to a person who attended. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet Nadella also delivered a message that it was time for a change. In his e-mail to employees, he wrote, &#8220;Our industry does not respect tradition -- it only respects innovation. Make no mistake, we are headed for greater places.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Basketball, Cricket &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The differences between Ballmer and Nadella begin with their backgrounds. Nadella is an engineer with degrees in electrical engineering and computer science, as well as an MBA that he earned by taking weekend classes after he had started at Microsoft. Ballmer is an Ivy League-educated businessman who specialized in sales and marketing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The dissimilarities extend into the two men&#8217;s personal lives. Ballmer is known as a ferocious defender and rebounder on the basketball court. Nadella lists poetry as an interest and one of his favorite sports is cricket, which features scheduled tea breaks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;He&#8217;s a thoughtful, quiet leader who rallies people around him,&#8221; former Microsoft Chief Financial Officer John Connors said of Nadella. &#8220;He works harder than anybody. He&#8217;ll make the tough calls but he&#8217;s very urbane and civil.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Ballmer&#8217;s Changes &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ballmer has made some changes in the past year that will help Nadella, said Will Poole, a former Microsoft vice president who left in 2008 and remains in close touch with the company. Last year, Ballmer discontinued a review system he had implemented that ranked each person in every work group on a bell curve, an approach that forced some employees to behave more politically. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ballmer also pushed through a major reorganization in July to break down walls at Microsoft. Rather than run their own discrete businesses, top executives now oversee functional areas, such as software and hardware engineering. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ballmer&#8217;s strained relationship with Wall Street also leaves Nadella plenty of room for improvement, said Daniel Ives, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ballmer wasn&#8217;t hands on with the Street,&#8221; said Ives, who has the equivalent of a hold rating on the stock. &#8220;I expect Nadella to be a lot more front and center, because it&#8217;s needed. He needs to prove that his vision is right.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nadella will still work with Ballmer in the boardroom, where both are directors. Having Ballmer there may make it complicated for Nadella to undo major initiatives from his predecessor, Yoffie said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Communicating with his board will be as challenging in some ways as all the other challenges he&#8217;ll face with the external world,&#8221; Yoffie said of Nadella. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Peter Burrows in San Francisco at pburrows@bloomberg.net; Dina Bass in Seattle at dbass2@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Pui-Wing Tam at ptam13@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) and JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) agreed to pay $1.86 billion to end U.S. accusations of
misconduct in their handling of home loans and related
securities that left taxpayers shouldering losses after the
financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley said yesterday it reached a $1.25 billion
deal to end Federal Housing Finance Agency claims the bank sold
faulty mortgage bonds to Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC) before the
firms&#8217; losses pushed them into U.S. conservatorship. JPMorgan
will pay $614 million after admitting it submitted ineligible
loans for Federal Housing Administration and Veterans Affairs
insurance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan &#8220;put profits ahead of responsibility by
recklessly churning out thousands of defective mortgage loans,
failing to inform the government of known problems with those
loans and leaving the government to cover the losses,&#8221;
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The six largest U.S. lenders have allocated more than $114
billion since the financial crisis to cover legal expenses,
government probes and mortgage-related claims. Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
deal with the FHFA prompted the New York-based bank to book an
additional $150 million charge in the fourth quarter, reducing
earnings for the period by 5 cents a share. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To bring Las Vegas-style gambling to
Florida, casino operators like Sheldon Adelson are sending more
than 100 lobbyists to the state Capitol to battle their biggest
adversary: Mickey Mouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clash pits casino operators Genting Bhd. (GENT) and Las Vegas
Sands Corp. (LVS), controlled by billionaire Adelson, against Walt
Disney Co. (DIS), which runs theme parks and resorts near Orlando, and
may face new competition for convention business. Companies on
both sides of the dispute are sending lobbyists and campaign
checks to Florida lawmakers, who say they&#8217;ll consider expanding
gambling this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A state-commissioned study found that full-service casinos
and their associated hotels could generate $1.5 billion in
spending annually in Florida, making the fourth-most populous
state an attractive target for the gambling industry as it
pushes to expand in the U.S. The outcome is critical for Disney,
as the world&#8217;s largest entertainment company seeks to protect
its Walt Disney World Resort, which includes theme parks and
five convention facilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Gambling interests in Las Vegas and Atlantic City are
looking for new territory, and opening Florida to them would be
tremendous,&#8221; said Robert Jarvis, who teaches gambling law at
Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale. &#8220;The fear for
Disney is that instead of people going to Disney and dropping
their disposable income there, they&#8217;ll go to the destination
casinos and drop their money there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A measure of U.S. corporate credit
risk declined as applications for U.S. unemployment benefits
fell for the first time in three weeks. International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM) issued $4.5 billion of bonds in four parts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark used to hedge against losses or
to speculate on creditworthiness, decreased 3.1 basis points to
69.8 basis points at 5:03 p.m. in New York, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The gauge has fallen from a more-than
three-month high of 74.5 basis points on Feb. 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stronger employment outlook may bolster investor
confidence in a strengthening economy, which would help
companies repay their obligations. Jobless claims dropped by
20,000 to 331,000 in the period ended Feb. 1, the Labor
Department reported today in Washington, signaling employers are
confident demand for goods and services will hold up at the same
time fiscal restraints ease. The median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg called for a decrease to 335,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The economic data continues to be on track in the U.S.,&#8221;
William Larkin, a fixed-income money manager who helps oversee
$500 million at Cabot Money Management Inc., said in a telephone
interview from Salem, Massachusetts. &#8220;The market is going to be
putting a lot of weighting on Friday&#8217;s employment report.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Labor Department may report tomorrow that payrolls
increased by 180,000 employees in January after a 74,000
increase in December, according to the median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Labor Gains &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies added 175,000 workers in January as colder-than-normal weather limited progress in the labor market, according
to a report yesterday by the ADP Research Institute in Roseland,
New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The credit swaps measure typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM sold $1 billion of two-year floating-rate notes to
yield 7 basis points more than the three-month London interbank
offered rate and $750 million of five-year floaters to yield 37
basis points more than the benchmark, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IBM Offering &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider also issued
$750 million of 1.95 percent, five-year debt to yield 48 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries and $2 billion of
3.625 percent, 10-year securities with a relative yield of 95
basis points, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proceeds may be used for general corporate purposes and the
securities may be rated Aa3 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service,
according to the data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a strong credit that there&#8217;s going to be demand
for,&#8221; Jody Lurie, a corporate-credit analyst at Janney
Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia, said in a telephone
interview. One reason IBM issued now was &#8220;because they know
what the market will offer today versus tomorrow.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Payrolls in December increased at the slowest pace since
January 2011 and the unemployment rate dropped to 6.7 percent,
the lowest since October 2008, as more people left the labor
force. Another weak number &#8220;would reinforce the fear that
another false start on this recovery has reemerged,&#8221; Eric Green, global head of foreign exchange, rates and commodities at
TD Securities USA LLC in New York, wrote today in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Commercial Paper &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market for corporate borrowing through short-term IOUs
fell to the lowest level in about six months. The seasonally
adjusted amount of U.S. commercial paper decreased $24.2 billion
to $989.7 billion outstanding in the week ended yesterday, the
fourth straight drop, the Federal Reserve said today on its
website. That&#8217;s the lowest level since the market touched $987.6
billion in the period ended Aug. 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commercial paper sold by non-U.S. financial institutions
fell $13.3 billion to $239 billion, the lowest level since the
period ended July 17, while the amount issued by U.S.-based
banks decreased $6.6 billion to $267.6 billion, the lowest level
since the period ended Sept. 4. Corporations sell commercial
paper, typically maturing in 270 days or less, to fund everyday
activities such as rent and salaries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk premium on the Markit CDX North American High
Yield Index, tied to the debt of 100 speculative-grade
companies, narrowed 14.3 basis points to 340.9, Bloomberg prices
show. High-yield, high-risk bonds are rated below Baa3 by
Moody&#8217;s and less than BBB- at Standard  Poor&#8217;s. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to hold investment-grade
corporate bonds rather than government debt was little changed
at 112, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While SodaStream International Ltd. (SODA) has poked fun at Coca-Cola Co. (KO) in its commercials, the world&#8217;s largest soft-drink maker may get the last laugh. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola&#8217;s agreement to buy a 10 percent stake in Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. (GMCR) and help market its new single-serve home soda appliance gives the device credibility even before it debuts later this year. That&#8217;s unwelcome news for SodaStream, the leader in at-home soda machines, which already is struggling to maintain the pace of its sales growth. It also may pressure SodaStream and PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) to partner up and counter the threat. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Opinion: Green Mountain Sold Some Stock to Buy Back Some Other Stock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Many will view this announcement as negative for SodaStream, but there is a small possibility that PepsiCo follows Coke&#8217;s lead and partners with SodaStream,&#8221; Bill Schmitz, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in Greenwich, Connecticut, wrote today in a note to clients. &#8220;It will be interesting to see if Green Mountain&#8217;s product, which relies on a chemical reaction, gains traction relative to SodaStream&#8217;s CO2-based solution.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He has a hold rating for SodaStream. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;PepsiCo and SodaStream spokesmen didn&#8217;t return telephone calls seeking comment on the speculation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Money manager David Einhorn&#8217;s wager
against Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. was undermined after
Coca-Cola Co. agreed to buy a 10 percent stake in the maker of
Keurig coffee brewers, sending the shares surging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola is buying the 16.7 million newly issued shares
for about $74.98 apiece, the companies said yesterday in a
statement. Green Mountain climbed 26 percent today to close at
$102.10 in New York, the highest price since Sept. 28, 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Einhorn, who runs $10 billion hedge-fund firm Greenlight
Capital Inc., first criticized Green Mountain at an Oct. 17,
2011 conference saying that the company should improve its
disclosure and that it has a &#8220;litany of accounting questions.&#8221;
Shares of Green Mountain, which were trading at about $92 before
Einhorn&#8217;s 2011 comments, have advanced more than 10 percent
since then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Einhorn is also chairman of Greenlight Capital Re Ltd. and
has been discussing Green Mountain on the Cayman Islands-based
reinsurer&#8217;s conference calls for at least a year-and-a-half. The
bet helped Greenlight in the second quarter of 2012, when Green
Mountain dropped 54 percent to $21.78. Einhorn hasn&#8217;t disclosed
the size of his wager against Green Mountain, or if he is still
sticking to it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks rose, sending benchmark indexes to their best gains this year, as claims for unemployment benefits fell and earnings from Walt Disney Co. to Akamai (AKAM) Technologies Inc. surpassed estimates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney gained 5.3 percent after posting quarterly profit that beat estimates. Akamai, which helps speed Internet-data delivery for customers such as Apple Inc. and Sony Corp., soared 21 percent after beating forecasts for quarterly earnings. Coca-Cola (KO) Co. advanced 1.1 percent after agreeing to buy 10 percent of Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. for about $1.25 billion. Green Mountain surged 26 percent. Twitter Inc. plunged 24 percent after reporting a wider-than-projected loss and slowing user growth. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index (SPX) climbed 1.2 percent to 1,773.43 at 4 p.m. in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average to added 188.30 points, or 1.2 percent, to 15,628.53. Both measures capped their biggest gains since Dec. 18. About 6.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, 9 percent above the three-month average. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The economy is showing somewhat steady improvement and earnings have been good,&#8221; Richard Sichel, chief investment officer at Philadelphia Trust Co., said in a telephone interview. He helps oversee $1.9 billion. &#8220;The better economic reports are helpful, it gives a little bit of a confidence booster.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arjun Murti, a Goldman Sachs (GS) Group
Inc. equity research analyst who covers oil companies including
Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and ConocoPhillips, will retire after 15 years
at the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Murti, a partner at the New York-based company who served
as co-head of equity research in the Americas, will become an
advisory director, according to an internal memo from Steve Strongin, head of global investment research. Leslie Shribman, a
Goldman Sachs spokeswoman, confirmed the memo and declined to
comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Murti in March 2005 correctly predicted a &#8220;super spike&#8221;
in the price of oil, which almost tripled from that point to a
record $147.27 in July 2008. Exxon shares hit an all-time high
last December as Murti raised his rating to buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Over the course of his career, Arjun has distinguished
himself as a leading expert in the energy sector,&#8221; Strongin
wrote in the memo. Murti will continue covering the integrated
oil and refining sectors while the firm makes plans for his
successor, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Murti joined Goldman Sachs in 1999 and was named partner in
2006. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, won a court ruling that will block generic versions
of its No. 1 product, Lyrica, in the U.S. until December 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA), Actavis Plc (ACT) and Lupin
Ltd. (LPC) are among the generic-drug makers that would infringe a
valid patent on the pain medicine, the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit in Washington said in an opinion today on
its website. The other generic-drug makers in the case were Sun
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Wockhardt Ltd. and Mylan Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyrica has become increasingly important to Pfizer&#8217;s
earnings since the New York-based company lost patent protection
on its cholesterol pill Lipitor, which once generated almost $13
billion a year. Sales of Lyrica, used to treat shingles,
fibromyalgia, epilepsy, and hot flashes, reached $4.6 billion
last year, accounting for 9 percent of Pfizer&#8217;s total revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeal centered on a single aspect of a patent covering
the active ingredient, pregabalin. The generic-drug makers
argued that the patent didn&#8217;t adequately describe a new
invention, and was an obvious variation of other compounds. They
conceded that, if the patent claim was upheld, they had no
chance at winning on that or a second patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We perceive no error in the district court&#8217;s
construction&#8221; of what the patent claim covers, the three-judge
panel wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Pfizer Inc. (PFE) v. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc.,
12-1576, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
(Washington). The lower court case is Pfizer Inc. v. Teva
Pharmaceuticals USA Inc., 09cv307, U.S. District Court for the
District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The head of Goldman Sachs (GS) Group
Inc.&#8217;s operations in Germany and the country&#8217;s second-highest
ranking bank regulator will testify at the trial of former
managers of Sal. Oppenheim Jr.  Cie this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Alexander Dibelius will give evidence on
Feb. 12 at the tribunal in Cologne where the case is being
heard, according to the court&#8217;s witness list. Frauke Menke, the
head of banking supervision at Bafin, is scheduled to testify
Feb. 20, the same day as Thomas Middelhoff, the former chief
executive officer of Bertelsmann AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former Sal. Oppenheim managers are charged with breach
of trust over bad investments, including property deals
prosecutors say resulted in about 150 million euros ($204
million) of losses. The court is also reviewing loans to
Arcandor AG (ARO), a German retailer which went bankrupt in 2009, in
the trial, which began last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Fisher, a spokesman for Bafin, said he didn&#8217;t know what
Menke&#8217;s testimony would be about. A spokesman for the Cologne
court, Achim Hengstenberg, said he couldn&#8217;t comment on the
subject of the testimony. The court is reviewing allegations
over the Arcandor investment at the moment, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sal. Oppenheim put itself up for sale after reporting a
2008 loss of 117 million euros, its first yearly loss since
World War II, from investments in real estate and companies.
Deutsche Bank AG bought the family-run lender, founded in 1789,
for its wealth-management operations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
is raising its bet on Africa by spending $100 million to bring
its Watson technology to the continent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider plans to
introduce Watson, an artificial-intelligence system best known
for beating humans on the &#8220;Jeopardy!&#8221; game show, to government
agencies, universities, scientists and other partners in Africa
to process socioeconomic information, the company said in a
statement. It will also establish a research center to help
advance a 10-year IBM initiative to spur development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moves are part of an effort by Chief Executive Officer
Ginni Rometty to make the continent into a growth engine for
IBM, which has reported seven consecutive quarters of falling
revenue. Last year&#8217;s 5 percent sales decline in its traditional
growth markets of Brazil, Russia, India and China helped drag
down total revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Africa, &#8220;we&#8217;re getting more partners and we&#8217;re helping
the economic development,&#8221; Solomon Assefa, an IBM researcher,
said in an interview. &#8220;Africa is really moving forward. We
believe that this investment reflects that it&#8217;s also a very good
business decision.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM will be expanding its investment in Watson as the
Armonk, New York-based company looks to data analytics to boost
growth. IBM said last month that it will spend $1 billion to
create a new division around Watson, which analyzes troves of
data and can answer questions in conversational language. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Research Center &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the company opened a research laboratory in
Nairobi, Kenya, its 12th in the world. In 2013, IBM had
operations in more than 20 African countries, up from four in
2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson can analyze large amounts of data after the
information is uploaded to the tool. Assefa said IBM&#8217;s new
research center, the Center of Excellence for Data-Driven
Development, will serve as a central point for universities,
government agencies and other partners to upload data. Assefa
declined to comment on partners for the project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health care and education will be two initial focus areas
for which IBM intends to deploy the Watson technology, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s current
and former employees, including former U.S. Treasury Secretary
Henry Paulson, have helped Republican Neel Kashkari raise almost
$1 million in his bid for California&#8217;s governorship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kashkari, a former Goldman vice president who as a Treasury
official managed the $700 billion rescue of the U.S. banking
system, reported $976,000 in contributions since announcing his
candidacy on Jan. 21. The donations included $79,400 from
Goldman employees and $54,400 from Paulson and his wife, Wendy,
according to a filing yesterday with the California Secretary of
State. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our campaign&#8217;s robust fundraising in these first two
weeks underscores Neel&#8217;s strength as a candidate, and it will
help ensure that we have the resources necessary to share with
voters his vision for turning California around,&#8221; Pat Melton,
Kashkari&#8217;s campaign manager, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kashkari, 40, is running in California&#8217;s June 3 primary,
where the top two vote-getters, regardless of party, advance to
the November general election. Also running for governor is
Republican state Assemblyman Tim Donnelly, 47, who raised
$374,000 last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governor Jerry Brown, a Democrat who hasn&#8217;t said whether
he&#8217;ll seek another term, has $17 million in campaign funds from
donors including Exxon Mobil Corp., Facebook Inc. (FB) and Microsoft
Corp., as well as porn mogul Larry Flynt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown was elected in 2010 after having previously served as
governor from 1975 to 1983. Prior to his second stint as
California&#8217;s chief executive, he also was elected mayor of
Oakland and the state&#8217;s attorney general. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Equity Work &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his work in the Troubled Asset Relief Program under
Paulson, Kashkari joined Pacific Investment Management Co. in
Newport Beach, California, in 2009, where he led the world&#8217;s
largest bond fund&#8217;s expansion into equities. He left in January
2013 and has said he spent the past year meeting with almost 700
potential donors from around the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson, a former chief executive officer at New York-based
Goldman Sachs, and his wife each gave the maximum individual
contribution of $27,200 under California law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs employees who donated to Kashkari&#8217;s campaign
include George C. Lee, II, listed as an executive living in
Tiburon, California, who gave $27,200; Jon Woodruff, a banker
from Menlo Park, California, who donated $27,200; and Andrew Gordon, an investment banker from Los Angeles, who gave $5,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Goldman Sachs employee Matthew L&#8217;Heureux of
Kentfield, California, gave $9,000 and O&#8217;Malley Miller, a
partner at the law firm Munger, Tolles  Olson LLP, who has
represented Goldman Sachs, gave $10,000, according to the
campaign filing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) briefly surpassed Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM) as the second-most valuable company, trailing only
Apple (AAPL) Inc. and underscoring the growing role of technology in
the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, which became the world&#8217;s largest online advertiser
through its dominant search engine, had a higher market
capitalization during intraday trading today before falling back
at the close in New York to a value of $395.4 billion compared
to Exxon&#8217;s $395.7 billion, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Apple had a market value of $463.5 billion. Software
company Microsoft Corp. is No. 4 with $303.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology companies are establishing themselves as key
players worldwide as they disrupt industries from retail to
finance. Google, which went public in 2004 -- 84 years after
Exxon -- has benefited from consumers moving to online services
and content, a trend that&#8217;s being accelerated by the growing
popularity of smartphones and tablets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s the sign of the times,&#8221; said Fadel Gheit, an
analyst at Oppenheimer  Co. in New York. &#8220;Out with the old and
in with the new.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Under Pressure &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the world&#8217;s largest oil producer by market value,
has been under pressure since it reported fourth-quarter output
declined last month. Net income fell 16 percent to $8.35
billion, or $1.91 a share. Sales dropped 3.3 percent to $110.86
billion. Global output for the Irving, Texas-based company
dropped for the ninth time in 10 quarters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blythe Masters, JPMorgan Chase  Co.

Masters, 44, stepped down because the company&#8217;s sale of its physical commodities unit will keep her occupied, the person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is selling a division that deals in assets such as metals and oil, as government watchdogs examine whether federally backed lenders should be involved in such markets. Masters&#8217;s appointment drew criticism from Twitter users who questioned the propriety of her advising the regulator of futures and swaps. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Masters, whose name appeared on a list of committee members on the CFTC&#8217;s website yesterday, had been scheduled to participate in a Feb. 12 meeting to discuss cross-border guidance on rules.

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
and BP Plc led a 25 percent jump in U.S. company bond sales this
week as borrowers rushed to lock in yields at about a seven-month low before a labor report today that showed employers
added fewer jobs than economists projected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider, and
London-based BP led $23.8 billion of offerings that rose from
$19.1 billion in the five days ended Jan. 31, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Issuance compares with $24.3 billion in
the first week of February 2013 and follows $140.8 billion of
sales last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offerings increased as companies sought to borrow before
the report on employment growth that MFR economist Joshua
Shapiro said might be a &#8220;crapshoot.&#8221; Payrolls rose 113,000 in
January, the Labor Department said, less than the 180,000 median
forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey. Investors are
watching for signs of weakness in the world&#8217;s biggest economy
amid a rout in emerging markets from Argentina to Turkey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In any given month, it&#8217;s the date on the calendar that
issuers are most mindful about assessing,&#8221; Edward Marrinan, a
macro credit strategist at RBS Securities in Stamford,
Connecticut, said before the report. Weak jobs numbers &#8220;give a
lot of people a lot of reasons to get anxious about the growth
story.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Assessing Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to own corporate bonds
rather than government debentures reached 193 basis points
yesterday, unchanged from Jan. 31, according to the Bank of
America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate  High Yield Index. Yields
increased to 3.9 percent from 3.89 percent, and compare with a
record low 3.35 percent in May. Yields last week touched 3.84
percent, the lowest since June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM sold $4.5 billion of bonds in four parts including $2
billion of 3.625 percent, 10-year notes to yield 95 basis points
more than similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. The
Armonk, New York-based company also issued $1.5 billion of five-year notes in fixed- and floating-rate portions and $1 billion
of two-year floaters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP, Europe&#8217;s second-largest oil company, issued $2.5
billion of bonds in three parts through its BP Capital Markets
unit, Bloomberg data show. The largest portion, $1.25 billion of
3.81 percent, 10-year securities, priced with a relative yield
of 115 basis points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of investment-grade debentures reached at least $17
billion, compared with $13.2 billion last week and a weekly
average of $21.9 billion in 2013, Bloomberg data show. Offerings
of speculative-grade bonds reached at least $6.8 billion,
compared with $6 billion last week and a weekly average of $7.2
billion last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculative-grade bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service and lower than BBB- by Standard  Poor&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     Feb. 7 (Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase  Co. is offering $390
million of non-performing loans as banks including HSBC Holdings
Plc and Regions Financial Corp. increasingly look to sell
troubled mortgage debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan put the pool of debt, a portion of which is tied
to residential properties in New York, on the market this week,
said two people with knowledge of the offering, who asked not to
be named because the sale is private. HSBC hired BlackRock Inc.
to manage the potential sale of as much as $1 billion in
delinquent loans and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is handling an
auction of about $700 million of modified loans for Regions,
according to two separate people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of the debt are accelerating amid financial
regulations that force banks to pledge more capital for some
assets they hold, including non-performing loans, or NPLs. The
government also is adding to the supply as it auctions the debt
to help prevent foreclosures and stem losses at the Federal
Housing Administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Banks have made a decision internally that a delinquent
borrower is not a core customer,&#8221;Ashish Pandey, chief
executive officer of Altisource Residential Corp. (RESI), said at a
conference in Las Vegas last month. Pandey, whose firm had 6,300
delinquent loans as of the third quarter of 2013, said he
expects as many as 500,000 non-performing loans to sell in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s policy shifts are a bigger
driver of the selloff in emerging markets than the Federal
Reserve&#8217;s decision to dial back stimulus, according to Goldman
Sachs Asset Management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volatility will rise toward its long-term average and that
means an increase in risk premiums, said Philip Moffitt, head of
fixed income in Sydney for Asia and the Pacific at Goldman Sachs
Asset Management, which had $991 billion of assets under
supervision worldwide as of September. The risks for different
emerging economies will become more idiosyncratic and Mexico
presents a buying opportunity following the rout, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets from Turkey to South Africa and Argentina were
roiled during the past month as investors sold off emerging-economy currencies, stocks and bonds, prompting emergency
measures from governments and central banks. The bout of risk
aversion follows the Fed&#8217;s decision to scale back asset
purchases and China&#8217;s pledge to rein in leverage and give market
forces a more decisive role in allocating resources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The selloff in emerging markets has much more to do with
China than with Fed tapering,&#8221; Moffitt said yesterday in an
interview in Sydney. &#8220;China&#8217;s such a big source of global
demand, in particular for other emerging markets, uncertainty&#8217;s
going to stay high and risk premiums should be expanding.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Philip Moffitt, head of fixed income in Sydney for Asia and the Pacific at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said investing in Mexico would be his top trade at the moment because the country&#8217;s fundamental outlook is strong even though it has been affected by the global selloff. Close

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and General
Electric Co. (GE)&#8217;s finance arm had their smallest Samurai-bond sales
in more than nine years as a global stock rout damped investor
demand for debt that offered investors record-low yields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Electric Capital Corp. sold 55 billion yen ($536
million) in three-year fixed-rate, yen-denominated notes that
pay 0.313 percent on Feb. 6, while JPMorgan offered 48.5 billion
yen in a two-tranche deal, including three-year fixed-rate notes
offering 0.373 percent. Those rates are the lowest ever paid by
the companies on the yen-denominated debt, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese investors are wary of buying overseas debt
offering such low yields after concerns that the Chinese economy
is slowing and the impact from U.S. Federal Reserve stimulus
cuts triggered a selloff in emerging-market currencies and
global stocks. JPMorgan joined Morgan Stanley last week in
agreeing to pay $1.86 billion to settle U.S. accusations of
misconduct in their handling of home loans and related
securities that left taxpayers shouldering losses after the
global financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Compared with notes from local issuers, Samurai bonds are
more exposed to overseas risk,&#8221; said Yoshihiro Nakatani, a
Tokyo-based senior fund manager who oversees about 100 billion
yen of bonds at Asahi Life Asset Management Co. &#8220;Spreads on
Samurai have fallen to unattractive levels, and it will be
difficult for Japanese investors to buy at the kind of rates
offered by JPMorgan and GE in future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spread &#8216;Unattractive&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nakatani, who has invested in GE Capital&#8217;s debt in the
past, said he didn&#8217;t buy the Norwalk, Connecticut-based
company&#8217;s notes this time because the spread was
&#8220;unattractive.&#8221; He doesn&#8217;t invest in U.S. banks like JPMorgan
as they can be affected more by financial regulation, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom Steiner, a London-based spokesman for GE Capital,
declined to comment on the company&#8217;s sale. Yukako Yoshino, a
spokeswoman for JPMorgan in Tokyo, also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan last had a Samurai sale smaller than last week&#8217;s
in September 2004, when it issued 25 billion yen in notes,
following two bigger sales the same year, according to
Bloomberg-compiled data. General Electric hasn&#8217;t had a smaller
sale, according to the data going back to 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GE Capital sold 95 billion yen of Samurai notes in
September, including 72.1 billion yen in debt also 10 basis
points over yen swaps. The spread on securities of the same
length offered last week declined to 4 basis points. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan issued 105.6 billion yen of Samurai bonds in June,
including 51.5 billion yen in three-year notes at 10 basis
points over swaps, the same level as last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Falling Spread &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average spread on Samurais was at 41 basis points on
Feb. 6, the least since November 2007, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GE is rated AA+ by Standard  Poor&#8217;s, its second-highest
ranking, and four levels above the A grade it gives JPMorgan.
SP lowered its outlook on JPMorgan to negative from stable in
June, saying that the likelihood of &#8220;extraordinary&#8221; government
support for the U.S. bank is waning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Topix index of Japanese shares has fallen 8.7 percent
this year after a 52 percent gain in 2013. The gauge rose on
Feb. 7 to pare a fifth straight week of losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Stock prices are falling and investors are worried, so
they aren&#8217;t going after credit investments,&#8221; said Mana Nakazora, the chief credit analyst at BNP Paribas in Tokyo, in a
telephone interview. &#8220;There&#8217;s very little incentive to make
investments at such low levels at a difficult time to assess
risk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Biggest Seller &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the biggest U.S. seller of Samurai bonds since
the global financial crisis, issuing 426.7 billion yen of the
notes from 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
General Electric is the second largest, at 370.7 billion yen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issuers from Australia to Norway have raised about 370
billion yen via Samurai sales this year, up from 60 billion for
the entire first quarter of last year. National Australia Bank
Ltd. is the biggest issuer of the securities this year, having
sold 123.8 billion yen last month. Norway&#8217;s DNB Bank ASA sold
81.6 billion yen also in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Following the emerging-market shock, and possibility of
spreads widening for overseas names, there appears to have been
a feeling that there wasn&#8217;t a need to rush to buy GE Capital&#8217;s
Samurai this time,&#8221; said Yusuke Ueda, a Tokyo-based credit
analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. For JPMorgan, &#8220;the
tone seems to have been a little different&#8221; and the bank had
less of a need to sell Samurai debt, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mortgage Settlement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will pay $614 million after admitting it submitted
ineligible loans for Federal Housing Administration and Veterans
Affairs insurance, according to a statement on Feb. 4 by the
U.S. Justice Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said in a statement the same day that the
&#8220;settlement represents another significant step in the firm&#8217;s
efforts to put historical mortgage-related issues behind it.&#8221;
The bank separately agreed last year to pay $4 billion to settle
Federal Housing Finance Agency claims related to about $33
billion in mortgage bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Under normal circumstances, JPMorgan probably would have
liked to sell a lot, lot more bonds&#8221; at a premium of as little
as 10 basis points, said BNP&#8217;s Nakazora said. &#8220;It&#8217;s litigation
risk has been very big.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenhill  Co. (GHL) hired Rodrigo Mello,
a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. investment-banking executive,
as a managing director to help build its new business in Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mello, 39, will work in the Sao Paulo office for the New
York-based merger-and-acquisition advisory firm, according to
Daniel Wainstein, a former partner and chairman of Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s Brazil investment-banking business who joined Greenhill
in October. Mello left Goldman Sachs&#8217;s investment-banking
division in November after two stints totaling 14 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Rodrigo Mello is one of the most experienced MA
executives in Brazil and a banker trusted by our clients,&#8221;
Wainstein said in an interview. &#8220;We are very happy he decided
to join us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenhill, founded by former Morgan Stanley President
Robert F. Greenhill, hired Wainstein, 43, to be the country head
for its first South American branch. The firm is growing in
Brazil as some international banks pull back. Goldman Sachs
halted an expansion there last year, and London-based Barclays
Plc has been reducing staff in Brazil as competition with local
lenders intensifies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If a region is going through some cyclical economic
challenges, it can be an even more opportune time for us to
recruit,&#8221; Greenhill Chief Executive Officer Scott Bok said in a
statement in October. &#8220;Brazil will certainly have its ups and
downs, just like the U.S. market does, but Brazil is clearly a
large market that will see significant economic growth over the
long term.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hiring Plans &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wainstein is building a team to advise Brazilian companies
on global transactions. The short-term plan is to hire a senior
vice president, a vice president and three bankers at the
associate analyst level, he said in the interview. The office
already employs five executives, including Wainstein. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our goal is to build one of the most important MA
advisory platforms in Brazil using Greenhill&#8217;s international
relationship network,&#8221; Wainstein said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Announced mergers and acquisitions involving companies in
Brazil increased more than 18 percent to $78.8 billion last year
from 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Goldman Sachs, Mello was a private-equity executive
at Banco Santander SA. He also worked from 2005 to 2007 as chief
financial officer at Monte Cristalina SA, a holding company
owned by Joao Alves de Queiroz Filho, founder and the biggest
shareholder of Hypermarcas SA, the Sao Paulo-based consumer-goods maker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gilt Groupe Inc., an online retailer
of discounted luxury goods, picked Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to
manage its initial public offering, according to people with
knowledge of the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timing for the IPO has still not been decided, said the
people, who asked not to be identified because the announcement
hasn&#8217;t been made public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E-commerce IPOs have been rare in recent years as
Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) expanded its dominance by focusing on growth --
building warehouses and lowering prices -- while forgoing
profit. Zulily Inc., which runs a shopping site targeted at
moms, was an exception last year. After its share sale, Zulily
is now valued at $4.76 billion, making it the third-biggest U.S.
e-commerce company by market value, behind Amazon and EBay Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gilt, founded in 2007, was forced to cut divisions and
eliminate jobs after competition emerged for its flash sale
model, which involves offering limited-time deals at steep
discounts. The company named former Citigroup Inc. marketing
head Michelle Peluso as chief executive officer last year,
replacing co-founder Kevin Ryan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview in September with Bloomberg Radio, Peluso
said that an IPO is &#8220;a likely path for us but we&#8217;re not in a
rush.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is an investor in Gilt and was part of a $138
million financing round in 2011, valuing the company at about $1
billion, that included Japan&#8217;s Softbank Corp. and venture
investors General Atlantic and Matrix Partners. The company has
raised a total of at least $240 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rising Revenue &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012, Gilt generated $550 million in revenue, excluding
businesses it discontinued, up from $450 million the prior year.
The company was expected to generate cash from operations by the
end of last year, Peluso said in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Miller, a spokeswoman for New York-based Gilt,
declined to comment. A spokesman for Goldman Sachs declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. e-commerce market is expected to climb 15 percent
this year to $300.6 billion, according to researcher EMarketer
Inc. Revenue at Seattle-based Amazon is projected to rise 21
percent to $90 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gilt&#8217;s current deals include a pair of Elizabeth  James
womens&#8217; sandals for $129, down from $198, and a $449 Hickey
mens&#8217; pinstripe sports coat, down from $895. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Leaving Flash &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Gilt rivals have moved away from flash sales and
others are stumbling. Fab.com Inc. stopped its flash technique
last year, opting instead to let customers track departments and
products they like, and has cut jobs. Rue La La and Lot18 laid
off employees and scaled back. Totsy, a flash site aimed at
moms, liquidated its assets last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ventee-Privee.com, a French e-retailer that competes with
Gilt, plans to more than quadruple revenue in the next decade by
extending the flash model, founder Jacques-Antoine Granjon said
this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peluso was CEO of Sabre Corp.&#8217;s online flight reservations
unit, Travelocity, which she helped modernize starting in 2003.
In 2009, the year she joined the board of Gilt, she began
working for Citigroup and became chief marketing and Internet
officer, aiming to make banking technology more consumer-friendly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s $13 billion
fraud settlement with the U.S. government should be blocked
until a court is able to review it, a Wall Street watchdog group
founded by an Atlanta hedge fund manager said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better Markets Inc. is seeking judicial scrutiny of the
accord because it&#8217;s the largest settlement &#8220;with a single
entity in the 237-year history of the U.S.,&#8221; according to a
complaint filed today in Washington federal court. &#8220;No one has
any ability to determine if the $13 billion agreement is fair&#8221;
or &#8220;if it is a sweetheart deal,&#8221; the group said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accord, announced in November, settled allegations that
the biggest U.S. lender by assets misled investors and the
public when it sold bonds backed by faulty residential
mortgages. U.S. and state officials blamed JPMorgan&#8217;s actions
for helping to cause the credit crisis, and said the agreement
didn&#8217;t shield JPMorgan or its employees from possible charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department &#8220;acted as investigator, prosecutor,
judge, juror, sentencer and collector,&#8221; Dennis Kelleher, chief
executive officer of Better Markets, said at a press conference
in Washington. The agreement was &#8220;mostly designed to conceal,
not reveal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment on the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The department is confident that the settlement reached
with JPMorgan Chase complies with the law,&#8221; Ellen Canale, a
Justice Department spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Financial Reform&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better Markets describes itself as &#8220;a nonprofit,
nonpartisan organization that promotes the public interest in
financial reform.&#8221; It was founded by Michael Masters, founder
and managing member of Atlanta-based Masters Capital Management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group expects that its standing to bring the complaint
will be challenged, Kelleher said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It will be hotly contested but I believe we have a solid
foundation to prove and demonstrate concrete and demonstrable
harm that give us ample standing to assert both the
constitutional claims and the statutory claims,&#8221; Kelleher said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If we do not, what that means is that no one in the
United States can ever challenge a backroom deal like this cut
by any attorney general,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better Markets&#8217; standing derives from its public interest
purpose being thwarted by a lack of transparency in the
settlement process and the lack of a &#8220;judicial forum in which
it could seek to participate to influence&#8221; the outcome, the
group said in its complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Novel Claim&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint doesn&#8217;t cite any precedents for challenges to
similar Justice Department settlements with banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think it&#8217;s fair to call it a novel claim,&#8221; driven by
uniquely damaging and far-reaching circumstances, Kelleher said
in a phone interview following his press conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least one portion of the settlement, a $2 billion civil
penalty obtained under the Financial Institutions Reform,
Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, or FIRREA, explicitly
required a court to levy the sanction, according to the
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better Markets also alleged that the Justice Department and
U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder &#8220;have an apparent conflict of
interest&#8221; because they have been criticized for failing to be
tough enough on large Wall Street firms and &#8220;have aggressively
used the $13 billion agreement to try to restore their
reputations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement is &#8220;a mere contract&#8221; whereby JPMorgan
agreed to pay &#8220;in exchange for complete civil immunity from DOJ
for years of pervasive, egregious and knowing alleged fraud and
other illegal conduct related to the worst financial crash in
the U.S. since 1929,&#8221; according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Better Markets Inc. v. U.S. Department of
Justice, 14-cv-00190, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia
(Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V) Chief Executive Officer
Charlie Scharf said China isn&#8217;t opening as quickly as expected
to foreign payment processors and must be viewed as a five- to
15-year opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s going to take a long time for the market to actually
open up in a way that we actually do have that level playing
field,&#8221; Scharf told analysts today in New York during an
industry conference sponsored by Keefe, Bruyette  Woods Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scharf plans to be in China next week and said the company
needs to understand why the market hasn&#8217;t become more open to
foreign firms. Visa, the world&#8217;s biggest bank-card network, has
been in talks with U.S. and local officials, Chinese banks and
China UnionPay Co., he said. UnionPay is a payment processor
founded in Shanghai by the State Council and central bank that
competes globally with Visa and MasterCard Inc. (MA) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese law limits what Visa can do, Scharf said at his
company&#8217;s annual meeting in January. &#8220;If you want to issue a
card locally in China, denominated in the local currency, it has
to be issued by a Chinese-owned company called China UnionPay,&#8221;
said Scharf, 48. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MobileIron Inc., whose software
helps companies protect data that employees access on
smartphones, is working with banks including Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. as it prepares for an initial public offering, people with
knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank AG and Barclays Plc are also
working on the IPO, said the people, asking not to be named
because the information is private. MobileIron plans to raise
about $150 million in the IPO, for a valuation of $1 billion to
$2 billion, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand for software that manages data on a variety of
mobile devices is growing as employees bring smartphones and
tablets from Apple Inc. to Google Inc. into the workplace,
instead of relying on company-issued devices made by BlackBerry
Ltd. MobileIron&#8217;s biggest competitor, AirWatch LLC, agreed to be
acquired last month by VMware Inc. (VMW) for $1.54 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of mobile-device management, or MDM, software could
reach $1.6 billion this year, compared with $784 million in
2012, according to forecasts by researcher Gartner Inc. Alvaro Monserrat, a vice president at Citrix, said at a conference in
December that the company&#8217;s primary competition in the MDM
market is coming from MobileIron and AirWatch, &#8220;who are being
very aggressive on price.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t have anything to share at this time,&#8221; Clarissa
Horowitz, senior director of communications at Mountain View,
California-based MobileIron, said by e-mail about plans for an
IPO. Spokesmen for Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank
and Barclays declined to comment on the MobileIron IPO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MobileIron, founded in 2007, has raised about $150 million
from venture investors including Sequoia Capital, Norwest
Venture Partners, Foundation Capital and Institutional Venture
Partners. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) partners
exercised options awarded at the end of 2008, benefiting from a
doubling in the firm&#8217;s stock price since the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixty-four partners exercised options last month that
yielded them $77 million in shares, after covering the cost of
the options and some tax withholding, according to a Feb. 7
regulatory filing. Gregory A. Agran, who runs the New York-based
firm&#8217;s commodities unit, received $7.1 million of stock, while
Steve Strongin, 55, head of global investment research, netted
$4 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2008, Goldman Sachs granted 36 million options
in an effort to give top performers an incentive to stay after
the bank reduced pay costs by almost half during the financial
crisis. That grant was more than five times the number of
options the firm awarded in the three previous years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The options show that Wall Street employees received
substantial awards even after the largest U.S. banks accepted
government support amid the worst credit crisis since the Great
Depression. They also echo regulators&#8217; desire to have bonuses
tie employee incentives to the long-term performance of the
bank, as partners have had to wait more than five years to reap
the gains. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenhill  Co. (GHL) hired Rodrigo Mello,
a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. investment-banking executive,
as a managing director to help build its new business in Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mello, 39, will work in the Sao Paulo office for the New
York-based merger-and-acquisition advisory firm, according to
Daniel Wainstein, a former partner and chairman of Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s Brazil investment-banking business who joined Greenhill
in October. Mello left Goldman Sachs&#8217;s investment-banking
division in November after two stints totaling 14 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Rodrigo Mello is one of the most experienced MA
executives in Brazil and a banker trusted by our clients,&#8221;
Wainstein said in an interview. &#8220;We are very happy he decided
to join us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenhill, founded by former Morgan Stanley President
Robert F. Greenhill, hired Wainstein, 43, to be the country head
for its first South American branch. The firm is growing in
Brazil as some international banks pull back. Goldman Sachs
halted an expansion there last year, and London-based Barclays
Plc has been reducing staff in Brazil as competition with local
lenders intensifies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If a region is going through some cyclical economic
challenges, it can be an even more opportune time for us to
recruit,&#8221; Greenhill Chief Executive Officer Scott Bok said in a
statement in October. &#8220;Brazil will certainly have its ups and
downs, just like the U.S. market does, but Brazil is clearly a
large market that will see significant economic growth over the
long term.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hiring Plans &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wainstein is building a team to advise Brazilian companies
on global transactions. The short-term plan is to hire a senior
vice president, a vice president and three bankers at the
associate analyst level, he said in the interview. The office
already employs five executives, including Wainstein. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our goal is to build one of the most important MA
advisory platforms in Brazil using Greenhill&#8217;s international
relationship network,&#8221; Wainstein said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Announced mergers and acquisitions involving companies in
Brazil increased more than 18 percent to $78.8 billion last year
from 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Goldman Sachs, Mello was a private-equity executive
at Banco Santander SA. He also worked from 2005 to 2007 as chief
financial officer at Monte Cristalina SA, a holding company
owned by Joao Alves de Queiroz Filho, founder and the biggest
shareholder of Hypermarcas SA, the Sao Paulo-based consumer-goods maker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)&#8217;s borrowing costs are rising even as those of its peers fall, underscoring concerns that the world&#8217;s largest seller of computer services is struggling to find its place in the cloud. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM sold 10-year bonds last week with a 3.625 percent coupon, exceeding the cost of similar-maturity 3.375 percent notes issued in July even as average yields for debt in the company&#8217;s AA rating tier contracted. Quarterly revenue dropped 5.5 percent in the last three months of 2013 to $27.7 billion, the biggest decline since the U.S. economy exited its last recession, as an industrywide shift to offsite data storage erodes demand for IBM&#8217;s hardware. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Big Blue Tries to Adapt. Again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s an early signal that bondholders want a slightly larger premium to hold IBM because of the disappointing results, the challenges it&#8217;s facing in the hardware business and favoring shareholder returns over improving balance-sheet fundamentals,&#8221; said Nikhill Patel, an analyst at San Antonio-based Frost Investment Advisors LLC, which oversees about $10 billion and doesn&#8217;t own IBM bonds. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Druckenmiller Short &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Debt investors are demanding higher interest rates about two months after money manager Stan Druckenmiller said he&#8217;s betting against the stock of IBM, the only company in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU) to deliver a loss to shareholders last year. The century-old Armonk, New York-based business has attempted to support its equity by selling assets, using tax havens and repurchasing shares, which has coincided with an increase in its ratio of debt to cash flow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the U.S.
bank most reliant on trading, named Ashok Varadhan as the third
co-head of that division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Varadhan, the 41-year-old chief of macro trading, joins
Pablo Salame and Isabelle Ealet in running the securities
division, according to an internal memo obtained today by
Bloomberg News. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the New York-based firm, confirmed the memo&#8217;s contents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Varadhan will help run the business that generates the most
revenue and profit among Goldman Sachs&#8217;s segments and that has
produced many of its top officers. He takes over as the trading
unit faces constraints from new capital rules and has seen
declines in revenue in three of the past four years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He joined Goldman Sachs in swap trading in 1998, and was
named a partner at age 30 four years later. He was chosen to run
North American interest-rate products in 2001 and became head of
foreign exchange in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As a long-tenured leader in the securities division,
Ashok has demonstrated dedication to our clients and a deep
understanding of our business,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and President Gary D. Cohn wrote in the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs generated $15.7 billion in revenue from
equity and fixed-income trading in 2013, down 13 percent from a
year earlier. While it set a Wall Street record for trading
revenue in 2009 as other firms took longer to recover from the
financial crisis, Goldman Sachs has been passed by fixed-income
giants JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Citigroup Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian stocks fell for the first
time in four days, erasing earlier gains, as investors awaited
Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen&#8217;s first report on monetary
policy and oil declined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Micex Index (INDEXCF) dropped 0.2 percent to 1,476.28 by the
close in Moscow after risen as much as 0.5 percent in the
session. Food retailer OAO Magnit fell 2.1 percent, the most
since Jan. 21, while OAO Sberbank, the nation&#8217;s biggest lender,
sank 1.2 percent to 95.49 rubles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Micex followed U.S. stocks lower before Yellen speaks
on policy and the outlook for the economy tomorrow for the first
time after being sworn in as the central bank&#8217;s head on Feb. 3.
Crude oil, Russia&#8217;s chief export earner, snapped three days of
gains in London, sinking as much as 0.6 percent to $108.87 a
barrel after the biggest gain in three months on Feb. 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Without a boost to the risk appetite, Russia is hardly
going to rise, despite the high oil price,&#8221; Evgeny Loktyukhov,
an analyst at OAO Promsvyazbank, said by e-mail.  &#8220;The nearest
risk is tomorrow&#8217;s speech by the new head of the Federal Reserve
Yellen, which can shed some light on the Fed&#8217;s plans regarding
stimulus tapering and spur a re-evaluation of the risks behind
emerging markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed pressed ahead with scaling back stimulus in
January, cutting its monthly bond buying by $10 billion to $65
billion. The Micex Index advanced an average 77 percent during
the Fed&#8217;s first two rounds of debt purchases, and fell 0.6
percent in periods of no stimulus, the biggest difference of 46
emerging and developed markets tracked by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ruble Depreciation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar-denominated RTS Index (RTSI$) fell 0.4 percent to
1,336.02. Russian equities have the cheapest valuations among 21
developing-nation economies monitored by Bloomberg. Shares on
the Micex trade at 3.2 times projected 12-month earnings,
compared with a multiple of 9.1 for the MSCI Emerging Markets
Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruble has slumped 5.6 percent against the dollar in
2014, the fourth-worst performer among 24 emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg, amid Fed tapering. A weaker
ruble encourages Russians to withdraw and convert local-currency
deposits, while hurting retailers by making imports more
expensive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Banks, Magnit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sberbank snapped three days of gains in Moscow, while its
depositary receipts retreated 0.9 percent in London to $11.03.
VTB Group, the nation&#8217;s second-biggest lender, tumbled 1.1
percent to 4.55 kopeks and dropped 0.2 percent in the U.K.
capital to $2.58. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnit, Russia&#8217;s biggest grocer, fell to 8,279.90 rubles.
The company&#8217;s net retail sales increased 25 percent in January
to 51.7 billion rubles ($1.5 billion), the company based in
Krasnodar, southern Russia, said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Magnit posted good results but people always have
inflated expectations for them,&#8221; Sergey Vakhrameev, an analyst
in Moscow at AnkorInvest LLC, said by phone. &#8220;Ruble devaluation
is negative for banks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruble depreciation should help &#8220;provide a constructive
outlook for Russian energy names in 2014,&#8221; according to Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., which raised its coverage view on the nation&#8217;s
oil industry to attractive from neutral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OAO Rosneft (ROSN), which was lifted to buy at Goldman analysts
including Geydar Mamedov in a report today, advanced 0.6 percent
to 247.41 rubles in Moscow, while OAO Lukoil, Russia&#8217;s biggest
non-state crude producer, added 0.6 percent to 1,987.50 rubles.
OAO Bashneft jumped 4 percent to 2,163 rubles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosneft, the nation&#8217;s largest crude producer, should
benefit from improving capital spending control this year and
strengthening cash-flow generation, as well as the ruble&#8217;s
decline against the dollar, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Unlike banks, oil companies benefit from the ruble
devaluation,&#8221; AnkorInvest&#8217;s Vakhrameev said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forint declined the most in a
week as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said further interest-rate cuts
will make Hungary vulnerable amid a global sell-off in riskier
assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forint weakened 1.3 percent to 311.83 per euro by 4:55
p.m. in Budapest, the biggest decline among 24 emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Yields on the government&#8217;s
benchmark three-year bonds rose nine basis points, or 0.09
percentage point, to 4.91 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Magyar Nemzeti Bank, which in January reduced the
benchmark rate to a record 2.85 percent in its 18th month of
cuts, said there was room for further easing after government-imposed energy price cuts sent inflation to the lowest in more
than 40 years. Policy makers are moving out of step with peers
in Turkey, India and South Africa, which increased interest
rates to help stem outflows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The erosion in real rates has been the strongest,
Hungary-specific factor differentiating Hungary from other
countries in the region in this latest sell-off,&#8221; Magdalena Polan, a London-based economist at Goldman, wrote in an e-mailed
report dated Feb. 7. The policy stance diverging from peers
leaves Hungary &#8220;exposed,&#8221; Polan wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Policy makers will reduce the main rate by 10 basis points
to 2.75 percent on Feb. 18, according to the median of 10
economists in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank will probably deliver a &#8220;small,
symbolic&#8221; rate cut next week before adopting a &#8220;very
cautious&#8221; stance, Polan wrote. Further depreciation beyond
about 320 to 325 per euro would make an increase in the
benchmark rate more likely, Polan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hungary&#8217;s slow price growth will probably make the central
bank &#8220;dangerously comfortable with the ultra-dovish stance,&#8221;
Luis Costa, a London-based strategist at Citigroup Inc., wrote
by e-mail today. &#8220;The forint looks quite vulnerable, and it is
the best/most liquid way to express the glaring monetary policy
risks in Hungary at this juncture.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data on Feb. 14 will probably show Hungary&#8217;s inflation rate
slowed to 0.2 percent in January from 0.4 percent in the
previous month, according to a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors say the forint&#8217;s weakness is connected to the
central bank&#8217;s commitment to monetary easing,&#8221; Gergely Tardos,
Budapest-based head of research at OTP Bank Nyrt., Hungary&#8217;s
largest lender, wrote in an e-mailed report today. &#8220;If euro-forint doesn&#8217;t rise substantially above 315 and the pressure to
tighten subsides, the Monetary Council will probably cut rates
again this month.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) managing directors are leaving for Citadel LLC, joining the migration of traders leaving Wall Street banks for hedge funds as lenders pull back from riskier businesses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Uberto Palomba, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s co-head of emerging markets trading for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, will join Citadel&#8217;s Global Fixed-Income Fund in London, Katie Spring, a spokeswoman for the Chicago-based hedge fund, said by telephone. Jonathan Tipermas, who led Goldman Sachs&#8217;s dollar swaps-trading desk, will work for the fixed-income fund in New York, she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Citadel is expanding the fixed-income operation it started after hiring former JPMorgan Chase  Co. proprietary trader Derek Kaufman in 2008 to widen its range of funds beyond Kensington and Wellington, its two biggest pools. The hedge fund has built the unit by hiring from lenders including Bank of America Corp. and Credit Suisse Group AG, which have seen traders leave since the financial crisis of 2008 as regulators press firms to cut back their proprietary-trading activities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Palomba, 39, joined Goldman Sachs in 2007 from Morgan Stanley (MS), according to his registration with the U.K.&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority. The bank named him a managing director in 2009, according to a Bloomberg News story at the time. Tipermas, who is based in New York, joined in 2004 and was named a managing director in 2012. Neither could be reached by telephone at their offices, while e-mails were returned. Spokesmen for the bank declined to comment on the departures. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fixed-Income &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Citadel&#8217;s fixed-income fund, which manages $2.2 billion, gained 5 percent in January after climbing about 20 percent in 2013, according to a person with direct knowledge of the performance who asked not to be identified because the fund is private. Hedge funds fell 0.14 percent on average last month and posted a 7.4 percent gain in 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Kaufman&#8217;s team also manages money for Kensington and Wellington, the person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Jesse Westbrook in London at jwestbrook1@bloomberg.net; Ambereen Choudhury in London at achoudhury@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Edward Evans at eevans3@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leland Lim, who retired as co-head
of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s macro trading team in the Asia-Pacific region outside of Japan, plans to start his own Hong
Kong-based hedge fund, said two people with knowledge of the
matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new company aims to start an Asia-focused global macro
hedge fund around mid-year, said the people, who asked not to be
identified as the information is private. The fund will trade
mainly currency and interest-rate instruments, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It joins other Asia-focused macro hedge funds that have
started in the past year or are in the works to capture rising
investment opportunities. The Eurekahedge Asia Macro Hedge Fund
Index gained 9 percent last year, the largest annual gain in
four years, and outperformed the 8 percent return by the index
that tracks global hedge funds across all strategies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Asia-based macro hedge funds have a natural advantage in
taking information gained from their front-row seats and turning
that information into trade and investment ideas,&#8221;said Ed Rogers, chief executive officer of Tokyo-based Rogers Investment
Advisors.  &#8220;Asian economies remain the ones to watch as many
transition from emerging markets to developed markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Large Diversity&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among others, Whiz Rock Global Macro Investment Fund is
looking to increase assets to $150 million by March, from $50
million, Naoki Iwami, a former managing director at Millennium
Capital Management in Tokyo who now runs Whiz Rock, said in
November. Former HSBC Holdings Plc economist Geoff Barker plans
to start a new Asian macro hedge fund in March with City
Financial Investment Co., he said the same month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Asia offers a large diversity of instruments to express a
macroeconomic view,&#8221; said Stephane Pizzo, managing partner of
Singapore-based Lotus Peak Capital Pte. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A skilled manager will be able to benefit from
opportunities including the Japanese quantitative easing;
China&#8217;s liberalization and internationalization of its financial
markets, and the controlled appreciation of its currency; and
the various monetary and fiscal policies from governments in
Southeast Asia and India, Pizzo added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HFRI Macro Index dropped 1.1 percent in January, hurt
by declining emerging markets, and losses for trend-following
funds and those that trade with computer models, Chicago-based
Hedge Fund Research Inc. said in a statement dated Feb. 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Leaving Goldman &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lim left Goldman Sachs on Jan. 24, according to his
licensing record with Hong Kong&#8217;s Securities and Futures
Commission. He decided to retire from Goldman Sachs after 17
years with the New York-based bank, according to an internal
memo. Edward Naylor, a Hong Kong-based spokesman for Goldman
Sachs, confirmed today the content of the memo dated Jan. 21,
declining to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lim, 37, joined Goldman Sachs in New York in 1997 on its
foreign-exchange options desk and moved to Asia in 1999 to work
on such instruments in Hong Kong and Tokyo, according to the
internal memo. He managed foreign exchange and interest-rate
derivatives trading in the Asia-Pacific region excluding Japan
before his appointment to the latest position in 2012, it added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was promoted to managing director in 2006 and made
partner in 2010, according to the memo from the bank&#8217;s co-heads
of sales and trading Isabelle Ealet and Pablo J. Salame. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Politicized Regulation&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs named Hidehiro Imatsu to co-head Asia-Pacific
macro trading, including interest-rate and exchange products,
with Stuart Riley, according to a separate internal memo also
dated Jan. 21. Imatsu was head of macro trading in Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lim&#8217;s departure was not related to regulatory
investigations in possible rate-rigging at various banks, said
the people. He will lead investments at his own company, said
the people said, without naming the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traders have been leaving various banks to set up their own
hedge funds amid tighter regulation, said Peter Douglas,
principal of Singapore-based GFIA Pte. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Because of increasingly politicized regulation, it makes
sense for traders to establish non-banking pools of capital and
continue to trade, but in a more flexible environment and
sourced from third parties rather than their banks,&#8221; Douglas
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s New Zealand unit
isn&#8217;t liable for the cost of cleaning up waterfront land it
leased in Auckland partly because the country has no laws to
deal with the issue, a judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Auckland Waterfront Development Agency, which is
undertaking New Zealand&#8217;s biggest urban revitalization project,
sought NZ$10 million ($8.3 million) from Mobil Oil New Zealand
Ltd. to pay for the cost of the clean up in the area known as
Wynyard Quarter, according to the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobil Oil operated a bulk fuel storage and distribution
center at the site since the 1950s, leaving the properties
&#8220;heavily contaminated&#8221; when it ceased operations in 2011, the
judge said. The contamination was caused by Mobil&#8217;s own
operations as well as what was left by previous oil company
tenants and what had spread from neighbors, such as a 1.8
million liter spill of jet fuel by a Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) unit
in 1986, the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Unlike a number of other countries, New Zealand has no
specific legislation dealing with liability for historic
contaminated sites,&#8221; High Court Justice Sarah Katz wrote in the
Feb. 7 decision, posted on the court&#8217;s website today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobil acted reasonably, leaving the property in a condition
suitable to be taken over by another industrial tenant, Katz
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it signed the last lease in 1985, &#8220;there was no
realistic possibility of the land being used for commercial or
residential purposes,&#8221; the judge wrote. &#8220;It was not until a
further plan change became operative in 2010 that there were
concrete provisions to develop the Wynyard Quarter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area is now being developed to include a mix of
residential, retail and commercial uses, while retaining
existing marine and fishing industry uses, the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is between Auckland Waterfront Development Agency
Ltd. and Mobil Oil New Zealand Ltd. 2014-NZHC-84. High Court of
New Zealand (Auckland). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s refinery in
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, will shut a hydrocracker next week for
about two weeks of planned work, two people familiar with
operations said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery currently has an alkylation unit shut for
repairs, said the people, who asked not to be identified because
the information is not public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrocrackers convert heavy feedstocks into lighter fuels
such as high-octane gasoline and diesel. Alkylation units work
with catalytic crackers to make high-octane gasoline blending
components. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Todd Spitler, a spokesman for Exxon in Fairfax, Virginia,

refinery in Baton Rouge, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to requests

&lt;p&gt;The Baton Rouge refinery can process 503,500 barrels of
crude oil a day, according to data compiled Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) said one person was
hospitalized and another is missing after a fire at a well in
Greene County, Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fire was reported at about 6:45 a.m. local time at the
Lanco Unit 7H well, the Houston-based company said in a
statement on its website today. Emergency personnel responded
and are containing the fire, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drilling began on the horizontal well south of Pittsburgh
on March 15, 2012, according to state data records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron owned the third-largest acreage in the Marcellus
shale as of the third quarter, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Production of natural gas from the Marcellus, helped
by hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, was expected to
exceed 13 billion cubic feet a day in December, up from less
than 2 billion cubic feet in 2010, the Energy Information
Administration said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five horizontal rigs targeting gas were in Greene County as
of Feb. 7, data compiled by oil-field services company Baker
Hughes Inc. show. All them drill development wells 5,000 feet to
10,000 feet deep, the company&#8217;s website shows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomas Stolper, chief currency
strategist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said he will be leaving
the firm by early March to set up a venture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stolper, 45, who joined Goldman in 1999 and became chief
foreign-exchange strategist in 2009, said in a telephone
interview that the enterprise will be foreign exchange related. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The London-based managing director said this week the
dollar will disappoint analysts expecting a broad rally in the
currency versus major peers as a tapering of Federal Reserve
stimulus isn&#8217;t improving the U.S.&#8217;s interest-rate advantage. The
U.S. currency was little changed at $1.3652 per euro at 12:24
p.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stolper correctly predicted the greenback&#8217;s slide against
the euro in 2013, and forecasts the U.S. currency will drop to
$1.40 in six months. That compares with analysts&#8217; median
estimates for a rise to $1.31 by the end of June, and $1.30 by
the end of the third quarter, according to Bloomberg surveys of
economists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;During his tenure at the firm, Thomas has developed many
analytical tools that have become a reference point for
institutional investing clients globally,&#8221; Dominic Wilson,
chief markets economist, and Francesco Garzarelli, co-head of
macro and markets research, said in an internal memo obtained by
Bloomberg News. &#8220;He has also helped to elevate the profile of
Global Markets Research and has served as a mentor to many of
his colleagues.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the New York-based bank,
confirmed the memo&#8217;s contents and declined to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S.&#8217;s top diplomat in India
will meet leading opposition candidate Narendra Modi for the
first time since he was denied a visa over his alleged role in
2002 riots that killed about 1,000 people, mostly Muslims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Ambassador Nancy Powell will meet Modi this week, Syed Akbaruddin, a spokesman for India&#8217;s ministry of external
affairs, told reporters in New Delhi today. The U.S. denied Modi
a visa in 2005 under rules that bar officials who were
responsible for &#8220;severe violations of religious freedom.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is part of our concentrated outreach to senior
political and business leaders, which began in November to
highlight the U.S.-India relationship,&#8221; Unni Menon, a spokesman
at the U.S embassy in New Delhi, said by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opinion polls show Modi&#8217;s Bharatiya Janata Party winning
the most seats in an election due by May while falling short of
a majority. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh&#8217;s ruling Congress
party has seen its popularity fall while overseeing the slowest
economic growth in a decade in the nation of 1.2 billion people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BJP welcomed the U.S. announcement, Captain Abhimanyu,
a party spokesman, said by phone. Modi has proved his record of
good governance and has never been charged with any wrongdoing,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Modi had nothing really to prove to people outside of
India,&#8221; Abhimanyu said. &#8220;There was just a section of the media
and his political opponents who had tried to malign him.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.K., Australia &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Western governments have warmed to Modi as he rose in the
ranks of the BJP. The U.K., Australia and the European Union
have resumed ties with Modi over the past few years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modi has trumpeted his transformation of Gujarat into one
of India&#8217;s most business-friendly states, luring investors with
faster approval process for developments, a network of roads and
ports and uninterrupted power supply, a rarity in India.
Political opponents and rights groups had earlier accused him of
allowing the 2002 violence to continue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The riots saw Hindu mobs rape and kill Muslims after a fire
on a train claimed 58 lives, among them Hindu pilgrims. Modi
allegedly instructed police to stand down and allow the violence
to go on, according to findings by a Concerned Citizens
Tribunal, a group with no legal standing comprised of former
judges, professors and a retired police officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Opinion Polls &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modi denies any wrongdoing and a Supreme Court-appointed
panel investigating one documented incident found no evidence
that he made decisions that prevented victims from receiving
assistance. He said he did his best to maintain law and order,
and his administration later won re-election in the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BJP is set to win 188 seats in the 545-member lower
house, surpassing the 182 seats it won in 1999, according to a
C-Voter poll for India Today published on Jan. 23. Congress may
get as few as 91 seats versus 210 now, dropping to its lowest on
record, the poll indicated, without giving a margin of error. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tensions between the U.S. and India increased in December
after diplomat Devyani Khobragade was arrested in New York,
strip-searched and charged with visa fraud for allegedly
underpaying her babysitter. Khobragade returned to India on Jan.
10 after she was indicted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gilt Groupe Inc., an e-retailer, and
MobileIron Inc., whose software protects smartphones, are
working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on their initial public
offerings, said people with knowledge of the deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gilt&#8217;s timing is still being decided, while MobileIron has
enlisted other banks including Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank AG
and Barclays Plc, said people familiar with the companies, who
asked not to be identified because the deals haven&#8217;t been
announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coming IPOs are part of a revival in technology
offerings that includes the debut of Facebook Inc., Twitter Inc.
and dozens of other Internet and software companies in the past
two years. The 14 U.S. companies that raised the most money in
offerings since mid-February of 2012 are all trading above their
IPO price, a stretch during which the Nasdaq Composite Index has
jumped 41 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When you have companies consistently coming to market and
performing well in the after market, more and more companies
keep coming,&#8221; said Sharon Wienbar, a partner at venture-capital
firm Scale Venture Partners in Foster City, California. &#8220;There
are a number of substantial technology disruptions favoring
startups.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with the surging popularity of technology deals, e-commerce IPOs have been rare as Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) expanded its
dominance by focusing on growth at the expense of profit. Zulily
Inc., which runs a shopping site targeted at moms, was an
exception last year. After its share sale, Zulily is now valued
at $4.76 billion, making it the third-biggest U.S. e-commerce
company by market value, behind Amazon and EBay Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New CEO &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gilt is trying to follow Zulily&#8217;s lead after new Chief
Executive Officer Michelle Peluso revamped the company. Founded
in 2007, Gilt was forced to cut divisions and eliminate jobs as
competition emerged for its flash sale model, which involves
offering limited-time deals at steep discounts. The company
named the former Citigroup Inc. marketing head as chief
executive officer last year, replacing co-founder Kevin Ryan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview in September with Bloomberg Radio, Peluso
said that an IPO is &#8220;a likely path for us but we&#8217;re not in a
rush.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is an investor in Gilt and was part of a $138
million financing round in 2011, valuing the company at about $1
billion, that included Japan&#8217;s Softbank Corp. and venture
investors General Atlantic and Matrix Partners. The company has
raised a total of at least $240 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Miller, a spokeswoman for New York-based Gilt,
declined to comment. A spokesman for Goldman Sachs declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Devices Galore &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MobileIron, also founded in 2007, has raised about $150
million from venture investors including Sequoia Capital,
Norwest Venture Partners, Foundation Capital and Institutional
Venture Partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand for software that manages data on a variety of
mobile devices is growing as employees bring smartphones and
tablets from Apple Inc. to Google Inc. into the workplace,
instead of relying on company-issued devices made by BlackBerry
Ltd. MobileIron&#8217;s biggest competitor, AirWatch LLC, agreed to be
acquired last month by VMware Inc. for $1.54 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of mobile-device management, or MDM, software could
reach $1.6 billion this year, compared with $784 million in
2012, according to forecasts by researcher Gartner Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t have anything to share at this time,&#8221; Clarissa
Horowitz, senior director of communications at Mountain View,
California-based MobileIron, said by e-mail about plans for an
IPO. Spokesmen for Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank
and Barclays declined to comment on the MobileIron IPO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rising Revenue &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012, Gilt generated $550 million in revenue, excluding
businesses it discontinued, up from $450 million the prior year.
The company was expected to generate cash from operations by the
end of last year, Peluso said in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. e-commerce market is expected to climb 15 percent
this year to $300.6 billion, according to researcher EMarketer
Inc. Revenue at Seattle-based Amazon is projected to rise 21
percent to $90 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gilt&#8217;s current deals include a pair of Elizabeth  James
womens&#8217; sandals for $129, down from $198, and a $449 Hickey
mens&#8217; pinstripe sports coat, down from $895. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Gilt rivals have moved away from flash sales and
others are stumbling. Fab.com Inc. stopped its flash technique
last year, opting instead to let customers track departments and
products they like, and has cut jobs. Rue La La and Lot18 laid
off employees and scaled back. Totsy, a flash site aimed at
moms, liquidated its assets last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;French Contrast &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ventee-Privee.com, a French e-retailer that competes with
Gilt, plans to more than quadruple revenue in the next decade by
extending the flash model, founder Jacques-Antoine Granjon said
this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gilt&#8217;s offering could boost the New York startup scene,
which has lacked marquee technology offerings. Video-ad provider
Tremor Video Inc. (TRMR) has lost more than half its value since going
public last year, while startups Fab, Foursquare Labs Inc. and
Etsy Inc. have struggled as private companies. Photo and video
marketplace Shutterstock Inc. has been the outlier, more than
quadrupling since its 2012 IPO. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iraq is considering additional
measures against Exxon Mobil Corp. over deals the company signed
with the semi-autonomous Kurdish region, Deputy Prime Minister
for Energy Affairs Hussain al-Shahristani said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Oil Ministry is &#8220;studying other measures&#8221; against
Exxon after requiring the company to reduce its involvement in
the West Qurna-1 field last year. Authorities in Baghdad have
received a reply from the Kurdistan Regional Government, or KRG,
on proposals for ending an impasse over oil exports from the
region, al-Shahristani told reporters today in Baghdad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Exxon violated Iraqi law, they were informed about that,
and Iraq started to take measures regarding it,&#8221; Shahristani
said. Now, the &#8220;ministry is studying other measures for
violating Iraqi laws,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq&#8217;s Kurds have halted crude flows via the national
export pipeline to Turkey amid a dispute with authorities in
Baghdad on the legality of deals the Kurds signed with
international companies, such as Exxon and Total SA. The KRG has
announced plans to sell crude it has pumped through its own new
pipeline to Turkey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shahristani didn&#8217;t give details of the KRG&#8217;s response to
the central government&#8217;s proposals for settling the dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National oil production is also being constrained by
insufficient storage space in the south, Shahristani said. Iraq
will be unable to maintain production levels at full capacity of
3.5 million barrels a day unless it increases handling capacity
at the southern port of al-Faw, Shahristani said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq pumped as much as 3.524 million barrels on one day in
January, he said. Monthly production in January was 3.05 million
barrels a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
nation said it pumped an average 2.85 million barrels in direct
submissions to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
in a report that was released today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they marketed one of the biggest commercial-mortgage bond deals ever in June 2007, just as credit markets began to crumble, bankers at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) handed out T-shirts depicting a glass it declared &#8220;half full.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Six years later, after the $7.6 billion of securities plunged in the collapse of the U.S. property market that pushed loans included in the deal into default, the glass is filling up. Portions of the deal that have been cut to junk, which fell to as low as 16 cents on the dollar in 2008, have jumped about 5 cents in the past month to as high as 69 cents, according to traders and investors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bonds are rising after distressed real estate, including properties in the 2007 deal, sold in an auction for more than their most recent appraisals. The sale provides a glimpse of what to expect in the $550 billion market as loan servicers work through a pipeline of $66.6 billion of defaulted mortgages funding everything from Manhattan skyscrapers to shopping malls in Tennessee. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;In many cases the buildings are in fairly decent areas -- they were just overleveraged,&#8221; said Keerthi Raghavan, a debt analyst at Barclays Plc in New York, referring to properties sold in the recent auction. &#8220;This is a chance to wipe the slate clean.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mexico President Enrique Pena Nieto
will challenge a judge&#8217;s ruling that the country&#8217;s
telecommunications regulator lacks the standing to force
broadcasters including Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO) to let cable and
satellite companies carry their content for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government will file an appeal with the Supreme Court
on behalf of the Federal Telecommunications Institute to
overturn the lower court&#8217;s decision, presidential spokesman
Eduardo Sanchez said today at an event in Mexico City. The
agency, known as IFT, earlier said in an e-mailed statement that
the judge&#8217;s ruling on Feb. 10 interferes with its ability to
regulate the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, started by Televisa, undermines an initiative
passed by Mexican lawmakers in June that requires broadcasters
to offer their over-the-air programming to carriers without
charging a fee or packaging them with other channels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citing the June law, Dish Mexico, the nation&#8217;s second-largest satellite-TV company, and phone carrier Axtel SAB (AXTELCPO) added
signals from Televisa and TV Azteca SAB (AZTECACP), Mexico&#8217;s two largest
broadcasters, to their channel lineups in September for no extra
charge. Previously, cable and satellite providers had to pay for
the broadcast networks as part of a bundle of channels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa and Azteca, both based in Mexico City, had
disputed Dish&#8217;s move to go ahead with the retransmissions,
arguing that it hadn&#8217;t yet been properly authorized by the
regulatory agency, which itself was created by the June law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Retransmission Fees &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billionaire Charlie Ergen, who co-owns Dish Mexico through
EchoStar Corp. (SATS), pressed the telecommunications institute this
week in a statement to let the satellite company keep
retransmitting the broadcasters&#8217; programming for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an e-mailed statement after the government announcement
today, Televisa said Dish Mexico was &#8220;disqualifying the
judicial process to benefit its own interests.&#8221; The lawsuit
seeks to protect Televisa&#8217;s right to control its intellectual
property, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa shares fell 2.6 percent to 76.41 pesos at the
close in Mexico City, while TV Azteca declined 2.3 percent to
8.23 pesos. Axtel dropped 1.4 percent to 5.08 pesos. Echostar
fell 1.3 percent to $47.87 at the close in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ryan Crane, a JPMorgan (JPM) Chase  Co.
employee who in a 14-year career at the New York-based bank rose
to executive director of a unit that trades blocks of stocks for
clients, has died. He was 37. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He died on Feb. 3 at his Stamford, Connecticut, home,
according to the website of Leo P. Gallagher  Son Funeral Home
in Greenwich, Connecticut. The cause of death will be determined
when a toxicology report is completed in about six weeks, said a
spokeswoman for the state&#8217;s chief medical examiner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crane started at JPMorgan in equities trading after
graduating from Harvard University in 1999, according to his

&lt;p&gt;Netflix Inc. (NFLX), adding to its growing
role in kids&#8217; online videos, obtained exclusive streaming rights
to an animated TV series based on George Lucas&#8217;s &#8220;Star Wars&#8221;
movies from Walt Disney Co., including the new final season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. and Canadian subscribers will be able to view the 13-episode sixth season of &#8220;Star Wars: the Clone Wars&#8221; beginning
March 7, Los Gatos, California-based Netflix said today in a
statement. The series ran for five seasons on Time Warner Inc.&#8217;s
Cartoon Network, according to the Star Wars website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;&#8216;Star Wars&#8217; is one of the most iconic franchises of all
time, and this series joins a long line of Disney content that
Netflix members are and will continue to enjoy for years to
come,&#8221; Ted Sarandos, the streaming-video company&#8217;s chief
content officer, said in the statement. &#8220;The &#8216;Clone Wars&#8217; marks
an important moment as Netflix welcomes more and more first-run
content from the Walt Disney Co. and its subsidiaries.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix is focusing on delivering a mix of exclusive TV
shows and movies, including children&#8217;s fare, as it battles
Amazon.com Inc., the largest online retailer, and Hulu LLC for
online viewers. The company has exclusive deals with both Disney
and DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India will award permits this month
to build solar power plants in the first national auction since
2011 as a trade spat with the U.S. over import curbs deepens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ReNew Power Ventures Pvt., a company backed by Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., the Tata group, whose businesses span software
to automobiles, and First Solar Inc. (FSLR), the biggest U.S. maker of
solar panels, are among 68 bidders vying for projects as India
seeks clean alternatives to fossil fuels. The winners for the
750 megawatts of capacity will be announced by the end of this
month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India plans a sixfold increase in solar capacity that may
draw $11.7 billion of investment by 2017 as the technology sheds
perceptions that risks are high. In contrast, banks are slowing
lending to coal and gas-fired projects hamstrung by a fuel
squeeze. Rising demand for equipment is also prompting panel
makers to seek a bigger share of the trade as the U.S. lodged a
complaint with the World Trade Organization this week against
India&#8217;s barriers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The advantage of renewables is that you know that the
cost is going to be forever,&#8221; said Sumant Sinha, chief
executive officer of ReNew Power, which is backed by a $385
million investment from Goldman Sachs. &#8220;You lock in the price
today. You&#8217;re not impacted by the rupee&#8217;s depreciation. There&#8217;s
no fuel risk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yarn Maker &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, India&#8217;s first national solar auction drew
skepticism with record-low bids from a woolen yarn maker and
animation company. Tata Power Co. shunned that tender, saying
banks wouldn&#8217;t loan to projects deemed too risky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current tender received bids for more than double the
capacity available. The offers include 100 megawatts by ReNew,
150 megawatts by a unit of India&#8217;s Infrastructure Leasing 
Financial Services Ltd. and 40 megawatts by Tata Power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growth of the industry has boosted inbound shipment of
photovoltaic gear, with the value of the purchases reaching $2.4
billion since 2010 when India started its solar program,
according to data from the Ministry of Commerce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to help local makers of solar modules including
Moser Baer India Ltd. (MBI), India is requiring half of the capacity
being auctioned to be built with locally made equipment. That&#8217;s
375 megawatts or about 10 percent of the total capacity India
has offered in the past year. The U.S. said this rule unlawfully
restricts access to American manufacturers such as First Solar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India said it will dispute the complaint lodged by the U.S.
with the WTO against the &#8220;unfair barrier to U.S. exports.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Offsetting Costs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India is offering as much as 18.75 billion rupees ($302
million) in grants for the first time to solar developers to
offset project costs. That will enable the plants to reduce the
electricity tariff to 5.5 rupees a kilowatt-hour, equal to the
cost of grid power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That eliminates one of the main investment hurdles the
industry faced: the risk that cash-strapped state utilities
buying the power would default, leaving plants unable to sell
their output elsewhere. At 5.5 rupees, the plants could find
alternate buyers, including industrial and commercial consumers
who pay the highest rates for power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Renewables are attracting a different class of investors
who want stable yields,&#8221; said Sunil Wadhwa, chief executive of
ILFS Energy Development Co., a developer of gas, coal and
clean-energy projects. &#8220;These are stable cash flows. For the
investor, the costs are highest in the beginning, but it&#8217;s more
predictable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stable Returns &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clean energy projects in Europe are luring institutional
cash as retirement and insurance funds, including Allianz SE,
Aviva Plc (AV/) and PensionDanmark A/S seek stable returns to match
their long-term liabilities. Copenhagen-based PensionDanmark has
invested about $1.8 billion in renewable energy, while Allianz
Capital Partners, a unit of Europe&#8217;s largest insurer, invested
more than 400 million euros ($545 million) last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In India, investors from Goldman to Morgan Stanley (MS) have led
about $2 billion of private-equity buyouts, project and company
acquisitions in the renewable industry since 2010, according to
Bloomberg New Energy Finance. In the past year, the Government
of Singapore Investment Corp. invested 100 million pounds ($166
million) in Greenko Group Plc (GKO), a developer of Indian wind farms.
GE Energy Financial Services invested 2.57 billion rupees in a
hydropower plant in northern Sikkim state under development by
Gati Infrastructure Pvt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photovoltaic plants in India are likely to earn a 16
percent return, according to calculations by the central
electricity regulator to set tariffs. That compares with a yield
of 8.87 percent offered by India&#8217;s benchmark 10-year bond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thermal Power &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign direct investment in India&#8217;s thermal power sector
has collapsed to less than one-third its level two years ago as
fuel risks, regulatory uncertainties and environmental delays
hold up projects, according to government data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 60 percent of power stations owned by NTPC Ltd.,
the nation&#8217;s biggest generator, are running below capacity due
to a lack of coal supply, NTPC Director A.K. Jha said this week.
India plans to raise local gas prices by as much as 90 percent
to $8 per million British thermal units, a level that will be
unviable for power plants, Oil Secretary Vivek Rae said on Jan.
12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With coal and gas prices rising and an increasing share to
be imported, a clean-energy project may already be able to
supply electricity about 3 percent cheaper over the long term,
said Wadhwa of ILFS Energy, which is building a 750-megawatt
gas power plant and is India&#8217;s second-biggest owner of wind
farms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia, the biggest coal supplier to India, banned
exports of raw ores last month. &#8220;Tomorrow it might be coal,&#8221;
said Wadhwa. &#8220;In thermal, you&#8217;re never sure.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emeterra, an agribusiness company
founded by a former managing director of global sweeteners at
Coca-Cola Co. (KO), is investing in agriculture processing assets
through new projects and acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Singapore-based company started by Jacob Robbins, who
left Coca-Cola last year, has been operating since Nov. 1 and is
looking at processing assets, Robbins said in a Feb. 10
interview in Dubai. Potential projects probably will be in
Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, excluding
Brazil for now, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our first assets should come on stream within 18 to 24
months, to be in physical production, which is not only the time
that it takes to build a facility, but also all the lead time to
get clearances and approvals and everything else,&#8221; Robbins
said. &#8220;We are looking at domestic assets in a number of
countries right now, some green fields, some brown fields.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emeterra will focus on trading and supplying sweeteners
including new sugar products and non-nutritive zero-calorie
offerings other than stevia, a sugar substitute, Robbins said.
The company will also trade dairy and juices other than orange.
The world will need to produce 60 percent more food by 2050 to
feed a growing population, the United Nations&#8217; Food 
Agriculture Organization estimates. Chinese imports of whole-milk powder surged 14-fold since 2008, data from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Dairy is an amazing opportunity because of the intrinsic
deficit for China and Asia Pacific,&#8221; Robbins said. &#8220;There&#8217;s
such a huge gap between what&#8217;s being produced and what is needed
and more importantly what will be needed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sustainable Development &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emeterra will also invest in technologies to boost
sustainable agricultural development as well as reduce costs,
Robbins said. The company&#8217;s first venture will involve rapid
multiplication of sugar-cane seedlings, which is the biggest
cost in growing the crop after fertilizers, according to a study
from the London-based International Sugar Organization. The ISO
seed cane price index rose 95 percent from 2005 to 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you look at the evolution of the whole sugar industry
in the last 20, 30, 40 years, what can you call as really
radical innovation?&#8221; Robbins said. &#8220;I think the time is here
for radical innovations because today, with all the pressure
that there is on prices, there&#8217;s only so much you can do for
price realization, so you have to look at costs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raw sugar futures traded in New York fell in the past three
years as supplies outpaced demand. That was the longest slump in
more than two decades. A fourth year of price declines would be
the longest losing streak since at least 1965, exchange data on
Bloomberg showed. Futures slid 1.4 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cut Costs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sugar cane is traditionally planted by putting segments on
the ground, which allows pests and diseases to be perpetuated,
Robbins said. The rapid seedling multiplication process will cut
costs for growers, interrupt the cycle of pests and diseases and
require much less water, making businesses more sustainable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s more traction with the consumer when you have a
sustainable product provided you can do it at cost parity or
better cost,&#8221; Robbins said. &#8220;There&#8217;s no question in my mind
that there&#8217;s the need for sustainable food, especially in
emerging markets. That&#8217;s a given.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emeterra is also advising Olympus Capital Asia, an
independent private equity firm investing in agribusiness, clean
energy and financial services, according to Robbins. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is poised
to become the first U.S. commercial bank to sell bonds in
Australia this year, while Westpac Banking Corp. is also
planning a new line of notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is marketing fixed- and floating-rate
Australian dollar bonds due August 2019 at a yield of about 135
basis points more than swap rates, according to an e-mailed
statement today from the issuer. Sydney-based Westpac,
Australia&#8217;s second-biggest lender by market value, plans to sell
five-year securities at a spread of around 95 basis points,
according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to
be identified because the terms aren&#8217;t set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investor appetite for credit has helped cap borrowing costs
in Australia with the yield premium over the swap rate on bank
paper averaging 99 basis points yesterday and 94 on Feb. 7, a
low unseen since February 2008, according to a Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index. No U.S. commercial bank has sold bonds in
Australia since Goldman Sachs&#8217;s last transaction in July, when
it priced A$750 million ($670 million) of five-year fixed and
floating-rate notes at a 170-basis-point spread. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investment banks were one of the strongest performing
sectors in 2013 and I&#8217;d expect the Goldman Sachs deal to perform
well, although recent emerging-market ructions could damp demand
a bit,&#8221; said Justin Davey, a money manager at BT Investment
Management Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rabobank, ABN Amro &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dutch lenders Rabobank Groep and ABN Amro NV are the only
other foreign commercial banks to have come to the Australian
market so far this year, issuing A$600 million and A$500 million
of notes respectively last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The August 2018 fixed-rate bond that Goldman Sachs sold
last year yielded 106 basis points more than the swap rate
today, Australia  New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. prices show.
The American bank carries a credit rating of A- at Standard 
Poor&#8217;s, the seventh highest, and is ranked Baa1 at Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service, one level lower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Australia Bank Ltd. was the last of the so-called
four-pillar domestic banks to sell new five-year notes in its
home market, pricing A$1.5 billion of floating-rate debentures
in November at a spread of 88 basis points, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Both Commonwealth Bank of Australia and
ANZ priced five-year securities in October. The last new
benchmark-sized five-year bond from Westpac (WBC) was issued in
January 2013 at a 95-basis-point premium, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There haven&#8217;t been many primary bank issues since the
latter part of 2013,&#8221; BT&#8217;s Davey said. &#8220;I&#8217;d expect there to be
solid interest for the Westpac transaction given the lack of
supply and the benign conditions for banks as evidenced by
recent results announcements from ANZ and CBA.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is managing its own offering along with CBA,
NAB and Royal Bank of Canada. Westpac is also managing its own
sale, the person familiar with that matter said. Both
transactions are expected to price by tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s Australian unit was
sued by the country&#8217;s competition regulator for misuse of market
power relating to sales of its generic version of the Lipitor
cholesterol drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said it
filed the lawsuit today in federal court in Sydney claiming
Pfizer Australia Pty.&#8217;s deals with pharmacies in 2012 for the
sale of atorvastatin breached competition rules. A copy of the
filing wasn&#8217;t immediately available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patent protection on Lipitor, the biggest selling
prescription drug in Australia under the federal drug plan,
expired in May 2012. At the time Lipitor was prescribed to more
than 1 million Australians with annual sales exceeding A$700
million ($625 million), according to the ACCC. Prior to the
expiry Pfizer struck a deal with pharmacies, offering discounts
and rebates on the condition they bought a minimum 12 months&#8217;
supply of atorvastatin, the generic equivalent, the ACCC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pfizer engaged in this conduct for the purpose of
deterring or preventing competitors in the market for
atorvastatin from engaging in competitive conduct,&#8221; ACCC
Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement. &#8220;This case also raises
an important public interest issue regarding the conduct of a
patent holder nearing the expiry of that patent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said in an e-mailed statement today it believes the
offers made to the pharmacies were competitive. Since the matter
is before the court, the company said it wouldn&#8217;t be appropriate
to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ACCC said it&#8217;s seeking pecuniary penalties and
declarations, without specifying them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A preliminary hearing is scheduled to be held on Mar. 18,
the regulator said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spain picked Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. to advise on the sale of Bankia (BKIA), the lender whose collapse
in 2012 pushed Spain into a European bank bailout, and agreed to
pay the U.S. bank one euro ($1.37) in fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will analyze strategies for divesting the
government&#8217;s stake in Bankia, the state bank restructuring fund,
known as FROB, said in an e-mailed statement today. The
investment bank, which previously worked on the government&#8217;s
plan to recapitalize Bankia in 2012 and 2013, will charge 1
euro, said three people familiar with the information who asked
not to be identified because the terms aren&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real estate-linked losses at the Bankia group helped push
Spain into seeking a 41 billion-euro ($56.2 billion) bailout
from Europe in 2012 as concern mounted that the cost of
salvaging it and other former savings banks would overwhelm
government finances. Bankia&#8217;s Chairman Jose Ignacio
Goirigolzarri signaled earlier this month that the government
was preparing to sell off its stake in the lender that was
recapitalized with 22.4 billion euros of public funds and that
the process may take more than two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Goldman Sachs in Madrid, who asked not to
be identified in line with company policy, declined to comment
on the fee structure for the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bookrunners for the U.K. government&#8217;s sale of 3.2
billion pounds ($5.4 billion) of shares in Lloyds Banking Group
Plc in September agreed to charge U.K. Financial Investments
Ltd. no fees for the work, according to the National Audit
Office. Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase  Co. and UBS AG
were joint bookrunners for that transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bankia group, including its parent company BFA, on Feb.
3 posted after-tax profit of 818 million euros in 2013, as
targeted in Goirigolzarri&#8217;s turnaround plan, compared with a
loss of 21.2 billion euros in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bankia also sold bonds last month in a sign of renewed
favor with investors and its shares have gained 20 percent this
year. The government owns about 68 percent of Bankia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street bankers behind
Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)&#8217;s $45.2 billion bid for Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC), a
surprise end-run around veteran media dealmaker John Malone,
drew from experience on some of the past decades&#8217; biggest deals,
including the RJR-Nabisco buyout made famous in &#8220;Barbarians at
the Gate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bankers James B. &#8220;Jimmy&#8221; Lee, Blair Effron, Paul Taubman
and Robert Kindler also have figured variously in Michael Dell&#8217;s
move to take his firm private and the sale of NBC by General
Electric Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sealing the Time Warner Cable deal last night, the four
bankers helped Comcast Chief Executive Officer Brian Roberts
trump a bid from Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR), advised by Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and LionTree Advisors LLC. Charter&#8217;s
billionaire backer Malone had courted Time Warner Cable for
months before the Comcast bid -- the biggest cable deal since
Comcast bought ATT Inc.&#8217;s cable assets for $52 billion in 2002. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Vice Chairman Lee and Taubman, a
Morgan Stanley alumnus, will take a share of as much as $68
million for working with Comcast, according to New York-based
research firm Freeman  Co. Part of that fee will go to co-adviser Barclays Plc (BARC), according to Freeman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effron, a co-founder of Centerview Partners, and Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s Kindler may get as much as $75 million for advising
Time Warner Cable, Freeman said. Sharing in the fee will be
Citigroup Inc. and Allen  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Professional Links &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four bankers have been professionally linked for years.
JPMorgan&#8217;s Lee and Centerview&#8217;s Effron both had roles in GE&#8217;s
$16.7 billion sale of its remaining stake in NBC Universal to
Comcast in early 2013. Kindler worked with Lee at JPMorgan as
head of global MA before Taubman recruited him to come work at
Morgan Stanley (MS) in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee, Taubman and Kindler have worked with and across the
table from each other on numerous deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee advised UAL Corp.&#8217;s United Airlines while Kindler
worked with Continental Airlines on their $3.1 billion merger in
2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taubman and Effron, meanwhile, are both among the biggest
Wall Street fundraisers for President Barack Obama and other
Democratic Party candidates. This is the first deal they have
worked on together, said a person familiar with the matter, who
asked not to be identified because the talks were private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Secret Talks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All four veteran bankers worked to keep the matter secret
from Malone, himself one of the biggest dealmakers in the cable
industry&#8217;s formative years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1980s, Malone won big with bets on startups like
Discovery Communications Inc. and Black Entertainment Television
and even by bailing out rival media tycoon Rupert Murdoch. Since
largely abandoning the U.S. cable market in 1999, Malone has
spent about $50 billion in Europe. His Liberty Global Inc. is on
track to report 2013 sales of almost $15 billion, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just the latest high-profile deal involving
JPMorgan&#8217;s Lee. He led the bank&#8217;s effort in taking General
Motors Co. public in 2010 with a record IPO. He also worked with
Effron on News Corp.&#8217;s 2007 acquisition of Dow Jones  Co.,
owner of the Wall Street Journal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effron, co-founder of the independent investment bank
Centerview with Robert Pruzan in 2006, is portrayed as a junior
banker arranging a secret meeting between KKR  Co. and a senior
Nabisco executive in the book &#8220;Barbarians,&#8221; by Bryan Burrough
and John Helyar, which described the $30 billion purchase of RJR
Nabisco in 1988, detailing the egos and back-room dealings that
went on at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ConAgra, InBev &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effron worked on ConAgra Foods Inc.&#8217;s purchase of Ralcorp
Holdings for $5 billion, and advised H.J. Heinz Co. last year
when the food giant was sold to Brazil private-equity firm 3G
and Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Effron also advised
InBev when it acquired Anheuser-Busch in 2008 for $52 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Time Warner Cable deal is another coup for Taubman, who
began PJT Capital LLC last year after leaving Morgan Stanley in
2013, following a 27-year career there. He had a role as an
individual adviser in Verizon Communication Inc.&#8217;s $130 billion
buyout of partner Vodafone Group Plc&#8217;s 45 percent stake in
Verizon Wireless, the largest U.S. mobile carrier. The
acquisition, the largest announced in the past five years,
pushed PJT into the top 20 deal advisers of 2013, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kindler&#8217;s Client &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kindler, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s vice chairman of investment
banking, has had Time Warner Cable as a client since he was a
lawyer at Cravath, Swaine  Moore, said a person familiar with
the matter, keeping them as a client in his next two roles. He
has worked before with Comcast, advising the cable company on
its acquisition of ATT Broadband, and was with Grupo Modelo SAB
when the Mexican brewer was sold to Anheuser-Busch InBev NV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fee pool for the financial advisers is projected to be
as much as $143 million for both sides, which would be the
third-largest payday since 2009, according to Freeman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley is the top adviser on mergers and
acquisitions this year including the Comcast-Time Warner Cable
transaction, with 21 deals valued at $115 billion, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. The New York-based investment bank also
worked with Suntory Holdings Ltd., the closely held Japanese
whiskey and beer maker, on its $16 billion takeover of Beam Inc.
in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is ranked second, with 25 deals worth $113
billion, and Centerview is third with seven transactions valued
at $88 billion, the data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs led MA advising last year, working on 349
deals valued at $559 billion, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;

yesterday. &#8220;The position would be different,&#8221; for links that

&lt;p&gt;The court was asked to rule on a dispute in Sweden between
journalists and a company that provided hyperlinks directly to
news articles published for free on the website of newspaper
Goeteborgs-Posten. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Swedish court sought EU legal guidance on whether such

&lt;p&gt;The case is C-466/12, Nils Svensson, Sten Sjoegren,
Madelaine Sahlman, Pia Gadd v. Retriever Sverige AB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Retailer HM Gets Photographer&#8217;s Copyright Case Dismissed &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit filed against Hennes 
Mauritz AB over the use of a photograph on its apparel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estevan Oriol, a photographer and director, claimed that
HM had misappropriated his 1995 photograph of hands
demonstrating a symbol for Los Angeles. The photograph -- known
as &#8220;LA Fingers&#8221; or &#8220;LA Hands&#8221; was, according to Oriol&#8217;s
complaint, featured on the cover of several magazines and used
in his own line of clothing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oriol sued HM last year over the use of the image of hands
creating the Los Angeles symbol on their apparel. He claimed the
photo was similar to his in six ways -- the selection of film,
camera angle, lighting and background, as well as the placement
and size of rings on the model&#8217;s hands. Judge Manuel Real on
Feb. 10 found the alleged similarities were insufficient to
support the suit and dismissed the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bradley Yourist, one of the attorneys representing Oriol,
said in an e-mail &#8220;We disagree with the ruling, and Estevan
Oriol intends on appealing. The fight will go on against those
clothing manufacturers that continue to misappropriate protected
artistic expression under the guise of &#8216;inspiration.&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Oriol v. HM Hennes  Mauritz LP, 13-05088-R,

Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pfizer Sued by Australia Regulator for Generic Lipitor Deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s Australian unit was sued by the country&#8217;s
competition regulator for misuse of market power relating to
sales of its generic version of the cholesterol drug Lipitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said it
filed the lawsuit yesterday in federal court in Sydney claiming
Pfizer Australia Pty.&#8217;s deals with pharmacies in 2012 for the
sale of atorvastatin breached competition rules. A copy of the
filing wasn&#8217;t immediately available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patent protection on Lipitor, the biggest-selling
prescription drug in Australia under the federal drug plan,
expired in May 2012. Prior to the expiration, the ACCC claimed
that Pfizer offered pharmacies discounts and rebates if they
bought a minimum 12 months&#8217; supply of the generic equivalent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pfizer engaged in this conduct for the purpose of
deterring or preventing competitors in the market for
atorvastatin from engaging in competitive conduct,&#8221; ACCC
Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said in an e-mailed statement yesterday it plans to
&#8220;vigorously defend the proceedings&#8221; and declined to comment
further. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Kind Sues Clif Bar Over Packaging of MOJO Line &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kind LLC, the maker of Kind energy bars, sued Clif Bar 
Co. alleging that the redesigned packaging and formulation of
its MOJO line infringes Kind&#8217;s trademarks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keely Wachs, spokesman for Clif Bar, said in an e-mail that
the MOJO line was introduced in 2002. He didn&#8217;t comment on the
lawsuit filed Feb. 6 in federal court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin Mervis, Kind&#8217;s general counsel, didn&#8217;t return a call
seeking comment on the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Kind LLC v. Clif Bar  Co., 14-cv-00770, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Museum in Harper Lee&#8217;s Hometown Fails to Win Lawsuit Dismissal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trademark lawsuit by Harper Lee, the author of &#8220;To Kill
a Mockingbird&#8221; who filed against a museum that capitalized on
the book, will go forward, a federal judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge William H. Steele of the federal court in Mobile,
Alabama, on Feb. 7 declined to dismiss any of Lee&#8217;s nine claims
against the Monroe County Heritage Museum Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steele held that the motion to dismiss lacked legal
reasoning and instead relied on &#8220;bald conclusions&#8221; that fell
short of demonstrating that any claims should be dismissed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee claims the museum, which contains exhibits that feature
both her name and the title of her book, violate federal and
state trademark law. At the time Lee filed her complaint, the
museum was using the domain name www.tokillamockingbird.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee claimed that Monroeville, Ala., is attempting to
capitalize on the success of the novel, which was set in
fictional Maycomb County, Ala. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Westpac (WBC)
Banking Corp. sold their largest Australian dollar-denominated
bonds in more than two years today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the first U.S. commercial bank to come to
the Australian market since July, issued A$950 million ($855
million) of notes maturing in August 2019 to yield 130 basis
points more than swap rates, a person familiar with the matter
said, asking not to be identified because the terms are private.
Westpac, the third-biggest issuer of bank debt in Australia last
year, priced A$3 billion of five-year securities at a 94-basis-point spread, according to an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investor appetite for credit has helped cap borrowing costs
in the South Pacific nation with the average yield premium on
bank paper over the swap rate at 98 basis points yesterday and
94 on Feb. 7, a low unseen since February 2008, according to a
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. Today&#8217;s unsecured bond
sales, the largest in Australia this year, were also accompanied
by a A$2.5 billion securitized issue from Commonwealth Bank of
Australia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;More than A$6 billion of issuance on one day is massive
for the Australian market,&#8221; said Ken Hanton, a director in
National Australia Bank Ltd.&#8217;s debt markets group. &#8220;The level
of demand we have seen is a clear demonstration of the health of
the market at the moment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman transaction was split into a A$700 million
fixed-rate portion and a A$250 million floating-rate component,
the person familiar said. No U.S. commercial bank has sold bonds
in Australia since Goldman&#8217;s last deal in July, when it priced
A$750 million of five-year fixed and floating-rate notes at a
170-basis-point spread, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goldman Offerings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based company raised A$600 million in November
2012 and A$1.25 billion in May 2011, its first Australian
offering following a five-year hiatus. The American bank carries
a credit rating of A- at Standard  Poor&#8217;s, the seventh highest,
and is ranked Baa1 at Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, one level
lower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Westpac&#8217;s sale was also a two-part deal, comprising A$1.1
billion of fixed-rate notes and A$1.9 billion of floaters. The
last transaction from the Sydney-based lender larger than that
was in January 2012, when Westpac borrowed A$3.1 billion via its
debut domestic covered bond, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It&#8217;s rated higher than Goldman Sachs, with scores of
Aa2 at Moody&#8217;s and AA- at SP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Domestic Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NAB was the most recent of the so-called four-pillar
domestic banks to sell new five-year notes in its home market,
pricing A$1.5 billion of floating-rate debentures in November at
a spread of 88 basis points, the data show. The last new
benchmark-sized five-year bond from Westpac was issued in
January 2013 at a 95-basis-point premium, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBA (CBA), the nation&#8217;s biggest lender, also priced A$2.5 billion
of residential mortgage-backed securities today. It sold A$1.4
billion of class A1 floating-rate notes at a yield 80 basis
points above the bank-bill swap rate, A$610 million A2 class
floating-rate notes at a 90-basis-point spread and A$300 million
A3 class fixed-rated securities at a 110 basis-point spread, a
person familiar with the matter said. Pricing on a further A$201
million of notes wasn&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employers are squeezing their workers&#8217; retirement savings, holding back on both the amount and the timing of 401(k) matching funds and dragging out vesting schedules. Taken together, these measures are making it more difficult to save for old age. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Major companies that have engaged in such practices in recent years include Whole Foods Market Inc. (WFM), Facebook Inc., Oracle Corp. (ORCL), Caesars Entertainment Corp. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The most frugal have been scaling back company matches and setting lower limits for the maximum annual payment they&#8217;ll make to a 401(k) account, according to hundreds of government filings analyzed by Bloomberg. A difference of three percentage points on a match can add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars lost for employees over the course of their careers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;America's Retirement Gap&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s been an implicit contract for years and years -- workers save and companies match -- but now they&#8217;re changing the rules,&#8221; said Brigitte Madrian, a Harvard Kennedy School professor who studies retirement policy and corporate management. &#8220;Most individuals can&#8217;t do it on their own. We&#8217;re going in the wrong direction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Companies including International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and Hewlett-Packard Co. say their 401(k) policies are partially dictated by bottom-line considerations and marketplace competition. Others say that when setting their 401(k) contributions, they consider a wide range of benefits and their costs as well as employee preferences, including health care, vacation policy and incentives such as performance bonuses, stock options and outright grants. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Choosing Benefits &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;In addition to our 401(k) plan, we offer benefits that our more than 80,000 Team Members have the opportunity to actually vote on, including paying only $0-$15 per paycheck for health insurance premiums, robust store discounts, and paid time off that carries over,&#8221; Mark Ehrnstein, global vice president of Team Member Services at Whole Foods, said in an e-mail. &#8220;We offer other benefits such as a broad-based stock plan that awards 95 percent of options to non-executives, and we have a gain-sharing program that rewards teams for labor productivity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European swap-trading platforms won
a reprieve from Dodd-Frank Act rules in a deal that puts U.S.
and European authorities on a path toward sharing oversight of
most of the $693 trillion global market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and European
Union officials, in an agreement announced Feb. 12, granted the
trading facilities relief until March 24 from U.S. registration.
U.K. and European regulators also are implementing trading rules
designed to meet U.S. standards that could then be relied on to
substitute for Dodd-Frank oversight in the long-term, said Mark
P. Wetjen, acting CFTC chairman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CFTC said in a summary of the deal that it would revoke
the relief to trading platforms if they fail to meet U.S.
conditions for competition and transparency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many interest-rate swaps will be required to trade on swap
execution facilities, or Sefs, in the U.S. under CFTC rules
starting Feb. 15. Platforms owned by Tradeweb Markets LLC, ICAP
Plc (IAP), GFI Group Inc. (GFIG) and Bloomberg LP, parent of Bloomberg News,
have temporarily registered with the CFTC. The Sefs facilitate
transactions among banks and between banks and asset managers or
other clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The international reach of CFTC rules has been among the
most contentious issues between the Washington-based regulator
and financial firms that operate around the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wetjen said the primary platforms affected are in London. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;State Street Overcharging Probed by U.K. Police, Irish Fund Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London police are investigating client overcharging at
State Street Corp. (STT)&#8217;s U.K. unit that led to a 22.9 million-pound
fine ($38.1 million) from regulators, an Irish fund official
told lawmakers in Dublin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority fined State Street on
Jan. 31 for charging clients &#8220;substantial&#8221; mark-ups without
their consent. A State Street spokeswoman declined to comment,
saying it was a matter for the City of London Police. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pfizer Sued by Australia Regulator for Generic Lipitor Deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s Australian unit was sued by the nation&#8217;s
competition regulator for misuse of market power relating to
sales of its generic version of the Lipitor cholesterol drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator said it filed the lawsuit yesterday in
federal court in Sydney claiming Pfizer Australia Pty.&#8217;s deals
with pharmacies in 2012 for the sale of atorvastatin breached
competition rules because by giving unfair incentives to the
pharmacies to sell the drug upon the expiration of the Lipitor
patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said in an e-mailed statement yesterday it believes
the offers made to the pharmacies were competitive, and declined
to comment further because the matter is before the court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Volcker Rule Bankers&#8217; Lawsuit Dropped as Regulations Revised &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Bankers Association is dropping its lawsuit
challenging a provision of the Volcker Rule that requires
community banks to divest their holdings in some collateralized
debt obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry group, which previously said banks would
suffer losses of $600 million because of the provision, is
working with regulators which have already made changes to the
rule that &#8220;allowed many banks to avoid taking hundreds of
millions of dollars in unnecessary writedowns,&#8221; Frank Keating,

&lt;p&gt;Feb. 10 (Bloomberg) -- Barclays Plc reported full-year

&lt;p&gt;1. Buffett Drives Headline Writers Crazy: Jonathan Weil &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feb. 13 (Bloomberg) -- Few things in journalism are more

owns. &lt;/p&gt;

Strain &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. $100,000 3D-Printed Dress Created by Designer, Architect &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feb. 11 (Bloomberg) -- Innovative fashion designers are
experimenting with 3D printing to create unique designs.
Designer Michael Schmidt says he worked with an architect to
create a mesh gown for Dita Von Teese made of &#8220;articulated
joints that expand and contract with the undulations of the
body.&#8221; Bloomberg&#8217;s Cory Johnson reports. (Source: Bloomberg) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the U.S.
bank most reliant on trading, lost market share in equities
revenue relative to the world&#8217;s top firms last year, according
to Tricumen Ltd., a financial research company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s share of total operating revenue from
equities in 2013 dropped 4.1 percent from the previous year,
while sales by the bank&#8217;s peer group rose a combined 15 percent,
Tricumen said in a report published today. UBS AG (UBSN), Switzerland&#8217;s
biggest bank, expanded its share by 1.4 percent, the largest
gain in the group, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs lost ground in equity derivatives due to its
limited range of services and products compared with No. 1
competitor JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), said Darko Kapor, a partner at
London-based Tricumen. Goldman Sachs fell to sixth from the
second rank by revenue in equity derivatives last year, and to
third from second in servicing hedge funds, according to
Tricumen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, based in New York, reported $15.7 billion in
revenue from equity and fixed-income trading in 2013, down 13
percent from a year earlier, hurt mostly by interest-rate and
currency trading. In stocks, it remained the leader for cash
equities last year and is also the No. 1 in proprietary trading
by revenue, Tricumen data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tricumen uses corporate filings and its own industry data
to compile the rankings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (G) named
Sergei Arsenyev and Dmitri Sedov as co-heads of its investment
banking division in Moscow, according to an internal memo
obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arsenyev, who joined the New York-based bank in 2000, is
focusing on coverage of the government and family offices, the
memo said. Sedov, who joined Goldman Sachs in 2007, is &#8220;MA
captain for Russia&#8221; and is focusing on telecommunications,
media, technology, infrastructure, industrials and healthcare in
the region, the memo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sergei and Dmitri will be working closely with Paolo Zannoni and Nick Jordan in their roles of co-chief executive
officers of the Russia/Commonwealth of Independent States
business,&#8221; said the memo, signed by co-heads of investment
banking Richard Gnodde, David Solomon and John Weinberg. Monika Schaller, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt,
confirmed the memo&#8217;s contents by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appointments come a year after Goldman Sachs was hired
by Russia&#8217;s Economy Ministry and the Russian Direct Investment
Fund as &#8220;a corporate broker&#8221; to burnish the nation&#8217;s image
overseas and attract more institutional investors. Jordan was
hired from UBS AG as co-head of the Russian business to work
alongside Zannoni last March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank also named Tim Talkington as head of its Russian
securities unit, according to another memo. Talkington joined
Goldman Sachs in 2000 in London and rejoined the firm in Moscow
in 2007. He was named head of equities for Russia in 2012.
Schaller also confirmed his appointment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Disneyland (DIS) plans to open
its third and largest hotel by early 2017 to accommodate an
influx of visitors from countries including China and South
Korea amid intensifying competition from a local theme park. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 750-room hotel will cost HK$4.26 billion ($550
million), the company said in a statement today. Hong Kong
Disneyland posted a profit of HK$242 million, its second annual
gain, in the 12 months ended September, more than double the
HK$109 million a year ago, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visitors from China to Hong Kong Disneyland, part-owned by
the city&#8217;s government, jumped 15 percent last year, while those
from South Korea surged 27 percent, Hong Kong Disneyland
Managing Director Andrew Kam told reporters today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The hotel expansion will support increasing demand from
the booming tourism industry in the region,&#8221; Kam said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Disneyland, 48-percent owned by Burbank,
California-based Walt Disney Co., will create an area that
features Marvel characters in late 2016 after new attractions
including Toy Story and Grizzly Gulch helped it turn a first
profit in fiscal 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Disneyland&#8217;s sales rose 15 percent to HK$4.9
billion for the fiscal year, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme park has had to contend with government-owned
Ocean Park, which drew 7.7 million visitors in the fiscal year
ended June. Ocean Park plans to add around 30 attractions by
2017 and a 495-room hotel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visitors from China to the former British colony jumped
16.7 percent to 40.8 million last year and accounted for 75
percent of total visitor arrivals, according to the Hong Kong
Tourism Board. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world&#8217;s largest
beverage company, dropped the most in more than two years after
North American soft-drink demand shrank and its once-effervescent growth in emerging markets showed signs of slowing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter net income slid 8.4 percent to $1.71
billion, or 38 cents a share, from $1.87 billion, or 41 cents, a
year earlier, Atlanta-based Coca-Cola said today in a statement.
Sales fell 3.6 percent to $11 billion in the period, missing the
average analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent, facing sluggish demand
worldwide, embarked on a plan to cut $1 billion in annual costs
by 2016, aiming to reduce supply and data-management expenses
and overhaul marketing programs. Still, the company has been
slow to react to health concerns about its drinks, as well as
the growing desire for beverages that aren&#8217;t carbonated colas,
said Ali Dibadj, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The changes that the company is making just aren&#8217;t
enough,&#8221; Dibadj, who is based in New York, said in an
interview. &#8220;Many investors aren&#8217;t sharing the confidence that
management does of the company&#8217;s future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola shares fell 3.8 percent to $37.47 in New York,
marking the biggest one-day decline since August 2011. The
shares have dropped 9.3 percent this year, compared with a 0.4
percent decline for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. PepsiCo
Inc. (PEP), the company&#8217;s biggest competitor, has decreased 5.7
percent in that period. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) employee fell
to his death from the roof of Chater House, the investment
bank&#8217;s Asia-Pacific headquarters in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A sad and tragic incident occurred in Chater House, Hong
Kong, which is currently being investigated by the police,&#8221;
JPMorgan said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. The bank
declined to comment further &#8220;out of respect for those involved.
Our thoughts and sympathy are with the family that&#8217;s involved at
this difficult point of time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Hong Kong police official, who asked not to be identified
in line with the agency&#8217;s policy, said the person was certified
dead at the hospital. The man was a junior employee in a
supporting function who didn&#8217;t work as a trader or investment
banker, said a JPMorgan employee who asked not to be identified
because they weren&#8217;t authorized to release the information until
the man&#8217;s family overseas are contacted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A Chinese male in his thirties&#8221; was found in front of
the building at about 1:55 p.m. yesterday, Lee Kwok Wing, senior
manager for security and support services of building owner
Hongkong Land Holdings Ltd., said at the scene. The building at
8 Connaught Road Central is 30 stories high, according to
Hongkong Land&#8217;s website. JPMorgan occupies the top 10 floors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other building tenants include Franklin Templeton
Investment Funds, Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd., Pictet Asset
Management (HK) Ltd. and Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, a 39-year-old vice president in technology
operations died after falling from JPMorgan&#8217;s London
headquarters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A rebound in Israeli exports is
signaling to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) that central bank Governor
Karnit Flug will resist manufacturers&#8217; calls to cut interest
rates to weaken the shekel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect growth in total exports to pick up to around 4
percent in 2014,&#8221; Kasper Lund-Jensen and Ahmet Akarli, London-based economists at Goldman Sachs, said in a report last week.
Imports will grow by a similar amount, making net impact on the
shekel &#8220;fairly neutral&#8221; and reducing &#8220;the risks of a near-term rate cut,&#8221; they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manufacturers say the strength of the shekel, which
outperformed 30 other major currencies Bloomberg tracked last
year, was a major reason exports slipped 0.1 percent in 2013.
They kept their demand for a rate cut even after exports began
rebounding late last year and the shekel&#8217;s appreciation stalled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales abroad rose to $4.2 billion in January from $4
billion in December, according to government data. The currency,
which gained 7.5 percent last year against the dollar, has
declined about 1 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bank of Israel, which has held the rate at 1 percent
since October, is scheduled to announce its next decision on
Feb. 24. Sixteen of 19 economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast
the bank will hold the rate again, with the rest predicting a
quarter-point cut. The shekel strengthened 0.1 percent to 3.5090
per dollar at 5:20 p.m. in Tel Aviv. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Economic Upturn &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s monetary policy committee cited an economic
pickup and rising home prices when it kept the rate unchanged
last month. The Manufacturers Association of Israel called the
Jan. 27 decision &#8220;disappointing&#8221; and said borrowing costs
should be cut to 0.25 percent to weaken the shekel and make
goods sold abroad more competitive. The Israel Export 
International Cooperation Institute said on Dec. 10 that the
currency&#8217;s appreciation dealt exports a &#8220;mortal blow.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in Davos
last month that Israeli exporters must adjust to the stronger
shekel because policy makers have limited options to curb it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government today announced measures to aid exporters,
including raising the ceiling on export guarantees, expediting
approvals of export risk insurance and allocating 50 million
shekels ($14.2 million) to market goods abroad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While exports have rallied in recent months, imports have
climbed more, widening the trade gap to $1.5 billion in January
from $1.2 billion a month earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Market Benefit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise in exports, if maintained, will benefit equity and
bond markets, said Jonathan Katz, a Jerusalem-based economist at
HSBC Holdings Plc. &#8220;The export figures were pretty broad-based
and varied, not limited to one sector like pharmaceuticals or
technology,&#8221; Katz said. &#8220;So although so far it&#8217;s just one
robust number, if exports and domestic demand continue trending
upwards, it will be good for companies and the whole economy and
eventually the markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank has tried to weaken the shekel by stepping
up its purchase of foreign currency reserves. It bought $1.7
billion in January, after buying $630 million the previous
month, bringing its reserves to a record $83.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stabilization of the dollar-shekel rate in recent weeks
makes it probable the bank will pare its currency purchases this
month and hold the key rate, said Tal Zohar Avda, chief
executive officer of the Tel Aviv branch of FXCM Inc. (FXCM) U.S.
Federal Reserve head Janet Yellen&#8217;s Feb. 11 comment that she
intends to maintain the policy of gradually reducing bond
purchases, also support this view, Avda said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Less Pressure &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the dollar continues to strengthen globally, mainly
against the euro, it will get stronger in Israel, too,&#8221; Avda
said. &#8220;As long as the dollar continues to stabilize or
strengthen, there will be less pressure from the exporters on
the Bank of Israel to cut the rate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman forecasts the bank will hold the rate through the
first half of 2014, until a continued improvement in exports, a
gradual quickening of inflation and rising housing prices
trigger &#8220;a hiking cycle&#8221; in the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Monetary Fund, in its annual report on
Israel&#8217;s economy released Feb. 12, urged the government to rein
in housing costs by limiting loan-to-value ratios on mortgages
and raising the property purchase tax for secondary homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If global growth prospects improve sharply&#8221; or
appreciation pressures on the shekel ease, &#8220;the monetary policy
stance should be gradually normalized,&#8221; the IMF said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd. (CCL) Managing
Director Terry Davis told investors he was sorry after a A$404
million ($367 million) writeoff at its packaged-foods unit SPC
Ardmona drove profit to its lowest level since 1992. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I apologize to not be able to bring you a better
result,&#8221; Davis, who&#8217;s leaving the job March 3, told investors
on a call today after announcing an 83 percent drop in net
income to A$79.9 million for the year ended Dec. 31. &#8220;Hopefully
we&#8217;ve turned the tide&#8221; with SPC, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales volumes at Coca-Cola Amatil&#8217;s main Australian soft
drinks business fell 3.2 percent to 338 million cases last year,
cutting group revenue by 1.1 percent to A$5.08 billion, the
first decline since 2006, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Australia&#8217;s biggest beverage company fell 5.3 percent
to A$11.22 at the close in Sydney, its lowest price since August
2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australian food companies have been hurt by currency swings
in recent years. The Australian dollar&#8217;s rise to a 29-year high
of $1.11 in July 2011 lowered the cost of competing imports, and
its subsequent decline to 90 cents has increased the price of
raw materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asahi Group Holdings Ltd. (2502)&#8217;s Schweppes Australia unit, which
sells Pepsi in the country, raised prices for the first time in
two years this month, Citigroup Inc. analyst Gino Rossi wrote in
a Feb. 7 note to clients, driven by an estimated 3.5 percent
increase in costs of imported ingredients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That will lessen pricing pressure on Coca-Cola, which sells
at a premium of more than 50 percent to Pepsi, according to
Rossi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Aggressive competitor pricing&#8221; was responsible for the
poor result from Coca-Cola Amatil&#8217;s Australian beverage unit,
the company said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;State Support &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were a negative for Coca-Cola Amatil&#8217;s credit,
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service senior vice president Ian Lewis wrote
in an opinion after the announcement. It wouldn&#8217;t affect the
company&#8217;s investment-grade ratings, which are stable at A3, he
wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The high Australian dollar has enabled a flood of cheap
imported product to be sold in Australia below the cost of
production here while decimating SPCA&#8217;s export markets,&#8221; Coca-Cola Amatil said in a regulatory statement today. The company
will pursue anti-dumping measures, changes to import tariffs,
and enforcement of standards on ingredients, according to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8217;Corporate Welfare&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia&#8217;s federal government, which has said it doesn&#8217;t
believe in &#8220;corporate welfare,&#8221; on Jan. 30 turned down Coca-Cola Amatil&#8217;s request for a A$25 million grant to fund
efficiency savings at SPC Ardmona. The government of Victoria
state will instead provide A$22 million alongside A$78 million
from the company, the parent company said Feb. 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remaining book value of SPC Ardmona is &#8220;just north of
A$300 million,&#8221; Alison Watkins, who will take over from Davis
next month, told investors on the call. The state&#8217;s investment
won&#8217;t eliminate Coca-Cola Amatil&#8217;s ability to exit the business
if it continues to underperform, Davis said, without giving
further details. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett, speaking last April at Coca-Cola Co. (KO)&#8217;s annual meeting, warned that the beverage giant shouldn&#8217;t get complacent about its success. Ten months later, those words could come back to haunt the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest soft-drink maker, facing sluggish growth overseas and concerns about the healthiness of its product at home, posted its fourth straight quarter of declining sales yesterday. The results sent the stock on its biggest one-day decline in more than two years -- bad news for both Coke and Buffett, the company&#8217;s largest shareholder. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The slowdown has raised concerns about the long-term plan of Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent, who has promised big revenue gains by 2020. Investors are looking for Kent to take bolder steps, said Ali Dibadj, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. While the company announced a $1 billion budget-tightening plan yesterday, it doesn&#8217;t go far enough, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There needs to be much more cost cutting,&#8221; Dibadj, who is based in New York, said in an interview. &#8220;There needs to be much faster innovation. There needs to be much more return of cash to shareholders.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Coke&#8217;s fourth-quarter sales fell 3.6 percent to $11 billion, missing the average analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg. Net income slid 8.4 percent to $1.71 billion, or 38 cents a share, from $1.87 billion, or 41 cents, a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malone, 55, was formerly a managing director and national

Comerica said today in a statement. He replaces Ross Rogers, who

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. is giving SodaStream
International Ltd. (SODA) a hand in scaring away short sellers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Coca-Cola agreed Feb. 5 to buy a 10 percent stake in
Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. (GMCR), a company developing a
make-your-own, single-serve product similar to SodaStream&#8217;s,
short interest on the stock has fallen. It dropped to 22 percent
of the Israeli beverage maker&#8217;s outstanding shares on Feb. 14
from an 18-month high of 30 percent at the start of the year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg and Markit, a London-based research firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Green Mountain deal helped validate the do-it-yourself
beverage market and fueled speculation that PepsiCo Inc. (PEP), the
world&#8217;s second-largest soft-drink maker after Coca-Cola, will
make a bid for SodaStream. The stock has started to rebound,
climbing 15 percent from a 14-month low it hit on Feb. 3 after
the company released worse-than-forecast preliminary earnings
for 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a chance SodaStream can repeat Green Mountain&#8217;s
success story,&#8221; Albert Saporta, the head of research at Makor
Capital Ltd. in Ramat Gan, Israel who has a buy rating on the
stock, said in a Feb. 12 telephone interview. &#8220;If the at-home
carbonated beverage market proves to be a substantial market,
you win without paying anything for that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) dropped Al-Rajhi Bank, the world&#8217;s largest Shariah-compliant lender, as a correspondent banking client amid a push to improve risk controls, said two people with direct knowledge of the move. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The relationship with Saudi Arabia&#8217;s biggest publicly traded bank ended Dec. 31 because JPMorgan couldn&#8217;t get enough information on where payments in dollar-clearing services for Al-Rajhi had originated, said one of the people, who requested anonymity because the decision wasn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it cut off the service to about 500 foreign lenders last year as regulators press the world&#8217;s biggest banks to verify that transactions are used for legitimate business. The crackdown seeks to halt funds tied to money laundering, terrorism and countries covered by economic sanctions. Correspondent accounts allow lenders to take deposits or make payments on behalf of foreign institutions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPMorgan has to be extra careful to make sure they&#8217;re adhering to standards and not even approaching anything questionable,&#8221; said David Kass, a professor at the University of Maryland&#8217;s Robert H. Smith School of Business. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The two banks haven&#8217;t been cited by U.S. regulators for involvement in illegal money transfers. Tasha Pelio, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to comment on clients of the company, which is based in New York and ranks as the nation&#8217;s largest lender by assets. A spokesman for Al-Rajhi (RJHI) didn&#8217;t respond to inquiries, and there was no response to messages sent to the firm&#8217;s Riyadh headquarters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan Exchange Group Inc. (8697) will
consider merging three smaller equity markets to simplify its
exchange structure, a bourse official said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPX, created last year from the merger of the Tokyo Stock
Exchange and Osaka Securities Exchange, will weigh combining its
Mothers, TSE Second Section and Jasdaq markets, Yasuyuki Konuma,
executive officer for the new listings department, said in an
interview in Tokyo yesterday. Serious discussion has yet to
begin and there is no schedule for the merger, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are some who say it&#8217;s a problem that we have so
many markets,&#8221; said Konuma. &#8220;We need to begin discussing
whether we need to merge them, the merit being simplicity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creation of the national bourse last year was part of a
state plan to streamline Japan&#8217;s securities industry and revive
its standing as a financial hub. Potential consolidation
contrasts with the U.S., where trading is spread across more
than 50 public and private markets as well as dozens of internal
platforms at broker-dealers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That fragmentation is blamed by some for making American
capital markets too complex. Two U.S. exchange operators, Bats
Global Markets Inc. and Direct Edge Holdings LLC, have retained
their four individual markets even after the parent companies
completed their merger this month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management and
William Blair Investment Management are buying the rupee as
India reins in a current-account deficit that drove the currency
to a record low in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rupee, which slid 21 percent in the past two years,
looks &#8220;cheap&#8221; relative to India&#8217;s improving external finances,
according to Goldman Sachs Asset, which opened a &#8220;small long&#8221;
position on the currency this year. William Blair has boosted
the currency to about 20 percent of its foreign-exchange
holdings for its higher yield and inexpensive valuation, said
Chicago-based fund manager Brian D. Singer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rupee has rebounded more than 10 percent from last
year&#8217;s all-time low of 68.845 per dollar as India curbed gold
imports to shore up the current account and the central bank
acted to spur dollar inflows. Only Indonesia&#8217;s rupiah has fallen
more than the rupee among Asian emerging markets. While India&#8217;s
finances have improved since last year, the nation needs a
coordinated plan to respond to volatility in global currency
markets as the U.S. reduces stimulus, the International Monetary
Fund said in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;current-account numbers have been the key driver
because it&#8217;s a very transparent measure of whether the policy
prescriptions are having an impact,&#8221; Philip Moffitt, Sydney-based head of fixed income for Asia-Pacific at Goldman Sachs
Asset, which oversaw more than $1 trillion on Dec. 31, said in 
an e-mail interview yesterday. &#8220;If you can find something 
that&#8217;s relatively cheap and the fundamentals appear to be 
improving, it&#8217;s usually a good mix.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Principal Risk&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shortfall in the broadest measure of trade will shrink
to $45 billion in the year through March from an unprecedented
$88 billion the previous period, the government said Feb. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The principal risk facing India is the inward spillover
from a tightening of global liquidity interacting with domestic
vulnerabilities,&#8221; the IMF said in the report. Pressures
associated with India&#8217;s &#8220;still-significant external financing
need&#8221; could lead to higher borrowing costs, fund outflows and
&#8220;disorderly adjustments&#8221; in the exchange rate, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any plan should make rupee flexibility the key defense and
include measures to raise the benchmark interest rate, impose
cash curbs, open foreign-exchange swap windows and raise diesel
prices, the Washington-based lender said in an annual review of
India&#8217;s economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Current Account &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dollar-based investors will earn 9 percent including
interest by holding the rupee until the end of 2014, the second-biggest return in Asia, according to Bloomberg data based on
appreciation estimates and deposit rates. Two-year government
bonds pay 8.67 percent in India, compared with 0.31 percent in
the U.S. and 3.70 percent in China. The rupee was at 62.23 per
dollar yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s current-account shortfall decreased to $5.2 billion
in the third quarter of 2013, from $21.8 billion in the previous
three months, after Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram
raised tariffs on gold in the world&#8217;s largest bullion-consuming
nation. Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan lured $34
billion of foreign-currency inflows by offering discounted swaps
for dollars raised by banks, one of his first steps on taking
office on Sept. 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajan has also raised interest rates three times so far,
helping curb consumer-price inflation to 8.79 percent last month
from as much as 11.2 percent in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rising Confidence &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Options are signaling increased confidence in the rupee as
external balances improve and price pressures cool. One-month
implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the exchange
rate used to price options, has eased to 8.17 percent from last
year&#8217;s peak of 22.4 percent in September, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carry traders, who borrow in currencies with lower yields
and buy those with higher rates, have earned 4.1 percent on
rupee investments using dollars since Sept. 30, the most among
23 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Favorable
policies will help the rupee and Indonesia&#8217;s rupiah perform
better than currencies of other nations with current-account
deficits such as Brazil, Turkey and South Africa, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. economist Fiona Lake wrote in a Feb. 19 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appointment of Rajan, an economist credited with
presaging the 2008 global financial crisis, as the RBI&#8217;s head
encouraged William Blair, which oversaw more than $72 billion as
of Dec. 31, to boost bullish positions on the rupee, according
to portfolio manager Singer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The rupee is a cheap currency with significant carry,&#8221;
he said in an interview in Melbourne yesterday. It &#8220;has
deviated from fundamentals and should not be included in the
fragile five,&#8221; he added, referring to a description used by
Morgan Stanley last year to describe currencies most vulnerable
to capital flight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO) said Kathy Waller,

&lt;p&gt;Waller, 55, joined Coca-Cola as a senior accountant in

Fayard, who is 62 years-old and has been CFO since 1999, will

&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent is leading the world&#8217;s

decline in two months after the company posted fourth-quarter
results that showed North American soft-drink demand is
shrinking and growth in emerging markets was slowing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola rose 0.6 percent to $37.30 at 1:52 p.m. in New
York. The shares fell 10 percent this year through yesterday,
compared with a 1.1 percent drop for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500

&lt;p&gt;Gemalto NV (GTO) fell the most in more
than three years after Visa Inc., owner of the biggest bank-card
network, said it&#8217;s offering cheaper alternatives to the
company&#8217;s technology for payments using mobile phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New capabilities include an option to host accounts &#8220;in a
secure, virtual cloud,&#8221; Foster City, California-based Visa said
in a statement yesterday. This gives financial institutions more
choice in secure payment systems with smartphones and follows
the introduction of technology that allows Android phones to
emulate a smartcard, so the devices can be used to &#8220;wave to
pay,&#8221; Visa said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The outlook for Gemalto&#8217;s Mobile Communication segment,
which accounts for around 50 percent of its earnings, is the
main reason for our sell recommendation,&#8221; Ali Farid Khwaja, an
analyst at Berenberg Bank, said in a note today. The technology
now supported by Visa &#8220;is simpler, cheaper and the fact that
Visa and Mastercard have approved it also suggests that it is
secure to use for payment transactions,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gemalto&#8217;s offerings include chips and software that make
bank cards and mobile phones more secure. Under Chief Executive
Officer Olivier Piou, the Amsterdam-based company has shifted
away from commoditized chips to sell more lucrative packages
including security software. Its clients include mobile-phone
carriers and banks, as well as companies including Volkswagen
AG&#8217;s Audi division and Facebook Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gemalto fell as much as 9.2 percent, the biggest intraday
drop since August 2010. The shares were down 5.3 percent at
78.42 euros as of 11:32 a.m. in Amsterdam, for a decline of 2
percent this year, giving the company a market value of 6.9
billion euros ($9.45 billion). &lt;/p&gt;

million and founded a biotechnology company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ganot, 40, a former Israeli army captain, is one of a
generation of parents who are stepping in when medicine and
industry don&#8217;t move fast enough to save their children. Instead
of the usual approach of forming or supporting an advocacy
group, Ganot is using his roots in finance to start a business
aimed at getting treatments to market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He&#8217;s a really exceptional example of a parent who says,
&#8216;I&#8217;m going to take my skills and apply them to this problem,&#8217;&#8221;
said Sharon Hesterlee, vice president of research at Parent
Project Muscular Dystrophy, a nonprofit focused on the disease.
&#8220;You want them to solve world peace after this.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ganot would settle for making a difference in the disease
afflicting his son, Eytani. There&#8217;s no cure for Duchenne
muscular dystrophy, which occurs when the body fails to produce
a protein called dystrophin that supports muscle fiber strength.
DMD puts kids in wheelchairs before their teens and is often
fatal in their 20s. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO), the largest
Spanish-language TV producer, reported a gain in fourth-quarter
adjusted profit as cable and satellite subscriptions rose and
advertising spending climbed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating-segment profit, which leaves out items such as
depreciation and amortization, rose 4.3 percent to 8.49 billion
pesos ($639 million), Mexico City-based Televisa said in a
statement. Sales rose 8.3 percent to 21.4 billion pesos,
compared with the 20.8 billion-peso average of 10 analysts&#8217;
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New cable and satellite customers are propelling sales for
Televisa, reducing the broadcaster&#8217;s reliance on over-the-air TV
advertising. The Sky satellite business added 136,550 users,
less than 245,000 average estimate of four analysts polled by
Bloomberg. Cable connections, including TV, Internet and phone
subscriptions, rose by more than 175,000 to 5.08 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new customers are helping Televisa as it forgoes
another source of revenue. The company will miss out on about
1.4 billion pesos in sales this year because of a new law that
lets cable and satellite companies include its channels in their
lineups for free instead of paying, Executive Vice President
Alfonso de Angoitia said on a conference call with analysts
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dish Mexico (DISH*) and Axtel SAB have been retransmitting
Televisa&#8217;s signals for free since September. Televisa is in a
legal battle challenging the authority of Mexico&#8217;s Federal
Telecommunications Institute to police the retransmissions of
its broadcasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Iusacell Writedown &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact of the law cut retransmission revenue by 22
percent from a year earlier to 639 million pesos in the fourth
quarter, Televisa said. The company reported 8.32 billion pesos
in revenue from TV advertising, 7.8 percent higher than a year
earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa shares rose 2.3 percent to 76.31 pesos at the
close of trading in Mexico City. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While growth slows for its Mexican television business,
Televisa&#8217;s investment in U.S. Spanish-language TV is paying off.
The company reported finance income of 5.36 billion pesos in the
fourth quarter to reflect the increased value of its debt
holdings in Univision Communications Inc., the largest U.S.
Spanish-language broadcaster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conservative Valuation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa calculated the value of the asset conservatively,
and it may be worth more, Angoitia said. A financial investor
acquired a 1.5 percent equity stake in Univision last month for
$125 million, which would value Televisa&#8217;s investment at $3
billion instead of the $2 billion the Mexican company calculated
itself, Angoitia said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a valuable price discovery exercise,&#8221; Richard Dineen, a New York-based analyst at HSBC Holdings Plc, said in a
phone interview. &#8220;The tension here is that private-equity
investors are not lifetime holders. An exit is in the cards.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1.5 percent stake could later be sold to a strategic
buyer, which may include Televisa, Dineen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s investment in Mexican mobile-phone operator
Grupo Iusacell SA hasn&#8217;t gone as well. Televisa recorded a
fourth-quarter loss from joint ventures of 4.74 billion pesos in
the quarter, mostly to write down the value of Iusacell. After
acquiring its 50 percent stake in the company for $1.6 billion
in 2012, Televisa invested 1.59 billion pesos in the mobile-phone carrier in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wireless company is in talks to combine its operations
with Telefonica SA in Mexico, a person with knowledge of the
matter said earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Consolidation may be good for the market down the road,&#8221;
Angoitia said on the call today. Iusacell, which ended 2013 with
8 million subscribers, or 8 percent of the market, is focusing
on growth and waiting for more clarity on regulatory matters, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkish Airlines has hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Citigroup Inc. (C) to sell debt backed by aircraft as it builds a fleet capable of taking on Europe&#8217;s leading carriers, three people familiar with the plan said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company aims to sell the enhanced equipment trust certificates this year, according to the people, who asked not to be identified as the plan is confidential. The amount of debt to be sold could approach $1 billion, one person said. Chief Executive Officer Temel Kotil said Feb. 11 that the company is working on a plan to sell EETCs, without elaborating. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EETCs allow airlines to issue investment-grade debt at lower yields and transfer the burden of financing fleet orders to the bond market. Purchases employing such instruments, which give investors a claim on planes if a carrier goes bankrupt, generally involve funding from multiple parties. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The securities will allow Turk Hava Yollari AO, as the carrier is formally known, to tap EETC investors in the U.S., two of the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Istanbul-based company aims to double its fleet to about 450 planes by 2020 after last year ordering 117 single-aisle planes from Airbus SAS and 95 from Boeing Co. (BA) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Turkish Air has embarked on an expansion as it builds its home airport into a long-haul transfer hub linking Europe and North America with Asia, Africa and the Middle East. The carrier will boost transit traffic to 70 percent of the international total by 2020 from about 40 percent today and should double its passenger tally to 100 million, according to Kotil. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gulf carriers such as Emirates employing a similar model are already capturing traffic from hubs operated by carriers including Air France-KLM Group (AF) and Deutsche Lufthansa AG. (LHA) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nevnihal Ciftci, a spokeswoman for Citigroup in Turkey, declined to comment. Ali Genc, a Turkish Airlines spokesman, wasn&#8217;t immediately available for comment, while Goldman Sachs spokesman didn&#8217;t reply to calls. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Turkish Airlines (THYAO) fell as much as 2 percent to 6.77 liras in Istanbul. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Ercan Ersoy in Istanbul at eersoy@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Benedikt Kammel at bkammel@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is cutting the price of Windows 8.1 by 70 percent for makers of low-cost computers and tablets as they try to fend off cheaper rivals like Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Chromebooks, people familiar with the program said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Manufacturers will be charged $15 to license Windows 8.1 and preinstall it on devices that retail for less than $250, instead of the usual fee of $50, said the people, who asked not to be named because the details aren&#8217;t public. The discount will apply to any products that meet the price limit, with no restrictions on the size or type of device, the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stronger competition from Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google cut revenue last quarter at Microsoft&#8217;s devices and consumer licensing division, which includes Windows software, as the computer industry posted its biggest annual decline on record. By offering incentives for PC makers to sell cheaper models, Microsoft may be able to increase its share of the growing $80 billion tablet market and stave off Chromebooks, notebooks that run Google&#8217;s operating system. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which named Satya Nadella as chief executive officer earlier this month, is seeking to speed up development and introduction of new devices. It won&#8217;t require products that use the cheaper licensing to complete logo certification, a process that verifies hardware compatibility, one of the people said. Devices aren&#8217;t required to be touch-screen compatible, they said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Julia Kelly-Echeverio, a spokeswoman for Microsoft, declined to comment yesterday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Slower Adoption &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft said earlier this month that it has sold more than 200 million licenses of Windows 8 since the program went on sale in October 2012, a slower rate of adoption than the previous Windows 7. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the regular Windows list price was $50, some of the largest global computer makers paid closer to $30 after incentives such as marketing funds provided by Microsoft, the people said. Products that receive discounted license fees won&#8217;t be eligible for such marketing support and incentives, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Global computer shipments fell a record 10 percent last year and are forecast to continue to decline this year as tablets and smartphones lure consumers away from traditional desktop and notebook designs, according to data from market research firm IDC. Tablet sales volume -- dominated by Apple and Google, whose operating systems account for 95 percent of that market -- will climb an average 16 percent through to 2017. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Dina Bass in Seattle at dbass2@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Pui-Wing Tam at ptam13@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

IMF &lt;/p&gt;

Cohan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feb. 18 (Bloomberg) -- I have always been deeply troubled
by the fact that more than a billion people willingly share, for
free, endless amounts of information about themselves and the
people they care about with Mark Zuckerberg  Co. over at
Facebook, and then allow Zuckerberg to mine that data and sell
the relevant bits and pieces to advertisers. &lt;/p&gt;

Goldberg &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feb. 18 (Bloomberg) -- Until recently, Gary Samore was the
Barack Obama administration&#8217;s top expert on weapons of mass
destruction and the go-to White House official on the

danger from avalanches. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BlackBerry Ltd. shares surged after
its QNX software was said to be favored by Ford Motor Co. for
its next-generation Sync system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford (F), struggling with in-car technology flaws, will no
longer use Microsoft (MSFT) Corp.&#8217;s Windows for Sync, instead basing
the system on QNX, according to people briefed on the matter.
Using QNX will be less expensive than licensing Microsoft
technology and will improve the flexibility and speed of the
next Sync system, the people, who asked not to be identified
because the decision hasn&#8217;t been made public, said Feb. 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackBerry shares jumped 7.6 percent, the most since Jan.
22. Ford was little changed at $15.18, and Microsoft slid less
than 1 percent to $37.69. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford&#8217;s decision highlights the value of QNX for BlackBerry,
the smartphone maker that lost 95 percent of its value from
mid-2008 to November and saw the collapse of a proposed $4.7
billion buyout. Ford has more than 7 million vehicles on the
road with Sync using Microsoft voice-activated software to make
mobile-phone calls and play music. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The QNX operating system &#8220;is the standard right now,&#8221;
said Matthew Stover, an analyst at Guggenheim Partners in
Boston. &#8220;QNX is a well-known, understood OS. It&#8217;s proven.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackBerry is already a supplier of technology and
engineering to Ford, among other automakers, and QNX technology
is already in use in Ford vehicles on the road today, said Paul
Leroux, a QNX spokesman. He declined to confirm Ford&#8217;s decision
and wouldn&#8217;t say whether it would produce more revenue for
BlackBerry. Susannah Wesley, a Ford spokeswoman, and Peter Wootton, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft who
works for Waggener Edstrom, also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;QNX Asset &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since becoming BlackBerry&#8217;s CEO on Nov. 4, John Chen cited
software such as QNX and the BlackBerry Messenger service as
assets he will look to capitalize on. Predecessor Thorsten Heins
spoke often during his tenure for the potential of QNX to play a
role in machine-to-machine settings such as cars interacting
with parking meters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is really the crown jewel in BlackBerry&#8217;s crown and
could make the rest of the company shine as well,&#8221; Thilo
Koslowski, auto analyst for researcher Gartner Inc. in Santa
Clara, California, said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The switch may help Ford, the second-largest U.S.
automaker, address customer complaints about malfunctioning
technology systems and touch screens that have hurt it in
surveys by J.D. Power  Associates and Consumer Reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford has said the quality of its
vehicles has been &#8220;mixed&#8221; each of the past three years and
fell short of its plan to improve those results in 2013. CEO
Alan Mulally was said to be a candidate to become Microsoft&#8217;s
chief until early this year, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Connected Cars &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improving Sync is crucial for Ford to draw car shoppers who
are increasingly looking to be connected at all times. In-vehicle technology is the top selling point for 39 percent of
auto buyers, more than twice the 14 percent who say their first
consideration is traditional performance measures such as power
and speed, according to a study by the consulting firm Accenture
released in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford and Lincoln ranked Nos. 26 and 27 out of 28 brands in
Consumer Reports&#8217; annual auto-reliability survey released in
October. While the Lincoln luxury line matched the industry
average in J.D. Power&#8217;s Initial Quality study in June, the
namesake finished 27th out of 33 brands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;QNX Users &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology companies are competing to win business from
automakers as in-car technology becomes an increasingly
important selling point. Google Inc. announced an alliance with
General Motors Co., Honda Motor Co., Hyundai Motor Co. and
chipmaker Nvidia Corp. in January to bring the Android operating
system to cars. Apple Inc. is working with Bayerische Motoren
Werke AG, Daimler AG&#8217;s Mercedes-Benz, Nissan Motor Co. and
others to introduce its iOS operating system to cars with
devices such as the iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackBerry&#8217;s QNX Software Systems can be found in cars made
made by Volkswagen AG&#8217;s Audi unit and BMW, according to its
website. QNX and Microsoft are the main suppliers of automotive
operating system software, according to researcher IHS iSuppli. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackBerry, at the time named Research in Motion Ltd. (BB),
bought QNX Software Systems for $200 million in 2010. In
addition to its presence in cars, QNX technology is used to
manage nuclear-power plants and by the U.S. military for
unmanned aerial drones. Its customers include Cisco Systems
Inc., General Electric Co. and Caterpillar Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Funeral Ceremony&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The switch would be a significant blow to Microsoft&#8217;s
automotive software business because Ford is by far its biggest
customer, said Gartner&#8217;s Koslowski. Microsoft also has software
in Kia Motors Corp., Fiat SpA models, Nissan and BMW models,
according to its website. Getting into the Ford system will
expand QNX&#8217;s industry leading position for automotive
entertainment operating systems, which Koslowski said he
estimates is as high as 70 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I look at this right now as a funeral ceremony for the
Microsoft automotive operating system, this is last rites in a
lot of ways,&#8221; said Guggenheim&#8217;s Stover, who rates Ford the
equivalent of a hold. Microsoft struggled because the economics
of what they were trying to do with cars &#8220;are totally
different&#8221;  than computers and smartphones, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operating system in the car entertainment system has
become more of a commodity, and now added functions are more
important, Koslowski said. QNX has done a better job of
integrating compatibility with other operating systems such as
those from Apple, Google and included emerging Internet
standards, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You have to look at it more from a perspective of how
much functionality do I get for what price and really move your
investment budgets to other areas that become much more
strategic for creating differentiation,&#8221; Koslowski said. &#8220;The
industry is realizing it has to do a better job to create a
unique experience for its customers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s pneumonia vaccine met
the goals of a study that was required by U.S. regulators when
the therapy was approved for patients at least 50 years old. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clinical trial called Capita showed the vaccine worked
against a first episode of vaccine-type community-acquired
pneumonia in patients 65 and older, Pfizer said today in a
statement. The Food and Drug Administration approved Prevnar 13
for adults 50 and older in December 2011 on an accelerated basis
with the condition the New York company prove the shot protects
against pneumonia in post-clearance studies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vaccine is expected to generate $4.4 billion in revenue
this year, according to the average of three analysts&#8217; estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Prevnar 13 competes with Merck  Co.&#8217;s
Pneumovax 23, approved about 30 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vaccine&#8217;s use in adults is expected to contribute $1
billion to sales, Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst with ISI Group,
said in a note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer rose 1.7 percent to $31.99 at the close in New York.
The company has gained 17 percent in the past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA approval was based on studies that showed patients
taking Prevnar 13 had comparable or higher antibody levels than
those taking Pneumovax 23. The results indicated the vaccine was
reasonably likely to produce clinical benefit, which is what
Pfizer sought to prove in the Capita trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer plans to share detailed results from the trial at a
conference in India on March 12, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prevnar 13 was approved in the U.S. in 2010 for children 6
weeks to 5 years old. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) is expanding its cloud services to lure customers to its
SoftLayer Technologies Inc. business, which it&#8217;s counting on to
help reverse seven quarters of falling sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is making it easier for developers to build and adjust
applications in the cloud, where information is delivered online
instead of stored on local servers, said Danny Sabbah, chief
technology officer of IBM&#8217;s Next Generation Platform. The
Armonk, New York-based company plans to spend more than $1
billion on cloud-software development through 2015, a double-digit percentage increase from the past two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move increases IBM&#8217;s bet on SoftLayer after acquiring
the company for $2 billion last year and committing $1.2 billion
in January to add 15 new data centers. As customers rely on the
cloud rather than buying their own servers, a slump in hardware
demand has contributed to IBM&#8217;s declining revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is crucial to expanding the potential audience and
helping them get benefit and value from using SoftLayer,&#8221;
Sabbah said in an interview. &#8220;This is not just about IBM&#8217;s
conventional enterprise customers. There will be a lot of
emerging companies in different areas.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move underscores SoftLayer&#8217;s position as one of IBM&#8217;s
biggest gambles as it faces off with competitors such as
Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) in cloud services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Big Bet &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price IBM paid to acquire Dallas-based SoftLayer last
year was the biggest it has disclosed for a takeover since the
purchase of software company Lotus Development Corp. in 1995,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. SoftLayer is becoming
the backbone for IBM&#8217;s cloud business as the company wound down
its legacy SmartCloud Enterprise product this year, Lance Crosby, chief executive officer of SoftLayer, said in an
interview last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is making these new capabilities available for
SoftLayer in hopes of attracting customers in different
industries than the typical bank and insurance clients that use
its cloud products at the moment, Sabbah said. One new addition
is an open-source enterprise software portfolio called BlueMix,
a platform-as-a-service that aims to help developers build
applications on its cloud infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The service would rival existing platform-as-a-service
products like Amazon&#8217;s AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku Inc.&#8217;s
development platform and Red Hat Inc.&#8217;s OpenShift. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has agreed to acquire Cloudant Inc., a cloud-delivered
database company, whose services will be offered in the BlueMix
portfolio, the company said today in a statement. Financial
terms weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Watson Services &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SoftLayer will also gain middleware offerings, including
WebSphere, to let apps be installed on hybrid clouds, which can
access data both onsite and offsite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM also said last month that it would create a new
business division around its Watson technology, which can
analyze large volumes of data and answer questions in
conversational language. IBM will invest more than $1 billion in
the unit and give it a headquarters in New York. Watson&#8217;s big-data services, which let customers mine vast troves of
information, will be run on SoftLayer&#8217;s cloud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM will integrate its Power Systems servers into
SoftLayer&#8217;s cloud to help support Watson and will make it
available in the second quarter of this year, said Robert Leblanc, senior vice president of software and cloud solutions
at IBM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve been shifting resources for a number of years into
this space,&#8221; Leblanc, said in an interview. &#8220;The $1 billion is
additional investment over the next two years to continue down
that path and bring even more services out to the cloud.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. says investors
should buy record-low yielding sukuk from Dubai-based port
operator DP World Ltd. (DPW) and Jebel Ali Free Zone Authority FZE
before credit ratings improve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on DP World&#8217;s $1.5 billion Islamic bonds due July
2017 slid 61 basis points this year to 2.6 percent at 2:22 p.m.
in Dubai, the lowest level since they were sold in 2007. The
yield on Jafza&#8217;s sukuk maturing two years later fell 32 basis
points. Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings, which rate
DP World the lowest investment grade and business-park operator
Jafza junk, could raise both in 2014, JPMorgan said in a note
Feb. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dubai issuers are benefiting from an economic resurgence in
the Gulf business hub that&#8217;s boosting balance sheets, driving
funding costs lower and helping companies pay debt early. Emaar
Properties PJSC&#8217;s Islamic bond yields fell the most in more than
four months after the emirate&#8217;s biggest developer was raised by
Standard  Poor&#8217;s Feb. 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue seeing tangible credit momentum in Dubai&#8221;
almost without exception, Zafar Nazim, a credit analyst at
JPMorgan Securities Ltd., said by phone Feb. 20. Companies are
paying off debt backed by &#8220;strong cash flows,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deep-Sea Port &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DP World lowered its net leverage by more than half since
its last upgrade three years ago, according to JPMorgan. At the
same time it invested in projects including London Gateway, a
new deep-sea port in the U.K. Jafza was raised to two steps
below investment grade by Moody&#8217;s in October after making
progress in reducing debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Jafza may not get to investment grade but they&#8217;re on
course for an upgrade with Moody&#8217;s given their deleveraging
trajectory,&#8221; Nazim said. &#8220;DP World was last upgraded in 2011
using 2010 numbers. Back in 2010 the world was still going
through a tight spot.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s said yesterday it doesn&#8217;t comment on speculation
regarding future rating actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sukuk were among securities caught up in a developing
markets selloff last year when the U.S. said it would reduce its
$85 billion per-month bond-purchasing program. The yield on
Jafza&#8217;s debt climbed to as high as 5.84 percent June 26, while
that on DP World&#8217;s notes rose to 4.9 percent a day earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Another Bubble&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three main risks for the bonds, according to
Richard Segal, London-based head of international credit
strategy at Jeffries International Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields could rise if &#8220;the U.S. Treasury (USGG10YR) market sells off
sharply again&#8221; or if &#8220;risk perceptions elsewhere in emerging
markets settle down and flight to quality flows reverse,&#8221; he
said by e-mail Feb. 20. Segal sees a third risk if &#8220;investors
begin to consider the possibility of another bubble in the
United Arab Emirates,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, many feel equities are more expensive than fixed
income, so this is less of a near-term risk, Segal said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing liquidity is another factor acting in DP World and
Jafza&#8217;s favor, Nazim said, as investors seek a place to put
their money. Sukuk sales from Dubai slowed this year, with $300
million raised compared with $750 million in the year-earlier
period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic bond sales in the emirate are expected to increase
as Dubai invests more than $8 billion preparing to host the
World Expo in 2020 and as $30 billion of debt comes due this
year. The sheikhdom, one of seven that make up the U.A.E., has a
stated ambition to become capital of the world&#8217;s Islamic economy
within three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dubai expects economic growth to average 4.6 percent,
between 2012 and 2015, more than twice the pace as in the prior
four years. Amid the growth, property prices and trade are
soaring, helping Emaar, the operator of the world&#8217;s largest
mall, to regain the investment grade rating lost in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upgrades will ensure that &#8220;regional investors will get
more comfortable,&#8221; Nazim said. &#8220;You don&#8217;t need too many to
push the bonds tighter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan, the world&#8217;s second-largest
solar market, saw domestic shipments of cells and modules double
in the fiscal third quarter as developers took advantage of
government incentives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local shipments totaled 2,043 megawatts in the three months
through December, compared with 1,003 megawatts a year earlier,
the Japan Photovoltaic Energy Association said in a statement.
Exports fell to 15 megawatts from 111 megawatts as growth in the
Japanese market outpaced that in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country&#8217;s solar industry is expanding after the
government introduced subsidies for clean-energy developments,
which also include wind, geothermal, hydropower and biomass, in
July 2012. Japan added the most solar capacity after China last
year, according to researcher Bloomberg New Energy Finance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese suppliers accounted for 70 percent of all modules
shipped domestically last quarter, including 541 megawatts
produced at plants abroad, the statement shows. Forty companies
including Sharp Corp. and Panasonic Corp. (6752) contributed data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) started an online
movie service, Disney Movies Anywhere, with Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iTunes
to increase sales of films such as &#8220;Toy Story&#8221; that can be
stored in Web-based accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Movies can be played on Apple&#8217;s iPad, iPhone and iPod
Touch, as well as through the Internet, Burbank, California-based Disney said today in a statement. Users will be able to
link to iTunes and import films they&#8217;ve previously purchased
there to Disney Movies Anywhere accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The service underscores a longstanding TV and film alliance
between Disney, the world&#8217;s largest entertainment company, and
Apple. Disney&#8217;s ABC television programs were the first to appear
on iTunes in 2005, and former Apple Chief Executive Officer
Steve Jobs sat on Disney&#8217;s board. Both companies stayed out of a
movie-industry initiative called Ultraviolet, meant to let users
buy movies from any studio or retailer and store them in a
cloud-based library. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Disney Movies Anywhere could stabilize Disney&#8217;s home-entertainment business, which has experienced lower results for
five consecutive years,&#8221; Drew Crum, an analyst with Stifel
Nicolaus  Co., said in a report. He recommends buying Disney
stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney fell 0.6 percent to $80.21 at the close in New York.
The shares have advanced 5 percent in 2014, while the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 Index is little changed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Movie studios have been struggling with a decline in DVD
sales since the mid-2000s, when home-video revenue accounted for
more than two-thirds of film-industry sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Changing Habits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audiences at home have turned to subscription services such
as Netflix Inc., or one-time movie rentals, available on iTunes,
Amazon.com, or through their pay-TV provider. These transactions
provide smaller profit margins to the studios. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of DVD and Blu-ray discs fell 8.1 percent to $7.8
billion in the U.S. last year, according to the industry&#8217;s
Digital Entertainment Group, while electronic sales advanced 47
percent to $1.19 billion. Total sales declined 3.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subscription streaming advanced 32 percent to $3.16
billion. Total home-video spending increased 0.7 percent to
$18.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Enrique Pena Nieto ran for
president in 2012, opponents nicknamed him the Televisa
candidate for what they described as favorable coverage from
Mexico&#8217;s largest broadcaster. Now as president he&#8217;s pushing for
more competition that will hurt Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO)&#8217;s revenue
growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a move that surprised the industry for its speed and
resolve, Pena Nieto last week persuaded the Supreme Court to
revoke a lower court&#8217;s injunction suspending regulatory measures
against Televisa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pena Nieto&#8217;s action may signal that a Mexican business
tactic of delaying regulatory decisions with court injunctions
is losing its effectiveness. At stake for Televisa is the
revenue it has said it will forgo if it&#8217;s unable to license its
programming to pay-TV companies for a fee. The company said the
current situation aids Dish Mexico, which competes with
Televisa&#8217;s own Sky satellite unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This was a wake-up call for Televisa, for the regulator
to say, &#8216;We count with the backing of the presidential
office,&#8217;&#8221; Gabriel Sosa Plata, a media and telecommunications
professor at Mexico City&#8217;s Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana,
said in a phone interview. &#8220;In Mexico, litigation has the
objective to lengthen decisions. The longer it goes, the fewer
decisions are made -- and they wanted to delay this decision.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike Mayo, the analyst who sparred
at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s 2013 investor day with Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon, challenged the bank at today&#8217;s event about
the logic of holding an asset-management business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayo, an analyst at CLSA Ltd., asked Mary Erdoes, CEO of
JPMorgan&#8217;s asset manager, how it feels to be &#8220;trapped&#8221; in a
bank that he estimates is valued at about 40 percent less than
companies in her business, based on price-to-earnings ratios. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You would probably be worth a lot more as a standalone,&#8221;
Mayo said. &#8220;How does it feel to be a 17 P-E business trapped in
a 10 P-E company?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon has said clients benefit from the array of services
provided by his New York-based company. JPMorgan is the largest
U.S. bank, and today&#8217;s session featured presentations by
commercial, retail and investment bankers, along with Erdoes,
who oversees more than $2 trillion. She said her unit helps
JPMorgan meet &#8220;holistic needs&#8221; of customers, and that the
valuation hasn&#8217;t hurt compensation of top money managers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We work very hard to deliver the whole company to the
clients,&#8221; Erdoes said today. &#8220;Someday we believe that all the
value of this part of the business will be reflected in the
stock price.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has advanced 20 percent in the past 12 months,
beating the 14 percent gain of T. Rowe Price Group Inc. (TROW), while
trailing BlackRock Inc. (BLK)&#8217;s 27 percent rally. JPMorgan trades for
about 8.6 times reported earnings, less than half the ratio at
BlackRock, the world&#8217;s largest money manager, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The stock has done fine as a competitive matter, against
most major competitors,&#8221; Dimon told Mayo today. &#8220;More than
fine, which you&#8217;ve noted yourself in some of your analyst
reports.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Morgan Stanley &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July 2012, Mayo said Morgan Stanley (MS) would be worth as
much as $32 if the firm were broken up. The bank, which didn&#8217;t
heed his call, has since more than doubled to $29.71 at 4 p.m.
in New York. The gain was fueled by improved profitability at
its brokerage unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayo asked Dimon at last year&#8217;s gathering if clients might
shift to banks with the highest capital ratios, citing UBS AG as
one company that could seek to win business from JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon countered, &#8220;so you would go to UBS&#8221; rather than
JPMorgan? &#8220;I didn&#8217;t say that,&#8221; Mayo responded. &#8220;I said that
was their argument.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m richer than you,&#8221; Dimon said, drawing
laughter from the audience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the lender
whose legal and regulatory battles led to more than $23 billion
in settlements in 2013, said Chief Compliance Officer Cindy Armine left to join another firm after a year on the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lou Rauchenberger, the chief administrative officer of the
corporate and investment bank, was named as interim replacement,
according to a staff memo from Chief Operating Officer Matt Zames obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The departure was reported earlier today by the Wall Street
Journal, which said Armine is moving to First Data Corp., the
payment processor run by former JPMorgan executive Frank Bisignano. He left JPMorgan last year when Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon named Zames sole chief operating officer at
the bank. Bisignano hired JPMorgan&#8217;s former Chief Information
Officer Guy Chiarello as president last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has clashed with regulators and law enforcement
officials over accusations that it misled buyers of mortgage
bonds, rigged markets and overlooked suspicious activity by
clients. The company agreed last month to pay $2.6 billion to
settle allegations that it ignored signs of wrongdoing in
Bernard Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As Jamie and our leadership team have said, controls and
compliance are our most important priority,&#8221; Zames wrote. &#8220;We
have made great progress over the past few years on our controls
agenda, and we will continue to focus on it relentlessly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managers will seek to &#8220;ensure a fortress compliance and
control environment,&#8221; according to a slide show today at an
annual presentation for investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armine joined the firm in May 2011 as chief control officer
of home lending after 31 years at Citigroup Inc., where she was
chief compliance officer. She was promoted to JPMorgan&#8217;s head of
compliance in January 2013. Attempts to reach Armine for comment
weren&#8217;t immediately successful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) said the bank

higher rates boost interest margins and the firm cuts 5,500 more

investor day. The bank now plans to eliminate about 8,000 jobs
in consumer and mortgage banking this year as demand wanes for
refinancings. Hiring in areas such as compliance and risk
management will offset some of the cuts, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managers led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon are
laying out strategy at the biggest U.S. bank by assets after a
year marred by clashes with regulators and $23 billion in legal
costs. Dimon, 57, is seeking to accelerate growth and trim
unwanted units while fending off allegations that the firm
misled buyers of mortgage bonds, rigged markets and ignored
suspicious activity by clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We now have clarity on most of the regulatory rules, and
we believe that we, more than others, will successfully adapt to
the new financial architecture and will emerge where we started
-- with best-in-class margins and returns,&#8221; Chief Financial
Officer Marianne Lake said at the investor conference. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orange SA (ORA), France&#8217;s largest phone
company, said today it&#8217;s in talks with Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) about
selling a minority stake in its online-video service
Dailymotion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operator, whose attempt to sell Dailymotion to Yahoo!
Inc. last year was blocked, has been searching for a partner to
help expand the smaller YouTube rival outside Europe. Orange
wants to retain a majority stake in Dailymotion and no agreement
has been reached at this point, spokeswoman Heloise Rothenbuhler
said, confirming comments by Chief Executive Officer Stephane Richard reported in Le Monde. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange is also holding talks with Singapore
Telecommunications Ltd. and Vivendi SA&#8217;s cable-TV unit Canal
Plus, the Wall Street Journal reported today. Rothenbuhler
declined to comment about that report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo neared an agreement to buy a stake in Dailymotion
last May. Talks were interrupted when the French government,
which owns about 27 percent of Orange, vetoed the sale. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.K. Home Secretary Theresa May
should set up a new &#8220;premium&#8221; route for wealthy investors,
with 100 visas a year auctioned off at a reserve price of 2.5
million pounds ($4.2 million), an advisory panel recommended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Migration Advisory Committee, which is made up of five
independent economists and a representative of the Commission
for Employment and Skills, proposed replacing the current so-called &#8220;higher investor routes&#8221; that require investments of 5
million pounds and 10 million pounds as they are &#8220;hugely
underused.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have focused our attention on how U.K. residents may
gain from this migration route; we express some healthy
skepticism regarding the value to U.K. residents of high net
worth individuals coming to the U.K.,&#8221; the panel&#8217;s chairman,
David Metcalf, told reporters in London today. &#8220;When people
say: &#8217;Isn&#8217;t it awful to sell visas?&#8217; -- it&#8217;s better than giving
them away, which is what we are doing now.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The committee also recommended the government improves
incentives for foreign investors to buy into financial
instruments other than government bonds. Options include
infrastructure bonds to improve roads or other amenities,
Metcalf said. Venture capital projects should also be
considered, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new premium route would benefit from relaxed residency
requirements, halving to 90 days a year the amount of time an
individual has to remain resident in the U.K. It would lead to
the settlement of individuals, not U.K. citizenship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The auction of premium route visas would be conducted via
sealed offers, with a bid of 2.5 million pounds comprised of an
investment of 2 million pounds by the applicant plus a gift of
500,000 pounds donated to the government, designed to be given
to philanthropic causes such as charities &#8220;or basketball
courts,&#8221; Metcalf said. The market may settle on a higher price
for the visas, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel also recommended doubling the minimum threshold
for investors on &#8220;standard route&#8221; visas to 2 million pounds,
uprating a price that has not changed since 1994. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May would need to accept the panel&#8217;s advice before the
changes could be introduced. The Home Office did not have an
immediate response to the recommendations when contacted by
phone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) hardware group chief
Julie Larson-Green will move to the software maker&#8217;s
applications and services unit in the first executive shift by
Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella since he took
over earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As chief experience officer, she&#8217;ll be responsible for
&#8220;modern digital experiences regardless of device,&#8221; Larson-Green wrote in an e-mail yesterday, obtained by Bloomberg News.
Larson-Green will switch to the new role once former Nokia Oyj
CEO Stephen Elop returns to Microsoft to lead the company&#8217;s
hardware efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larson-Green, who started at Microsoft 21 years ago, had
been put in charge of all hardware in a sweeping reorganization
in July. That group is responsible for Xbox and the company&#8217;s
push into gadgets such as tablets, which so far is faltering as
consumers and businesses shun the company&#8217;s Surface computer in
favor of the iPad from Apple Inc. and mobile machines from
Samsung Electronics Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dawn Beauparlant, a spokeswoman for Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, confirmed the e-mail&#8217;s authenticity and Larson-Green&#8217;s new job title. She declined to comment further and said
Larson-Green wasn&#8217;t available for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said in September that Larson-Green, who led a
design overhaul of both Office and Windows, would be superseded
as leader of the unit that makes Xboxes and video games by Elop
when the $7.2 billion acquisition of the Nokia handset unit
closes and joins Microsoft&#8217;s hardware unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nadella was appointed CEO earlier this month after a five-month search, charged with speeding up a turnaround at the
world&#8217;s biggest software maker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larson-Green&#8217;s move was reported earlier by GeekWire. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, adopted a new disclosure form for its
prepaid card to provide greater clarity on fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disclosure, based on a model released by Pew Charitable
Trusts, gives customers a description of fees and when deposits
are available in an easy-to-read format, the New York-based bank
said today in a statement. Pew is a Washington-based non-profit
research firm specializing in trends and public attitudes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government agencies including the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau are pushing financial firms to make their
retail products easier to understand. The amount loaded onto
prepaid cards by U.S. consumers more than doubled in 2012 to $64
billion from 2009, according to Pew&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This disclosure box should be required by the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau for all general purpose reloadable
prepaid cards,&#8221; Susan Weinstock, director of Pew&#8217;s safe
checking research, said on the trust&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samuel Gilford, spokesman for the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to inquiries about
the Pew standard. U.S. Senator Mark R. Warner, a Virginia
Democrat on the Banking Committee, has introduced legislation
requiring financial institutions to be more upfront with prepaid
cards. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) were among 18 financial firms that agreed to stop participating in some surveys of analyst sentiment while New York investigates early access to the information. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The firms will stop answering analyst surveys by &#8220;certain elite, technologically sophisticated clients&#8221; seeking to use the information for trading, according to New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. The interim pacts are part of efforts to combat advantages secured by investors that get to see potentially market-moving data before other traders. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Schneiderman requested that the firms stop participating in these surveys while he conducts an industry wide investigation into early access to analyst sentiment. The deals follow an accord last month with BlackRock Inc. (BLK), the world&#8217;s largest asset manager, to end a program in which it systematically surveyed analysts on companies they cover. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Opinion: What Does Eric Schneiderman Know That the Rest of Us Don't?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our markets will only be fair and healthy if everyone plays by the same rules, which is why we will continue to take action against those who provide unfair advantages to elite traders at the expense of the rest of us,&#8221; Schneiderman said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors who have been pouring
money into funds that purchase leveraged loans need to be wary
of a reversal in demand, according to Justin Gmelich, the head
of credit trading at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s been a bit of a one-way freight train,&#8221; Gmelich
said in a question and answer session, posted on the company&#8217;s
website yesterday. &#8220;I would just caution those that are
involved in the loan space to be mindful of the fact that
they&#8217;ve been beneficiaries of inflows for 88 straight weeks and
the tide can turn.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The floating-rate debt, which offers a shield for investors
from rising rates, has seen unprecedented demand with the funds
that purchase the debt receiving deposits every single week
since the summer of 2012. That enabled speculative-grade
companies to raise $676 billion last year of bank debt, with
more than 80 percent of that used to escape maturing debt
deadlines, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leveraged loans in the U.S. have returned 1.2 percent this
year, after gains of 5.3 percent in 2013, according to the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s/LSTA Leveraged Loan index. Loans, which are
ranked higher up in the capital structure than junk bonds in
case of a bankruptcy, are better protected from rising interest
rates since they are generally pegged to floating-rate
benchmarks. The value of a fixed-rate security diminishes with
an increase in rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rate Protection &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Folks have been shrewd enough to try to protect against
some of the rate shock,&#8221; Gmelich said. &#8220;When you see fund
flows reverse, irrespective of whether or not the credit quality
is good, you see a risk retracement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retail inflow into loan mutual funds exceeded $63 billion
last year and have already netted $4.6 billion this year,
according to a Feb. 20 report from Bank of America Corp.
Companies have been able to find willing lenders as the assets
managed by mutual funds investing in the debt swelled to more
than $150 billion from about $70 billion at the start of last
year, according to data from the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leveraged loans and high-yield, high-risk, or junk, bonds
are rated below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and lower than
BBB- at SP. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) is encouraging software developers to build applications
on its artificial-intelligence system Watson, looking to data
analytics to help reverse falling revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM will host a mobile developer challenge that urges
programmers to create consumer and business apps powered by
Watson, Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty said in a speech
today at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. In three
months, the company will choose three prototypes to receive
design consulting and support to develop commercial apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has been increasing its investment in Watson as the
Armonk, New York-based company works to show clients the value
of the technology, which analyzes troves of data and can answer
questions in conversational language. The company said in
January that it will spend $1 billion to create a new division
around Watson to help spur growth after seven consecutive
quarters of declining revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You run a business today and you reinvent it for the
future at the same time,&#8221; Rometty said. &#8220;You go through these
transitions. If you try to compare today to the past, today the
speed is much faster.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As sluggish demand for computer hardware has hurt sales,
IBM has focused on more profitable, faster-growing areas such as
data analytics and cloud computing, and the company has also
sold hardware businesses. Watson and other big-data services
were the company&#8217;s primary focus in 2013, Rometty said in March.
Last year, IBM boosted its expected sales from the data-analysis
business to $20 billion in 2015, compared with an earlier
forecast of $16 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S. lender, is moving about 2,000 employees to offices in Brooklyn&#8217;s MetroTech Center after a review of its real estate holdings, said a person with direct knowledge of the plan. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The biggest single source of employees heading to Brooklyn by year-end is 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza, the 60-story lower Manhattan skyscraper the bank sold to Shanghai-based Fosun International Ltd. (656) in 2013, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the move isn&#8217;t public. The employees are from several of the bank&#8217;s business lines, the person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is consolidating its real estate as it pushes to trim expenses and simplify itself by exiting businesses including student lending and private equity. Offices in and near downtown Brooklyn, where MetroTech Center is located, are among the most in demand in the city, in particular drawing young technology and social-media companies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If JPMorgan follows through with its plans, it will show that the market also can appeal to traditional financial firms while it tries to attract and retain young talent, said Tucker Reed, president of the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership, a group representing local businesses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Were they to come, it would be a validation of our office market here,&#8221; Reed said in a telephone interview. &#8220;The only drawback, if you can call it that, would be the challenge it creates. It means there would be even less office space for us to grow into. It makes our space dilemma a little more acute, but that&#8217;s a good problem to have.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tightest Market &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brooklyn&#8217;s 15.5 million square feet (1.4 million square meters) of offices are more than 96 percent occupied, data from CBRE Group Inc. show. By comparison, Manhattan&#8217;s tightest office market -- the area roughly from 30th to Canal streets, known as midtown south -- has a 93 percent occupancy rate, according to the real estate services firm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;MetroTech Center is a 3.7 million-square-foot office campus close to the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges. JPMorgan owns two buildings at the complex. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another group of Chase Plaza-based staff members is bound for the bank&#8217;s offices at the Newport office complex on Washington Street in Jersey City, New Jersey, the person said. The transfers started in December and will continue throughout 2014, according to the person. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lender intends to keep about 300,000 to 400,000 square feet of offices at Chase Plaza, the person said. JPMorgan occupied about half the space in the 2.2 million-square-foot tower, according to data from CoStar Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re continually looking at ways to ensure that our space and occupancy strategy aligns with the ever-evolving needs of our business,&#8221; Melissa Shuffield, a spokeswoman for the bank, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;MetroTech Space &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;As recently as 2012, JPMorgan considered giving up at least some of its offices at MetroTech, listing about 700,000 square feet for rent, according to the person. After floods from Hurricane Sandy damaged bank offices at 4 New York Plaza, another downtown Manhattan tower, displaced workers were moved temporarily into the Brooklyn space. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan owns 4 MetroTech Center, with about 1.35 million square feet, and 3 MetroTech Center, according to Mrofficespace.com, a website that tracks New York office buildings. The other six buildings at the office park are owned by Forest City Ratner Cos., which started building MetroTech in the late 1980s. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 16-acre (6.5-hectare) campus was Brooklyn&#8217;s first modern office development, built in partnership with the New York City government. Many of its earlier tenants have been financial firms, including Bank of New York and Bear Stearns Cos., which used the properties for back-office operations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In recent years, the complex has attracted technology and media companies such as MakerBot Industries LLC, a developer of three-dimensional printers; and ImpreMedia LLC, which publishes Hispanic newspapers including New York&#8217;s El Diario La Prensa. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Downtown Brooklyn has now become a very diverse ecosystem of varied companies that are more reflective of all of Brooklyn and all of New York City,&#8221; said Ali Esmaeilzadeh, vice president of commercial development and leasing at Forest City Ratner. &#8220;There&#8217;s still the presence of government and back-office, there&#8217;s also a surge in technology-based firms, entrepreneurial-type companies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: David M.

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) will film a live-action series for Netflix Inc. (NFLX) with Marvel superheroes in New
York City, the biggest production commitment in state history,
Governor Andrew Cuomo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuomo, who announced the deal today in Manhattan, is
providing incentives valued at about $4 million, said an aide,
who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details
aren&#8217;t public. In November, Disney agreed to create four
television series for Netflix using Marvel characters such as
Daredevil, adding to the online-streaming video service&#8217;s
growing lineup of orginal content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;New York is where the entertainment industry started, and
this unprecedented commitment from Disney and Marvel is further
evidence that we&#8217;re bringing it back bigger and better than ever
before,&#8221; Cuomo said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;The competition
for these projects is fierce.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s Marvel TV will start bringing the shows to Netflix
in 2015, according to a November statement. They will focus on
heroes battling villains in New York&#8217;s Hell&#8217;s Kitchen. Netflix
committed to a minimum of four 13-episode series, culminating in
the miniseries &#8220;The Defenders.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix, based in Los Gatos, California, is gaining more
Disney content following an agreement in 2012 for rights to show
movies including Marvel, Pixar and Lucasfilm titles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our Marvel series for Netflix will inject millions
directly into the local economy and create hundreds of new
jobs,&#8221; said Robert Iger, chief executive officer of Burbank,
California-based Disney, in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported the deal earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;

serve California&#8217;s Gold Rush pioneers, will be &#8220;a major
investment bank&#8221; within five years, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, 57, guided JPMorgan through the financial crisis
without posting a quarterly loss and expanded the firm by
acquiring rivals that faltered. As the company grappled with
costs from government probes last year, its profit was surpassed
by Wells Fargo, the fourth-biggest U.S. lender, which relies
most on retail banking and mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My operating assumption has always been and always will
be that we are going to have huge, tough competition from
Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo to some new entrants,&#8221; Dimon
said. &#8220;Wells Fargo will be in our business. I have enormous
respect for them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo, led by CEO John Stumpf, 60, has been expanding
its securities unit. The lender opened trading floors in 2012 in
Charlotte, North Carolina, bolstering a securities business
acquired with the purchase of Wachovia Corp. four years earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;They&#8217;re Huge&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICBC (1398), based in Beijing, is seeking to triple earnings from
outside its home country by 2016. China&#8217;s biggest financial
firms are &#8220;ambitious&#8221; and have &#8220;strategic reason to win,&#8221;
Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re huge, their clients are huge,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
expect very large, tough Chinese competitors all around the
world.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan generated $26.6 billion of revenue from corporate
advisory, underwriting and trading in 2013, the most of any
global investment bank, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the major U.S. bank most reliant on
trading, had $34.2 billion in total revenue, including other
businesses such as asset management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California technology companies are delving into electronic
payments. Google (GOOG), based in Mountain View, created Wallet, a
program that lets users make transactions in stores and online
with their smartphones. Cupertino-based Apple Inc., which has
more than 400 million credit cards on file with its iTunes
Store, is exploring an expansion of its mobile-payments system,
a person with knowledge of the matter said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;EBay&#8217;s PayPal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EBay Inc.&#8217;s PayPal unit is a leading online payments
system, which accounts for 40 percent of the San Jose-based
company&#8217;s revenue and has 143 million active users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology companies &#8220;all want to eat our lunch,&#8221; Dimon
said. &#8220;I mean every single one of them, and they&#8217;re going to
try.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon may be overstating his firm&#8217;s vulnerability to blunt
criticism of its size, said Erik Gordon, a business professor at
the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. JPMorgan is the biggest
U.S. bank by assets and the country&#8217;s largest credit-card
lender. It counts 80 percent of the Fortune 500 as clients,
according to presentations at yesterday&#8217;s meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He&#8217;s downplaying the fact that at the end of the day,
JPMorgan is probably as powerful as any financial institution,
including going back to the original JPMorgan,&#8221; Gordon said in
a telephone interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s his way of saying, &#8216;Don&#8217;t be
afraid of us and how big we are.&#8217; My guess is that he doesn&#8217;t
really go home at night and worry about Wells Fargo.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cutting Jobs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon&#8217;s comments on long-term threats came near the end of
his company&#8217;s annual investor meeting. The bank can increase
profit by 50 percent to $27 billion in four to five years as
higher rates boost interest margins and legal costs subside,
according to presentations posted yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank also said it would eliminate about 8,000 jobs in
consumer and mortgage banking this year, while hiring in areas
such as compliance and risk management. Dimon said he will stick
with home lending, after calling mortgages &#8220;the most painful
business ever.&#8221; The loans fill a key need for consumers, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan slipped 0.6 percent to $56.67 at 9:44 a.m. in New
York after dropping 1.7 percent yesterday. It has gained 19
percent in the past 12 months, trailing the 24 percent advance
of the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Financials Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading revenue dropped about 15 percent so far this year
compared with the same period in 2013, Dimon said yesterday.
Lower levels of client activity, especially in fixed income,
pressured results, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Dog Days&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s earnings last year were marred by clashes with
regulators and $23 billion in legal settlements that contributed
to the bank&#8217;s first quarterly loss under Dimon. The CEO is
selling or closing businesses he considers risky and dropping
non-U.S. clients who may invite regulatory scrutiny. He&#8217;s
fending off allegations the firm rigged markets and ignored
suspicious activity by clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s meeting concluded on an upbeat note, with a
song from English rock band Florence + the Machine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The dog days are over,&#8221; the lyrics blared from speakers.
&#8220;The dog days are done.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe Ltd.&#8217;s pledge to reduce
credit-card fees was accepted by European Union regulators in a
settlement that ends an antitrust probe that dates back more
than a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe, operator of the EU&#8217;s largest payment-card
network, will cap so-called interbank fees for processing credit
card payments to 0.3 percent of the value of the transaction for
cross-border and domestic payments in Europe for four years,
from Jan. 1, 2015. The commitment will reduce card charges by 40
percent to 60 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Card fees charged by Visa Europe and MasterCard Inc. have
been probed by European Union regulators since at least 2002.
MasterCard is currently challenging a similar settlement at the
EU&#8217;s highest court, saying such multilateral interchange fees
are crucial for sharing the costs of card payments among banks,
retailers and customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement &#8220;provides legal certainty&#8221; and allows the
company focus on its payment business &#8220;rather than pursuing
lengthy legal cases,&#8221; Nicholas Huss, Visa Europe&#8217;s chief
executive officer, said in an e-mailed statement. Visa Europe
will also make its pricing more transparent to help retailers
compare rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 0.3 percent cap on credit card fees for payments that
customers make in their home nation will be applied after a two-year delay to deter banks switching to cards with higher
charges, the EU said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) began dismissing U.S. workers yesterday, part of a $1
billion restructuring to help the company meet profit goals as
it adapts to shifts in the technology industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workers in New York, Vermont, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri,
Oklahoma and North Carolina were fired yesterday, according to
Alliance@IBM, an employee group. The Armonk, New York-based
company had a headcount of 431,212 at the end of 2013, down 0.7
percent from a year earlier -- its first decline in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is aiming for $20 a share in adjusted earnings by 2015,
up from $11.67 in 2010 -- a target made more difficult by seven
straight quarters of falling revenue. To get there, Chief
Executive Officer Ginni Rometty has fired and furloughed
workers, sold assets, cut IBM&#8217;s tax rate and bought back shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has already begun eliminating positions this
year in Europe, Asia and South America, according to
Alliance@IBM. Worldwide, this year&#8217;s job cuts could lead to the
elimination of at least 13,000 employees, Toni Sacconaghi, an
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co., said in a Feb. 3 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rometty is seeking to transform IBM as clients shift to
storing their data and applications offsite, or in the cloud,
rather than buying their own servers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;IBM continues to rebalance its workforce to meet the
changing requirements of its clients and to pioneer new, high-value segments of the IT industry,&#8221; the company said in a
statement yesterday. At any given time, IBM has more than 3,000
job openings in its growth units, including its cloud business
and nanotechnology, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hudson Valley &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM had agreed to keep high-technology jobs in New York&#8217;s
Hudson Valley through 2016, increasing the number of positions
it has pledged to retain by 750 to 3,100, New York Governor
Andrew Cuomo said this week in a statement. That would restore
the 697 workers fired last year in Dutchess County, where the
company had about 8,000 employees as of 2012, according to the
county government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firings took place yesterday in Endicott and Poughkeepsie,
New York, Alliance@IBM said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The job cuts in New York raise questions about the newly
brokered deal between the company and the state, said
Assemblyman Kieran Lalor, who represents Fishkill, New York.
Fishkill is a town in Dutchess County, where IBM has a
semiconductor chip manufacturing plant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Both the state and IBM have been short on details about
the agreement,&#8221; Lalor said in a letter dated Feb. 27 to Cuomo,
requesting disclosure of how many people IBM employs in New York
and information on the 3,900 jobs not guaranteed under the plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chip Plants &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM also makes semiconductor chips at its plant in
Burlington, Vermont, and servers in Rochester, Minnesota,
according to its website. The company has a delivery center in
Dubuque, Iowa, that was to create as many as 1,300 jobs when it
opened in 2009. The facility provides services including
outsourcing-client support, server-systems operations, security
services, and maintenance of hardware and software, according to
the website. IBM dismissed workers in all three cities, in
addition to Columbia, Missouri; Tulsa, Oklahoma; and the
Raleigh, North Carolina, area, Alliance@IBM said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has already begun eliminating positions this
year in Europe, Asia and South America, according to
Alliance@IBM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Global Restructuring &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the shift in its focus to products like cloud
services and data analytics, the company agreed in January to
sell its low-end server division for $2.3 billion to Lenovo. IBM
said it expects to send more than 7,000 workers to the Chinese
computer maker in the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is focused on finding a joint-venture partner
for its chip-manufacturing business after failing to attract a
buyer for the division, two people with knowledge of the matter
said this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM was little changed at $185.17 at the close of trading
in New York. The shares are up less than 1 percent since the
start of Rometty&#8217;s tenure at the beginning of 2012, compared
with a 48 percent gain for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A $300 million settlement by
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and insurers with homeowners who accused
the bank of taking kickbacks in exchange for sticking them with
overpriced insurance policies was approved by a judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Federico Moreno in Miami today approved
the accord. It requires JPMorgan, Assurant Inc. (AIZ) and other
insurers to pay refunds valued at 12.5 percent of annual premium
costs to homeowners who had certain policies placed on their
properties by the bank starting in January 2008. JPMorgan and
Assurant didn&#8217;t admit wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The homeowners sued New York-based JPMorgan last year,
claiming the bank placed required hazard and wind coverage with
Assurant and other insurers at inflated rates. Some of the
excess costs were kicked back to a JPMorgan unit, the homeowners
alleged in their class-action, or group, lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is among several large banks facing claims by
homeowners that they overcharged mortgage borrowers for lender-placed insurance. Last year, New York-based Assurant agreed to
pay $14 million to resolve similar allegations by the New York
State Department of Financial Services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his ruling, Moreno rejected objections to the settlement
and approved $20 million in fees to lawyers for the class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Saccoccio v. JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 13-cv-21107, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida
(Miami). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Egol, a Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. trader whose desk produced the security that prompted the
Securities and Exchange Commission to sue the firm, has retired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Egol, 44, left the New York-based bank earlier this year,
said Michael DuVally, a company spokesman. He joined the firm in
1998 and was named a managing director in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs paid a then-record $550 million in 2010 to
settle an SEC suit over the marketing of a synthetic
collateralized debt obligation dubbed Abacus 2007-AC1. The firm
created a committee that year to review its business standards
and practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC sued Fabrice Tourre, 35, one of the employees under
Egol, after dropping a plan to file claims against Egol,
according to interviews with SEC enforcement staff conducted by
the agency&#8217;s inspector general. Tourre was found liable in a
jury trial last year in which the SEC claimed he intentionally
misled investors in the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Egol testified in Tourre&#8217;s trial in July that he was &#8220;not
aware of any&#8221; disclosures to investors that Paulson  Co.,
which stood to make money from the failure of the transaction,
helped select the assets underlying it. Egol said Tourre did
tell a superior that the hedge-fund firm run by billionaire John Paulson helped pick the portfolio of 90 subprime mortgage-backed
securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported the departure earlier
today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla Motor Inc. (TSLA)&#8217;s planned battery
factory may consume as much as 17 percent of current lithium
output, easing a forecast oversupply and benefiting producers
like Rockwood Holdings Inc. (ROC), Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The battery plant that Tesla co-founder Elon Musk has
called a &#8220;gigafactory&#8221; could require the equivalent of 15,000
tons to 25,000 tons of lithium carbonate annually at full
capacity, Goldman analysts led by Robert Koort said in a report
today. That estimate exceeds a Feb. 26 Bank of America Corp.
prediction the facility would use 9,000 tons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla today sold $2 billion of convertible notes to fund
the factory intended to lower the cost of lithium-ion batteries
used in its vehicles and for power storage. The increasing
popularity of Tesla&#8217;s electric cars, which use larger battery
packs than competing models, should help narrow the coming
lithium oversupply, Koort wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to see a near-term oversupply scenario as
likely,&#8221; Koort, who rates Rockwood neutral, said in the note.
&#8220;An inflection in pure battery electric vehicles may help ease
oversupply of lithium around 2020.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galaxy Resources Ltd. (GXY)&#8217;s decision not to resume production
in Mt. Cattlin, Australia, also contributes to the tighter
supply outlook, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While companies like FMC Corp. don&#8217;t get a big portion of
earnings from lithium, Rockwood is &#8220;positioning for an electric
vehicle inflection,&#8221; Koort said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rockwood is divesting units to focus on lithium products
and surface treatments. The Princeton, New Jersey-based chemical
maker gained more access to lithium supplies with its December
agreement to form a joint venture with China&#8217;s Chengdu Tianqi
Industry Group Co. to get a stake in Talison Lithium Pty. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) awarded
employees restricted stock worth $2.3 billion for their 2013
performance, the smallest amount in two years as the firm cut
costs by lowering the portion of revenue it set aside for pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm granted 13.8 million restricted shares that vest
over several years, New York-based Goldman Sachs said today in
its annual regulatory filing. The value, down from $2.4 billion
a year earlier, is based on the closing price on Jan. 28, when
senior executives were given their awards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 59, cut
compensation to 37 percent of revenue last year, the second-lowest portion since the firm went public in 1999. That
contributed to a 6 percent increase in net income even as
revenue was little changed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks have been seeking to balance regulatory pressure to
tie awards to long-term performance with shareholders&#8217; desire
for flexibility to cut pay costs if needed. Goldman Sachs Chief
Financial Officer Harvey M. Schwartz, 49, has said the firm is
reluctant to ramp up the amount of pay it defers because it is
&#8220;a bit of mortgaging the future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said about 70 percent of the restricted stock
awards were recognized as expenses immediately. The cost
recorded by the firm is probably lower than the current value of
the shares because the bank accounts for the fact that employees
can&#8217;t immediately sell the shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the world&#8217;s largest brokerage,
gave employees $2.72 billion in deferred awards for 2013
performance, including $1.25 billion of restricted stock and
$1.47 billion of deferred cash. About $100 million of the awards
were expensed in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t disclose any deferred cash awards, and
the firm hasn&#8217;t typically given such bonuses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which more
than doubled the amount it set aside for litigation costs in
2013, said &#8220;reasonably possible&#8221; legal losses beyond those
reserves were $3.6 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure dropped from $4 billion at the end of the third
quarter, while rising from $3.5 billion a year earlier, the New
York-based bank said today in an annual regulatory filing. The
estimate doesn&#8217;t include potential claims from investigations by
the Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group of the
U.S. Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs added some items to its list of activities
that are subject to current regulatory investigations and
reviews, including &#8220;allocations of and trading in fixed-income
securities,&#8221; its financial-advisory services and interactions
between the bank&#8217;s research analysts and third parties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs had $962 million of net provisions for
litigation and regulatory proceedings in 2013, primarily tied to
mortgage-related matters, up from $448 million in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
generated 46 percent of revenue from sales and trading last
year, recorded losses from that business on 27 days in 2013, up
from 16 the previous year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the daily losses exceeded the firm&#8217;s value-at-risk,
an estimate of potential losses with 95 percent confidence, the
New York-based company said today in a filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. Traders made more than $100
million on 34 days, down from 41 days a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s trading revenue fell 15 percent to $16
billion in 2013, excluding accounting charges, as the firm
generated less from bond trading and sold a reinsurance unit
that reported its results in the firm&#8217;s equities segment. The
bank&#8217;s net income climbed 6 percent as Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd C. Blankfein set aside a lower portion of revenue for pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the world&#8217;s biggest brokerage,
reported this week that it lost money in its trading business on
33 days last year, down from 37 in 2012 and the fewest since
2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S. bank, revised its
gauge of market gains and losses to incorporate new regulatory
requirements, resulting in a jump in the frequency of losses
last year. Under the new method, JPMorgan posted gains on 177 of
the 260 trading days in 2013, while the old measurement showed
losses on zero days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wall Street, $3,500 goes further than anyone dared imagine in the 1980s when the predecessor to JPMorgan Chase  Co. charged the fee to trade each non-investment grade loan it sold. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That surcharge remains the same today and helps the biggest U.S. bank dominate the secretive $1.1 trillion junk-loan market while stifling profits for investors and rivals, which mostly stopped charging it years ago. The New York-based bank waives it for exclusive customers: trade with JPMorgan, no fee; trade one of its loans with anyone else, pay up. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan can dictate terms because of its size, according to 12 people with knowledge of the matter who are concerned they&#8217;d jeopardize their business if their identities were revealed. The bank brings more corporate debt to market than anyone, and competitors and investors say they might be shut out of future deals if they don&#8217;t play by JPMorgan&#8217;s rules. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is one of the last frontiers of relatively unregulated, over-the-counter trading between financial giants,&#8221; said Jose Gabilondo, a law professor at Florida International University in Miami who focuses on corporate finance. &#8220;You&#8217;re dealing with a market that doesn&#8217;t have regulated disclosure requirements getting the information out in the market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Riskier Investments &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The issue goes beyond pinched profits for rivals and investors such as pension plans and hedge funds that buy the loans. It&#8217;s also about what may happen when riskier investments lose their appeal. Since the fees make it unprofitable for JPMorgan competitors to trade loans made by the bank, buying and selling the debt may become difficult and put at risk individual investors, who own more of the loans through mutual funds than ever before. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a spokesman for JPMorgan in New York, declined to comment on the bank&#8217;s practice of charging the trading fees or the way in which the charge affects how quickly investors can move in and out of the market. The bank has more than 1,200 predecessor institutions, according to its website, and became JPMorgan Chase in 2000 after J.P. Morgan  Co. merged with Chase Manhattan Corp., which had earlier combined with Chemical Banking Corp. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is at the center of an unprecedented expansion in global corporate debt markets, which have become more popular with investors seeking alternatives to government securities as central banks hold interest rates at record lows to spur growth. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Biggest Underwriter &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The market value of bonds in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Corporate  High Yield Index has soared to $10.5 trillion from $5.15 trillion in 2008. The market for institutional junk-rated loans, given to the most indebted companies, increased to $688.3 billion last year, exceeding the 2007 peak of $596 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan was the biggest underwriter of corporate bonds last year, with a 6.8 percent share of the $3.27 trillion issued, compared with 6.1 percent for No. 2 Bank of America Corp., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was also the top-ranked manager of U.S. syndicated loan sales, the data show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since 2007, JPMorgan&#8217;s assets have grown 55 percent and its customer deposits have risen 74 percent. The bank ranks first in the U.S. in both categories. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Junk loans, also called high-yield or leveraged loans, are a lucrative business for banks at a time when new regulations designed to make the financial system safer are forcing them to cut back on businesses such as trading for their own accounts. Banks have typically earned 1 percent to 5 percent selling pieces of the debt to institutional investors such as pension plans and mutual funds, according to Standard  Poor&#8217;s data. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Banking Behemoth &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;That compares with almost nothing to manage sales of investment-grade loans, given to companies with good credit, and an average 1.3 percent on sales of junk bonds last year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Banks also earn an annual fee from borrowers to handle the paperwork, making sure everyone gets paid what they&#8217;re owed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The $3,500 add-on might seem like a mote of dust on the $2.4 trillion balance sheet of a banking behemoth such as JPMorgan. Still, the fees add up because trades often consist of multiple transactions and JPMorgan charges for each. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, if an investment firm buys a $2 million slice of a loan administered by JPMorgan and then parcels it out to four of its funds, it would be forced to pay $14,000 if a dealer other than JPMorgan brokers the trade. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Additional Inefficiencies&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a nuisance and it creates additional inefficiencies,&#8221; David Breazzano, the president and chief investment officer of Waltham, Massachusetts-based DDJ Capital Management LLC, said in an interview. DDJ manages more than $7 billion in high-yield assets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rivals said they&#8217;re reluctant to trade many deals that JPMorgan helped to originally distribute because it&#8217;s too costly. Rather than finding ways to circumvent the biggest U.S. bank, investors usually give in and trade the debt only with JPMorgan, said the people who requested anonymity. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The rivals said they&#8217;re also concerned that if they don&#8217;t comply, JPMorgan may not give them opportunities to buy new deals the bank brings to market. That would hurt their business because their customers are giving them more cash to invest in high-yield loans than ever before, the people said. Perras, the JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The loans are widely traded. Last year&#8217;s $517 billion of transactions were within $3 billion of the all-time high in 2007, SP and Loan Syndications and Trading Association data show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Financial Burden &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;More plentiful trading has &#8220;dramatically increased the financial burden that assignment fees have imposed,&#8221; said Barry Zamore, the head of U.S. non-distressed, leveraged-loan trading for Credit Suisse Group AG in New York. &#8220;Assignment fees were meant for the manual processes in the year 1995, not 2014.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After the 2008 financial crisis, international rules penalized financial institutions for keeping the loans on their books by requiring them to hold more capital in case the debt goes bad. Banks found ready buyers in an economy distorted by the Federal Reserve&#8217;s near-zero benchmark interest rate. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Leveraged loans have returned 81 percent in the past five years through January, about five times the 16.6 percent return of the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Treasury Index. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Junk loans differ from junk bonds even though many investors buy both. Finance laws drafted after the Great Depression of the 1930s didn&#8217;t consider junk loans to be securities because they were mostly private transactions between one bank and one borrower. Since the government already supervised banks, lawmakers saw no need to double up by regulating their loans, too. Today, banks sell most of the loans to institutions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Relative Darkness &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s impossible to estimate from public regulatory filings how much JPMorgan earns from the fees. Trading data isn&#8217;t available on a loan-specific level. Banks don&#8217;t disclose such detailed earnings, nor are they legally required to. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lack of transparency allows the trading of leveraged loans to go on in relative darkness, said Elisabeth de Fontenay, a Duke Law School professor in Durham, North Carolina, who previously worked as a corporate lawyer at Ropes  Gray LLP. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The leveraged-loan market is at once the most dynamic and the least visible capital market in the U.S., which is exactly how its participants like it,&#8221; de Fontenay said in an academic article presented at the 2013 Law and Society Association conference. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission hasn&#8217;t tried to regulate the loans as securities, such oversight would lead to pressure to lower or eliminate fees, de Fontenay said in a telephone interview this month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Lotus Spreadsheets &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The market will be tested when sentiment deteriorates, she said. It&#8217;s happened before. Prices fell as low as 59.2 cents on the dollar during the 2008 credit crisis, SP and LSTA data show. They hit a high of 98.9 cents on Jan. 17. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s fee is a relic from a time when clerks used Lotus spreadsheets to track transactions and the market for junk loans was less than 2 percent the size it is now. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Loan trades can still take weeks to settle, and until 2012 traders relied on fax machines to place orders. In contrast, junk bonds are increasingly traded electronically and have prices that are publicly reported through Trace, run by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s dominance dates from 1982, when banker James B. Lee Jr. created a loan syndication unit to sell pieces of debt for JPMorgan predecessor Chemical Bank, according to a press release for a New York Public Library event honoring Lee in 2008. Lee is now a JPMorgan vice chairman. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Stopped Charging &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;By 1999, another JPMorgan predecessor, Chase Manhattan, handled 44 percent of the $22 billion of loans to the least creditworthy companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last year, JPMorgan managed the distribution of $133.7 billion of junk-rated loans, the second-biggest share among banks. Bank of America has been the top underwriter since 2008 after combining with Merrill Lynch  Co. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bank of America charges the $3,500 fee to JPMorgan, Royal Bank of Canada and Jefferies Group LLC, according to two people familiar with the trades. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank waives the fee for most of its rivals. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By 2005, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank AG, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and 10 other banks agreed to mostly stop charging each other&#8217;s clients the standard $3,500 fee to trade loans. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Market Impediment &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investors are still protesting 10 years after an August 2004 LSTA survey in which market participants said the surcharges are &#8220;an impediment for the loan market.&#8221; The fee reduced competition, making it cost more to enter and exit the growing market, investors said at the time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;These fees are associated with froth,&#8221; said Gabilondo of Florida International University. &#8220;The bank probably feels that it can skim a little bit off because there&#8217;s some investor on the other side who&#8217;s so willing to hold these that they&#8217;re willing to pay a transaction fee.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mutual funds, whose investors are often quick to buy and sell, account for about 33 percent of the market, according to data from SP and the LSTA. They channeled a record $63 billion into the debt last year, compared with net withdrawals in 2007. Retirees and pensioners are turning to leveraged loans, which pay more when benchmark interest rates rise, instead of junk bonds, which are tied to fixed benchmark rates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yields on junk loans issued this year are an average 5.03 percent, according to SP&#8217;s Capital IQ Leveraged Commentary  Data. That compares with the yield on 10-year Treasury bond of 2.64 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a surprisingly concentrated market,&#8221; said de Fontenay of Duke Law School. &#8220;Right now there&#8217;s so much artificial demand for loans. In the long run it will be an issue.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Lisa Abramowicz in New York at labramowicz@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Bob Ivry at bivry@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feb. 11 (Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Janet

&lt;h2&gt;COLUMNS &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Why Marrying Your Equal Can Boost U.S. Inequality: Peter
Orszag &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feb. 5 (Bloomberg) -- Rich and poor Americans are slowly
but surely staking out separate lives. Increasingly, they have
been moving to different communities, and more and more they are
also marrying people of similar income and educational
backgrounds. This is a phenomenon social scientists call
assortative mating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Credit Suisse CEO Joins Wall Street Clueless Club: Jonathan
Weil &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feb. 27 (Bloomberg) -- One of the best lines to come out of
the financial crisis was by Michael Lewis in a March 2008 column

Post. &lt;/p&gt;

Daily Journal Corp., a small California newspaper publisher. He
also is Warren Buffett&#8217;s longtime business partner and Berkshire
Hathaway Inc.&#8217;s vice chairman. So it&#8217;s understandable why many

Optimism &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feb. 28 (Bloomberg) -- The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index rose
to another record and Treasuries fell amid improving U.S.

Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index rising to a record, as Federal
Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said the central bank may alter its
