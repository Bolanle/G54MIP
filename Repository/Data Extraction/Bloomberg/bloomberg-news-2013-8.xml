&lt;p&gt;Yorkshire Water Services Ltd., a
supplier to more than 1.9 million households in northern
England, is undervalued by a 2 billion-pound ($3 billion) bid
reported in the Sunday Times, RBC Capital Markets LLC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offer from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Allianz SE (ALV) for
a 30 percent stake would represent only a 13 percent premium on
the utility&#8217;s regulatory capital value, John Musk, an analyst at
RBC in London, said today in a note. That &#8220;would appear to be
low for an MA transaction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs plans to make a joint bid with German insurer
Allianz, the London-based Times reported yesterday, without
saying where it got the information. Citigroup Inc. will sell a
17 percent stake and MG Investments will divest its 13 percent
holding, the newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Allianz declined to comment when
Bloomberg News called. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the absence of any concrete details of the bid
package, the implied premium to Yorkshire Water&#8217;s regulated
asset value looks at first glance to be slightly on the thin
side,&#8221; said Ian Elkins, editor of Oxford, England-based
publication Global Water Intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While investors are attracted to the steady revenues that
water assets bring, U.K. utilities are undergoing a regulatory
shift. Industry watchdog Ofwat last month published changes to
the way they can charge customers from 2015 to 2020. These
include separate price controls for wholesale and retail arms to
spur competition in the retail market by allowing non-household
customers to choose suppliers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lower Offer &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pressure on the selling shareholders to offload their
stakes before the price review may prompt the prospective buyers
to offer a lower valuation multiple, Elkins said by e-mail. &#8220;We
expect this deal to be the last sizeable deal in the regulated
water utilities space in the U.K. until after the results of the
next price review are known,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilities have until Dec. 2 to submit their business plans
and Ofwat will make final decisions on prices in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other U.K. water companies have been subject to takeover
talk. The Daily Mail in April said state-owned Abu Dhabi
Investment Authority was considering a bid for Pennon Group Plc (PNN),
while the Times said United Utilities Group Plc (UU/) hired Goldman
Sachs amid speculation of a possible takeover. Severn Trent Plc (SVT)
rejected a takeover offer in June, saying it was too low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The few expected changes to the regulatory regime over
the next few years do not seem to detract from the
attractiveness of stable, long-term returns that water
investments offer investors,&#8221; Andrew Cox, KPMG LLP&#8217;s global
head of energy and natural resources for transactions and
restructuring, said today by e-mail. &#8220;There are a limited
number of such investment opportunities available.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the U.S.
bank that announced plans in April to hire 50 people in Brazil,
has reversed course after the economy expanded less than
analysts estimated and top executives left the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The outlook for the economy and equity and merger-and-acquisition deal volumes are worse than we expected,&#8221; Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the New York-based bank, said in an
interview on Aug. 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s benchmark Ibovespa index has lost 13 percent since
the start of April and more than 20 percent this year. Foreign
banks from Zurich-based UBS AG to London-based Barclays Plc have
been reducing staff in Brazil as the investment-banking business
shrinks and competition from local lenders intensifies. Merger
volume fell to a six-year low this year through July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a quarter of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s roughly 45-person Brazil
investment-banking division have left, people familiar with the
matter said, asking not to be identified because the bank hasn&#8217;t
announced the departures. Five managing directors, four from the
eight-person executive committee, are no longer at the firm, the
people said. All of the executive-committee members have been
replaced, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walter Smith, who won 21 trophies in
two spells as manager of Rangers Football Club, has resigned as
chairman of the Scottish soccer club with immediate effect, the
Glasgow-based club said in a statement to the Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith quit after a period of in-fighting at the club, the
British Broadcasting Corporation said, without saying where it
got the information. Smith, appointed as chairman in May, is
expected to make a statement about his reasons for leaving, the
BBC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith&#8217;s resignation came hours after Chief Executive
Officer Craig Mather said calls for his own departure were ill-timed and ill-informed, the BBC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Green, a former CEO who led the rescue of the club
last year after it went into administration, has returned to the
club as a paid consultant, the BBC said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), which said last
month it plans to get out of the business of owning and trading
physical commodities from metals to oil, bought the over-the-counter commodity derivatives portfolio of UBS AG (UBSN), which is
exiting most of its raw-materials trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction includes on-exchange hedge positions and
excludes precious metals and index-based products, UBS said in
an e-mailed statement today. JPMorgan assumed market risk on the
portfolio and the two banks &#8220;will work together in the coming
months with their clients to fully assign contracts for
individual trades to JPMorgan,&#8221; according to the statement.
JPMorgan spokesman Patrick Burton declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are scaling back or exiting their commodities
operations amid regulatory scrutiny and lower profits from raw
materials. Revenue in commodities at the 10 largest investment
banks fell 25 percent in the first half of the year, analytics
company Coalition said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said last month that it&#8217;s considering an exit from
the business of trading physical commodities, marking a reversal
of its push into raw materials with its 2010 purchase of parts
of RBS Sempra, a joint venture between Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc and Sempra Energy. (SRE) UBS and JPMorgan didn't report the
price of the transaction reported today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zurich-based UBS, Switzerland&#8217;s biggest lender, last year
decided to close its oil, base metals and agriculture trading
desks, a person with direct knowledge of the decision said Oct.
31. The bank is keeping its index-investor products and precious
metals trading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drax (DRX) Group Plc climbed to the highest
level in almost five years in London as Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
added the operator of the largest U.K. coal-fired power station
to its conviction buy list from a neutral rating previously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drax rose as much as 3.8 percent in London to 678.50 pence,
the highest price since Oct. 9, 2008, as Goldman said U.K. plans
to pay low-carbon generators fixed subsidies will boost profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company plans to spend as much as 700 million pounds
($1 billion) turning three of the six units at its site in Selby
to burn biomass by 2016. The first was converted in April, while
Drax plans to convert a second to burning wood chips by the
middle of next year and a third in 2016. It spent 106 million
pounds in the first half on its biomass conversion program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under U.K. plans released in June, power generated from
converted biomass plants may receive 105 pounds a megawatt-hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The new fixed-price subsidies for renewables including
biomass recently published by the government indicate upside
potential profits from the current renewable scheme,&#8221; Goldman
analyst Andrew Meads said in a note. Meads increased his price
estimate by 32 percent to 900 pence, from 684 pence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drax rose 2.7 percent to 671 pence by 2.56 p.m. in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drax last week said first-half profit slumped 22 percent to
120 million pounds after a carbon emissions tax was introduced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will be &#8220;very different&#8221; when it reports its
first-half 2014 earnings, Mead said. By then two of the three
units should have been converted. It will also probably decide
to convert a fourth unit to burn biomass, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world&#8217;s largest
entertainment company, said third-quarter profit was little
changed amid costs to market the box-office disappointment &#8220;The
Lone Ranger&#8221; and shrinking revenue at ABC television. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income rose to $1.85 billion, or $1.01 a share, from
$1.83 billion, or $1.01, a year earlier, Burbank, California-based Disney said today in a statement. Profit came to $1.03 a
share excluding items, compared with the $1.01 average of 30
analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given the number of headwinds we faced, we are very
pleased with the financial results we delivered,&#8221; Chief
Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said on a call with investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney expects to record a loss this quarter of as much as
$190 million on &#8220;The Lone Ranger,&#8221; which cost $225 million to
make and has produced less in worldwide sales. The company&#8217;s
ESPN, AE and domestic children&#8217;s cable channels, along with the
popular theme parks, continue to spur growth for Disney as film
profits slide and the ABC broadcast division struggles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney fell 1.7 percent to $65.88 in extended trading after
results came out. The stock rose 1.6 percent to $67.05 at the
close in New York and has gained 35 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) named Alex Dibelius and Clare Scherrer to new leadership positions at a
unit that provides strategic and financial advice to industrial
clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dibelius was appointed chairman of the global industrials
group and Scherrer co-head, alongside Dusty Philip, according to
an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg News, whose contents were
confirmed by the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, based in New York, is No. 3 in global
industrials deals this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The bank advised on transactions including
Charterhouse Capital Partners LLP&#8217;s sale of German energy-metering business Ista International GmbH to CVC Capital
Partners Ltd. in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scherrer, currently chief operating officer of the global
industrials group, is the third female executive to be promoted
to a management role at the investment bank this year. The
others include Kate Richdale, who was named the head of
investment-banking services in Asia, and Christina Minnis, who
last month was appointed co-head of healthcare Americas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dibelius is currently co-head of the global industrials
group and has overall responsibility for the firm&#8217;s business in
Germany, Austria, and Central and Eastern Europe, the memo says. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank, was sued with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Glencore
Xstrata Plc (GLEN) over claims they restrained aluminum supplies and
drove up prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint was filed by a Jacksonville, Florida, direct
purchaser, Master Screens Inc., and by individual plaintiff
Daniel Price Bart of Tallahassee, who is described in the filing
as a &#8220;purchaser of beverages sold in aluminum cans.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks and Glencore are accused in the complaint filed
yesterday in federal court in Tallahassee of racketeering and
conspiring with the London Metal Exchange, hoarding aluminum in
Detroit-area warehouses and violating federal antitrust laws.
Goldman Sachs was first sued over similar claims by a Michigan
company on Aug. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;By inserting itself into a healthy industry producing
widely needed commodities, severely degrading functionality and
widely distributing costs while itself benefiting, Goldman Sachs
and JPMorgan couldn&#8217;t fit a more archetypal description of a
parasite on the markets,&#8221; according to the Florida complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are no queues at our warehouses and we believe this
suit has no merit,&#8221; Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan Chase, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe this suit is without merit and we intend to
vigorously contest it,&#8221; Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New
York-based Goldman Sachs, said in an e-mail. &#8220;We also note that
aluminum prices are down 40 percent from their peak in 2006.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Warehousing &#8216;Giant&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 1 million tons of aluminum are stored in the
Detroit warehouses, many of which are owned by Goldman Sachs,
which charges rent for the storage, according to the complaint,
while London Metal Exchange load-out rules curtail how much of
the metal leaves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan-owned Henry Bath  Son Ltd., acquired in 2010, is
described in the complaint as a &#8220;metal warehousing giant.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Florida plaintiffs are seeking class action, or group,
status, to represent other aluminum buyers and consumers, as
well as compensatory damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Watenphul, a spokesman for Baar, Switzerland-based
commodities group Glencore, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DuVally last week said the complaint filed against Goldman
Sachs in Detroit was without merit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third lawsuit, naming as defendants Goldman Sachs and its
warehouse unit, Metro International Trade Services LLC, as
defendants, was filed yesterday in federal court in New Orleans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plaintiff River Parish Contractors Inc. of Reserve,
Louisiana, also alleges the Goldman Sachs entities inflated
aluminum prices and restrained supplies in violation of U.S.
antitrust laws. Neither London Metal Exchange nor JPMorgan are
named as defendants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Florida case is Master Screens Inc. v. Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., 13-cv-00431, U.S. District Court, Northern District
of Florida (Tallahassee). The Michigan case is Superior
Extrusion Inc. v. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., 13-cv-13315, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Michigan (Detroit). The
Louisiana case is River Parish Contractors Inc. v. Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., 13-cv-05267, U.S. District Court, Eastern District
of Louisiana (New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world&#8217;s largest
entertainment company, said costs to market the box-office
disappointment &#8220;The Lone Ranger&#8221; and shrinking revenue at ABC
television network held back third-quarter profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income was little changed at $1.85 billion, or $1.01 a
share, compared with $1.83 billion, or $1.01, a year earlier,
Burbank, California-based Disney said yesterday in a statement.
Profit came to $1.03 a share excluding items, compared with the
$1.01 average of 30 analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney expects to record a loss of as much as $190 million
this quarter on &#8220;The Lone Ranger,&#8221; which cost $225 million to
make and has produced less in box-office sales. The company&#8217;s
ESPN, AE and domestic children&#8217;s cable channels, along with the
popular theme parks, continue to spur growth for Disney as film
profits slide and the ABC broadcast division struggles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There has been a lot said I know about the risk of
basically high-cost, tentpole films, and we certainly can attest
to that given what happened with &#8216;Lone Ranger,&#8217;&#8221; Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger said on a call with
investors. &#8220;We still believe that a tentpole strategy is a good
strategy. One way to rise above the din and the competition is
with a big film, not just a big budget, but a big story, big
cast, big marketing behind it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney fell 1.7 percent to $65.91 at the close in New York.
The stock has gained 32 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you strip everything aside, it was maybe a tad light
compared to what people were expecting,&#8221; Matthew Harrigan, an
analyst at Wunderlich Securities in Denver, said of the
earnings. He has a hold rating on the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quarterly Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales increased 4.4 percent to $11.6 billion in the period
ended June 29, compared with the $11.7 billion average of 27
analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s film studio posted a 36 percent drop in profit to
to $201 million due to pre-release marketing costs of the &#8220;The
Lone Ranger&#8221; and lower revenue from &#8220;Iron Man 3&#8221; compared to
last year&#8217;s megahit &#8220;The Avengers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Lone Ranger,&#8221; featuring Armie Hammer in the title
role and Johnny Depp as his sidekick Tonto, has collected $176
million in worldwide ticket revenue since its July 3 release,
according to Box Office Mojo, an industry website. Studios split
those receipts with theater owners and incur additional costs
marketing their pictures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cable, TV &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating income at Disney&#8217;s media networks, the company&#8217;s
largest group, rose 8.2 percent to $2.3 billion. Growth in fees
from pay-TV services and advertising at networks, including
ESPN, countered higher programing costs and lower revenue from
the ABC broadcast business. Sales increased 5.3 percent to $5.35
billion, Disney said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costs at the ABC network rose as the broadcast division
aired fewer shows made internally and acquired more programming
from outside producers, according to the statement. The ABC
network lost about 6 percent of its audience in the TV season
that ended in May and saw a 10 percent drop in the younger
viewers that advertisers target, according to Nielsen data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investments and an improving economy lifted profit at
Disney resorts and theme parks, where earnings increased 9.4
percent to $689 million on 7 percent higher attendance and more
spending by tourists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said projects such as MyMagic+, a wristband for
guests that serves as an admission ticket, room key and credit
card, led to higher costs. The Florida parks are benefiting from
the new Disney&#8217;s Art of Animation resort and the expansion of
the Magic Kingdom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer products profit rose 4.8 percent to $219 million,
while losses at the company&#8217;s interactive division increased to
$58 million from $42 million a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given the number of headwinds we faced, we are very
pleased with the financial results we delivered,&#8221; Chief
Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said on the call. &lt;/p&gt;

behind,&#8221; Hans Ephraimson, managing director and head of foreign
exchange, commodities and short-duration sales for the Americas
at Deutsche Bank in New York, said in a telephone interview.
&#8220;Gaurang&#8217;s expected contribution, and hires like this, are much
longer lasting than any one interim-year increase in flow.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yen has fallen 10 percent this year against the
greenback. The dollar has rallied against 13 of its 16 most-traded peers during that span. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currency trading volumes in the U.S. and U.K. rose to
records in April, according to the Foreign Exchange Committee&#8217;s
twice-yearly survey. The average-daily-volume of U.S. currency
trading rose 27 percent since October to $1 trillion, the
committee said July 29 in a statement. U.K. volume rose 26
percent to $2.55 trillion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey&#8217;s benchmark yields climbed for
the first time in five days and the lira depreciated against the
dollar as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said pressure on the economy
may continue given the nation&#8217;s external imbalances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on two-year benchmark notes rose 16 basis points, or
0.16 percentage point, to 8.83 percent at the close and the
Borsa Istanbul National 100 (XU100) index fell 0.7 percent. The lira
weakened 0.3 percent to 1.9317 per dollar, the lowest since Aug.
1, at 12:42 p.m. in Istanbul. Turkish Markets closed at 12:40
p.m. local time and will reopen Aug. 12 as the nation celebrates
Eid, which marks the end of the Islamic month of fasting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Turkish economy may have to go through a significant
adjustment as the U.S. economy continues to normalize over the
next couple of years,&#8221; Ahmet Akarli, a London-based economist
at Goldman Sachs, said in a report dated yesterday. The
adjustment may come &#8220;through a combination of a weaker exchange
rate, as well as higher domestic rates,&#8221; he said, citing the
economy&#8217;s shortfall, a source of &#8220;vulnerability.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current account deficit widened an annual 42 percent to
$7.52 billion in May, according to central bank data published
last month. The gap may reach 6.9 percent of gross domestic
product in 2013, up from 6.04 percent last year, according to
the median estimate of 21 economists in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Re-appreciation&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-year yields have surged 404 basis points, or 4.04
percentage points, from a record low of 4.79 percent on May 17.
The lira has weakened 7.7 percent against the dollar this year,
the biggest decline after South Africa&#8217;s rand among emerging
markets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We may see a partial re-appreciation in the lira, with
perceptions of inflation turning positive this month,&#8221; Inanc Sozer, an economic-research manager at Odea Bank AS, the Turkish
unit of Lebanon&#8217;s Banque Audi SAL-Audi Saradar Group, said in e-mailed comments today. &#8220;If food prices remain subdued,
inflation in August might even drop to 7.5 percent,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annual inflation in July rose to 8.88 percent, the highest
level since September, from 8.3 percent the previous month,
according to data released by the statistics office this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Core inflation, which strips out energy, food, beverages,
tobacco and gold, accelerated to 6.09 percent from 5.57 percent
in June, the largest monthly pickup since October 2011.
Publication of this month&#8217;s inflation data is scheduled for
Sept. 3. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) hired James McMurdo
from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) as chief executive officer for its
Australian and New Zealand business to replace John Macfarlane,
who retires in early 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McMurdo was most recently a partner at Goldman Sachs in
London, where he headed the financial sponsors group for Europe,
the Middle East and Africa. He will report to Gunit Chadha and
Alan Cloete, co-chief executive officers for the Asia-Pacific
region, Deutsche Bank said in an e-mailed statement. McMurdo&#8217;s
appointment is effective from February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank is on course to finish outside the top three
for advising on mergers and acquisitions in Australia and New
Zealand for a third straight year, ranking ninth in 2013,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Frankfurt-based
bank is the fifth-biggest arranger of bond deals in Australia,
trailing the four largest domestic lenders, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;James McMurdo is one of the most respected bankers in
this key growth market for Deutsche Bank,&#8221; Chada said in
today&#8217;s statement. &#8220;He brings great depth of experience to this
important role and is best suited to help grow our strong
position across all our client businesses.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Slowing MA &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australian MA volume dropped 31 percent this year from the
same period in 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show, as the
fading mining boom sapped the economy and consumer confidence.
The government on Aug. 2 cut its growth estimate for the year
ending June 2014 to 2.5 percent from 2.75 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Imperial Oil
Ltd. (IMO) agreed to buy ConocoPhillips&#8217; Clyden lease for about C$751
million ($723 million), expanding their holdings in the booming
Alberta oil-sands region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale includes 226,000 net acres of undeveloped land
near the southern edge of the Athabasca oil sands, Houston-based
ConocoPhillips said in a statement today. Under the agreement,
Exxon will hold 72.5 percent of the leasehold and Calgary-based
Imperial, which Exxon controls, will have 27.5 percent, the
companies said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s the second Canadian purchase in 10 months for Irving,
Texas-based Exxon, which agreed to pay C$2.86 billion for Celtic
Exploration Ltd. in October, gaining access to shale regions in
Alberta and British Columbia. Canada has the world&#8217;s third-largest oil reserves, after Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, and its
output is expected to more than double by 2030, according to the
Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil-sands projects offer &#8220;the same predictable
production&#8221; for years, as companies like Exxon face declining
output from conventional oil fields, said Fadel Gheit, an
analyst with Oppenheimer  Co. in New York who has the
equivalent of a hold rating on Exxon and a buy on
ConocoPhillips. (COP) Exxon said in March its combined oil and gas
production will fall for a second straight year as it builds
platforms and pipelines to bring recent discoveries online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exxon Partner &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale is expected to close in the third quarter and
requires approval from Canada&#8217;s Competition Bureau,
ConocoPhillips said. Exxon is the largest shareholder in
Imperial Oil, with a 70 percent stake as of Feb. 13, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ConocoPhillips gained 0.9 percent to $67.09 at the close in
New York, while Exxon climbed 0.5 percent to $91.78. Imperial
increased 3 cents to C$42.03 in Toronto. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon plans to bring in a partner, reducing its stake to
27.5 percent while it keeps majority control of the project with
Imperial, the companies said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imperial has been expanding output from its oil-sands
holding, including the C$12.9 billion Kearl project in Alberta
which began production in April. Kearl is on schedule to produce
110,000 barrels a day by the end of the year, the company said
Aug. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Imperial Oil &#8220;this seems like a logical bolt-on
acquisition that&#8217;s easy to integrate,&#8221; Pavel Molchanov, an
analyst with Raymond James  Associates Inc. in Houston, said in
a phone interview today. He has the equivalent of a buy on Exxon
and a sell on ConocoPhillips and doesn&#8217;t own either shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ConocoPhillips has been selling assets for more than three
years to focus on more profitable areas. Chief Financial Officer
Jeff Sheets said earlier this month ConocoPhillips might reduce
its oil-sands holdings. The company expects about $13.5 billion
from its 2012-2013 asset sales program, including $3.8 billion
received through the end of June. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colombia has reduced the area of land
used for cocaine production to the lowest since records began
tracking it, according to a report published by the United
Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Land planted with coca bushes, the raw material for making
cocaine, fell to 48,000 hectares in 2012, down from 64,000
hectares in 2011, says the report. The UN estimates that cocaine
production in Colombia fell 10 percent to 309 metric tons last
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Colombian government uses manual and aerial spraying
methods to eradicate coca plants across the Andean nation,
partially funded by Plan Colombia, a US counter-narcotics
program started by the Clinton administration. In a speech last
year, White House Drug Policy Director Richard Gil Kerlikowske
said Colombian cocaine production had fallen behind Peru and
Bolivia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These reductions have cost lives in our police and armed
forces,&#8221; Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon said at an event
in the UNODC office in Bogota. &#8220;It is with cocaine production
and illegal mining that terrorist groups and criminal gangs in
this country are financing their activities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombian armed groups include the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, or FARC, the National Liberation Army, or
ELN, and organized crime gangs. The FARC has been engaged in a
five-decade armed struggle against the Colombian government and
is currently participating in peace talks in Havana. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Deutsche
Bank AG (DBK) are funding the acquisition of New York&#8217;s 650 Madison
building with an $800 million loan, according to two people with
knowledge of the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lenders plan to package the debt on the Manhattan tower
into bonds to sell to investors, said the people, who asked not
to be identified because the negotiations are private. A $150
million portion may be carved into riskier mezzanine loans that
pay higher yields, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal signals Wall Street&#8217;s conviction that bond buyers
will snap up the commercial-mortgage backed securities even as
concern that the Federal Reserve may begin to reduce stimulus
efforts next month roils markets. Goldman Sachs and Deutsche
Bank beat out Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan
Chase  Co. and Wells Fargo  Co. to land the assignment,
according to four people with knowledge of the talks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, and Amanda Williams of Deutsche Bank, both in New York, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A partnership between Crown Acquisitions and Highgate
Holdings Inc. agreed to pay a record $1.3 billion, or $2,100 a
square foot, for the tower at Madison Avenue and East 59th
Street in June. Vornado Realty Trust (VNO) and Oxford Properties Group
have joined the consortium of buyers, Vornado Chairman Steven Roth said on an Aug. 6 conference call with analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchase, from Carlyle Group LP, is the largest for an
entire building in the U.S. since Google Inc.&#8217;s $1.8 billion
acquisition in 2010 of 111 Eighth Ave., a former warehouse in
Manhattan&#8217;s Chelsea section. It exceeds the record $1,583 a
square foot paid for 450 Park Ave. in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street banks have arranged $49.1 billion of bonds
linked to everything from strip malls to skyscrapers this year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Issuance is forecast to
climb to $70 billion in 2013, more than double last year&#8217;s
total, according to Credit Suisse Group AG. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said it probably will sell a majority stake in its European insurance business in the next 12 months as banks face more stringent capital rules. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rothesay Life Ltd., a London-based insurer run by Goldman Sachs partner Addy Loudiadis, had $9.66 billion in assets as of June 30, Goldman Sachs said today in a regulatory filing. The New York-based bank sold about 80 percent of Global Atlantic Financial Group, a reinsurance business in Bermuda, to institutions and high-net worth clients in April. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is planning the sale of Rothesay, which it set up in 2007, in part because new rules require banks to hold more equity to absorb potential losses on their assets, according to a person briefed on the discussions. The sale of Global Atlantic boosted Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Basel III Tier 1 common ratio by 0.5 percentage point, Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said last month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our reinsurance business -- good business, we like the business -- but with the new Basel rules it was clear that business was better held outside of Goldman Sachs,&#8221; Schwartz, 49, said at an investor conference in May. &#8220;If something&#8217;s better outside of Goldman Sachs, we&#8217;ll make an adjustment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Pension Hedging &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Tier 1 common equity was equal to 9.3 percent of the bank&#8217;s risk-weighted assets at the end of June under new Basel III rules, according to the filing. The bank has said it wants to maintain a ratio of about 9.5 percent, or 1 percentage point higher than regulators will require. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s Tier 1 common equity was reduced by $9.87 billion because of investments in nonconsolidated financial institutions, according to the filing. That brought its Basel III figure to $55.8 billion, compared with $61.9 billion under current rules. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rothesay insures more than 10 billion pounds ($15.5 billion) of pension liabilities for companies including IAG SA&#8217;s British Airways and General Motors Co.&#8217;s U.K. division. Firms such as Rothesay promise to pay pensions if retirees live beyond a certain age and then use derivatives to try to hedge the risk. The insurer typically receives a portion of the pension plan&#8217;s assets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rothesay had pretax operating profit of 266 million pounds in 2012, according to the unit&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Greek Derivative &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The unit&#8217;s assets included corporate bonds, non-U.S. government debt and $1 billion of over-the-counter derivatives, according to the filing. The business had $10.6 billion of liabilities as of June 30. The total asset and liability figures exclude inter-company assets and liabilities, which are expected to be included in the sale, according to Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Loudiadis, 50, who joined Goldman&#8217;s European derivatives marketing group in 1994 from JPMorgan Chase  Co. and was named partner in 2000, rose to be one of the bank&#8217;s top European sales executives. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2001 she helped sell Greece a derivative that masked the country&#8217;s growing debt so the country could improve its finances to meet European Union fiscal targets. The derivative later cost Greece billions of euros. Goldman Sachs wasn&#8217;t accused of wrongdoing related to the transaction. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Michael J.

&lt;p&gt;G. Robert Blakey, the law professor
who helped draft the U.S. wiretap statute, may submit a brief
supporting imprisoned hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam&#8217;s effort
to overturn his conviction for insider trading, a U.S. appeals
court ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blakey, who teaches at Notre Dame Law School in Indiana,
supports a rehearing of the case against the Galleon Group LLC
co-founder, whose conviction was upheld in June by the appeals
court in New York. He was granted the right to submit written
arguments yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, who&#8217;s serving an 11-year term at the Federal
Medical Center Devens in Ayers, Massachusetts, on July 24 asked
for a hearing before the full U.S. Court of Appeals in New York.
His conviction was upheld by a three-judge panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, 56, was convicted of directing the biggest
hedge fund insider-trading scheme in U.S. history. It was the
first such case in which investigators tapped targets&#8217; phone
conversations, a tactic used in organized-crime probes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jurors listened to more than 45 wiretap recordings, on some
of which Rajaratnam can be heard gathering nonpublic information
from his sources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blakely, who is viewed as the architect of the wiretap
statute, called the secret recordings &#8220;a method of last
resort&#8221; in court papers submitted with his request to file the
brief on Rajaratnam&#8217;s behalf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeal is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 11-04416, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SP Said to Face SEC Probe on 2011 Commercial-Mortgage Bond &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard  Poor&#8217;s is facing scrutiny from the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission for how it rated a
commercial-mortgage bond in 2011, three people with knowledge of
the matter, but who weren&#8217;t authorized to speak publicly, said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inquiry extends beyond a U.S. Justice Department
lawsuit against New York-based McGraw Hill Financial Inc. (MHFI) and
its SP unit. Massachusetts has also looked into SP&#8217;s post-crisis methods, Bloomberg News reported Feb. 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We reviewed the application of our CMBS methodology and
determined that the approach used for new transactions rated in
2011 produced results that were consistent with Standard 
Poor&#8217;s rating definitions and resulted in no ratings changes,&#8221;
Ed Sweeney, an SP spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Nester, an SEC spokesman in Washington, declined to
comment on whether the agency was scrutinizing the deal, which
was first reported by Dow Jones Newswires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department sued SP Feb. 4 in federal court in
Los Angeles, accusing the company of inflating ratings to win
business on bonds backed by home loans made to the riskiest
borrowers from September 2004 to October 2007. The U.S. is
seeking more than $5 billion in damages, or more than five years
of profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP denies the allegations and said in a Feb. 5 statement
it will defend itself &#8220;vigorously.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ex-Baker  McKenzie Partner Sentenced to 2 Years for Fraud &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Baker  McKenzie LLP partner Martin Weisberg, who
admitted to stealing from a client and taking part in a $55
million securities fraud, was sentenced to two years in prison,
the U.S. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weisberg, 62, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and money
laundering in May 2012 after prosecutors alleged he skimmed $1.3
million in interest from an escrow account for a hedge fund
client, SIAM Capital Management. Separately, Weisberg joined a
scheme to manipulate the stock price of technology firms
Xybernaut Corp. and Ramp Corp. prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Instead of using his talents to provide wise counsel, he
lied to and stole from his own clients, lied to the Securities
and Exchange Commission, and betrayed the investing public,&#8221;
Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn, New
York, also ordered Weisberg to pay $297,500 in restitution and
$250,000 in forfeiture, according to prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weisberg left Baker  McKenzie in October 2007 at the time
of his arrest in the securities case. Previously, he had worked
at firms including Cravath, Swaine  Moore LLP, Morgan Lewis 
Bockius, and Shea  Gould, according to a memorandum filed by
his lawyers in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Albert, a lawyer for Weisberg, declined to comment
on the sentence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Saltsman, 07-cr-641, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Faces Criminal Probe as Bank Says U.S. Faults MBS Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S. bank, said it&#8217;s
under both civil and criminal investigation for practices tied
to sales of mortgage-backed bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department&#8217;s civil division told the bank in
May of its preliminary finding after examining securities tied
to subprime and Alt-A loans, which were sold to investors from
2005 through 2007, JPMorgan said Aug. 7. The office of U.S.
Attorney Benjamin Wagner in Sacramento, California, has been
conducting civil and criminal inquiries, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It would be a major decision for them to indict a major
U.S. bank, and frankly I would not predict it,&#8221; said John
Coffee, a professor at Columbia Law School in New York. &#8220;You
can often bring dual investigations, civil and criminal, in
order to maximize pressure for a global civil resolution.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigators are seeking to wrap up years-long probes of
abuses that fueled the housing collapse and led global credit
markets to freeze in 2008. This week, the Justice Department and
Securities and Exchange Commission sued Bank of America Corp.,
the nation&#8217;s second-biggest lender, accusing it of misleading
investors in an $850 million mortgage-backed bond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. is investigating JPMorgan under the Financial
Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act, according to
a person briefed on the matter, requesting anonymity because
details of the inquiry aren&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1989 law, known as FIRREA, allows the government to
seek civil penalties for losses to federally insured financial
firms. The Bank of America case cited the same statute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lauren Horwood, a spokeswoman for Wagner in Sacramento,
declined to comment on the bank&#8217;s disclosures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan &#8220;continues to respond to other MBS-related
regulatory inquiries,&#8221; the New York-based company wrote in a
regulatory filing listing investigations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Evangelisti, a company spokesman, declined to comment.
Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America has said buyers
of its mortgage bonds were sophisticated investors with ample
access to underlying data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors are reluctant to bring criminal charges
against a large bank that&#8217;s tightly interconnected with other
firms because it could endanger national or global economies,
U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder told a Senate Judiciary
Committee hearing in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goldman Sachs Cooperating With U.S. Credit Derivatives Inquiry &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc., the fifth-largest U.S. bank by
assets, said it&#8217;s cooperating with the U.S. Department of
Justice&#8217;s four-year-old antitrust probe into the credit-default
swaps market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm has received civil investigative demands related
to the investigation, New York-based Goldman Sachs said in a
regulatory filing today. The bank was among more than a dozen
financial institutions accused by the European Union last month
of colluding to curb competition in credit derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) and Citigroup Inc. also said in filings last
week that they were cooperating with the probe. The Justice
Department sent civil investigative notices in July 2009 to the
banks that own London-based Markit Group Ltd., a provider of
data on derivatives and bonds, to find out if they had unfair
access to price information, three people familiar with the
matter said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markit&#8217;s shareholders included Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan
Chase  Co., Bank of America Corp., and Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc, according to filings with the U.K.&#8217;s Companies House
at the time. Bloomberg LP, the owner of Bloomberg News, competes
with Markit in selling information to the financial-services
industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MetLife Says Bank May Face Fine as U.S. Probes Foreclosures &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MetLife Inc. (MET), the largest U.S. life insurer, said it may
face fines amid a government review of foreclosures at its bank
unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank received a request in May from the U.S. Department
of Justice for information on payments the lender made to law
firms tied to foreclosures, the New York-based insurer said in a
filing yesterday. Expenses were submitted to Fannie Mae (FNMA), Freddie
Mac (FMCC) and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for
reimbursement, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is possible that various state or federal regulatory
and law enforcement authorities may seek monetary penalties from
MetLife Bank relating to foreclosure practices,&#8221; the insurer
said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probe adds to U.S. scrutiny of a business that MetLife
has been exiting as it seeks to focus on insurance and
retirement products. The company said last year that the Justice
Department, led by Attorney General Eric Holder, made a civil
investigative demand in a review of mortgages insured by the
Federal Housing Administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Calagna, a spokesman for MetLife, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAC&#8217;s Cohen Shouldn&#8217;t Get Evidence in SEC Case, Prosecutor Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAC Capital Advisors LP founder Steven A. Cohen shouldn&#8217;t
get evidence in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
administrative proceeding until criminal cases tied to his hedge
fund conclude, a prosecutor said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohen, the billionaire founder of Stamford, Connecticut-based SAC, was accused July 19 in an administrative action of
failing to supervise two employees facing criminal charges of
insider trading. On July 25, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet
Bharara indicted SAC and filed a separate money-laundering
lawsuit against the fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC alleged Cohen, 57, received &#8220;highly suspicious&#8221;
information that should have caused any reasonable hedge-fund
manager to investigate the basis for trades. Prosecutors said
the fund reaped hundreds of millions of dollars in illicit
profit from insider-trading schemes involving at least eight
employees including the two facing charges, former SAC fund
manager Mathew Martoma and Michael Steinberg, a fund manager at
SAC&#8217;s Sigma Capital unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Cohen doesn&#8217;t oppose the request to postpone the SEC
case, he asked to be given prompt access to the agency&#8217;s
investigative records. His lawyers said he would be &#8220;severely
prejudiced&#8221; with &#8220;insufficient time&#8221; to adequately review the
vast number of documents collected by the SEC, which outnumber
those in prosecutors&#8217; custody. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Both arguments are incorrect,&#8221; Assistant U.S. Attorney
Antonia Apps, who is prosecuting SAC and Steinberg, said in a
memo filed yesterday in the SEC case. &#8220;The U.S. Attorney
respectfully submits that the public interest would best be
served by staying the administrative proceeding pending
prosecution of the related criminal cases.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for SAC at Sard Verbinnen
 Co., declined to comment on the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are U.S. v. SAC Capital Advisors LP, 13-cr-00541;
U.S. v. SAC Capital Advisors LP 13-cv-05182, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The
administrative proceeding is In the matter of Steven A. Cohen,
3015382, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Obama Says Private Capital Should Take Lead Mortgage Role &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama is calling for private capital to
take the lead role in the nation&#8217;s mortgage market with the U.S.
government continuing to provide a backstop only against
catastrophic risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president for the first time is endorsing an approach
to remake the housing finance system as Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac are wound down. He said the government still must play a
role to preserve broad access to 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages
that underpin the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You can&#8217;t have a situation in which the government is
underwriting and guaranteeing all the mortgage lending that&#8217;s
taking place around the country and big profits are being made
by these quasi-private institutions,&#8221; Obama said. Congress
should pass housing legislation by the end of the year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president&#8217;s remarks yesterday came during a question
and answer session in Los Angeles moderated by Spencer Rascoff,
chief executive officer of Zillow Inc (Z), operator of the largest
real-estate information website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reduced government role would likely mean that mortgages
would become more expensive as the costs of covering risk are
shifted from taxpayers to borrowers. A Senate bill containing
Obama&#8217;s approach would increase interest rates by between 50 and
75 basis points for a typical borrower with a 30-year fixed rate
loan, a 20 percent down payment, and a 750 credit score,
according to a report by Moody&#8217;s Analytics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Concessions Seen in Telefonica-KPN German Merger for EU Nod &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telefonica SA (TEF) and Royal KPN NV (KPN)&#8217;s bid to combine their
German assets has become an acid test for a telecommunications
industry anxious over whether regulators will allow deals
carriers say they need to spur growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already Germany&#8217;s phone regulator has given Telefonica&#8217;s O2
and KPN&#8217;s E-Plus units two weeks to turn over details of
wireless frequencies so it can determine they&#8217;d be &#8220;efficiently
used,&#8221; and that the merger won&#8217;t hamper competition, according
to a July 25 letter from the Bonn-based agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter raised the prospect of a surrender of some
airwaves, which could water down the benefits of the 8.1
billion-euro ($10.8 billion) transaction and by extension
inhibit other carriers from attempting similar consolidation
moves, which regulators have said are key to rationalizing the
28-nation European Union market. Approval of the deal will
probably come with conditions such as asset disposals, according
to competition lawyer Paul Hughes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;re looking at a reduction in the big players from
four to three,&#8221; said Hughes, European competition counsel at
Steptoe  Johnson LLP in Brussels. &#8220;No doubt, there will be
remedies required in the form of making available access to
wholesale network for virtual mobile telephony companies, for
making spectrum available to other players.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU telecommunications market is inundated with carriers
spread over 28 countries. That creates a sevenfold difference in
the price of a domestic mobile call between the priciest and
cheapest markets across a region less than half the size of the
U.S., according to a statement Aug. 6 from Neelie Kroes, who is
in charge of the digital agenda for the European Commission, the
EU&#8217;s executive arm in Brussels. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;In the Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Sued With Goldman Sachs in Aluminum Antitrust Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest U.S. bank, was sued with
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Glencore Xstrata Plc (GLEN) over claims
they restrained aluminum supplies and drove up prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint was filed by a Jacksonville, Florida, direct
purchaser, Master Screens Inc., and by individual plaintiff
Daniel Price Bart of Tallahassee, who is described in the filing
as a &#8220;purchaser of beverages sold in aluminum cans.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks and Glencore are accused in the complaint filed
yesterday in federal court in Tallahassee of racketeering and
conspiring with the London Metal Exchange, hoarding aluminum in
Detroit-area warehouses and violating federal antitrust laws.
Goldman Sachs was first sued over similar claims by a Michigan
company on Aug. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are no queues at our warehouses and we believe this
suit has no merit,&#8221; Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan Chase, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe this suit is without merit and we intend to
vigorously contest it,&#8221; Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New
York-based Goldman Sachs, said in an e-mail. &#8220;We also note that
aluminum prices are down 40 percent from their peak in 2006.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Watenphul, a spokesman for Baar, Switzerland-based
commodities group Glencore, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Florida case is Master Screens Inc. v. Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., 13-cv-00431, U.S. District Court, Northern District
of Florida (Tallahassee). The Michigan case is Superior
Extrusion Inc. v. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., 13-cv-13315, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Michigan (Detroit). The
Louisiana case is River Parish Contractors Inc. v. Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., 13-cv-05267, U.S. District Court, Eastern District
of Louisiana (New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nuveen Funds Sue AIG, Executives Claiming Securities Fraud &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-five Nuveen Investments Inc. funds sued American
International Group Inc. (AIG), claiming the company and executives
committed securities fraud leading to the U.S. financial crisis
that intensified in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also named Aug. 6 as defendants in a 237-page complaint in
federal court in Chicago were former Chief Executive Officer
Martin J. Sullivan, ex-Chief Financial Officer Steven Bensinger
and Joseph Cassano, who led the AIG Financial Products unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Plaintiffs suffered tens of billions of dollars in
losses, at least, based on false and materially misleading
statements that AIG, certain of its executives, directors,
underwriters and outside auditor made,&#8221; according to the
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funds accused the company, Sullivan and others of
violating Illinois and federal securities laws, common law fraud
and unjust enrichment. They asked for unspecified money damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew Gallagher, a spokesman for New York-based AIG,
declined to comment immediately on the allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the Nuveen funds suing the insurer are the Dow 30
Enhanced Premium and Income Fund, the Nuveen Equity Premium
Opportunity Fund (JSN) and the Nuveen Large Cap Value Fund. (NNGAX) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Dow 30 Enhanced Premium  Income Fund v.
American International Group Inc., 13-cv-05612, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Publishers Object to U.S. Request in Apple E-Book Pricing Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishers who previously settled an antitrust lawsuit with
the U.S. Justice Department over pricing of electronic books
filed an objection to the government&#8217;s bid to force Apple Inc. (AAPL)
to terminate existing contracts with them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HarperCollins Publishers LLC, Hachette Book Group Inc.,
Simon  Schuster Inc. and two others claimed in the objection
yesterday that they would be punished by the proposed order. The
government&#8217;s proposal would force Apple to find new ways of
making deals with publishers to distribute e-books. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal would &#8220;effectively eliminate the use of the
agency model&#8221; for selling and distributing e-books for a period
of five years, the publishers said in the filing in federal
court in Manhattan. Under the agency model, publishers, not
retailers, set book prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The provisions do not impose any limitation on Apple&#8217;s
pricing behavior at all,&#8221; lawyers for the publishers wrote.
&#8220;Rather, under the guise of punishing Apple, they effectively
punish the settling defendants by prohibiting agreements with
Apple using an agency model.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Denise Cote ruled in July that
Cupertino, California-based Apple, the world&#8217;s largest
technology company, violated U.S. antitrust law by fixing e-book
prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five publishers were also defendants in the lawsuit,
which was brought by the U.S. government and 33 state attorneys
general. The publishers, Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck
GmbH&#8217;s Macmillan unit, CBS Corp. (CBS)&#8217;s Simon  Schuster, Lagardere
SCA (MMB)&#8217;s Hachette Book Group, Pearson Plc (PSON)&#8217;s Penguin unit and News
Corp.&#8217;s HarperCollins, settled with the government for a total
of at least $164 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sixth publisher, Random House Inc., didn&#8217;t sign an agency
agreement with Apple and wasn&#8217;t involved in the U.S. suit.
Penguin was merged with Random House this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gina Talamona, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department,
said in an e-mail that the proposed court order doesn&#8217;t modify
the terms of the settlement reached with the publishers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If approved by the court, the order &#8220;would prohibit Apple
from entering agreements that limit retail price competition
during a reset period,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Apple Inc., 12-cv-02826, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
generated about half its revenue from trading last quarter,
posted losses from that business on six days in the second
quarter, unchanged from a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s traders made more than $100 million on 10 days
in the quarter ended June 30, compared with four days in the
year-earlier period, the New York-based company said in a
regulatory filing today. While the largest one-day loss was
between $75 million and $100 million, none of the firm&#8217;s losses
topped its value-at-risk estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs generated $4.31 billion from its trading
division in the second quarter of 2013, an increase of 11
percent from the year-earlier period. The total was down from
the first quarter amid a drop in bond prices sparked by
indications that the Federal Reserve may ease economic-stimulus
measures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Macro concerns emerged again toward the end of the
quarter and were reflected in lower activity levels and risk
appetite in certain businesses,&#8221; Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said on a conference call last month. &#8220;In addition,
the market volatility created more challenging periods within
the capital markets for managing client flows.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. lost money on seven days during the
quarter, including a $54 million misstep on one of them. Morgan
Stanley posted losses on 12 days, including one that topped $50
million, while Wells Fargo  Co. reported five negative days.
Citigroup Inc. doesn&#8217;t disclose money-losing days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola HBC AG (CCH), the bottler that
switched its listing from Athens to London, said second-quarter
sales fell 2 percent as a volume gain in emerging markets failed
to offset declines in countries including Greece and Austria. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue fell to 1.95 billion euros ($2.6 billion) in the
three months ended June 28, the company said today in a
statement. That missed the prediction of Mike Gibbs, an analyst
at JPMorgan Cazenove who estimated sales of 1.989 billion euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volume gained 2 percent in emerging markets, Coca-Cola HBC
said, while levels dropped 6 percent in so-called established
economies and 3 percent in developing markets. The company buys
concentrate from Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co. and sells the
products in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola HBC said it will start a &#8220;progressive&#8221; dividend
policy in 2014 that targets an annual payout with a ratio to
profit after tax of 35 percent to 45 percent. The company, which
switched its primary stock listing in April, paid a dividend of
34 euros cents a share in July worth 124.7 million euros, or
about 43 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola HBC maintained volume share in sparkling drinks
&#8220;in the majority of our markets&#8221; in the first half, the
company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottler operates in countries with lower per-capita
consumption of sparkling drinks than the rest of the eurozone,
which will help it boost volume growth, Chief Executive Officer
Dimitris Lois said in April. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Julie Bykowicz and Joshua Gallu" date="Aug 09, 2013 12:17 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-08-09/sec-probe-of-foreign-visas-roils-virginia-governor-race.html"><headline>SEC Probe of Foreign Visas Roils Virginia Governor Race</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission and other government agencies are conducting a broad
probe of &#8220;potential security and financial risks&#8221; in a foreign
visa program used to promote job growth, according to a letter
sent to the Senate yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigations are becoming an issue in the Virginia
governor&#8217;s race, where Terry McAuliffe, a Democratic fundraiser
and confidant of Bill and Hillary Clinton, partnered in 2009
with a Chinese businessman in a startup company, GreenTech
Automotive Inc., and worked with Anthony Rodham, the former
first lady&#8217;s brother, to secure financing from Chinese
investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, McAuliffe, 56, resigned from GreenTech to
devote full time to his campaign. He left behind a company that
employs fewer people than promised, hasn&#8217;t produce many cars and
is drawing government scrutiny for promises made in its pitch to
prospective foreign backers -- details that Republican candidate
Ken Cuccinelli, himself fending off criticism over ties to a
developer under scrutiny, has repeatedly raised on the campaign
trail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A closer look at GreenTech illustrates what some analysts
and government investigators say are broader flaws in a two-decade-old program that gives foreign investors green cards in
exchange for $500,000 investments that create or preserve at
least 10 American jobs. There are 10,000 so-called &#8220;EB-5&#8221;
visas available each year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Program Skepticism &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m very skeptical about this program,&#8221; said David
Martin, a law professor at the University of Virginia who has
served as general counsel to the Immigration and Naturalization
Service and as a deputy counselor to the Department of Homeland
Security, in the Clinton and Obama administrations. &#8220;It&#8217;s
doubtful how much these visas have contributed to jobs and the
overall economy. And has it been worth all of the effort and
complications?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal agencies including the SEC and U.S. Citizenship and
Immigration Services formed a team last year to &#8220;examine
potential security and financial risks associated with the EB-5
program,&#8221; according to a letter dated yesterday from the SEC to
Senator Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican who has been asking
questions about the visas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the SEC is conducting its own review. In
February, it filed a securities fraud claim against a Chicago
man seeking foreign money to build a &#8220;green&#8221; hotel, and in
July the commission sent a document subpoena to GreenTech, the
company confirmed in a statement. Other firms are also under
scrutiny and could face fines and other civil penalties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Homeland Investigation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of Homeland Security&#8217;s inspector general
also has been auditing the EB-5 program for a year, according to
an e-mail from the inspector&#8217;s office to Grassley, which the
lawmaker made public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The EB-5 program was created to benefit American
communities through investment and job creation, and with a
fragile economy, the program has been a tool that could increase
economic activity,&#8221; Grassley said in a statement. &#8220;But when
whistle-blowers come forward with documents and allegations of
political favoritism and national security concerns, Congress
needs to take another look at the program and ask questions with
a new sense of urgency.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McAuliffe, who in an Aug. 3 statement said he was unaware
of the SEC inquiry, has more than $250,000 invested in the
company, according to a financial-disclosure form he filed as a
gubernatorial candidate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Startup Troubles &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Like every startup during the recession,&#8221; Josh Schwerin,
a McAuliffe spokesman, said in an e-mail, &#8220;the company faced
headwinds: Manufacturing isn&#8217;t easy, and manufacturing a new
kind of car is even harder.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foreign investor visas have powerful allies in
Congress, including Senator Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat
who heads the Judiciary Committee. Vermont has made use of the
program to help build two ski resorts, steering the money
through a state-run broker. In a May Senate hearing, he
highlighted the program as an &#8220;investment in America, the power
of immigration to make our economy stronger.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program&#8217;s detractors say an examination of it is long
overdue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m not surprised the SEC is investigating GreenTech
because I&#8217;m not surprised the SEC would investigate any EB-5
project,&#8221; said David North, a fellow at the Center for
Immigration Studies, a Washington group that favors reducing the
number of immigrants in the U.S. &#8220;It&#8217;s inherently a program
that deals with the second- and third-rate investments -- just
the sort of thing that would naturally attract the attention of
the SEC.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Visa Origins &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visas were created decades ago during a recession.
Grappling with an even worse economic collapse, President Barack Obama&#8217;s administration sought to make more use of them to spur
growth and job creation when cash-strapped American investors
were on the sidelines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its initial champion was Alan Simpson, a now-retired
Republican senator from Wyoming, who demanded that 10,000
investor visas be included in the 1990 revision of immigration
laws, according to an Associated Press article at the time. Dale Bumpers, a Democratic senator from Arkansas, unsuccessfully
tried to defeat the visa provision, calling it &#8220;a toll road&#8221;
into the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The immigration law went into effect on Oct. 1, 1991. In
the course of the next two decades, Congress tweaked the program
several times, generally with an aim of making the visas easier
to get rather than increasing scrutiny of the jobs claims
associated with them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Regional Centers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In broad strokes, the program works like this: Companies
seeking to finance projects with foreign cash typically are
required to work with a &#8220;regional center.&#8221; Those centers help
match foreign investors with development projects and then
prepare paperwork to forward to the federal government for visa
approval. Sometimes these centers are run by government
entities, as in Vermont. Other times, as in the case of
GreenTech and the Gulf Coast Funds Management regional center,
which is Rodham&#8217;s employer, they are set up by the project
itself and run privately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a commitment of $500,000 is made to a project, the
investors -- and their spouses and children -- qualify for a
two-year green card after undergoing homeland security checks
and proving they haven&#8217;t obtained their money illegally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After two years, the investor -- usually working with the
regional center -- can petition the government to remove the
conditional status, becoming a permanent resident. At that
point, the Citizenship and Immigration Services, a DHS agency,
must certify that 10 jobs have been created or saved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Job Creation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Association to Invest in USA, a trade group for
regional centers, says in an economic-impact report provided to
Bloomberg that &#8220;spending associated with EB-5 investors
contributed $2.65 billion to the U.S. gross domestic product and
supported over 33,000 jobs during 2010-2011.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than half of those jobs are &#8220;indirect&#8221; or
&#8220;induced,&#8221; meaning the projects aren&#8217;t directly employing
them. Critics say those fluid definitions for job creation,
approved in 2003 by Congress, make it easier for each project to
reach its 10-jobs-per-investor quota. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program drew 6,106 foreign investor applicants in
fiscal year 2012, eight times as many as the year before the
recession began, 2007, according to Citizenship and Immigration
Services data. In 2007, there were about two dozen regional
centers to help process these applicants; that list has grown to
more than 300 across the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;GreenTech Founding &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the companies counted in that surge of growth was
GreenTech, which was formed in the aftermath of a legal dispute
between two Chinese businessmen looking to break into the green-car market by attracting foreign investors through the EB-5
program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McAuliffe joined Xiaolin &#8220;Charles&#8221; Wang as a co-founder
in late 2009. Within a year, the former head of the Democratic
National Committee was showing off the company&#8217;s Day-Glo orange
golf-cart-sized MyCar to Bill Clinton and a flock of reporters
and photographers at the former president&#8217;s annual Clinton
Global Initiative meeting in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fund the project, McAuliffe worked with Rodham. Gulf
Coast, which lists on its website Rodham as chief executive
officer and president, serves as GreenTech&#8217;s regional center.
Schwerin said McAuliffe recommended Rodham for the job and Gulf
Coast made its own hiring decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phone calls and e-mails to GreenTech and Gulf Coast, in
Mississippi and in McLean, Virginia, where the two companies are
based, weren&#8217;t returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MyCars Promises &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McAuliffe, speaking at the Clinton Global Initiative in
September 2010, pledged to make the first 100,000 MyCars
available to consumers for $10,000 apiece. He also said as many
as 5,000 workers would be hired to produce the vehicles, which
reach a top speed of 45 miles per hour and are intended for
neighborhood use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Rodham pursued foreign investor funding,
documents shared by Grassley&#8217;s office show. McAuliffe played no
role in recruiting foreign investors, Schwerin said. In 2011,
there were at least 64 GreenTech investor applicants awaiting
approval by immigration officials, internal agency e-mails show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 2012, after getting referrals of possible fraud
from immigration authorities, the SEC created an informal
working group to investigate companies that might be luring
foreign investors into fraudulent investment schemes, according
to a person with direct knowledge of the complaints who asked
not to be named because the matter isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fraud Tips &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the companies using the EB-5 program aren&#8217;t
registered with the SEC, so the agency has relied on immigration
authorities to flag cases of possible securities fraud, the
person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GreenTech and Gulf Coast received subpoenas from
investigators seeking a range of documents and bank records. The
SEC raised concern about a GreenTech promissory note posted
online that appeared to guarantee investors&#8217; principal,
according to the documents posted online by Grassley. Pledging
to return investors&#8217; money if their visa application is denied
isn&#8217;t consistent with one of the EB-5 program&#8217;s requirements:
Project backers must bear some risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The note says GreenTech would invest the person&#8217;s $500,000
for a period of five years once the immigration petition has
been approved. Alternatively, the note says, GreenTech
&#8220;promises to purchase back&#8221; the $500,000 in stock bought by
the investor if the company fails to go public in five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Favored Treatment &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the SEC inquiry, Grassley has raised
questions about whether Alejandro Mayorkas, director of
Citizenship and Immigration Services, gave preferential
treatment to McAuliffe and Rodham. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We absolutely gave special treatment to GreenTech at the
directive of D1,&#8221; an unnamed immigration agency employee wrote
in an e-mail Grassley released. The e-mail said &#8220;D1,&#8221; which
Grassley said is a reference to Mayorkas, &#8220;was working
directly&#8221; with an attorney for Gulf Coast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayorkas, a nominee to become deputy director of Homeland
Security, said in a Senate hearing last month that GreenTech was
treated no differently than any other EB-5 project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, Mayorkas said the &#8220;EB-5 program is indeed
controversial, and it is extraordinarily complex.&#8221; He said he
added economists and business analysts to the immigration agency
to help vet the projects and the jobs claims they ultimately
submitted to remove visa conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the inception of the program through the end of the
last fiscal year, 23,599 investors have asked for green cards.
The government gave conditional approval to about half of them,
and just 4,843 have been granted permanent residency, according
to a document provided to Bloomberg by the Citizenship and
Immigration Services agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Economic Impact &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on those numbers, the agency calculates that the
program created at least 49,000 jobs over the years and pumped
at least $6.8 billion in foreign capital into the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A GreenTech press release last week reported the company
employs more than 80 workers and is still building its main
production plant in Tunica, Mississippi. The company has a
smaller facility in nearby Horn Lake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marshall Molen, a professor of vehicle design at
Mississippi State University, said he&#8217;d toured the Horn Lake
site several months ago and spotted a handful of employees and
&#8220;maybe two&#8221; MyCar vehicles being assembled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Are they alive?&#8221; the professor asked when a reporter
called with questions about GreenTech. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t heard anyone
out here mention them in quite some time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (SUNP),
India&#8217;s biggest drugmaker by market value, posted a 56 percent
increase in profit before a one-time charge as sales of its
generic drugs in the U.S. climbed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit before a one-time payment to settle a patent
litigation with Pfizer Inc. was 12.41 billion rupees (204.8
million) in the quarter ended June, compared with 7.96 billion
rupees a year earlier, the Mumbai-based Sun said in a statement
today. The group reported a loss of 12.8 billion rupees during
the period, compared with a median estimate for a profit of 10.3
billion rupees in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you exclude the one-time payment, which was known to
the market, the sales, margins and profits have all beaten our
estimates,&#8221; said Ranjit Kapadia, an analyst at Centrum Broking
Pvt. &#8220;We expect the stocks to rally about 5 percent&#8221; on Aug.
12. Centrum will maintain its buy rating on the stock and revise
the target price of 628 rupees, Kapadia said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sun, controlled by billionaire Dilip Shanghvi, paid 25.2
billion rupees to Pfizer (PFE) to settle the litigation over sales of
heartburn drug Protonix, the company said. Sun agreed in June to
pay $550 million as settlement, compared with the $100 million
it had set aside for the damages. Sun and Teva Pharmaceutical
Industries Ltd. will together pay $2.15 billion to Pfizer and a
partner to settle the litigation, Pfizer said in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales increased 31 percent to 34.8 billion rupees in the
three months ended June from a year earlier, Sun said. Sales of
finished dosages in the U.S. grew 28 percent to $364 million in
the first quarter from a year earlier, it said. Overseas sales
accounted for 57 percent of Sun&#8217;s total revenue in the year
ended in March 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sun&#8217;s shares have advanced 50 percent to 505.70 rupees in
the past year, the most among the 30 companies on the benchmark
SP BSE Sensex. The 17-member SP BSE India Healthcare Index has
rallied 21 percent in the past year compared with an advance of
7 percent on the Sensex. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s &#8220;Planes,&#8221; a low-cost animated feature that began life as a direct-to-DVD
project, is shaping up as a potential moneymaker for theaters in
a summer marked by slow sales for big-budget films. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie, inspired by Pixar&#8217;s &#8220;Cars,&#8221; opens today. The
picture went from DVD-only to cinemas when Disney, the world&#8217;s
largest entertainment company, saw how test audiences responded
to a rough cut, Dave Hollis, the studio&#8217;s executive vice
president for sales and distribution, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was off the charts,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Produced for about a fourth of what big budget movies cost,
&#8220;Planes&#8221; could generate $21 million this weekend and $81
million in its domestic run, according to Boxoffice.com.
Animated films typically do more outside the U.S., and Disney
already has &#8220;Planes&#8221; toys and apparel in stores. The film was
made for about $50 million, according to a company official who
asked not to be named because the figure isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Planes&#8221; could be a surprise success because of its lower
price tag, according to David Weitzner, a movie marketing
consultant who teaches at the University of Southern
California&#8217;s School of Cinematic Arts. &#8220;The Lone Ranger,&#8221; a
July release from Burbank, California-based Disney, may lose as
much as $190 million, the company said on Aug. 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney executives &#8220;see where the market is going, what
families are looking for, and are bringing it in at a price that
makes sense,&#8221; Weitzner said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DisneyToon Studios &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Planes&#8221; is about a cropdusting aircraft named Dusty with
a fear of heights and dreams of racing. It has a similar look
and feel as the two &#8220;Cars&#8221; movies, from Disney&#8217;s Pixar, which
have collected a combined $1 billion worldwide in ticket sales,
according to researcher Box Office Mojo. Comedian Dane Cook
supplies the voice for Dusty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Planes&#8221; was produced by DisneyToon Studios, a division
specializing in low-budget animated features mostly for home
video. &#8220;The Jungle Book 2,&#8221; a $20 million theatrical release
from the division in 2003, had $135.7 million in worldwide
sales, according to Box Office Mojo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Lasseter, who joined Disney as chief creative officer
of the animation studios following the company&#8217;s acquisition of
Pixar in 2006, scaled back the unit&#8217;s production after voicing
dissatisfaction with the quality of direct-to-home features.
DisneyToon Studios has been releasing about one movie a year,
down from six a decade ago, according to researcher IMDB.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Action Films &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timing of &#8220;Planes&#8221; may help, according to Paul Dergarabedian, president of the box-office division at market
researcher Hollywood.com. It comes on a weekend when other new
pictures are aimed at older theatergoers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;August can be the land of opportunity for movies that
aren&#8217;t hardcore action films,&#8221; Dergarabedian said. &#8220;It&#8217;s sort
of like counter programming.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Elysium,&#8221; a science-fiction film from Sony Corp.
starring Matt Damon and Jodie Foster, also opens today. &#8220;Percy
Jackson: Sea of Monsters,&#8221; based on a series of young-adult
novels, opened Aug. 7 and targets older kids than &#8220;Planes&#8221;
because of its PG rating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Planes&#8221; will compete with three animated films still in
theaters: &#8220;The Smurfs 2,&#8221; in its second week, the hit film
&#8220;Despicable Me 2&#8221; in its sixth week, and &#8220;Turbo,&#8221; in its
fourth week. The picture is opening in 3,700 theaters, according
to Hollywood.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Planes&#8217; Toys &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Cars&#8221; is among Disney&#8217;s largest toy franchises,
generating more than $10 billion in retail sales since the first
picture&#8217;s release in 2006, the company has said. Last year&#8217;s
Cars Land addition to the company&#8217;s California Adventure park in
Anaheim, California, led to a 23 percent jump in attendance,
according to the Themed Entertainment Association. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney has already released &#8220;Planes&#8221; related merchandise,
including $6 diecast airplanes, $13 story books and $18
children&#8217;s jackets. A sequel, &#8220;Planes: Fire  Rescue,&#8221; is
scheduled for theaters in July 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertising and word-of-mouth from the theatrical release
could lead to higher sales of the DVD and merchandise tied to
the film, according to David Paiko, vice president of business
development at Rentrak Corp. (RENT), a media measurement firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All those marketing dollars to promote it theatrically
puts an awareness into people&#8217;s minds,&#8221; he said in an
interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s &#8216;Cars&#8217; in the sky.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authorities plan to arrest two
former JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) employees on fraud charges related
to their role in a trading loss last year, the New York Times
reported, citing people briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Javier Martin-Artajo and Julien Grout, who worked in the
bank&#8217;s London office, will probably be taken into custody in
coming days, the newspaper reported. They are natives of other
European countries and British authorities may not be able to
locate them, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An attorney for Martin-Artajo didn&#8217;t immediately reply to
requests for comment from Bloomberg News. An attorney for Grout
and spokesmen for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S.
Attorney&#8217;s Office declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors determined that Martin-Artajo and Grout, who
worked in a London unit that lost more than $6 billion last
year, concealed losses from their managers in New York, the
newspaper said. The case hinges on help from Bruno Iksil, who
was dubbed the London Whale because of his trading positions&#8217;
outsized effects on credit-derivative markets, according to the
New York Times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iksil, who some investigators decided had been unfairly
blamed for the losses, met with authorities in Brussels and New
York and secured a cooperation agreement with the U.S.
government, the newspaper reported. It isn&#8217;t clear whether he
could face charges, according to the paper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Report &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An attorney for Iksil declined to comment to Bloomberg
News, as did Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for JPMorgan in New
York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, is also
negotiating the final terms of a deal with the Securities and
Exchange Commission to end a yearlong probe of the trading loss,
two people briefed on the talks said on Aug. 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank, led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, is
seeking to resolve U.S. and U.K. probes after botched trades by
its chief investment office led to the losses and an earnings
restatement. Senate investigators concluded in March that the
bank dodged regulators and misled investors about the souring
bets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s own 129-page report on the losses, released in
January, found that London traders initially tried to hide
losses on the positions. The employees left the bank and the
bank sought to claw back pay. The report also blamed managers,
some of whom were reassigned or left the bank, for failing to
halt the losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo, who supervised Iksil, in January settled a
London lawsuit brought against him by the bank, a person with
direct knowledge said at the time. The bank sued Martin-Artajo
in October without detailing its allegations in filings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three former managing directors of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s Japan business plan to start an Asia multi-strategy hedge fund early next year, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Koji Gotoda and Takayuki Kasama have incorporated Golvis Investment Pte in Singapore, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the information is private. The fund will invest in all asset classes with an initial focus on Japan, they added. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Japan-focused hedge funds have historically traded stocks, making a company staffed by a large team of former Goldman Sachs employees and capable of investing in multiple asset classes a rarity, one of the people said. The New York-based bank, once Wall Street&#8217;s most profitable securities firm, generated about half of its revenue from trading last quarter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The pedigree of the principals will guarantee they at least get a good hearing from prospective allocators,&#8221; Peter Douglas, principal of Singapore-based GFIA Pte, which advises on hedge-fund investments. &#8220;After many years of slow death or exile for the Japanese hedge fund industry, it does feel as if the industry, like the country, could be on the verge of a renaissance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gotoda most recently led Asia convertible bond trading at Goldman Sachs before leaving in July, said the other person. Kasama, a former co-head of Japan credit trading, left the New York-based bank in June. Both were among 272 promoted to managing directors in 2009, according to an internal memo at that time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks fell, giving the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index its fifth drop in six sessions, as data showed a slowdown in Japan&#8217;s economic growth and investors awaited tomorrow&#8217;s report on America&#8217;s retail sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tesla Motors Inc. declined 3.7 percent as Lazard Capital Markets LLC downgraded the carmaker&#8217;s shares. Sysco Corp. fell 5.8 percent after results missed analysts&#8217; estimates. Apple Inc. advanced 2.8 percent after winning a patent-infringement battle against Samsung Electronics Co. BlackBerry (BBRY) Ltd. rallied 10 percent as the company&#8217;s board said it is exploring alternatives, including a possible sale. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 (SPX) fell 0.1 percent to 1,689.47 at 4 p.m. in New York, extending its loss from a record high to 1.2 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 5.83 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 15,419.68. About 5 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, 20 percent below the three-month average. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have growth frustratingly low offset by discount rates that are unnaturally low,&#8221; Joe Costigan, director of equity research at Bryn Mawr Trust Co. in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, said in a phone interview. His firm oversees $6.7 billion. &#8220;As long as that&#8217;s the case, the market will stay locked at least into September and you&#8217;ll see days like this with low volume and really not a lot of conviction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 declined 1.1 percent last week, its biggest drop in seven weeks, and the Dow dropped 1.5 percent in the period, snapping a string of six weekly advances, amid growing speculation the Federal Reserve will pare bond purchases this year as the economy strengthens. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;SP Rally &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 has rallied 18 percent so far in 2013 and closed at a record 1,709.67 on Aug. 2. The index is trading at 15.3 times projected earnings, up from 13.1 times on the first trading day of this year. That compares with a five-year average of 13.9 times, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Better-than-estimated corporate earnings and central bank stimulus, including record-low borrowing rates, have helped equities rally, with the SP 500 surging more than 150 percent from its bear-market low in 2009. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of the 450 companies in the SP 500 that have reported quarterly results this period, 72 percent have exceeded analysts&#8217; profit estimates, with earnings rising 2.8 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen a rally with a multiple expansion and not necessarily earnings growth,&#8221; Jeff Schwarte, a money manager who helps oversee about $290 billion in Des Moines, Iowa, at Principal Global Investors, said by phone. &#8220;We need to see earnings, we need to see some resolution on tapering.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Economic Data &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investors have been scrutinizing economic data to determine whether growth is strong enough for the Fed to curtail its monthly bond buying. A Commerce Department report tomorrow will show that retail sales rose for a fourth consecutive month in July, economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted. A Fed release on Aug. 15 may show factories, mines and utilities increased their output in July. On Aug. 16, reports will probably show that housing starts and building permits rebounded last month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Asia, government reports showed Japan&#8217;s gross domestic product growth slowed from the first quarter to a pace below economists&#8217; forecasts while Chinese factor production increased a higher-than-expected 9.7 percent in July. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stock swings have narrowed. The SP 500&#8217;s average intraday price changes averaged about 0.7 percent over the past 30 days, the smallest fluctuation since a comparable period ended Feb. 21, data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or VIX, retreated 4.5 percent to 12.81. The equity volatility gauge reached its 2013 peak in June and has since dropped 37 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Weighing Penalties &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seven of 10 main groups in the SP 500 fell today, with utility and energy stocks sinking at least 0.5 percent to lead the retreat. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. lost 0.8 percent to $54.09, the stock&#8217;s seventh straight decline. Prosecutors are weighing penalties for the bank, including a fine and a reprimand, related to allegations staff tried to conceal losses last year, the New York Times reported. The U.S. may announce charges as early as this week against former London-based employees, a person familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tesla (TSLA) slumped 3.7 percent to $147.38. Investors are pricing in the company&#8217;s development into a successful premium manufacturer similar to Porsche Automobil Holding SE over the next decade, and any &#8220;execution issues&#8221; with its electric car models could send the shares down to $100, Aditya Satghare, an analyst with Lazard, wrote in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Sysco, Apple &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sysco fell 5.8 percent, the most in the SP 500, to $32.99. The food distributor said it will not meet its fiscal 2015 earnings forecast as weak restaurant traffic hurt profit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple advanced 2.8 percent to $467.36, snapping a four-day losing streak. The U.S. International Trade Commission on Aug. 9 said Samsung Electronics infringed two Apple patents and issued an order banning imports of products using the iPhone maker&#8217;s multitouch features and headphone jack detection. &#60276; F5 Networks (FFIV) Inc. gained 3.1 percent to $92.70. Barclays Plc analyst Ben Reitzes upgraded the Internet software provider to overweight from equalweight, citing improved prospects in the company&#8217;s networking business and &#8220;significant&#8221; opportunities to provide security solutions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;BlackBerry jumped 10 percent, the most since March 11, to $10.78. The mobile device maker said it has formed a special committee to explore options including a sale of the company or a joint venture. Its shares slumped 18 percent this year through the end of last week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;J.C. Penney &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Newmont Mining Corp., the world&#8217;s second-biggest gold producer, gained 4.7 percent to $30.90 for the largest increase in the SP 500, as the precious metal rose a fourth day, the longest rally in almost a month. Barrick Gold Corp, Newmont Mining&#8217;s bigger rival, added 4.5 percent to $18.21. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;J.C. Penney Co. gained 2.3 percent to $13.17. The stock erased an earlier decline people familiar with the situation said shareholders Soros Fund Management LLC and Glenview Capital Management LLC support the current management team in a dispute between Bill Ackman and Chairman Tom Engibous over the company&#8217;s leadership. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ackman, whose Pershing Square Capital Management LP owns about 18 percent of the retailer&#8217;s shares, asked his fellow J.C. Penney directors last week to expedite the search for a new chief executive officer and to replace Engibous. The stock tumbled 5.8 percent Aug. 9 and has lost 33 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Lu Wang in New York at lwang8@bloomberg.net; Nick Taborek in New York at ntaborek@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Lynn Thomasson at lthomasson@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mexico&#8217;s President Enrique Pena Nieto presented a bill to Congress today that would end a seven-decade state energy monopoly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pena Nieto plans to allow private companies such as Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Chevron Corp. (CVX) to pump crude for the first time
since 1938 by changing articles 27 and 28 of the constitution,
he told reporters today in Mexico City. Under the proposal,
companies would receive a portion of profit within a risk-sharing model that would also allow them to book a percentage of
reserves under U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules,
said Deputy Energy Minster Enrique Ochoa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill to loosen state-owned Petroleos Mexicanos&#8217;s grip
on production and attract investment needed to reverse an eight-year output drop would be the economy&#8217;s biggest overhaul since
the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994. An even more
aggressive proposal delivered last month by an opposition party
increases Pena Nieto&#8217;s chances of pushing his bill through
Congress, said Nomura Holdings Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The risk-sharing or profit-sharing contracts have a long-term economic interest that the SEC registers to define the
percentage&#8221; that a company can use to book reserves from a
project, Ochoa told reporters in Mexico City. &lt;/p&gt;

direct knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corfield, who was with Deutsche Bank since May 2012, will

&lt;p&gt;Yahoo Japan Corp. (4689), operator of the
country&#8217;s most-visited Web portal, said it hired Ryu Hirayama, a
former banker at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) in Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hirayama, who was vice president of investment banking at
Goldman Sachs, joined Yahoo Japan on Aug. 1, and the company
hasn&#8217;t decided on his position, said Junji Miyahara, a spokesman
for Yahoo Japan. Hirayama advised on mergers and acquisitions
while at Goldman, according to a person with knowledge of the
matter who asked not to be identified because personnel matters
aren&#8217;t discussed publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo Japan, whose largest shareholder is billionaire
Masayoshi Son&#8217;s SoftBank Corp. (9984), has announced at least eight
mergers and acquisitions worth about $670 million since April
2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company said
in June it&#8217;s targeting a 77 percent increase in earnings during
the next six years through expanding its e-commerce business and
offering more services for smartphones and tablet computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Domestic mergers and acquisitions are very critical&#8221; for
Yahoo Japan, said Hiroshi Naya, an analyst at Ichiyoshi Research
Institute Inc. &#8220;Yahoo Japan may look for joint ventures and
collaborations with newspapers, broadcasters or the financial
industry,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bruno Iksil, the former JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) trader whose bets caused more than $6.2 billion in losses last year, is now central to any U.S. charges against his former colleagues. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Iksil, the Frenchman who became known as the London Whale because of his trading book&#8217;s size, has been cooperating with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Manhattan U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office for months in their probe of the New York-based bank&#8217;s biggest trading debacle ever, said three people with direct knowledge with the matter. Iksil won&#8217;t face charges as long as he cooperates and testifies, the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prosecutors may announce charges as early as this week against former London-based JPMorgan employees, accusing them of trying to mask losses on a complex derivatives portfolio, said another person who asked not to be named because the investigation isn&#8217;t public. The episode already has sparked a Senate hearing and prompted JPMorgan&#8217;s board to cut Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon&#8217;s pay in half. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Jamie Dimon really wants to put this issue behind the bank,&#8221; said Christopher Wheeler, an analyst at Mediobanca SpA in London who has an outperform rating on JPMorgan shares. Charges against former employees would mean &#8220;JPMorgan will have to put up with having its dirty linen washed in public.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the politically inflammatory issue of U.S. companies holding trillions of dollars in profits overseas, two tech firms get the lion's share of attention and blame for the practice: Apple and Cisco Systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's because their chief executive officers, Tim Cook and John Chambers, have been among the most vocal lobbyists for a tax holiday to bring the cash home at a rate lower than the 35 percent currently required by the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Apple and Cisco aren't the biggest hoarders of overseas cash. According to Bloomberg Rankings, which looked at the regulatory filings of the 70 companies in the SP 500 Information Technology Index and the five in the SP 500 Internet  Catalog Retail Index, the distinction belongs to Microsoft and IBM. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft had $76.4 billion and IBM had $44.4 billion in foreign profits on their books in 2012 that were untaxed by the U.S., according to the documents. The companies were followed by Cisco, with $41.3 billion, and Apple, with $40.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft responded to a request for comment by pointing to congressional testimony from September, when Bill Sample, corporate vice president for worldwide tax at Microsoft, said that U.S. taxes on foreign earnings create a "disincentive for U.S. investment" and need changing to be competitive with many U.S. trading partners. IBM did not respond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's estimated that U.S. corporations have more than $2 trillion in offshore earnings that are not being taxed by the U.S. As my colleague Jesse Drucker has reported, companies funnel cash overseas to lower their tax rates and in some cases have figured out ways to bring the money home tax-free through acquisitions and other means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Obama has waded into the issue. In February 2012 he proposed reducing the top corporate rate for most companies to 28 percent from 35 percent while eliminating tax breaks and changing other core features of the tax code. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the central concerns about a tax holiday is that it was tried before - in 2004 - and it did little to encourage the companies that took advantage of the break to create jobs or spur domestic investment, several independent economic studies have shown. However, the holiday did encourage companies to do one thing: to hoard overseas profits in expectation of another tax break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chambers may address the overseas topic when Cisco reports earnings on Wednesday. He's said in the past that the issue has "well over a 60 percent probability of being resolved in a positive way." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever the eventual outcome, one thing is certain: The following companies have a deeply vested interest in it. Here are the top 25 U.S. technology companies with the most untaxed overseas profits:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Microsoft, $76.4 billion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. IBM, $44.4 billion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Cisco Systems, $41.3 billion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Apple, $40.4 billion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Hewlett-Packard, $33.4 billion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. Google, $33.3 billion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7. Oracle, $26.2 billion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;8. Dell, $19.0 billion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;9. Intel, $17.5 billion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;10. Qualcomm, $16.4 billion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;11. Corning, $11.9 billion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;11. EBay, $11.9 billion &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;13. Xerox, $8.3 billion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;14. EMC, $8.1 billion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;15. Western Digital, $6.3 billion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;16. Texas Instruments, $5.5 billion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;17. Western Union, $4.4 billion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;18.

MasterCard, $2.6 billion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(TE Connectivity, with $18 billion in overseas cash, and Seagate Technology with $2.8 billion, were excluded from the list because both are based outside the U.S.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methodology: Bloomberg ranked the 70 companies in the SP 500 Information Technology Index, along with the five companies in the SP 500 Internet  Catalog Retail Index, based on the amount of undistributed earnings held outside the U.S. The top 25 companies are displayed.

&lt;p&gt;Investors had declared the stock of AllianceBernstein Holding LP (AB) a loser. From Jan. 1, 2010, to Aug. 23, 2012, it had declined 43 percent compared with a 33 percent gain for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. Nevertheless, on that day, Credit Suisse Group AG analyst Craig Siegenthaler lifted his rating on the New York-based money manager&#8217;s shares to a buy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Many investors had left it for dead,&#8221; Siegenthaler says. &#8220;It was a tough stock to even bring up in front of investors. Underneath the low valuation, the company was really in a transformational period.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since his call, AllianceBernstein&#8217;s shares have outperformed the SP 500 by almost threefold, with the stock returning 73 percent for the year ended on Aug. 14. In recommending the shares to Credit Suisse customers, Siegenthaler said that the company was cutting expenses and that fixed-income sales were improving, Bloomberg Markets magazine will report in its September issue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More from the September issue of Bloomberg Markets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Siegenthaler&#8217;s calls on stocks such as AllianceBernstein helped make him and his Credit Suisse partner, Howard Chen, the top U.S. analysts of brokerage and asset management firms in 2012, according to a ranking of stock analysts by consulting firm Greenwich Associates and Bloomberg Markets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He currently has buy recommendations on private-equity firm Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG) and Zions Bancorporation. (ZION) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Analysts Surveyed &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;To compile the ranking, Stamford, Connecticut-based Greenwich Associates surveyed 945 buy-side analysts at 190 investment management firms, mutual funds, hedge funds, pension funds and insurers from December to March. The analysts were asked to name the Wall Street research teams they considered their most important sources of advice on investments. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s research unit, under Noelle Grainger, the bank&#8217;s head of equity research in the Americas, scored the largest number of highly ranked analysts, making it the No. 1 firm in U.S. equities research for the fourth consecutive year, according to Greenwich Associates. Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research unit was No. 2, followed by Morgan Stanley. (MS) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Research directors and analysts say the big news in their field is that the era of correlation -- when stocks move up or down in unison in reaction to macroeconomic events -- is finally ending. Weakening correlation signals that investors are less obsessed with big issues like Europe&#8217;s debt crisis, the U.S. fiscal deficit and China&#8217;s growth trajectory. They&#8217;re looking instead at more stock-specific investment drivers such as earnings, technology innovations and market share, Grainger says. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Adding Value &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;In 2012, people started to be willing to put a little more risk on the table,&#8221; Grainger says. &#8220;It was a year where analysts could add more value based on their industry and company expertise.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was also a year in which the tide lifted a lot of boats. More than 300 of the stocks in the SP 500 index saw returns in excess of 10 percent in 2012, including reinvested dividends. As the index surged, driven by four straight years of profit growth and three rounds of Federal Reserve stimulus, companies&#8217; stocks began to break away from the pack and move up or down on their merits. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;From the stock pickers&#8217; side, two things stuck out in the past year,&#8221; says Brett Hodess, the head of Americas equity research at BofA Merrill Lynch. &#8220;It was still very important to look at macro events in order to see which sectors would be most favored. Then you had to figure out who the winners and losers would be. That was the way to outperform.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Calculating Correlation &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The correlation among SP 500 companies fell to an average of 0.59 last year, according to data compiled by Westport, Connecticut-based research firm Birinyi Associates Inc. A reading of 1.0 indicates they&#8217;re all moving in the same direction by the same amount. In 2011, stocks had moved in unison by the most since at least 1980, reaching a record correlation of 0.86 in October as prices tumbled, according to Birinyi. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Heather Bellini, a software analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) who ranked second in her industry, started coverage of Salesforce.com (CRM) Inc. in July 2011, putting the largest maker of customer-management software on Goldman&#8217;s buy list. She saw cash flow rising on the continued success of Salesforce&#8217;s Sales Cloud -- its core product -- as well as newer offerings such as the Service Cloud customer-support software. The shares fell after her July 12, 2011, buy recommendation and then gained 66 percent in 2012. The stock is up 6.3 perpercent this year as Aug. 14. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bellini now has buy recommendations on Facebook Inc. (FB) and Oracle Corp. (ORCL) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Reassessing Private Equity &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse (CSGN)&#8217;s Chen took a new look at publicly listed private-equity firms, including Apollo Global Management LLC, Blackstone Group LP (BX) and Carlyle Group LP. (CG) Investors are still struggling to properly value them, he says. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Private-equity firms lock up investor money for as long as a decade while they buy companies, overhaul them and, if all goes well, sell them for a profit. The firms, which use debt to finance the deals, typically charge an annual management fee of 1.5 percent to 2 percent and keep 20 percent of profits from investments. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Valuing the firms had traditionally consisted of a sum-of-the-parts analysis -- marking the value of investments every quarter, according to Chen. He argued in a February 2012 report to change that metric and judge the firms based on their longer-term cash earnings generated from management fees and profits from investments. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;False Precision&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;To me, sum of the parts has a false sense of precision,&#8221; Chen says. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t get to the heart of how these companies create value and why they&#8217;ve been so successful.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apollo and Blackstone were the best positioned in 2012 to deliver the biggest growth in cash earnings, Chen says. He maintained his buy calls on both firms throughout the year. From Chen&#8217;s Feb. 7, 2012, note calling for a new valuation methodology, Apollo returned 129 percent as of yesterday&#8217;s close and Blackstone, 46.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chen today has buy recommendations on IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE) and asset manager State Street Corp. (STT) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The top analyst of large-cap banks in the Greenwich Associates/Bloomberg Markets ranking is Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. In one of her best calls, she saw bad news for JPMorgan as good news for investors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Double Down&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;On May 18, 2012, eight days after the biggest U.S. bank by assets announced a $2 billion trading loss in the firm&#8217;s London chief investment office, Graseck published a note telling investors to &#8220;double down&#8221; on the shares, which had plunged 27 percent from their March 2012 peak. The trading losses were attributed to Bruno Iksil, known in the market as the London Whale, and ultimately totaled at least $6.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We pounded the table post-Whale,&#8221; Graseck says. &#8220;The view was that management had the skills to be able to work with the Street and get the portfolio risks reduced.&#8221; JPMorgan stock returned 67.6 percent from her May report to yesterday&#8217;s close. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another Graseck winner was Atlanta-based SunTrust Banks (STI) Inc., which she upgraded to a buy on July 2, 2012, after digging into data that showed a recovery in the housing market in the Southeastern U.S. SunTrust is the biggest lender in Georgia and has branches in Florida, Maryland and North Carolina. She also saw that SunTrust would benefit from a new wave of refinancing following the extension of the federal Home Affordable Refinance Program, which allows Americans with little home equity to refinance. Shares of SunTrust rallied 42.9 percent from her call to Aug. 14. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Trade Routes &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Graseck&#8217;s Morgan Stanley colleague Bill Greene ranks No. 1 in transportation. One of his best calls was a sell in March 2010 on Expeditors International (EXPD) of Washington Inc., which assists companies in shipping goods across international borders. Most of Expeditors&#8217; business is on trade routes across the Pacific Ocean, especially between China and the U.S. Greene predicted that the company&#8217;s growth would stumble as freight flows shifted to emerging markets -- between China and Vietnam, for example. In addition, companies were increasingly near-shoring, or relocating factories and offices closer to headquarters, resulting in fewer international shipments. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;All of these factors were head winds to growth,&#8221; Greene says. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Starting in the fourth quarter of 2011, Expeditors&#8217; profits missed analysts&#8217; estimates for six straight quarters, sending shares down 2 percent in 2012. They&#8217;ve returned 3.2 percent this year as of yesterday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;One-by-One &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While judging stocks one by one has become easier, what hasn&#8217;t changed since the financial crisis is investors&#8217; demand for research on global investment themes. Analysts now collaborate across industries and regions in order to produce comprehensive reports that identify worldwide trends. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Companies are competing across traditional lines,&#8221; Goldman software analyst Bellini says. &#8220;One thing that&#8217;s important for us is to make sure we break down the silos that are set up due to the way the industries are covered. This lets us present portfolio managers with research that&#8217;s more unified and consistent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bellini teamed up with William Shope Jr., Goldman&#8217;s technology hardware analyst, who&#8217;s tied for third in his group in the Greenwich Associates/Bloomberg Markets survey, and Michael Bang, a Seoul-based analyst at the firm, on a December report that noted how Apple Inc. (AAPL), Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) and Facebook would all benefit from changing trends in how consumers use smartphones and tablets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Defying the Crisis &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stephen Penwell, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s director of North American equity research, says his firm did a report that featured companies whose profit margins had risen even as global economic events such as the European debt crisis had intensified. They included discount chain Dollar General Corp. (DG), Dunkin&#8217; Brands Group Inc. (DNKN) and Web services firm Rackspace Hosting Inc. (RAX) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Good old-fashioned stock picking is coming back in vogue,&#8221; Penwell says. &#8220;Clients are beginning to make more bets and bigger bets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If investors are looking to make a big bet on AllianceBernstein, Craig Siegenthaler says they&#8217;re late to the party. On July 3, he concluded the shares would no longer outperform relative to other asset managers and downgraded them to a hold. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How We Crunched the Numbers &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;To create rankings of the top U.S. analysts by industry, Bloomberg Rankings worked with Greenwich Associates, a consultant to financial services firms. From December through March, Greenwich Associates interviewed buy-side analysts who use Wall Street research, asking each respondent to list the 10 firms they regarded as the most important sources of information on the industries they cover. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About 60 percent of these discussions were in person; the balance were conducted online. Greenwich Associates interviewed a total of 945 analysts at 190 institutions, including banks, insurance companies, investment management firms, mutual funds, pension funds and hedge funds. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These accounts represent an estimated total of $4.7 billion in commissions, or an average of almost $30 million in commissions per buy-side institution. Participating institutions were placed in seven tiers based on the commissions they generated. The responses of top-tier accounts received the greatest weight. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Greenwich Associates received responses for 58 industries, and we included in the ranking the 34 industries that had at least 45 responses. For the final ranking, Bloomberg Markets researched and added the names of the sell-side analyst or analysts with prime responsibility for tracking each industry. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Commission Weighted &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Greenwich Associates listed as many as five winning firms for some industries and as few as two for others. The number of firms selected was a function of their commission-weighted share of the institutional vote. Statistical ties occurred when the difference between weighted shares was small. When the difference between the second- and third-ranked firms was substantial, no No. 3 firm was named. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Inyoung Hwang in London at ihwang7@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Michael Serrill at mserrill@bloomberg.net. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) said today it won its biggest cloud-computing contract
from the U.S. government, a 10-year agreement valued at as much
as $1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Interior Department awarded similar pacts to nine other
suppliers, including Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT), which also said the
agreement was its largest federal cloud contract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deals might reach a total of $10 billion, allowing the
agency to speed its efforts to move information to the cloud,
the Web-based pool of shared resources such as data storage and
software. Other U.S. departments may eventually tap the program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement shows that &#8220;IBM&#8217;s ability to help
governments transform with new technologies, like cloud,
continue to grow,&#8221; Michael Rowinski, a spokesman for the
Armonk, New York-based company, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The award is a coup following IBM&#8217;s loss to Amazon.com Inc.
in the competition for a four-year, $600 million cloud contract
with the Central Intelligence Agency. IBM may get another chance
at that business following a successful protest to a federal
office that arbitrates contract disputes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Interior Department awards were issued in May,
the work and many of the companies&#8217; announcements were delayed
by CenturyLink Inc. (CTL)&#8217;s protest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CenturyLink Protest &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CenturyLink, based in Monroe, Louisiana, in March sued the
government in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, partly because
it said the Interior Department&#8217;s price and technical evaluation
criteria were unreasonable. It lost last month, and it didn&#8217;t
make the Interior Department&#8217;s list of 10 winners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency&#8217;s cloud effort may end up being the biggest
across the federal government, Afzal Bari, a senior technology
analyst for Bloomberg Government, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10 companies selected to provide services under the
contract will have a competitive advantage in the expanding
cloud-computing industry, Bari said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other winners include CGI Group Inc. (GIB) of Montreal; Verizon
Communications Inc. (VZ), based in New York; Unisys Corp. (UIS), based in
Blue Bell, Pennsylvania; and ATT Inc. (T), based in Dallas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four closely held vendors made the list. They are Aquilent
Inc., based in Laurel, Maryland; Smartronix Inc., based in
Hollywood, Maryland; Autonomic Resources LLC, based in Cary,
North Carolina; and Global Technology Resources Inc., based in
Denver. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk held as a government report showed producer prices were
little changed in July. JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) sold $750 million
of 30-year bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, rose 0.2
basis point to a mid-price of 75.5 basis points as of 4:19 p.m.
in New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors are looking at economic data including inflation
and employment reports to assess when the Federal Reserve will
begin tapering its $85 billion in monthly asset purchases that
have strengthened credit markets. The producer price index was
unchanged last month after a 0.8 percent gain in June, a Labor
Department report showed today in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Inflation is at least one metric that is not changing,&#8221;
Rajeev Sharma, who manages $1.5 billion of fixed-income assets
in New York at First Investors Management Co., said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;If we do see inflation creep up, it bodes
more to tapering happening sooner rather than later. I don&#8217;t
think the market will be excited if they see that number rise.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The credit-swaps index typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Bonds &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed policy makers have set a goal of 2 percent for
inflation. Chairman Ben S. Bernanke next month will probably
reduce the central bank&#8217;s monthly bond purchases, according to
65 percent of economists surveyed Aug. 9-13 by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan sold 5.625 percent, subordinated notes to yield
190 basis more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Proceeds will be used for general
corporate purposes, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS), the fourth-largest U.S. wireless carrier,
sold $500 million of five-year notes in its first debt offering
after merging with MetroPCS Communications Inc., Bloomberg data
show. The 5.25 percent securities were priced to yield 378 basis
points more than benchmarks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default premium on the Markit CDX North American High
Yield Index, a measure of speculative-grade corporate bond risk,
fell 0.9 basis points to 380.1 basis points, Bloomberg prices
show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average extra yield investors demand to hold
investment-grade corporate bonds rather than similar-maturity
Treasuries widened 1.4 basis points to 129.3 basis points,
Bloomberg data show. The measure for speculative-grade, or junk-rated, debt rose 3.5 basis points to 564.7 basis points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-yield, high-risk debt is rated below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service and less than BBB- at Standard  Poor&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two former JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
employees were charged by federal prosecutors with attempting to
conceal trading losses at the largest U.S. bank last year as
part of a probe of its $6.2 billion loss on derivatives bets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Javier Martin-Artajo, who oversaw trading strategy for the
synthetic portfolio at the bank&#8217;s chief investment office in
London, and Julien Grout, a trader who worked for him, were
charged with conspiracy, wire fraud and false filings in
complaints unsealed today in Manhattan federal court. The two
men engaged in a scheme to falsify securities filings between
March and May of 2012, the government said. They face as long as
20 years in prison if convicted of the most serious counts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon characterized
the loss as &#8220;the stupidest and most embarrassing situation I
have ever been a part of.&#8221; First disclosed in May 2012, the bad
bets led to an earnings restatement, a U.S. Senate subcommittee
hearing and probes by the Securities and Exchange Commission and
U.K. Financial Conduct Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. investigators said their probe is continuing, alluding
to &#8220;pressure from above&#8221; the defendants and alleged direction
from superiors in court papers and at a press conference today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank, sold $750 million of 30-year bonds in its first
dollar-denominated benchmark issue of the maturity in 20 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 5.625 percent, subordinated notes yielded 190 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Proceeds will be used for general
corporate purposes, the data show. Benchmark sales are typically
at least $500 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan issued $1.25 billion of 5.4 percent, 30-year
debentures in December 2011 to yield 250 basis points more than
benchmarks, Bloomberg data show. The notes traded at 108 cents
on the dollar to yield 4.88 percent on Aug. 12, according to
Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two former JPMorgan employees were charged today by U.S.

&lt;p&gt;Bruno Iksil, the Frenchman at the center of the case who

&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s real, the world&#8217;s worst-performing major currency since February, is likely to suffer
more losses in the run up to next year&#8217;s presidential election
as a wave of recent street protests and a weak economy throw the
race wide open, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tightening of the race in electoral polls, which until
March showed President Dilma Rousseff winning in the first
round, has become the main driver of investor sentiment and
government policy, JPMorgan said. Reflecting the uncertainty,
the bank cut its forecast for the real, which it now expects
will weaken this year to 2.35 per dollar, compared with an
earlier estimate of 2.25, and decline to 2.45 in the run-up to
the October 2014 vote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s financial markets have proven volatile before
previous elections, with the real plunging 38 percent ahead of
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva&#8217;s 2002 victory. When Rousseff disputed
her first-ever election in 2010, buoyed by the economy&#8217;s fastest
expansion in two decades, the markets remained calm. The June
protests sparked by bus fare increases, combined with
frustration over lackluster growth and rising inflation, may
indicate the country is ready for change after a decade of
Workers&#8217; Party rule, JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The tide has turned,&#8221; JPMorgan analysts including Fabio Akira and Emy Shayo Cherman wrote in the Aug. 13 report.
&#8220;Economic malaise could ignite a call for change, giving an
important edge to the opposition.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Policy Mix &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the race is too competitive to predict a winner, none
of the likely candidates represent a radical alternative to the
current policy mix, JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever wins will have to implement a &#8220;costly&#8221; adjustment
to lower inflation and boost investor confidence by better
controlling spending and opening the economy to more private
investment, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approval of Rousseff&#8217;s government plunged by half in the
wake of the protests and rebounded six percentage points to 36
percent in a Aug. 7-9 poll by Sao Paulo-based Datafolha. The
nationwide poll had a margin of error of 2 percentage points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rousseff was favored to win 35 percent of the vote in the
first round, compared with 26 percent for her nearest
challenger, former Environment Minister Marina Silva, the poll
found. Two other possible candidates, Senator Aecio Neves of the
opposition Social Democracy Party and Governor Eduardo Campos, a
government ally, trailed with 13 percent and 8 percent
respectively. To win in the first round, a candidate needs more
than 50 percent of valid votes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Falling Real &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real has fallen 13 percent against the dollar in the
past three months, more than any other major currency tracked by
Bloomberg, with investors shunning emerging markets as the U.S.
economy strengthens and the Federal Reserve signals it may scale
back its $85 billion a month bond-purchasing program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The currency weakness is complicating policy makers&#8217;
efforts to control inflation, which has been hovering near the
6.5 percent upper limit of the target range, without damping
growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Latin America&#8217;s largest economy expanded just 0.9 percent
last year, and analysts surveyed by the central bank have been
cutting their forecasts for growth this year and 2014 since the
June protests. Gross domestic product will expand 2.21 percent
this year, according to the latest survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unemployment rate is the election&#8217;s &#8220;wild card,&#8221;
JPMorgan said. After dipping to a record low of 4.6 percent last
December, the rate rose to 6 percent in June for the first time
in more than a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any further softening of the job market could further
hamper Rousseff&#8217;s chances, triggering populist measures on the
eve of the vote that would add to inflation concerns, the bank
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What until a couple of months ago was expected to be a
relatively uncompetitive contest, is now a wide-open battle
field,&#8221; the bank said. &#8220;Politics is slowly becoming the most
important domestic variable in the market outlook.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said it is delaying the release of its Xbox One console in eight countries, including Russia and the Netherlands, until 2014 in order to make sure it has enough supply for larger markets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company, which had planned to begin sales of the console in November in 21 countries, will now cut that to 13. It will push back the date for the Xbox One&#8217;s rollout in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Russia and the Netherlands. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We understand this will be disappointing news for our fans in the impacted countries, and we are doing everything we can to bring Xbox One to you as soon as possible next year,&#8221; Microsoft said in a blog post on its website. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The delayed rollout is another issue for the Xbox One, which will sell for $499 and which has already seen Microsoft reversing itself on limits for reselling and trading games, as well as a requirement to connect the console to the Internet once a day. It will compete against Sony Corp.&#8217;s (6758) PlayStation 4, which will cost $399. Both consoles are crucial to the companies&#8217; efforts to reach consumers in their living rooms. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Dina Bass in Seattle at dbass2@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Pui-Wing Tam at ptam13@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lansdowne Partners Ltd., the biggest
European hedge-fund firm focused on stock picking, reduced its
stakes in Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase  Co. during
the second quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm sold 35 million Bank of America shares in the
three months through June, reducing its stake by more than 90
percent to $35.4 million, according to a filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission today. The London-based firm
reduced its JPMorgan stake by 2.8 million shares to 15 million
shares, valued at about $804.6 million, the filing shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 24-member KBW Bank Index (BKX) rose 20 percent in the first
half of 2013, outpacing the 13 percent gain for the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. Bank of America was one of the KBW Index&#8217;s
worst performers over that period, increasing 11 percent, while
JPMorgan (JPM) gained 20 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lansdowne, which manages $13.4 billion, had held 27.5
million shares in Bank of America through its Developed Markets
fund, the firm&#8217;s biggest hedge fund. That fund sold its entire
position in the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank. The
remaining stake is held by funds including Lansdowne&#8217;s Global
Financials fund, according to the filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lansdowne financial fund sold its entire Morgan Stanley (MS)
stake of 1.9 million shares and its holding of 260,000 shares of
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), today&#8217;s filing shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lansdowne&#8217;s biggest second-quarter share increase was
Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) The firm added 5 million shares of the cable-television provider and holds a position valued at about $853.2
million, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s Developed Markets fund gained 18 percent in the
first seven months of this year, while the Global Financials
fund rose 10 percent, according to a performance note sent to
investors. Hedge funds focused on stocks rose 7.7 percent in the
same period, according to Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vietnamese seaport of Da Nang
has reached agreement on smart-water and transit technology
improvements with International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), the
world&#8217;s biggest computer-services company said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terms weren&#8217;t disclosed of the pact with Vietnam&#8217;s fourth-largest city. Da Nang Water Co. is expanding and modernizing its
water-treatment capacity using IBM&#8217;s real-time analysis and
monitoring of the water supply, IBM said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Da Nang is upgrading its water and transportation system
infrastructure using sensors to cope with urban growth and a
shortage of water in the dry season, IBM said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Water and transportation are the first two areas where we
are applying some of the most advanced technologies available,&#8221;
Pham Kim Son, director of Da Nang&#8217;s Department of Information
and Communications, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is also helping the city manage water salinity
problems. The hydropower plant on the upper part of the Vu Gia
River that provides water to Da Nang has reduced supplies to the
city, Armonk, New York-based IBM said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) broke
disclosure rules when it arranged a 1 billion-euro ($1.3
billion) exchangeable bond for Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena
SpA in 2008, the Bank of Italy told Siena prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan should have informed the central bank the Italian
lender had guaranteed it against losing money on the bond sale,
the Bank of Italy said in an April 19 letter to prosecutors
filed at a Siena court. The Bank of Italy said it may have
withheld approval for the deal had it known about the indemnity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No claim was ever made under this indemnity -- which only
existed for a matter of days -- including either for the benefit
of JPMorgan or any of its employees,&#8221; JPMorgan said in a
statement. &#8220;We believe that JPMorgan and its employees acted
correctly at all times. We will defend this action vigorously.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monte Paschi (BMPS), the world&#8217;s oldest bank, received a 4.1
billion-euro government bailout earlier this year. The
investigation into the fundraising is part of a wider probe by
prosecutors into allegations the Siena-based lender hid losses
using derivatives, manipulated markets and obstructed regulators
probing its takeover of Banca Antonveneta SpA in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monte Paschi issued notes that converted into its own
shares to boost capital following the Antonveneta purchase. As
part of the deal, the bank issued new shares to JPMorgan to
cover the potential conversion of the bonds and the central bank
authorized JPMorgan to hold about 10 percent of Monte Paschi&#8217;s
stock, the documents show. If investors failed to pay for the
notes after ordering them, Monte Paschi would have compensated
the New York-based bank, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
JPMorgan Chase  Co. should have disclosed the indemnity because it could have reduced the total amount raised for Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA and the relationship could have affected its financial dealings with the Italian lender, according to the central bank. Close

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. may announce charges as
early as today related to JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s trading losses
last year, a person familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former bank employees in London have been investigated by
the U.S. Justice Department for more than a year over whether
they tried to conceal the losses at the largest U.S. bank, a
person familiar with the matter previously said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan lost more than $6.2 billion last year on
derivatives bets. The loss, first disclosed in May 2012, led to
an earnings restatement, a Senate subcommittee hearing and
probes by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and
U.K. Financial Conduct Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The episode prompted JPMorgan&#8217;s board to cut Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon&#8217;s pay in half. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The penalties in the U.S. are significantly higher&#8221; than
in the U.K., said Jeremy Summers, a lawyer at Slater  Gordon in
London. &#8220;People faced with the possibility of being charged
here or the U.S. have sought to be dealt with here because they
are less draconian,&#8221; Summers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bruno Iksil, the former JPMorgan trader who became known as
the London Whale because of the size of his trading book and
losses, has been cooperating with the Federal Bureau of
Investigation and the Manhattan U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office for
months in their probe of the New York-based bank&#8217;s biggest
trading debacle ever, said three people with direct knowledge
with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel Loeb&#8217;s Third Point LLC, the
hedge-fund pressing Sony Corp. (6758) to sell part of its entertainment
business, acquired a $113.7 million stake in Walt Disney Co. (DIS),
extending his bet on the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third Point held 1.8 million shares of Burbank, California-based Disney at the end of June, according to a regulatory
filing yesterday by the New York-based investor. He also held
options to buy 32,000 more, the filing showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loeb was buying the stock as he pressed Tokyo-based Sony (SNE) to
sell as much as 20 percent of its film, TV and music business in
an initial public offering. The company rejected that call this
month, saying the entertainment business is a crucial part of
its corporate strategy. Loeb said he was &#8220;disappointed&#8221; and
would continue to seek a dialog with the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elissa Doyle, a spokeswoman for Third Point, declined to
comment on the holdings. Zenia Mucha, a spokeswoman for Disney,
didn&#8217;t respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney fell 2.5 percent to $62.38 at the close in New York,
valuing Loeb&#8217;s shares at about $112 million. The company has a
market value of more than $111 billion and has gained 25 percent
this year. A trust associated with the late Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs is the largest investor with a 7.3 percent
stake, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loeb&#8217;s filing didn&#8217;t show shares of Sony. The investor said
in a June 17 letter to Sony Chief Executive Officer Kazuo Hirai
that Third Point owned 70 million shares through direct
ownership and cash-settled swaps as of mid-June, and is
interested in representation on Sony&#8217;s board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Loeb Holdings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entertainment unit of Sony came under criticism from
Loeb amid disappointing box-office sales this year for two film
releases: &#8220;After Earth&#8221; and &#8220;White House Down.&#8221; Loeb pushed
for a partial sale of the division as a way to boost the
performance and accountability of Sony&#8217;s entertainment unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third Point also holds shares of Yahoo! Inc. valued at
$1.56 billion, two classes of shares in Liberty Global Plc, the
international cable TV service controlled by billionaire John Malone, and an investment in 21st Century Fox Inc., the film and
TV company controlled by Rupert Murdoch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investor also added 845,000 shares of Deerfield,
Illinois-based fertilizer maker CF Industries Holdings Inc. (CF) in
the second quarter, valued at about $144.9 million at the end of
June, according to the filing. Third Point originally disclosed
the investment in the largest U.S. producer of nitrogen
fertilizer in its second-quarter letter to investors last month,
without specifying the size of the stake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third Point also bought 8.5 million American depository
receipts of Irish pharmaceutical company Elan Corp., valued at
$120.2 million. Last month, Perrigo Co., a U.S. maker of over-the-counter medicines, agreed to buy Elan for $8.6 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world&#8217;s largest seller of computer services, agreed
to buy Israeli security-software maker Trusteer Inc., giving it
fresh tools to fight the ever-escalating tactics of hackers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is paying more than $800 million for the company, said
a person familiar with the deal, who asked not to be identified
because financial terms weren&#8217;t disclosed. As part of the
transaction, IBM will form a cybersecurity software lab in
Israel with more than 200 researchers from both companies,
according to a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trusteer sells software to protect financial institutions&#8217;
employees and customers from hackers. The startup, backed by
Israeli security entrepreneur Shlomo Kramer, aims to spot
threats conventional desktop programs miss, such as malicious
software on smartphones. IBM said Trusteer, which has offices in
Tel Aviv and Boston, serves seven of the 10 largest U.S. banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If we think of the most pressing problems which are
facing our clients today in security, a lot of it is related to
malware, fraud and sophisticated attacks,&#8221; Brendan Hannigan,
general manager of IBM&#8217;s security systems division, said in an
interview. &#8220;Trusteer had this strong technology that we didn&#8217;t
have within our division.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He declined to discuss the purchase price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trusteer Chief Executive Officer Mickey Boodaei said his
company will be able to use IBM&#8217;s sales network to distribute
its products more widely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has been buying up smaller software companies, which
generally are more profitable than hardware and services
companies, as it seeks to reach $20 in adjusted earnings per
share by 2015, from $15.25 last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cloud Expansion &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trusteer acquisition is also part of Armonk, New York-based IBM&#8217;s efforts to expand cloud-computing offerings --
services delivered to customers from remote data centers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, IBM agreed to buy Dallas-based SoftLayer
Technologies Inc., a cloud-computing storage provider that will
help it compete with Amazon.com Inc. IBM paid almost $2 billion
in that deal, a person familiar with the matter said at the
time. SoftLayer had $335 million in revenue in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM fell 0.9 percent to $185.79 at the close in New York.
The shares have dropped 3 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trusteer&#8217;s acquisition price of about $800 million was
previously reported in the Israeli press. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two months ago, Microsoft announced its most aggressive Xbox launch ever, the simultaneous release of the new Xbox One in 21 countries on four continents. Too good to be true? Yes, as it turns out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft overestimated both its ability to produce enough machines, and the time needed to translate and add local content to the Xbox dashboard, television apps and voice controls. The company said yesterday in a blog post that it's delaying the rollout in eight European countries, including Russia, Belgium and Denmark. The change allows Microsoft to prioritize bigger gaming centers like the U.S., U.K., Australia, Brazil and Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even without those eight markets, the remaining 13 countries will still make the new console's November release the biggest Xbox launch. The original Xbox's November 2001 debut was a North America-only affair. The 360 was released in November 2005, initially in the U.S. and Canada, with Europe and Japan following the next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is promising Xbox One consoles to the eight countries it's leaving out "as soon as possible in 2014." Customers who pre-ordered special first-day models of the Xbox One will get a free game as a consolation prize. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The snafu is the latest in a summer of reversals and public-relations cleanup attempts by Microsoft's Xbox unit. Since officially unveiling the console in May, the group has been trying to undo unpopular policies, like limits on used games and Internet connectivity requirements. Maybe now Microsoft can get back to telling customers what the Xbox One can do instead of what it won't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two former JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
employees were charged by U.S. prosecutors with attempting to
conceal trading losses at the largest U.S. bank last year as
part of a probe of its $6.2 billion loss on derivatives bets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Javier Martin-Artajo, a former executive who oversaw the
trading strategy at the bank&#8217;s chief investment office in
London, and Julien Grout, a trader who worked for him, were
charged with conspiracy, wire fraud and making false filings in
complaints unsealed yesterday in Manhattan federal court. The
two men engaged in a scheme to falsify securities filings
between March 2012 and May 2012, according to the government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bruno Iksil, the Frenchman at the center of the case who
became known as the &#8220;London whale&#8221; because his portfolio was
so large, signed a non-prosecution agreement with the U.S. in
June, the government said yesterday. He pledged to cooperate
with prosecutors as part of the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo was Iksil&#8217;s supervisor while Grout assisted
him in valuing his trading book. JPMorgan ousted all three last
year and sought to recoup some of their pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon characterized
the $6.2 billion loss as &#8220;the stupidest and most-embarrassing
situation I have ever been a part of.&#8221; First disclosed in May
2012, the bad bets led to an earnings restatement, a U.S. Senate
subcommittee hearing and probes by the Securities and Exchange
Commission and U.K. Financial Conduct Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, 57, pushed out senior executives including former
Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew, who oversaw the London unit
where the loss took place. The bank said it clawed back more
than $100 million in pay from employees who were involved with,
or oversaw, the trade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo, 49, and Grout, 35, are charged with four
counts, including conspiracy to falsify books and records,
commit wire fraud and falsify securities filings; falsifying
books and records; wire fraud; and making false filings to the
SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They face as long as 20 years in prison if convicted on the
most serious counts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for the bank in New York,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors in the office of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in
Manhattan said Martin-Artajo and Grout manipulated and inflated
the value of the position marks in the Synthetic Credit
Portfolio, or SCP, which the government said had been very
profitable for the bank&#8217;s chief investment office, or CIO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorneys for Martin-Artajo and Iksil declined to comment
on the charges. Grout&#8217;s lawyers didn&#8217;t respond to a request for
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC has filed a parallel civil suit in Manhattan
federal court seeking disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and
unspecified financial penalties. In the civil suit, U.S.
regulators signaled they will hold JPMorgan accountable for
violating securities laws when it disclosed inaccurate
information to investors because of allegedly deceitful
accounting by traders in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The references to the bank were contained in a lawsuit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither Martin-Artajo nor Grout is in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edward Little, a partner at Hughes Hubbard  Reed LLP in
New York who represents Grout, said in an Aug. 12 interview that
his client was living in France and isn&#8217;t a fugitive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo was on vacation, and had received no
communication telling him he shouldn&#8217;t travel, his attorneys at
Norton Rose Fulbright LLP in London said in an Aug. 13
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless the defendants surrender to authorities, the U.S.
will probably have to seek extradition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are U.S. v, Grout, 13-MAG-01976, and U.S. v.
Martin-Artajo, 13-MAG-01975, U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Company Profits Without Borders Spurs Government Scrutiny &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Policymakers around the world are stepping up efforts to
tighten rules because a growing slice of corporate profits isn&#8217;t
taxed in any country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multinational companies can legally structure transactions
so they don&#8217;t pay tax anywhere, creating &#8220;stateless income&#8221;
that is coming under attack as countries seek to fill budget
gaps. The Obama administration, Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development and tax officials from other
countries want to reach a consensus on how to combat the issue,
with more than a dozen proposals being weighed, Bloomberg BNA
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heightened scrutiny offers a chance to take action. The
largest U.S.-based companies expanded their untaxed offshore
stockpiles by $183 billion last year, or 14 percent, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. In the U.S., Senator Carl Levin
held hearings taking U.S. technology companies to task for
structures that let them pay little or no tax on billions in
profits. Representative Dave Camp is leading a tax rewrite that
he says will fix the system. Camp has signaled potential support
for a 15 percent tax on intangibles as one way to limit base
erosion, one of three options he has suggested in a discussion
draft of a new tax system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stateless income is one driver behind a plan to stop profit
shifting unveiled in July by the OECD, which calls on countries
to take action in more than a dozen areas over the next two
years. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew hailed the plan. Leaders of
the wealthiest economies, the Group of Eight nations, have
agreed to tackle tax evasion by multinational companies anew. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OECD plans to look at rules requiring taxpayers to
disclose aggressive tax planning arrangements. The plan calls
for scrutiny of facets of the digital economy that may be
vulnerable to tax manipulation and a variety of changes to
transfer pricing guidelines and a focus on &#8220;harmful tax
practices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tribal Online Lenders Ask Banks to Resist Regulatory Pressure &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An association of online lenders operated by Native
American tribes called on banks to resist pressure from New York
State to cut them off from the nation&#8217;s primary payment system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Native American Financial Services Association said the
state&#8217;s regulators are violating the tribes&#8217; sovereign immunity
when they ask banks to prevent them from making and collecting
on short-term, high-cost loans via the Internet, according to a
letter written by Barry Brandon, the group&#8217;s executive director,
to more than 100 banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks include Capital One Financial Corp. (COF), Citigroup
Inc. (C), Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase  Co., Wells Fargo 
Co. (WFC), PNC Financial Services Group (PNC) and U.S. Bancorp. (USB) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Lawsky, the New York superintendent of financial
services, on Aug. 6 ordered a group of 35 online lenders,
including at least four tribal companies, to cease offering
loans in New York. He also sent a letter to 117 banks requesting
their assistance to &#8220;choke off&#8221; the lenders from the automated

electronic bank account debits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctrine of tribal sovereign immunity limits state
interference in Native American governments&#8217; actions. Brandon
said tribal lending operations are legal, and that New York is
&#8220;doing an end-run&#8221; around the doctrine by pressuring banks and
third-party payment processors to sever ties with the tribes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brandon also wrote that tribes are considering &#8220;the next
legal steps&#8221; to take regarding the New York actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of Justice and the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. have been pressuring banks to reconsider their

&lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fed Given Week by Judge to Respond on New Swipe-Fee Rules &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Reserve was given a week to tell a federal
judge its position on immediately rewriting regulations setting
debit-card swipe fees in the wake of a court finding the current
rule unlawful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Richard Leon in Washington yesterday
ordered Fed General Counsel Scott Alvarez to appear in his
courtroom on Aug. 21 after a lawyer for the Fed said it hadn&#8217;t
made any decisions on how to replace the current rule, or
whether to appeal the judge&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the hearing, Leon laid out a timeline that would
put a final interim rule in place by the end of the month. An
interim final rule takes effect immediately before any public
comments are accepted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s hearing comes two weeks after retailers
battling banks over debit-card transaction costs were handed a
victory by Leon in Washington, who said merchants were
overcharged billions of dollars under an unlawful swipe fee set
by the Fed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision, unless overturned on appeal, will force
regulators to revisit rules that bankers said would cost them 45
percent of their swipe-fee revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is NACS v. Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System, 11-cv-02075, U.S. District Court, District of
Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Comings and Goings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yellen Beats Summers as Most Likely Fed Chair in Economists Poll &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Janet Yellen is the most
qualified and most likely candidate to run the central bank,
according to the majority of private economists in a Bloomberg
News survey that showed Lawrence Summers trailing by wide
margins in both categories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixty-five percent said Yellen probably will be President
Barack Obama&#8217;s selection to replace Chairman Ben S. Bernanke,
while 53 percent said she would do the best job, according to an
Aug. 9-13 poll of 63 economists. Twenty-five percent said
Summers, Obama&#8217;s former top economic adviser, would be the
nominee, while 10 percent said he would be best. Six percent
said former Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn is most likely choice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey results contrast with odds offered by bookmaker
Paddy Power Plc, which show Summers is the favorite. Economists
are focusing more on leadership continuity than on the political
connections underpinning Summers&#8217;s chances, according to Mark
Calabria, an economist and the director of financial regulation
studies at the Cato Institute in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), seeking to fend off
competition for its Xbox game console by souping up the Kinect
motion sensor, is tapping a new semiconductor developer: itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time, the company will build its own
processors based on an in-house design. The new chips will make
Kinect more accurate and responsive using an imaging technology
found in military gear, said Cyrus Bamji, who played a key role
in developing the silicon architecture. Previously, Kinect
relied on an off-the-shelf chip from Israel&#8217;s PrimeSense Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft joins companies such as Apple Inc. (AAPL) that are doing
more work on chips internally to add exclusive features and set
their devices apart. Microsoft will package the Kinect with the
latest version of the Xbox later this year, adding $100 to its
price. Gamers who don&#8217;t see the value may be tempted to opt for
Sony Corp. (6758)&#8217;s $399 PlayStation 4, instead of Xbox One at $499. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are seeing a big trend towards more of the hardware
makers out there, whether it&#8217;s smartphones or whether it&#8217;s
tablets, starting to bring more of that semiconductor function
in-house,&#8221; said Jon Erensen, an analyst at market-research firm
Gartner Inc. &#8220;It allows them to differentiate. Everybody in the
market is using the same off-the-shelf processor.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time of Flight &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kinect is a camera-based device that connects to the Xbox
to let users translate body motions and voice commands into game
moves -- say, in a virtual tennis or car-racing game. The newest
version of the sensor will include TV controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kinect chips, designed by a team mostly based in
Microsoft&#8217;s Silicon Valley office, use a technology called Time
of Flight that will let the sensor track minute changes in a
user&#8217;s body, like finger movements and facial expressions, a
much more precise system than the earlier version. That lets
Microsoft eliminate some of the failings of the first Kinect,
Bamji said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time of Flight works by bouncing photons off a person or
object, and has been used by military agencies for tasks like
detecting a tank hiding behind tree cover, Bamji said. Texas
Instruments Inc. and Infineon Technologies AG are also
developing chips using Time of Flight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it goes on sale, Xbox One will face tough competition
from Sony&#8217;s new PlayStation 4, as well as Nintendo Co. (7974)&#8217;s Wii U.
Kinect in the past has largely appealed to kids and casual
gamers and hasn&#8217;t had much content targeted at serious gamers,
said Rob Sanfilippo, an analyst at Kirkland, Washington-based
Directions on Microsoft. The new version may still not lure
those customers from rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Design Challenge &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#8217;s also the challenge and cost of creating a new chip
from scratch, which can run into the tens of millions of dollars
and take months of testing. One mistake in design or
manufacturing slip-up can cause months of delay to a final
product. For a company like Microsoft, with less experience in
developing chips, there&#8217;s a risk that performance may not be as
expected, Gartner&#8217;s Erensen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which announced the shift in May, follows some
of the largest consumer-electronics makers in taking over more
of its own chip design. Apple&#8217;s iPhone and iPad run on
processors that the Cupertino, California-based company designs
itself and has manufactured by Samsung Electronics Co. While the
chips are based on ARM Holdings Plc technology, Apple customized
the layout and makeup of the chip&#8217;s components. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung also is using more of its own chips in its mobile
phones, and LG Electronics Inc., HTC Corp. and Lenovo Group Ltd.
have all talked about it, Gartner&#8217;s Erensen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Taking Note &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox and WebTV units have previously done
some work designing chips, the company has never handled this
much of a chip&#8217;s design, development and assembly, said
Microsoft Distinguished Engineer Nick Baker, who leads the
silicon architecture and verification teams. The company has
about 200 people working on microprocessors. Only the mass
manufacturing for the Kinect chips has been handed off to a chip
foundry, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other groups at Microsoft are taking notice, asking the
Xbox team about their work on chips, and may even pursue a
greater role in customizing their own microprocessors, said Todd
Holmdahl, the vice president who has overseen Xbox hardware
since the development of the first version in 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Custom Features &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest software maker first moved into making
its own computer hardware last year with a line of tablets
called Surface. The company could choose to customize existing
chips in order to gain attention and new features for Microsoft-powered smartphones and tablets, which have a tiny share of both
those markets, Directions on Microsoft&#8217;s Sanfilippo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty likely that Microsoft will be getting more
into the hardware business,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So it makes sense for
them to invest more right down to the silicon so they can have
proprietary features.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That investment may be crucial to the continued success of
Xbox, the bright spot among Microsoft&#8217;s consumer businesses,
especially as sales of the company&#8217;s Windows personal-computer
software stagnate and as Surface demand disappoints. Xbox
accounted for the bulk of revenue in Microsoft&#8217;s $10.2 billion
Entertainment and Devices division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeal of Xbox One will rest partially on whether the
new chips improve on the previous Kinect. After Nintendo Co.&#8217;s
Wii introduced a handheld controller than let gamers play by
swinging and moving the device, Kinect pushed the envelope
further by integrating full-body motion and voice into games.
For some customers, it hasn&#8217;t delivered on its initial promise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m unhappy with the way it works,&#8221; Sanfilippo said of
the current Kinect. &#8220;And I&#8217;m not sure if I would want the
device if I upgrade to an Xbox One. The selling point from
Microsoft is that this one is more accurate and faster.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Precision Needed &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PrimeSense chip in the previous Kinect, which sold 24
million units, or about one for every three Xbox 360 machines,
didn&#8217;t provide the precision and responsiveness that Microsoft
needed for the device. That version has trouble reading the
motions of small children, seated players and low-light
situations, Holmdahl said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new iteration handles those situations better and can
pick up even small changes, such as a finger movement, facial
expressions and heart rate, he said, and has a field of view
that&#8217;s 60 percent bigger than the previous Kinect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the new Xbox is rolled out for the holiday shopping
season, Microsoft will see whether the new chips can make Kinect
a bigger draw for both families and hard-core gamers -- and help
justify Xbox One&#8217;s premium price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s super-important,&#8221; Holmdahl said. &#8220;We have an
opportunity to change the living room.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the same day prosecutors charged
two former JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) employees with concealing $6.2
billion of losses on derivatives trades, the bank persuaded bond
investors to lend it money for 30 years at an interest rate less
than similar securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. bank sold $750 million of bonds yesterday
that are due in 2043 and yield 5.68 percent, below the 6.38
percent average for similarly-rated, dollar-denominated
subordinated debt maturing in 20 to 40 years, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terms of the deal show that at least in the bond market,
JPMorgan is suffering little to no negative repercussions 16
months after Bloomberg News first reported that bets from its
chief investment office in London were distorting the
derivatives market. Bruno Iksil, the trader at the center of the
case who became known as the &#8220;London Whale&#8221; because his bets
were so big, pledged to cooperate with investigators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Managers have moved past the Whale story,&#8221; said Adrian Miller, director of fixed-income strategies at GMP Securities
LLC in New York. &#8220;As it relates to JPM&#8217;s future business,
investors care little at this point.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 5.625 percent, subordinated notes yielded 190 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data
show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristin Lemkau, a spokeswoman at JPMorgan in New York,
didn&#8217;t return telephone and e-mail messages seeking comment
about the new issue left after regular business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;$6 Billion Ding&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Timing is 90 percent of life,&#8221; Craig Pirrong, a former
futures trader and now a professor of finance at the University
of Houston, said of the subordinated debt issue and allegations.
&#8220;Maybe investors will figure if they can survive a $6 billion
ding no problem, the bonds are safe as can be,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said in court filings that Javier Martin-Artajo
and Julien Grout falsified the value of positions in JPMorgan&#8217;s
Synthetic Credit Portfolio, which the government said had been
profitable for the unit, raking in more than $1 billion in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclosed by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon in May
2012, the bad derivative bets led to an earnings restatement, a
U.S. Senate subcommittee hearing and probes by the Securities
and Exchange Commission and U.K. Financial Conduct Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Next Crisis&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The divergent performances by the CIO unit in 2009 and 2012
demonstrate the &#8220;yin and yang of that operation,&#8221; Pirrong said
in an e-mail. &#8220;In the next crisis, their trade could exacerbate
the problems rather than save them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps tied to the company&#8217;s debt, which
typically rise as investor confidence deteriorates, rose 0.8
basis point to a mid-price of 81.7 basis points yesterday, up
from a 2013 low of 72.3 basis points in March, according to
Bloomberg prices. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a
contract protecting $10 million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contracts, which pay the buyer face value if a borrower
fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted
debt, reached as high as 174 basis points in June 2012 as
investors sought to estimate the size of the loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan never lost its investment-grade status in the eyes
of swaps traders, according to Moody&#8217;s Corp.&#8217;s capital markets
research group. At worst, the contract&#8217;s prices climbed to
levels in September and October that implied the debt should be
rated Baa2, the second-lowest step of investment grade. Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service grades the company A2, and Standard  Poor&#8217;s
an equivalent A. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Earnings Increase &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment-grade debt is rated Baa3 or more by Moody&#8217;s and
BBB- at SP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan reported a 31 percent increase in second-quarter
profit of $6.5 billion on July 12 that beat analysts&#8217; estimates
as revenue from trading stocks and bonds climbed. It was
profitable every year during the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of the investment-grade corporate market,
&#8220;a 30-year single-A rated subordinated note yielding 190 over
is attractive,&#8221; said Bonnie Baha, the head of global developed
credit at Los Angeles-based DoubleLine Capital LP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While JPMorgan is &#8220;still big, still generating tremendous
profitability, and well-capitalized,&#8221; buying bank debt and
benefiting as yields fell relative to Treasuries, a strategy
that&#8217;s been profitable since 2009, is &#8220;getting toward the end
of the road,&#8221; she said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors have made a lot of money on that play, but going
forward, where&#8217;s the revenue generation going to come from that
drives profitability?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Narrowing Spread &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average spread investors demand to hold U.S. bank bonds
has dropped to 153 basis points through yesterday, from as high
as 834 during the financial crisis, according to the Bank of
America Merrill Lynch U.S. Banking Corporate Index. That
compares with a spread of 150 basis points for industrial debt,
from 602 basis points in December 2008, according to a Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index of U.S. industrial issuers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s new subordinated notes were priced at a spread
closer to the average industrial bond rated at the lowest level
of investment grade, which fell to 198 basis points yesterday,
according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch BBB U.S.
Industrial Excluding Financial, Telecom, Transportation and
Utility Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That enabled investors &#8220;to get BBB-like spreads while
still getting a single-A rating,&#8221; which is important for some
money managers, according to Joel Levington, managing director
of corporate credit for Brookfield Investment Management Inc. in
New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people &#8220;don&#8217;t have a perfect view of an
organization&#8217;s risk policies and how they are implemented on a
daily basis,&#8221; Levington said in an e-mail. &#8220;JPMorgan was able
to take a big hit and bounce back quickly. That says something
about the earnings power and balance sheet quality here.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp.

(LMT), which also described the agreement as its largest federal cloud contract. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The deals might reach a combined $10 billion, allowing the agency to speed its efforts to move information to the cloud, a Web-based pool of shared resources such as data storage and software. Other U.S. departments may eventually tap the program. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The agreement shows that &#8220;IBM&#8217;s ability to help governments transform with new technologies, like cloud, continue to grow,&#8221; Michael Rowinski, a spokesman for the Armonk, New York-based company, said in an e-mail yesterday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The award is a coup following IBM&#8217;s loss to Amazon.com Inc. in the competition for a four-year, $600 million cloud contract with the Central Intelligence Agency.

&lt;p&gt;A lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) by liquidators of two Bear Stearns Cos. hedge funds seeking
$1.5 billion over their collapse formally ended today after the
parties reached a settlement in June, according to court
records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns Cos., two of its former managers, and auditor
Deloitte  Touche were accused of misleading investors in two
hedge funds with holdings in subprime mortgages that imploded
and filed for bankruptcy in July 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two former Bear Stearns fund managers who were named as
defendants, Ralph Cioffi and Matthew Tannin, were acquitted
after a federal trial in Brooklyn New York in 2009 of charges
they misled investors in the funds&#8217; losses of $1.6 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint was filed by Stillwater Capital Partners LP
of New York, Essex Fund Ltd. of the Cayman Islands and Geoffrey
Varga and William Cleghorn, two liquidators appointed in the
Caymans to recover losses for investors in &#8220;feeder funds.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parties filed a stipulation with U.S. District Court
Judge Alvin Hellerstein today asking him to dismiss all claims
and counterclaims, citing an accord that was originally reached
last year. The judge issued a June 13 order that he would close
the case within 90 days if a settlement hadn&#8217;t been consummated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan bought Bear Stearns in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Varga v. The Bear Stearns Cos., 08-03397, U.S.

&lt;p&gt;InterOil Corp. (IOC) said discussions with
Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) about jointly developing Papua New Guinea
natural gas discoveries are continuing, contradicting a media
report that the talks collapsed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies entered exclusive negotiations to sell stakes
in InterOil&#8217;s Elk and Antelope fields to Irving, Texas-based
Exxon in May. InterOil, based in Whitehorse, Yukon Territory,
and run from Cairns, Australia, said today in a statement the
discussions are &#8220;ongoing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;InterOil dropped 3.2 percent to $71.70 at the close in New
York, after earlier declining as much as 12 percent. The shares
have fallen 16 percent this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;InterOil Chief Executive Officer Michael Hession told
analysts and investors during an Aug. 13 conference call that he
was abandoning efforts to build and operate a liquefied natural
gas export terminal in Papua New Guinea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, Hession said negotiations with Exxon over the
Elk and Antelope fields were progressing. The former Woodside
Energy Ltd. executive was hired last month to replace InterOil
founder Phil Mulacek, who retired in April. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) failed to sell North
Sea Forties crude even after lowering its offer. There were no
bids of offers for Russian Urals blend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angola, Africa&#8217;s second-largest oil producer, will export
55 crude cargoes in October, two more than in September, a
preliminary loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;North Sea &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron was unable to sell Forties for Sept. 6 to Sept. 8
loading at a premium of $1.15 a barrel, 30 cents less than its
offer yesterday, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and
brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No bids or offers were made for Brent, Oseberg or Ekofisk
crudes. Reported crude trading typically occurs during the
Platts window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent for October settlement traded at $110.19 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $109.79 in the previous session. The November
contract was at $109.32, a discount of 87 cents to October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North Sea Alvheim and connected oil fields were shut for
nine days of maintenance, according to Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO), which
operates the field. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Production from the Greater Alvheim Area is now shut
according to plan,&#8221; Ingvar Solberg, a Stavanger, Norway-based
spokesman said in an e-mailed response to questions. Output
halted last night at Alvheim, Volund and Vilje fields, which
feed into Alvheim&#8217;s floating production, storage and offloading,
or FPSO, vessel. The Alvheim area produces about 120,000 barrels
a day before closure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mediterranean/Urals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PKN Orlen SA closed an import tender earlier today for
100,000 metric tons of Urals for Sept. 1 to Sept. 5 loading,
according to two people with knowledge of matter who asked not
to be identified because the information is confidential. The
result wasn&#8217;t known yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OAO Surgutneftegas issued a tender to sell Urals loading on
Sept. 5 to Sept. 6 from the Baltic Sea port of Primorsk,
according to two traders who participate in the market. The
tender closes on Aug. 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;West Africa &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shipments from Angola will total 52.76 million barrels, or
1.7 million barrels a day, the plan showed. That compares with a
revised plan of 50.91 million, or 1.7 million barrels a day,
next month. Most consignments are 950,000 to 1 million barrels.
The final program will be released on Aug. 26. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exports for September increased to 53 lots from 52 after
one Saturno cargo was added, a revised shipping schedule showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigeria&#8217;s loading programs for October and official selling
prices for September are expected to be released next week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is leading
the race to take the biggest share of a stake in China Huarong
Asset Management Co. before a stock sale by the so-called bad
bank, the Financial Times reported, citing two people close to
the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley (MS) and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) have
held talks about investing in Huarong Asset&#8217;s $1.5 billion share
sale ahead of a planned listing in Hong Kong next year, the FT
said. The newspaper cited another unnamed banker as saying only
a few meetings had been held and a deal is not expected until
December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eddie Naylor, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment. Jeremy Hughes, a Deutsche Bank spokesman, declined to
immediately comment. A Morgan Stanley spokeswoman couldn&#8217;t
immediately be reached for comment. Phone calls to Beijing-based
China Huarong&#8217;s press office went unanswered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huarong Asset said in October it would seek Chinese and
foreign strategic investors and sell shares in local and
overseas markets. The nation&#8217;s Ministry of Finance owns 98.06
percent of the company, while China Life Insurance (Group) Co.
holds the rest, the ministry said in September. China Life is
the parent of publicly traded China Life Insurance Co. (2628) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huarong Asset had first-half profit after provisions of 7.5
billion yuan ($1.2 billion), the most among the four asset
management companies the government set up in the 1990s to
dispose of non-performing loans at the nation&#8217;s biggest banks,
according to a July 24 statement on the firm&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ad for Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s new Infinity video-game system features the Pixar characters Buzz Lightyear and Sulley squaring off against a phalanx of movie villains. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Real-world combat moves to toy stores Aug. 18 when Disney, the world&#8217;s largest entertainment company, introduces Infinity. The system, using technology that combines collectible figures with onscreen play, goes head-to-head with the top-selling &#8220;Skylanders&#8221; game from Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI), the largest independent U.S. video-game publisher. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For Disney Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger, Infinity represents the best shot at reviving his only unprofitable division, an interactive unit that lost $216 million last year. The product will compete with &#8220;Skylanders SWAP Force,&#8221; the next installment in a $1.5 billion franchise that Activision CEO Robert Kotick is counting on as he engineers an $8.17 billion buyout of his largest investor. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Disney is going to put a lot of marketing dollars into this platform,&#8221; said Michael Hickey, a Denver-based analyst at Benchmark Co. &#8220;They have a treasure chest of intellectual property. They&#8217;re going to market the hell out of it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Infinity links collectible figures with game consoles. When players set plastic characters from Disney&#8217;s &#8220;Pirates of the Caribbean&#8221; or &#8220;Monsters&#8221; movies on top of the unit, they appear on screen as game characters and can interact, the first time the company has put characters from different films together in a game. Additional toys and discs, introducing other characters and features, cost $5 to $13. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blackstone Group LP (BX), the world&#8217;s
biggest private-equity firm, is in talks to buy a stake in
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s European insurance business,
according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price and size of the stake to be acquired by
Blackstone&#8217;s Tactical Opportunities fund are being discussed,
and a deal still may not be reached, said the person, who
requested anonymity because the negotiations are private. The
companies were considering the sale of a minority stake, the
Financial Times reported Aug. 16, citing people familiar with
the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which said it probably will sell a majority
of London-based Rothesay Life Ltd., is doing so in part because
new rules require banks to hold more equity to absorb potential
losses on assets, a person briefed on the discussions said
earlier this month. The business, run by Goldman Sachs partner
Addy Loudiadis, 50, insures more than 10 billion pounds ($15.6
billion) of pension liabilities for companies including IAG SA&#8217;s
British Airways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christine Anderson, a spokeswoman for New York-based
Blackstone, and Michael DuVally at Goldman Sachs declined to
comment on the potential deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tactical Opportunities fund, which oversaw $2.7 billion
as of April, invests across Blackstone&#8217;s four main strategies:
private equity, real estate, credit and hedge funds. It&#8217;s led by
David Blitzer, 43, a senior managing director who started the
firm&#8217;s European private-equity business in 2002. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Basel Rules &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rothesay, which Goldman Sachs set up in 2007, had $9.66
billion of assets at the end of the second quarter, an Aug. 8
filing shows. The unit had a pretax operating profit of 266
million pounds in 2012, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Tier 1 common equity was equal to 9.3
percent of the bank&#8217;s risk-weighted assets at the end of June
under new rules from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
known as Basel III, according to the filing. The New York-based
bank has said it wants to maintain a ratio of about 9.5 percent,
or 1 percentage point higher than regulators will require. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s Tier 1 common equity was reduced by $9.87
billion because of investments in nonconsolidated financial
institutions, according to the filing. That brought its Basel
III figure to $55.8 billion, compared with $61.9 billion under
current rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurance Insider reported earlier that Goldman Sachs and
Blackstone were discussing a deal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission&#8217;s anti-bribery unit is investigating whether JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) hired the children of Chinese officials to help its
business, The New York Times reported, citing a confidential
government document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank hired the son of a former Chinese banking
regulator who is currently chairman of China Everbright Group
Ltd., a state-controlled financial company, while its Hong Kong
office employed a Chinese railway official&#8217;s daughter, according
to the report. After each appointment, the bank secured
assignments from companies connected to the new hires&#8217; parents,
according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank has not been accused of any wrongdoing, according
to the report. The government document and public records cited
by The New York Times do not indicate that the employees helped
JPMorgan secure business or that they were unqualified,
according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator in May requested records from the bank
concerning Tang Xiaoning, the son of Tang Shuangning, who since
2007 has been chairman of the China Everbright Group, according
to the report. Officials also sought information on the hiring
of Zhang Xixi, daughter of former Railway Ministry deputy chief
engineer Zhang Shuguang, the New York Times said. Both Tang and
Zhang have left JPMorgan, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd. (CCL), Australia&#8217;s
largest listed drinks company, posted first-half profit that
missed analyst estimates and said a measure of full-year
earnings would be as much as 22 percent below expectations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income fell 12 percent to A$216 million from A$246
million a year earlier, the Sydney-based company said in a
regulatory statement. That compared with the A$220 million
average estimate of three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competition in Australian supermarkets, where Woolworths
Ltd. and Wesfarmers Ltd. (WES) units have an 80 percent market share,
weighed on profits, the company said. Full-year group earnings
before interest and tax may fall as much as four percent below
last year&#8217;s result, missing the A$890 million average of 11
analyst estimates by about 22 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While the Australian non-grocery business continues to
perform well, the trading conditions in the grocery channel
continue to be challenging,&#8221; Terry Davis, group managing
director, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ebit fell 6.9 percent during the first half excluding one

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) sold North Sea Forties
crude at less than half the last traded differential in the
window, after offering the cargo for a fourth time. Total SA and
Eni SpA bought Russian Urals blend at lower prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Oil Corp. declared a force majeure on crude and
product loadings from Es Sider, Ras Lanuf, Zueitina and El Brega
ports, according to document obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;North Sea &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron sold Forties F0902 for Sept. 7 to Sept. 9 loading
at a premium of 60 cents a barrel, 55 cents less than its offer
on Aug. 16, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and
brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window. It traded at
premium of $1.25 on Aug. 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell Plc withdrew an offer for Forties loading
Sept. 3 to Sept. 5 at 35 cents more than the cash cost of North
Sea crudes for October, the survey showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No bids or offers were made for Brent, Oseberg or Ekofisk
crudes. Reported crude trading typically occurs during the
Platts window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent for October settlement traded at $110.41 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $110.19 in the previous session. The November
contract was at $109.39, a discount of $1.02 cents to October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forties lot F0902 was delayed a second time by one day to
Sept. 7 to Sept. 9, said two people with knowledge of the
loading program, asking not to be identified because the
information is confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mediterranean/Urals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total bought 100,000 metric tons of Urals crude for loading
at the Baltic Sea port of Primorsk on Aug. 30 to Sept. 3 from
Glencore Xstrata Plc at a 25 cents a barrel above Dated Brent,
the survey showed. That&#8217;s 40 cents less than the last trade
reported in the window on Aug. 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitol Group sold 80,000 tons of the Russian blend to Eni
for loading at the Mediterranean port of Novorossiysk on Aug. 30
to Sept. 3 at a premium of 15 cents to Dated Brent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four Libyan terminals &#8220;are closed due to Oil Security
Guards who are on strike at these locations since the end of
July 2013, which resulted total shutdown for these facilities
and cease of all exports,&#8221; NOC said in the document which is
dated Aug. 18 and signed by Chairman Nuri Berruien. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An NOC official said oil exports were currently at a rate
of about 500,000 barrels a day, using the port of Zawiya and
offshore loading platforms at the Mellitah, Al Jurf and Bouri
fields, while another port, Hariga, will probably resume
exports, at about 180,000 barrels a day, either tomorrow or the
day after. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OAO Surgutneftegas sold to Shell 100,000 tons of Urals
loading on Sept. 5 to Sept. 6 from the Baltic Sea port of
Primorsk via a tender, according to two traders who participate
in the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PT Pertamina, the Indonesian state-owned oil company,
bought 950,000 barrels of Azerbaijan&#8217;s Azeri Light crude for
October delivery, said a company official. The cargo is for its
Balikpapan refinery in East Kalimantan, said the official, who
asked not to be identified because he isn&#8217;t authorized to speak
to the media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PTT Pcl, Thailand&#8217;s state-owned oil company, bought 600,000
barrels of Algeria&#8217;s Saharan Blend for October delivery to IRPC
Pcl&#8217;s Rayong refinery, said two people who participate in the
market. The company bought the grade from Concord Energy Pte.,
said the people who asked not to be identified because they
aren&#8217;t authorized to speak to the media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;West Africa &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian Oil Corp. bought 1 million barrels each of Nigerian
Qua Iboe and Equatorial Guinea&#8217;s Zafiro crude grades through a
second tender for October loading, two traders with knowledge of
the matter said, asking not to be identified because the
information is confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mangalore Refinery  Petrochemicals Ltd. is seeking to buy
600,000 or 1 million barrels low-sulfur crude for loading Oct.
16 to Oct. 31 via a tender, according to a document obtained by
Bloomberg News. The tender closes Aug. 23 at 9:30 am local time
and offers are valid until 8pm Aug. 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigeria&#8217;s loading programs for October and official selling
prices for September are expected to be released this week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A programming error at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. caused unintended stock-option orders to flood American exchanges this morning, roiling markets and shaking confidence in electronic trading infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An internal system that Goldman Sachs uses to help prepare to meet market demand for equity options inadvertently produced orders with inaccurate price limits and sent them to exchanges, said a person familiar with the situation, who asked not to be named because the information is private. The size of the losses depends on which trades are canceled, the person said. Some have already been voided, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The mishap comes about a year after computers run by Knight Capital Group Inc. flooded U.S. equity markets with erroneous orders, a mistake that almost put the market-making firm out of business. Goldman&#8217;s error is fuel for critics of America&#8217;s electronic market structure, coming four months after the Chicago Board Options Exchange was shut down for 3 1/2 hours by a computer malfunction. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This unfortunately was an error, and in the financial world an error can be a million-dollar error,&#8221; Chip Hendon, the Cincinnati-based senior fund manager at Huntington Asset Management, said in a telephone interview. His firm oversees $16 billion. &#8220;You can use the computer, but there has to be that human touch as well to try and catch errors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Louis V. Gerstner III, the son of
the executive credited with saving International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM), has died. He was 41. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He died on Aug. 14 after choking while dining in a
restaurant, according to a death notice in the New York Times.
Grace Brugess, a spokeswoman for the New York City Medical
Examiner&#8217;s Office, said yesterday in a telephone interview that
he died at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan and that autopsy
results require &#8220;further testing and investigation.&#8221; His
family declined to elaborate on the death notice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 1996 graduate of Princeton University, and a father of
two, Gerstner was president of the Gerstner Family Foundation,
which reported $94 million in assets in 2011. Among its biggest
pledges and grants: $2 million to the Partnership for Inner-City
Education, which pays tuition for low-income students to attend
Catholic schools in Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island, and
$4.6 million to support a study of the genetics of attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, by Massachusetts
General Hospital and the Eli and Edythe L. Broad Institute of
Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The younger Gerstner &#8220;dedicated much of his adult life to
providing educational opportunities to underprivileged
children,&#8221; the death notice said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was the older of two children of Louis V. Gerstner Jr.,
whose nine-year tenure as IBM chairman and CEO is often used as
a case study in corporate leadership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IBM&#8217;s Turnaround &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he took over the Armonk, New York-based company in
1993, IBM was facing bankruptcy or breakup. Gerstner led a
turnaround in management, marketing and compensation that
boosted IBM&#8217;s market value from $29 billion to about $168
billion in 2002 and, as he wrote in his 2002 memoir, turned the
company &#8220;into a market-driven rather than an internally
focused, process-driven enterprise.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elder Gerstner previously led RJR Nabisco Inc. and
American Express Co. He retired in 2008 as chairman of Carlyle
Group LP, the world&#8217;s second-largest manager of alternative
assets such as private equity and real estate. He remains a
senior adviser at the Washington-based firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louis Vincent Gerstner III was a graduate of St. Paul&#8217;s
School in Concord, New Hampshire, Princeton and Columbia
Business School, where he received a master&#8217;s in business
administration in 2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He worked as an analyst for the private-equity firm
Forstmann Little  Co. and, according to a 2000 PR Newswire
release, was joining the management team of a fund called J Net
Ventures I, which was to make Internet-related investments for J
Net Enterprises Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Active Philanthropist &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Post reported in 1999 that Gerstner was among
&#8220;a new generation of philanthropists&#8221; that had formed a group
called the Young Lions to raise funds for the New York Public
Library. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He married Mary Gervaise Lawhorne, another Princeton
graduate, in 1999, in a ceremony on St. Simons Island, off the
Georgia coast, according to a wedding announcement in the New
York Times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The death notice says his children, Grace and Olivia, are
among his survivors, along with his sister, Elizabeth Gerstner,
a neurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, and his
parents, Louis Jr. and the former Elizabeth Robins Link. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NYSE Euronext, the bourse operator
being acquired by IntercontinentalExchange Group Inc., has
tapped JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Societe Generale SA (GLE) to help
arrange the initial public offering of its European equity
operations, four people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stake in the Euronext unit, which controls markets in
Paris, Lisbon, Brussels and Amsterdam, may be sold next year,
said the people, asking not to be named because the information
isn&#8217;t public. The sale could raise about 750 million euros
($1 billion), though the final size of the deal hasn&#8217;t been

&lt;p&gt;The IPO would end an experiment to unite the biggest U.S.
and European stock-exchange operators that began in April 2007
after New York-based NYSE Group acquired Paris-based Euronext NV
for $14.3 billion. Jeffrey Sprecher, chief executive officer of
IntercontinentalExchange, said in December that the European
business would be reviewed for a possible sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprecher&#8217;s company agreed nine months ago to buy the New
York Stock Exchange owner for cash and stock worth about $8.2
billion at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French financial regulators want to know the plans for
Euronext before approving ICE&#8217;s acquisition of NYSE, two people
said. IntercontinentalExchange, the Atlanta-based futures market
known as ICE, will retain the London-based Liffe derivatives
venue, which was part of NYSE&#8217;s Euronext acquisition six years
ago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) faces a Justice
Department probe of its energy-trading practices after the bank
settled a regulator&#8217;s market-manipulation complaint last month,
a person with direct knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan is scrutinizing
the conduct at issue in JPMorgan&#8217;s settlement with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, said the person, who asked not to
be named because the investigation isn&#8217;t public. The inquiry is
in an early stage, the Wall Street Journal reported late
yesterday. Jerika Richardson, a spokeswoman for Bharara, and
Mark Kornblau at JPMorgan declined to comment on the probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan Ventures Energy Corp. agreed last month to pay
$410 million in penalties and forfeited gains, and gave up its
claims to $262 million of disputed payments, to settle the
FERC&#8217;s allegations that the bank manipulated power markets to
enrich itself at the expense of consumers in California and the
Midwest from 2010 to 2012. While the deal released the New York-based company and its employees from future enforcement actions
by the regulator, it didn&#8217;t preclude other U.S. authorities from
pursuing their own investigations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FERC said JPMorgan&#8217;s energy-trading unit, which is
overseen by commodities chief Blythe Masters, engaged in 12
bidding strategies in wholesale energy markets from September
2010 to November 2012, resulting in tens of millions of dollars
in overpayments from grid operators. The agency announced the
violations July 29 after investigating for more than a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;FERC&#8217;s Discussions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan used strategies such as offering below-market
rates for some hours of energy production, then charging
exorbitantly high rates for hours that state bidders agreed to
pay for the plants to &#8220;ramp&#8221; production, the FERC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Masters, 44, was told in an October 2010 document that the
firm&#8217;s bidding strategies would enable it to produce $1.5
billion to $2 billion in gains through 2018, according to the
FERC. The FERC didn&#8217;t take action against any individuals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan accepted the facts in the settlement agreement
without admitting or denying wrongdoing, the FERC said at the
time. The firm announced last month that it&#8217;s looking for ways
to exit the physical commodities business, which includes energy
trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FERC Chairman Jon Wellinghoff has stepped up scrutiny of
corporations as the agency wields policing powers that were
expanded in the wake of Enron Corp.&#8217;s 2001 collapse. Since 2011,
the regulator has revealed at least 13 probes of energy-market
gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wellinghoff said in an interview last month that other
government entities are free to pursue penalties against
JPMorgan&#8217;s employees and that the FERC would cooperate with
them. He said he wasn&#8217;t aware of any separate investigations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have had some discussions with some agencies that I
can&#8217;t disclose at this time,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) sold $102.7
million of notes tied to the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index, the
bank&#8217;s largest such offering since at least 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one-year securities, issued Aug. 16, yield twice the
gains of the benchmark, with returns capped at 15.7 percent and
all capital at risk, according to a prospectus filed with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The bank, which
distributed the notes for a 1 percent fee, estimated their
initial value at 99 cents on the dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issuers have sold $5.21 billion of securities linked to the
stock benchmark this year, 23 percent less than the $6.76
billion during the same period in 2012, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. JPMorgan has issued $291.2 million of
notes tied to the index in 2013, less than half the $585.7
million during same period last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a spokesman for the bank in New York,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmark of 500 U.S. companies, which is the most
popular underlying asset for U.S. structured notes, has risen
15.9 percent this year to 1,652.35 at the close of trading
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg started to collect comprehensive data on SEC-registered structured-note offerings in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts that
have a value derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and
currencies, or events such as changes in interest rates or the
weather. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is working

the financial condition of the firm,&#8221; according to an e-mail

&lt;p&gt;At least three operators of U.S. options exchanges are
reviewing trades that took place at the beginning of the day and
NYSE Amex Options said most of the transactions may be canceled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &#8220;large number&#8221; of trades in tickers beginning with
letters H through L in the first 17 minutes are being examined
by NYSE Amex Options, it said in a statement. CBOE Holdings, the
largest venue, said it is examining trades between 9:30 and 9:41

from 9:30 to 9:47 a.m., according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the fate of the H-1B visa program rests with the U.S. Congress, a lot of Indians -- at least 168,367 of them -- are losing sleep over proposed changes to the guest worker rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's the number of Indians whose H-1B visa petitions were approved in the year ending in September 2012, according to a recent report by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. While it's no surprise that India gets the lion's share of these visas designed for skilled workers such as engineers, the latest figure represents 64 percent of the total, up from 58 percent the year before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, the H-1B stakes are only growing for Asia's third-largest economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Senate passed an immigration bill in June that would increase the annual H-1B cap, but also raise the visa cost by thousands of dollars, which could hit India's big outsourcing firms. That's causing many restless nights for foreigners who are banking on employment in the U.S. and the money that's sent back home. Tighter rules could sap up to $8 billion from India's teetering economy, JPMorgan Chase estimated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, what the final law will look like and when it might happen aren't yet clear. House Republicans have delayed consideration of immigration bills until the fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s ESPN sports
network has held preliminary talks to offer programming on a
Web-based TV service like those proposed by Google Inc. (GOOG), Sony
Corp. and Intel Corp. (INTC) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Internet TV provider would have to pay as much or more
than cable and satellite services, President John Skipper said
today at ESPN&#8217;s campus in Bristol, Connecticut. He declined to
specify the companies ESPN has spoken with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Web-based service would have to buy &#8220;the whole suite of
products,&#8221; Skipper said. &#8220;We&#8217;re not going to offer one-offs.&#8221;
The network includes the flagship channel, plus others such as
ESPN2, ESPN News and mobile applications offered to existing
pay-TV subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access to ESPN would give new online TV providers instant
credibility and a foothold to compete with established players
like Comcast Corp. and DirecTV. The network is the most valuable
channel on pay TV, garnering the highest subscriber fees on
basic cable, according to researcher SNL Kagan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talks with alternative TV providers are exploratory and any
new platform would have to offer a package of channels
comparable to what other operators provide, according to Chris LaPlaca, a spokesman for ESPN. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get deals done with ESPN and other networks, the new
providers will have to guarantee minimum subscriber numbers and
pay the associated fees even if fewer viewers sign up, David Bank, an analyst at RBC Capital in New York, wrote in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. hired Mauro Roca from Deutsche Bank AG as an economist for Latin America,
according to a person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roca had worked as a local markets strategist and senior
economist in Deutsche Bank&#8217;s Latin America group since 2010 and
previously held jobs at the International Monetary Fund,
Barclays Plc and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman at Goldman Sachs, and Roca

Latin America economics team is led by managing director Alberto Ramos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roca&#8217;s departure from Deutsche Bank&#8217;s Latin America group
follows those of corporate credit analyst Natalia Corfield and

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. hired Corfield to join its emerging-market corporate credit research group, two people with direct

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s ABC television
division is cutting about 175 jobs as part of a restructuring of
the broadcast business, according to a person with knowledge of
the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cuts amount to about 2.3 percent of the unit&#8217;s
approximately 7,600 employees, said the person, who asked not to
be identified because the numbers aren&#8217;t being announced. ABC
lost about 10 percent of its prime-time viewers in a key
audience demographic last season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move follows several hundred job cuts at Disney&#8217;s ESPN
and the film and interactive divisions. ABC is eliminating
positions as the network rolls out new technology, including a
Watch ABC application for mobile devices that provides a live-stream of its broadcast. The primary areas affected will be ABC
operations and owned stations in eight markets, including New
York and Los Angeles, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As technological advances continue to alter the
competitive landscape and viewer habits, it&#8217;s incumbent upon us
to stay ahead of the curve,&#8221; Burbank, California-based ABC said
today in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;To that end, we&#8217;ve undergone a
review of our organizational structures and processes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The restructuring will begin tomorrow and take about a week
to complete, the person said. Changes will occur across the
Disney/ABC Television Group, which includes the Disney Channel
and ABC Family cable networks, the person said. Some new
positions may also be created, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TV Ratings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, owner of theme parks in California and Florida, had
about 166,000 employees at the end of September 2012, according
to a company filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABC finished the prime-time TV season in May last among the
major broadcast networks in viewers ages 18 to 49, the group
most targeted by advertisers, according to Nielsen data. The
network averaged 7.84 million total viewers a night for second
place among the four major U.S. broadcast networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s largest entertainment company, fell 1.2
percent to $61.14 at the close in New York. The stock has gained
23 percent this year, beating the 15 percent gain of the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) will close its 10-year-old Toontown Online video game and two other virtual worlds
for kids, as the company&#8217;s interactive unit shifts resources
toward the larger Club Penguin and to mobile games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toontown, in which members form teams to fight evil robots,
will close on Sept. 19, according to a website announcement. The
$9.95-a-month game, which Disney called the first massively
multiplayer online title for kids and families, made its debut
in June 2003. Pirates of the Caribbean Online and Disney Fairies
Pixie Hollow will also close. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are shifting our development focus toward other online
and mobile play experiences, such as Club Penguin and a growing
selection of Disney Mobile apps,&#8221; the Burbank, California-based
company said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes leave the $7.95-a-month Club Penguin as the
only so-called virtual world operated by Disney. The site,
acquired in 2007, is the largest of its kind, according to the
company, which is asking players to move there. Club Penguin has
added content tied to characters from &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; and Pixar
films such as &#8220;Monsters University.&#8221; More than 200 million
penguin characters have been created, Variety reported in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger has been
working to shore up Disney&#8217;s interactive unit, which lost $216
million last year. This week, the company introduced its
Infinity video-game system, which features collectibles
including Pixar&#8217;s Buzz Lightyear and Captain Jack Sparrow from
&#8220;Pirates of the Caribbean.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assured Guaranty Ltd. (AGO) and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) agreed to settle lawsuits filed by the bond insurer
accusing the bank&#8217;s EMC Mortgage and Bear Stearns units of
making misrepresentations about mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assured Guaranty Corp., a New York-based unit of the
Hamilton, Bermuda-based bond insurer, sued EMC, J.P. Morgan
Securities Inc. and JPMorgan Chase Bank NA in state and federal
court in New York starting in 2010, alleging violations of
representations and warranties in connection with three
residential mortgage-backed securities transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and Assured reached an agreement resolving the
claims this month, according to a filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission dated Aug. 9. Terms of the
settlement weren&#8217;t disclosed in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assured still has similar suits pending against other
lenders, including Deutsche Bank AG, Germany&#8217;s biggest lender,
and Credit Suisse AG, Switzerland&#8217;s largest bank, according to
its SEC filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
biggest recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
and the crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the
market for the securities evaporated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashweeta Durani, a spokeswoman for Assured Guaranty in New
York, said in a telephone interview that she couldn&#8217;t comment
beyond the regulatory filing. Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman
for New York-based JPMorgan, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;

portfolio was so large. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said Aug. 14 that he
was &#8220;hopeful&#8221; the men, neither of whom are in the U.S., would
return to face the charges. Grout&#8217;s lawyers have said he&#8217;s in

Sachs (GS) Group Inc. shows the dangers haven&#8217;t gone away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A programming error caused the firm to send unintentional
stock options orders in the first minutes of trading, pushing
prices on dozens of contracts to a dollar each, according to a
person briefed on the matter yesterday and data compiled by
Bloomberg. Any losses for Goldman Sachs, the fifth-largest U.S.
bank by assets, won&#8217;t be known until exchanges determine which
contracts should be canceled, said the person, who requested
anonymity because the information is private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors who fret about the increasing dominance of
electronic exchanges say the error at Goldman Sachs, which
generated about half its revenue from trading last quarter,
shows that worse breakdowns are inevitable. A year ago, Knight
Capital Group Inc. was pushed to the brink of bankruptcy by a
trading breakdown, and Chinese regulators are investigating
broker Everbright (601788) Securities Co. after $3.8 billion of incorrect
buy orders sent the Shanghai Composite Index up about 6 percent
in two minutes last week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA)
Chairman Phillip Frost said he backed the management&#8217;s strategy
following criticism from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan
Stanley analysts who are advising investors to sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker&#8217;s blockbuster multiple sclerosis treatment
Copaxone, which faces potential generic competition as early as
next year, has a &#8220;long way to go&#8221; as a commercially viable
medicine, Frost, 76, said in a Bloomberg Television interview
from Tel Aviv today. Teva is seeking approval for a new version
of the injected drug that can be taken three times a week,
replacing the daily doses patients must now endure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t pay too much attention to what other analysts are
saying,&#8221; Frost said. &#8220;We need to do what&#8217;s important for the
company and I personally have expressed my confidence in the way
I know how to do it, and that&#8217;s by buying shares.&#8221; Frost
acquired 1 million Teva shares at prices ranging from $37.82 to
$39.57 each, the company said on June 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva&#8217;s shares have lagged behind pharmaceutical peers as
analysts predict Copaxone sales will fall in each of the next
five years on possible generic competition and as patients
choose new oral medicines over an injection. While Chief
Executive Officer Jeremy Levin has pledged to revive growth by
making small acquisitions and developing drugs internally,
Goldman Sachs analyst Jami Rubin asked on an Aug. 1 earnings
call whether the board was behind the CEO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Generic Version &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rubin cut the stock to sell from neutral in July, citing
&#8220;0 percent return potential.&#8221; Petach Tikva, Israel-based Teva
was downgraded to underweight from equalweight by Morgan Stanley
on Aug. 5 as analysts said generic drugmaker Mylan Inc. (MYL) may
secure U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for its
generic version of Copaxone in 2014. Teva&#8217;s American depositary
receipts have returned 7.3 percent this year, including
dividends, compared with a 21 percent gain for the Bloomberg
Europe Pharmaceutical Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frost was speaking at the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange to mark
the listing of Opko Health Inc. (OPK), of which he is the largest
shareholder. He said he hopes to turn the Miami-based drugmaker
into &#8220;the next Teva&#8221; after the company agreed to purchase Ness
Ziona, Israel-based Prolor Biotech Inc. (PBTH), which is developing a
long-acting version of human growth hormone that&#8217;s in the final
stage of clinical trials. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ubisoft Entertainment SA (UBI) is seeing
&#8220;very strong&#8221; orders for its &#8220;Watch Dogs&#8221; video game and a
new version of &#8220;Assassin&#8217;s Creed&#8221; as console makers prepare to
ship new-generation machines in time for Christmas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a thirst for new products among our clients,&#8221;
Chief Executive Officer Yves Guillemot said in an interview at
the Gamescom trade fair in Cologne today. &#8220;It&#8217;s been a very
long time since the last generation of consoles was released --
there&#8217;s very strong built-up appetite that transforms very
quickly into preorders. And we haven&#8217;t seen the end of it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony Corp. (6758) will start selling the PlayStation 4, its first
new console in seven years, in North America on Nov. 15 and in
Europe on Nov. 29 and in 32 countries for the year-end holiday
season, Sony Computer Entertainment CEO Andrew House said
yesterday. Orders already top 1 million. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will
release its Xbox One console in November in 13 countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the gaming industry, new consoles are an opportunity
to reshuffle the cards,&#8221; Guillemot said. &#8220;That&#8217;s when market
share changes are potentially the biggest. We want to use this
time to launch or relaunch our brands. With each generation we
try to climb up a step and grab a few more points of market
share.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Increased Promotion &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introduction of new consoles will probably spark
consumer appetite and set the video-games market up for a new
growth cycle, according to a note from Richard Beaudoux, a
Paris-based analyst at Natixis Securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Console manufacturers help promote games to sell their
consoles,&#8221; Guillemot said. &#8220;That can double the firepower when
we&#8217;re promoting a game.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their first year, the new generation of consoles will
sell about 10 million to 15 million units, Guillemot estimated.
Montreuil-Sous-Bois, France-based Ubisoft&#8217;s forecasts for its
business in the second quarter and full year are unchanged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Assassin&#8217;s Creed IV Black Flag,&#8221; an adventure game, will
be released at the end of October, and vigilante game &#8220;Watch
Dogs&#8221; will follow at the end of November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubisoft shares rose 1.1 percent to 11.75 euros at 1:06 p.m.
in Paris, taking the advance to 49 percent this year and giving
the company a market value of 1.1 billion euros. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SugarCRM Inc., a maker of sales-tracking software, raised $40 million from Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. to speed global expansion as it takes on larger rivals
Oracle Corp. (ORCL) and Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cupertino, California-based company will use the cash
to invest in research and development as well as sales and
marketing, Chief Executive Officer Larry Augustin said in an
interview. Sugar 7, the latest version of SugarCRM&#8217;s customer-relationship management software, will debut in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think the opportunity for CRM is vastly
underpenetrated,&#8221; Augustin said. &#8220;We figure there are 450
million to 500 million people in customer-facing roles. Today,
commercial CRM companies serve maybe 20 million of them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors on the public and private markets are circling
emerging business software providers as companies move away from
traditional packaged and desktop software. Cloud-based providers
like Workday Inc. (WDAY) and ServiceNow Inc. (NOW) have soared since their
initial public offerings last year, while startups such as Box
Inc., Zendesk Inc. and New Relic Inc. have raised growth-equity
rounds from large institutional investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before this investment, SugarCRM had raised $79 million.
Augustin wouldn&#8217;t comment on the valuation, saying only that
it&#8217;s &#8220;up and to the right&#8221; since the last investment round
early last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SugarCRM, founded in 2004, added 600 new customers in the
second quarter, bringing the total to 6500 commercial clients.
Most individual users run a free version of the program, and
paying customers are charged $35 to $100 per user per month.
Sales rose 30 percent in the second quarter from the same period
a year earlier, about half the growth rate for all of 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nearing Profit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Augustin, who said late last year that the company may go
public as soon as 2013, declined to comment further on its
plans. The company has 400 employees and is close to
profitability, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antoine Munfa, a vice president at New York-based Goldman,
will join SugarCRM&#8217;s board. The investment was made by Goldman&#8217;s
Private Capital Investing group, which backs growth and mid-sized companies in North America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The CRM market is ripe for technologies and products that
change the face of how enterprises conduct business with their
customers,&#8221; Munfa said in today&#8217;s statement. &#8220;SugarCRM, with
its user-centric vision and product design, has stepped up to
meet a real market need.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Walt&#8217;s dream is a nightmare.&#8221; &#8220;Crowds gripe over long waiting lines.&#8221; &#8220;Opening day was a confused mess.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These were the first newspaper reviews of Disneyland, the California theme park that debuted one scorching day in July 1955. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a junior publicist hired a month earlier, Marty Sklar had an inside view of the event which included women&#8217;s heels stuck in the hot asphalt, not enough water fountains due to a plumber&#8217;s strike and attendance double what was planned because of ticket counterfeiting. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He remembers &#8220;Davy Crockett&#8221; star Fess Parker, mounted on his steed, pleading: &#8220;Marty, help me get out of here before this horse kills somebody.&#8221; Sklar escorted them both backstage. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s PR staff turned things around by inviting the press to come back at night, when the park wasn&#8217;t so crowded. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sklar went on to become president of the Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s Imagineering unit, which designs the company&#8217;s parks and hotels, and has now written a memoir called &#8220;Dream It! Do It!&#8221; (Disney Editions, $24.99). In an interview, he described the company&#8217;s early days and why the world&#8217;s largest licensor may never lend its name to a car. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Palmeri: What was it like to work with Walt? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sklar: He was not the kind of person who would pat you on the back and say &#8220;Great idea.&#8221; He just expected it. Dick Irvine (a design executive) was a master at getting something in position, something Walt could build on. Walt loved plus-ing other people&#8217;s ideas. That was exciting to be around. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.K. and U.S. regulators are
preparing to impose fines as soon as mid-September on JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) after an investigation into the bank&#8217;s London
trading losses last year, a person with direct knowledge of the
matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K.&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority and the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission are in negotiations with the
New York-based company to settle their probes, according to the
person, who asked not to be identified because the talks aren&#8217;t
public. In the U.S., the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
and the Justice Department are also investigating events
surrounding the losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, lost more than
$6.2 billion last year on derivatives bets made by Bruno Iksil,
a trader who was dubbed the London Whale because of the size of
his positions. The U.S. last week charged Javier Martin-Artajo
and Julien Grout, two of Iksil&#8217;s former colleagues, with wire
fraud and conspiracy charges for allegedly seeking to hide
losses. Iksil is cooperating with the U.S. in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for JPMorgan, the SEC and the FCA declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC, which also sued Martin-Artajo and Grout last week,
wrote in its complaint that JPMorgan &#8220;failed to furnish to the
commission, in accordance with the rules and regulations
prescribed by the commission, such financial reports as the
commission has prescribed.&#8221; JPMorgan, which restated last
year&#8217;s first-quarter earnings because of the losses, is
expecting multiple fines from regulators investigating the
losses, a person familiar with the matter said last week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The yen&#8217;s breach of a key trading
level opens the way for it to weaken to an almost one-month low
versus the dollar, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co., citing
technical analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After weakening through support at 98.65 yesterday, the
Japanese currency will test 99.10 before falling to 99.97,
according to Niall O&#8217;Connor, a New York-based technical analyst
at JPMorgan. That would be the lowest since July 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The price action over the last few days has been
constructive and suggests that we can see a test of 99.10, if
not the 100 area,&#8221; O&#8217;Connor said in a telephone interview.
&#8220;There&#8217;s potential to extend in dollar-yen.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s currency declined 1.1 percent to 98.72 per dollar
yesterday in New York after earlier depreciating as much as 1.2
percent to 98.81, its weakest level since Aug. 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yen&#8217;s current downtrend was confirmed after it failed
to strengthen through the area from 96.40 to 97 on Aug. 20,
according to O&#8217;Connor. It touched a seven-week high of 95.81 on
Aug. 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Japanese currency has weakened 9 percent this year, the
worst performer after Australia&#8217;s dollar among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Indexes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index. Resistance refers to an
area on a chart where sell orders may be clustered, and support
is an area where there may be buy orders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steven Sinofsky, the former
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) executive who was pushed out in November, said
on his blog that he&#8217;s joined venture-firm Andreessen Horowitz as
a board partner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In this position I will represent the firm on the boards
of portfolio companies when the opportunities present
themselves, but will not be a full-time member of the firm,&#8221;
Sinofsky wrote. Sinofsky added that he will keep his current
position as executive in residence at Harvard Business School. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andreessen Horowitz has been staffing up with experienced
technology executives since opening in 2009. In addition to
founders Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, who have worked
together since the 1990s, the firm&#8217;s partners also include
former OpenTable Inc. (OPEN) Chief Executive Officer Jeff Jordan,
IronPort Systems Inc. co-founder Scott Weiss and SuccessFactors
Inc. founder Lars Dalgaard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andreessen Horowitz, based in Menlo Park, California,
confirmed the hiring of Sinofsky in an e-mail and said he will
not be an investing partner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sinofsky, a 23-year Microsoft veteran, left the Redmond,
Washington-based company last year after clashes with
executives, including CEO Steve Ballmer, people with knowledge
of the matter said in November. Sinofsky was president of the

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, said it&#8217;s cooperating with federal authorities
investigating possible illegal activity by employees and
business partners in Russia and Pakistan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company takes every allegation seriously and will
cooperate fully with any government inquiries, John Frank,
Microsoft&#8217;s deputy general counsel, wrote in a blog posting
yesterday. Mark Murray, a spokesman for Microsoft, confirmed
that the software maker&#8217;s activities in Russia and Pakistan are
now part of an investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement followed a Wall Street Journal report that
federal regulators are extending their examination of the
company&#8217;s relations with business partners that allegedly bribed
foreign officials for contracts. The investigation had earlier
looked into allegations made by a former Microsoft
representative in China, and the company&#8217;s relationships with
resellers and consultants in Romania and Italy, the newspaper
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Nester, a spokesman for the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission, and Michael Passman, a Justice Department
spokesman, didn&#8217;t immediately return e-mails seeking comment on
the probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, said it employs
more than 50 people to investigate potential breaches of company
policy, as well as 120 more people to make sure the software
maker complies with local laws and regulations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said in March that that lawyers from the Justice
Department and the SEC were examining allegations that Microsoft
partners bribed foreign government representatives in exchange
for software contracts, following a Wall Street Journal report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) sold $50.4
million of four-year notes tied to the least performing of two
stock indexes and an exchange-traded fund, the largest &#8220;worst
of&#8221; offering this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The securities, issued on Aug. 21, yield 8 percent a year
as long as the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index, the Russell 2000
Index and the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF are all at least 60 percent
of their initial value with all capital at risk, according to a
prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. The bank distributed the notes, which can be called
in as soon as three months, for a 1.75 percent fee and estimated
their value at 97 cents on the dollar at the time of sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a spokesman for JPMorgan in New York,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of worst-of notes have soared to $1.27 billion this
year, 23 percent more than the $1.03 billion issued in all of
2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The securities
have become more popular as issuers look for ways to construct
bonds with higher yields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correlation between changes in the Russell 2000 and iShares
MSCI EAFE dropped to .75 this year from .83 for all of 2012,
Bloomberg data show. The closer the correlation is to one, the
more the prices of assets tend to move together. Notes tied to
less correlated assets can give investors better terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer, who has struggled to adapt the world&#8217;s largest software maker to the shift away from personal computers and toward mobile devices, will retire after more than a decade at the helm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ballmer, 57, plans to step down within 12 months, Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said today in a statement. The company&#8217;s lead independent director, John Thompson, will oversee the search for his successor, heading a committee that will also include Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. Investors applauded the move, sending the shares up the most since 2009. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ballmer&#8217;s move reflects the changes roiling the computing industry his company helped pioneer. Microsoft, which supplies the software running most PCs, lost almost half its value on Ballmer&#8217;s watch. The stock hasn&#8217;t closed above $50 since his first year on the job amid competition from Google Inc. (GOOG), Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Facebook Inc.

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is never a perfect time for this type of transition, but now is the right time,&#8221; Ballmer wrote in a memo to employees today that was posted on Microsoft&#8217;s website. &#8220;We need a CEO who will be here longer term for this new direction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer, the world&#8217;s 44th-richest person, has seen his net worth jump $786 million after announcing his retirement from the world&#8217;s largest software maker. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 57-year-old is the second-largest individual shareholder of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, after co-founder and Chairman Bill Gates, the world&#8217;s richest man. Ballmer has a net worth of $16.8 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He said he plans to step down within the next 12 months after serving as CEO since 2000. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors want new leadership to navigate the company in a world that doesn&#8217;t rely on the PC anymore,&#8221; said Jack Ablin, who helps oversee about $66 billion as chief investment officer of BMO Private Bank in Chicago, by phone. &#8220;In a big picture sense, he&#8217;s done a good job.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related Features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares rose 7.3 percent to $34.75 at the close of trading in New York. The stock has gained 30.1 percent during the year, driving up Gates&#8217;s fortune by 15.4 percent and Ballmer&#8217;s by 21.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Billionaire Trio &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gates, 57, co-founded Microsoft with billionaire Paul Allen, in 1975, and is still its largest individual shareholder with a 4.8 percent stake. Ballmer, who joined Microsoft in 1980, holds 4 percent. Allen, 60, who controlled as much as 28 percent of Microsoft shares, now holds 2 percent, according to the index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer&#8217;s retirement leaves the world&#8217;s largest software company in a succession crisis amid the worst slump in history for the personal-computer industry it helped create. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The search committee will consider internal and external candidates to replace Ballmer, 57, who will depart within the next 12 months, the company said in a statement today. Tony Bates, Satya Nadella, Qi Lu and Terry Myerson are the leading choices among Microsoft&#8217;s executives, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the process isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ballmer&#8217;s planned departure follows a management revamp, the company&#8217;s biggest earnings disappointment in a decade and the fifth-consecutive quarterly drop in PC shipments. Meanwhile, Microsoft remains an outsider in a burgeoning mobile-computing market led by Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related Features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It would be a difficult job, but if you could turn around Microsoft you&#8217;d be seen as a hero,&#8221; said Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities LLC in Portland, Oregon. He has the equivalent of a hold rating on the stock. &#8220;He&#8217;s not really leaving the company in the best financial position.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shares of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft rose 7.3 percent to $34.75 at the close in New York, for its biggest gain since April 2009. The stock has gained 30 percent this year and is still trading below its close at the end of 2007. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Reducing Units &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bates, a former Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) executive, joined Microsoft in the 2011 acquisition of Skype Technologies SA and now leads the company&#8217;s business-development organization. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As executive vice president, Nadella runs the company&#8217;s cloud and enterprise business. He joined Microsoft in 1992 from Sun Microsystems Inc. Lu came to Microsoft from Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) in 2008 and oversees the company&#8217;s applications and services group, which develops products such as Office, Office 365 and SharePoint. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last month, Microsoft reduced the number of business units to four and gave Myerson, the head of Windows Phone software, the added responsibility for the Windows and Xbox operating systems. Myerson has been at the company since it bought his startup, Interse Corp., in 1997. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Outside Options &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Long term, they have a big problem,&#8221; said Dan Niles, portfolio manager at Alphaone Capital Partners LLC in Tiburon, California. &#8220;They are moving from a market where they have monopoly profits to a brutally competitive market of services and devices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Frank Shaw, a spokesman for Microsoft, said the company isn&#8217;t making any executives available for comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If Microsoft decides to bring in a leader from the outside, it might consider EBay Inc. (EBAY) CEO John Donahoe or try to recruit Facebook Inc. Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, Pacific Crest&#8217;s Barnicle said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s not a clear internal successor, as some of the potential successors have left in recent years,&#8221; said David Cearley, an analyst at Gartner Inc. in Stamford, Connecticut. &#8220;It&#8217;ll be difficult for an outsider to come in and change a very strong culture that exists at Microsoft.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Steven Sinofsky, former head of the Windows division, left the company last year after clashes with executives including Ballmer, people familiar with the situation said at the time. Gates is not being considered, according to people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fresh Blood &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s board should look outside the company to replace Ballmer, said Bill George, a former CEO of Medtronic Inc. (MDT) and now a director at Exxon Mobil Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;They need fresh blood from the outside, someone from the technology world who&#8217;s innovative, creative and willing to take them in new directions,&#8221; said George, who&#8217;s also a management professor at Harvard Business School. &#8220;Microsoft in recent years has missed mobile, search and all of social media, which is why I don&#8217;t think they should choose from inside.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whoever gets the job will face a list of challenges that recently has grown longer. Last month the company reported profit that missed analysts&#8217; estimates by the biggest margin in at least a decade amid weakening demand for PCs running its Windows software. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Surface Writedown &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s attempt to crack the growing market for tablet computers with the Surface device led to a $900 million writedown of inventory as consumers continued to buy rival products like Apple&#8217;s iPad. Surface, Microsoft&#8217;s first-ever homegrown computer, shipped just 900,000 units in each of the December and March quarters, according to IDC. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the same time, Microsoft&#8217;s flagship business is struggling. PC shipments fell 11 percent last quarter, according to Framingham, Massachusetts-based IDC. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For some investors, the most important thing is replacing Ballmer with a leader who will help the company reemerge as a technology pioneer rather than just a follower. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;You need someone who doesn&#8217;t need to be as much of an operations person as Steve Ballmer, who can say where Microsoft needs to be five years from now,&#8221; said Microsoft investor Michael Obuchowski, a fund manager at North Shore Asset Management LLC in Cold Spring Harbor, New York. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Ian King in &#26481;&#20140; at ianking@bloomberg.net; Sarah Frier in New York at sfrier1@bloomberg.net; Dina Bass in Seattle at dbass2@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Pui-Wing Tam at ptam13@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the trades caused when
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. bombarded NYSE Amex Options with
erroneous orders have been canceled, a person with direct
knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision by the exchange where most of the transactions
occurred will limit losses at the fifth-biggest bank by assets
after it roiled options markets three days ago. More than half
of Goldman&#8217;s trades and a greater percentage of its volume from
the first 13 minutes of the day will be voided by NYSE Amex,
according to the person, who asked not to be named because the
matter is private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A programming error that spewed orders that pushed prices
on dozens of contracts to a dollar each, according to a person
briefed on the matter Aug. 20 and data compiled by Bloomberg.
How exchanges would rule on trades that qualified as &#8220;clearly
erroneous&#8221; orders was key to quantifying Goldman&#8217;s losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich Adamonis, a spokesman for NYSE Euronext, and Michael DuVally at Goldman Sachs declined to comment on the trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman clearly wanted as many of those trades busted as
possible,&#8221; Mark S. Longo, a former market maker and chief
executive officer of Options Insider Inc., said by phone today.
&#8220;They were the ones who put the trades on at excruciating
prices. The more cancellations they could get the better for
Goldman.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Options Trades &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The malfunction affected securities with ticker symbols
starting with the letters I, J and K. Of the 500 biggest options
trades in the first 15 minutes markets were open on Aug. 20, 405
were for those tickers and priced at $1, according to data
compiled by Trade Alert LLC and Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NYSE Amex Options accounted for 76 percent of those,
compared with 18 percent for Nasdaq Options Market and 12
percent for the International Securities Exchange, data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NYSE Euronext&#8217;s options venue said less than two hours
after the malfunction that, &#8220;as permitted by the rules, we
anticipate that most of the impacted trades will be busted.&#8221;
Goldman Sachs, which generated $5.8 billion in revenue from
equities last year, said in an e-mail that any potential losses
would be within the firm&#8217;s risk limits and not material to its
finances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs shares fell 0.8 percent to $158.21 at 1:31
p.m. in New York after rising 1.5 percent yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of the reviewed trades at the International
Securities Exchange were adjusted and not canceled, based on the
exchange&#8217;s rules, according to spokeswoman Molly McGregor. Bats
Global Markets Inc. let the few hundred trades on that venue
stand while Boston Options Exchanges adjusted trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CBOE, BATS &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chicago Board Options Exchange, operated by CBOE Holdings
Inc. (CBOE), said it reviewed the trades as obvious errors when a
request for review was received within its time limit, which is
60 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Randy Williams, a Bats spokesman, Tony McCormick, chief
executive officer of the Boston Options Exchange, Robert Madden
of Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. and CBOE&#8217;s Gail Osten declined to
comment for this story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s crazy when you look at how ISE does it one way, CBOE
does it another way, Amex does it yet another way, that is
absurd and it is demonstrably dangerous,&#8221; Longo said. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
say you&#8217;re a market maker and you put up the same trade on three
different exchanges, then you have three different processes you
have to deal with to bust or adjust the exact same trade and you
may have three different outcomes. How is that beneficial to
anybody?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), seeking a successor to Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer, doesn&#8217;t plan to consider co-founder Bill Gates for the role, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gates, who is on the committee in charge of finding a new CEO, plans to stay on in his role at the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation, a philanthropic organization, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the search is private. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Sarah Frier in New York at sfrier1@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, would be worth 30 percent more if broken
into its four business segments, an unlikely scenario, an
analyst at Stifel Financial Corp. (SF)&#8217;s KBW unit said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s businesses -- traditional banking, investment
banking, asset management and private equity -- are separately
worth $255.7 billion, KBW&#8217;s Christopher Mutascio said today in a
note. That compares with the New York-based lender&#8217;s $197
billion market capitalization as of yesterday&#8217;s closing price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the possibility of breaking up JPMorgan is &#8220;quite
low,&#8221; it &#8220;could potentially result in substantial upside for
current shareholders if the segments were valued like similar
companies,&#8221; Mutascio wrote in the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it estimates that losses from lawsuits and
investigations could exceed its legal reserves by as much as
$6.8 billion, according to an Aug. 7 regulatory filing. While
litigation costs are &#8220;high and uncertain,&#8221; JPMorgan can
&#8220;easily earn through them,&#8221; Mutascio wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New regulatory probes and potential litigation costs have
damped JPMorgan&#8217;s stock price compared to other large banks,
Mutascio said. JPMorgan has slid 7.8 percent since Aug. 1 to
$52.11 at 11:35 a.m. in New York, compared with the 3.4 percent
drop in the 24-company KBW Bank Index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next chairman of the Federal Reserve faces an alarming possibility: the new normal for the economy is even worse than advertised. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The long-run potential growth rate for gross domestic product has slid to around 1 3/4 percent per year, from an average rise in GDP of 2 1/2 percent since 1990, according to economists at JPMorgan Chase  Co., the largest U.S. bank by assets. That would be the lowest level since World War II and below the 2 percent mark that Pacific Investment Management Co. pegged as the new normal for the economy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &#8220;U.S. future isn&#8217;t what it used to be,&#8221; said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan in New York. Declining productivity gains and a slower expansion of the labor force &#8220;should limit the U.S. average growth pace&#8221; in the long run. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As they gather for the Fed&#8217;s annual conference at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, economists and central bankers are aware of the implications. A slower potential growth rate -- the top speed at which the economy can expand without heating up inflation -- means the Fed would have to tighten credit quicker if growth does gain momentum. Slower growth would limit the ability of businesses to boost profits and workers to win pay increases and make it tougher to reduce the federal budget deficit. &lt;/p&gt;

Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said in November that the financial crisis and its aftermath had probably "reduced the potential growth rate" of the economy, as discouraged workers dropped out of the labor force and businesses held back on investment. Close

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Executive
Officer Steve Ballmer&#8217;s retirement leaves the world&#8217;s largest
software company in a succession crisis amid the worst slump in
history for the personal-computer industry it helped create. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The search committee will consider internal and external
candidates to replace Ballmer, 57, who will depart within the
next 12 months, the company said in a statement yesterday. Tony Bates, Satya Nadella, Qi Lu and Terry Myerson are the leading
choices among Microsoft&#8217;s executives, according to people with
knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because
the process isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ballmer&#8217;s planned departure follows a management revamp,
the company&#8217;s biggest earnings disappointment in a decade and
the fifth-consecutive quarterly drop in PC shipments. Meanwhile,
Microsoft remains an outsider in a burgeoning mobile-computing
market led by Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It would be a difficult job, but if you could turn around
Microsoft you&#8217;d be seen as a hero,&#8221; said Brendan Barnicle, an
analyst at Pacific Crest Securities LLC in Portland, Oregon. He
has the equivalent of a hold rating on the stock. &#8220;He&#8217;s not
really leaving the company in the best financial position.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft rose 7.3
percent to $34.75 at the close in New York yesterday, for its
biggest gain since April 2009. The stock is up 30 percent this
year and is still trading below its price at the end of 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reducing Units &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bates, a former Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) executive, joined
Microsoft in the 2011 acquisition of Skype Technologies SA and
now leads the company&#8217;s business-development organization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As executive vice president, Nadella runs the company&#8217;s
cloud and enterprise business. He joined Microsoft in 1992 from
Sun Microsystems Inc. Lu came to Microsoft from Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) in
2008 and oversees the company&#8217;s applications and services group,
which develops products such as Office, Office 365 and
SharePoint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Microsoft reduced the number of business units
to four and gave Myerson, the head of Windows Phone software,
the added responsibility for the Windows and Xbox operating
systems. Myerson has been at the company since it bought his
startup, Interse Corp., in 1997. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Outside Options &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Long term, they have a big problem,&#8221; said Dan Niles,
portfolio manager at Alphaone Capital Partners LLC in Tiburon,
California. &#8220;They are moving from a market where they have
monopoly profits to a brutally competitive market of services
and devices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frank Shaw, a spokesman for Microsoft, said the company
isn&#8217;t making any executives available for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Microsoft decides to bring in a leader from the outside,
it might consider EBay Inc. (EBAY) CEO John Donahoe or try to recruit
Facebook Inc. Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, Pacific
Crest&#8217;s Barnicle said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s not a clear internal successor, as some of the
potential successors have left in recent years,&#8221; said David
Cearley, an analyst at Gartner Inc. in Stamford, Connecticut.
&#8220;It&#8217;ll be difficult for an outsider to come in and change a
very strong culture that exists at Microsoft.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Sinofsky, former head of the Windows division, left
the company last year after clashes with executives including
Ballmer, people familiar with the situation said at the time.
Gates is not being considered, according to people with
knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fresh Blood &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s board should look outside the company to
replace Ballmer, said Bill George, a former CEO of Medtronic
Inc. (MDT) and now a director at Exxon Mobil Corp. and Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They need fresh blood from the outside, someone from the
technology world who&#8217;s innovative, creative and willing to take
them in new directions,&#8221; said George, who&#8217;s also a management
professor at Harvard Business School. &#8220;Microsoft in recent
years has missed mobile, search and all of social media, which
is why I don&#8217;t think they should choose from inside.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever gets the job will face a list of challenges that
recently has grown longer. Last month the company reported
profit that missed analysts&#8217; estimates by the biggest margin in
at least a decade amid weakening demand for PCs running its
Windows software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Surface Writedown &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s attempt to crack the growing market for tablet
computers with the Surface device led to a $900 million
writedown of inventory as consumers continued to buy rival
products like Apple&#8217;s iPad. Surface, Microsoft&#8217;s first-ever
homegrown computer, shipped just 900,000 units in each of the
December and March quarters, according to IDC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Microsoft&#8217;s flagship business is
struggling. PC shipments fell 11 percent last quarter, according
to Framingham, Massachusetts-based IDC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some investors, the most important thing is replacing
Ballmer with a leader who will help the company reemerge as a
technology pioneer rather than just a follower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You need someone who doesn&#8217;t need to be as much of an
operations person as Steve Ballmer, who can say where Microsoft
needs to be five years from now,&#8221; said Microsoft investor
Michael Obuchowski, a fund manager at North Shore Asset
Management LLC in Cold Spring Harbor, New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve Ballmer spent his first two decades as a Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) manager pushing the company&#8217;s software onto 97 percent of the world&#8217;s personal computers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He spent his 13-year tenure as chief executive officer in the failed pursuit of an encore. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ballmer, 57, said yesterday that he plans to retire within a year, capping a career that took him from a take-no-prisoners salesman once known for bringing a baseball bat to meetings into an embattled CEO of a company that couldn&#8217;t keep pace with nimbler rivals and shifting customer tastes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;He was a true company man,&#8221; said Tim Bajarin, president of market-research firm Creative Strategies, who first visited Microsoft when it had 28 employees in the early 1980s. &#8220;The bottom line is, he stayed too long at Microsoft with a position focused on PCs, and didn&#8217;t really anticipate the dramatic impact of mobile computing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ballmer put his stamp on Microsoft by dint of his intellect, dogged pursuit of his goals and a close personal and business relationship with co-founder Bill Gates that saw the two executives complement each other&#8217;s strengths and weaknesses through Microsoft&#8217;s meteoric rise. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Ballmer was clearly in charge, his tenure was marked by a list of missed opportunities: smartphones, Web search and tablet computing. While Microsoft built many of these products early on, it never came up with a hit. Its latest attempt to fight back, with Surface tablets, hasn&#8217;t succeeded. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Industry Shift &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company, based in Redmond, Washington, wrested control of the computer industry from International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) in the 1980s and made personal computing a reality for much of the world in the &#8217;90s. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During his time as CEO, Ballmer brought Windows, one of the world&#8217;s most valuable brands, into the modern era. He was also instrumental in resolving a U.S. antitrust case that almost saw the company broken in two. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Microsoft was already talking about a shift away from PC-based computing when Ballmer became CEO in 2000, the company has been eclipsed by Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG), as the industry&#8217;s center of gravity shifted to handheld computers and software served via an Internet &#8220;cloud&#8221; instead of programs installed on the PCs that fueled Microsoft&#8217;s two big franchises, the Windows operating system and Office productivity suite. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ballmer&#8217;s tenure hasn&#8217;t worked out well for shareholders, either. An investment of $1,000 when Ballmer took over is now worth 13 percent less, including dividend returns, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Since Microsoft&#8217;s 1986 initial public offering through the end of the Gates era, $1,000 turned into $554,464. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Terrific Energy &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft had a great run for 30 years, but it&#8217;s too much to expect somebody like Steve, who is more of a caretaker CEO than a visionary leader, to just bring Microsoft to the next level,&#8221; said Michael Cusumano, a management professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who wrote a 1995 book on the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ballmer, raised outside Detroit and whose father was a manager at Ford Motor Co. (F), started at Microsoft in his 20s, dropping out of Stanford Graduate School of Business to join his Harvard friend Gates as Microsoft&#8217;s first professional manager in 1980. The partnership would come to define the company and led to a string of historic success. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;ve met Steve a number of times. He&#8217;s a great motivator, he has terrific energy, tremendous enthusiasm, and he loves the company deeply,&#8221; Cusumano said. &#8220;That energy is contagious. But Microsoft competes in a market where the competition and the pace of change is really quite fast, and if you&#8217;re not ahead of the game, then you&#8217;re likely underneath it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;PC Era &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM contracted Microsoft to write the software for its original PC, which debuted in 1981. Gates correctly foresaw that the rise of cheap, plentiful machines using off-the-shelf parts rather than the custom-designed computers seen in the &#8217;60s and &#8217;70s would shift most of the value to software. Along with partner Intel Corp. (INTC), which had a chokehold on PC chips, Microsoft siphoned off much of the industry&#8217;s profits. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft also dispatched Apple, whose Macintosh was considered by many users to be more elegant and better-designed. Windows PCs were cheaper, spawning a universe of software programs and add-on hardware that Apple couldn&#8217;t match. Microsoft&#8217;s sales grew 10,000-fold, from $7.5 million when Ballmer joined, to $78 billion last year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;High Octane &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the summer of 1995, Microsoft&#8217;s shipment of Windows 95 was a turning point for the PC era, complete with a theme song from the Rolling Stones and midnight lines of customers waiting to buy the revamped operating system. Five years later, Windows 2000, in versions for PCs and servers, helped make Microsoft a viable alternative to Sun Microsystems and IBM in data centers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s market value soared from about $600 million when it went public in 1986, to more than $600 billion in 1999 at the height of its run. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft was firing on all cylinders,&#8221; Jack Gold, principal of market researcher J. Gold Associates, wrote in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With a booming voice and physically larger than most others in the room, the tenacious Ballmer often got his way. Yet he could also be a warm and gracious host, pouring sodas for guests and recalling his days as a young Duncan Hines brownie mix manager at Procter  Gamble Co. (PG) Ballmer also possessed a business savvy and grasp of data that belied his brusque style. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Critical Juncture &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;He could also be intemperate, working himself up into a froth, including his sweaty rants onstage at company conferences. During Microsoft&#8217;s antitrust fight with the Justice Department, his &#8220;the heck with Janet Reno&#8221; comment about the U.S. attorney general didn&#8217;t help the company&#8217;s cause. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;In many ways he had a very hard job,&#8221; said Cusumano. &#8220;When Bill Gates stepped down in 2000, he left at a critical juncture,&#8221; he said. Ballmer took over from Gates just as the Internet was creating new ways of computing and handheld devices were beginning to show promise. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;All of these changes, and Ballmer, who is much more of a sales guy than a technical leader or market visionary, was left holding the bag,&#8221; he said. Microsoft had also started to splinter into fiefdoms of product groups that battled with each other instead of collaborating on hit products. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There have also been bright spots in Ballmer&#8217;s tenure. He introduced the Xbox video-game console in 2001 and turned it into a $7 billion business. The Windows 7 operating system in 2009 led to widespread upgrades of business PCs at a time when hardware sales were ebbing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Apple&#8217;s Revenge &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;With Microsoft awash in more money than any other U.S. company outside the financial industry, and facing pressure from shareholders to return cash, Ballmer began paying a dividend in 2003, a sign that the company was maturing. In 2004, he expanded on that, announcing the return of more than $75 billion to shareholders through buybacks and increased dividends. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet Ballmer couldn&#8217;t turn Windows into a popular platform for mobile computing, as Apple had with the iPhone and iPad. Apple CEO Steve Jobs -- in his second career fight against the company -- took a page right from Microsoft&#8217;s playbook, turning Apple into the hub of an industrywide ecosystem of software developers who wanted to write mobile applications for its platform. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think anything will change at Microsoft as long as Ballmer is running it,&#8221; Jobs said in Walter Isaacson&#8217;s authorized biography, published in 2011. &#8220;They were very good at the business side of things. They were never as ambitious product-wise as they should have been.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Falling Short &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile Google had become what Microsoft had once been in the &#8217;90s -- a magnet for the most talented computer engineers. Google is now threatening Microsoft&#8217;s business on several fronts, including Web search and advertising, mobile software, cloud-computing and productivity software. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Windows Vista, an ambitious operating system that was years late to market and plagued by technical difficulties, met with a terrible reception by businesses and consumers when it was released in 2006. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In tablets and smartphones, Microsoft&#8217;s attempts to catch Apple and Google have fallen short. Its own Surface tablet has met with disappointing sales, and Windows 8, an operating system for tablet computers, has failed to gain significant market share on the devices. Various versions of Windows for smartphones haven&#8217;t made much of a dent either. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the Web, Ballmer&#8217;s big initiatives -- the Bing search engine, a $6.3 billion acquisition of advertising company aQuantive Inc. that later had to be written down, and an aborted attempt to buy Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) in 2008 -- have left Microsoft without much sway in the consumer space, where Google and Facebook Inc. (FB) now set the agenda. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;He was still too tied to the PC past to see the mobile future,&#8221; said Bajarin. &#8220;When business school cases are written about Steve&#8217;s tenure, they will point out that he totally underestimated Apple and certainly the iPhone. He didn&#8217;t take advantage of Microsoft&#8217;s own innovations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Aaron Ricadela in San Francisco at aricadela@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Pui-Wing Tam at ptam13@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;
</body></entry><entry author="By Dina Bass, Scott Moritz and Sarah Frier" date="Aug 24, 2013 12:01 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-08-24/microsoft-ceo-ballmer-said-to-discuss-exit-in-2010.html"><headline>Microsoft CEO Ballmer Said to Discuss Exit in 2010</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer has been contemplating his departure from the world&#8217;s largest software maker for at least three years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ballmer and the company&#8217;s board started discussing succession planning as early as 2010, said a person with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations were private. The conversations centered on what attributes Ballmer and other board members wanted in a new CEO. That led to Ballmer exposing internal CEO candidates to the board and also meeting with external candidates, said the person. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The exit plans gathered steam about three to four months ago, when Ballmer approached the board and said he was considering stepping down and asked directors to examine what an official succession process would look like, said the person. Ballmer finalized his decision with the board on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CEO, 57, will now retire within 12 months, Microsoft said yesterday in a statement. The Redmond, Washington-based company&#8217;s lead independent director, John Thompson, will oversee the search for his successor, heading a committee that will also include Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. Investors applauded the move, sending the shares up the most since 2009. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Industry Decline &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ballmer&#8217;s announcement reflects the changes roiling the computing industry his company helped pioneer. Microsoft, which supplies the software running most personal computers, lost almost half its value on Ballmer&#8217;s watch. The stock hasn&#8217;t closed above $50 since his first year on the job amid competition from Google Inc. (GOOG), Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Facebook Inc. (FB) in everything from tablets to the Web. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The world has figured out that you don&#8217;t need a PC to connect to the Internet,&#8221; said Dan Niles, portfolio manager with Alphaone Capital Partners LLC, in Tiburon, California. &#8220;A tablet or a smartphone is just fine. Microsoft is going from having 90 percent of the market in PCs to 5 percent in smartphones.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ballmer, in a memo to employees yesterday that was posted on Microsoft&#8217;s website, wrote, &#8220;There is never a perfect time for this type of transition, but now is the right time.&#8221; He added, &#8220;We need a CEO who will be here longer term for this new direction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Management Shakeup &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The announcement comes six weeks after Ballmer streamlined the company&#8217;s management, spurring speculation that he was grooming successors. He cut the number of business units to four and said Windows chief Julie Larson-Green, 51, would oversee all hardware, including the Surface tablet and Xbox console and related games. Windows Phone software head Terry Myerson gained responsibility for the Windows and Xbox operating systems. Skype president Tony Bates, 46, was put in charge of a new group for business development and acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other PC-related companies are also been struggling with an industry decline. Intel Corp. (INTC), which supplies the chips used in PCs, announced a CEO change last year. Dell Inc. (DELL), the No. 3 PC maker, is embroiled in a months-long battle to go private. And this week, Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ), the No. 2 PC company, shook up its executive ranks as it attempts a turnaround. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The mantle of technology leadership has instead been taken up by Google, Apple and Facebook, which have over the past decade moved the landscape toward mobile, search and social networking -- all areas where Microsoft is weak. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Lightning Rod&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amid these shifts, Microsoft last month reported quarterly profits and sales that missed analysts&#8217; estimates. The company&#8217;s latest computing operating system, Windows 8, also hasn&#8217;t spurred the comeback that Ballmer was aiming for. In April, activist investor ValueAct Holdings LP disclosed a stake of about $1.9 billion in Microsoft, pushing the software maker to consider giving the shareholder a board seat. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;He&#8217;s become a lightning rod for frustration over Microsoft&#8217;s lack of progress in mobile and Windows 8,&#8221; said Richard Williams, an analyst at Cross Research in Millburn, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s stock rose 7.3 percent to $34.75 at the close in New York yesterday. Since Ballmer became CEO in 2000, Microsoft&#8217;s total return including shares and dividends was down 13 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, meaning investors who invested $1,000 in the company&#8217;s shares at the time would only have $867.24 left now. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Internal Shock &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ballmer said in an interview with ZDNet yesterday that he officially communicated that he would exit during a board call two days ago. Gates, who is chairman and on the board, didn&#8217;t ask Ballmer to stay, said the CEO. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Bill respects my decision,&#8221; Ballmer said to ZDNet. &#8220;Ultimately, these kinds of things have to be one&#8217;s own personal decision.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Members of Microsoft&#8217;s senior leadership team only learned about Ballmer&#8217;s decision to retire at a meeting on Aug. 22, said a person with knowledge of the matter. Many senior executives were surprised, said another person, who asked not to be identified because the discussions were private. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The announcement of Ballmer&#8217;s departure coincides with the time when Microsoft conducts the CEO&#8217;s annual performance review. In each of the past two years, Ballmer has received less than his maximum bonus because of deficiencies in areas like online services, mobile and tablets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Possible Successors &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it would consider both external and internal candidates for CEO. Among the internal candidates are Bates, Myerson, Satya Nadella, head of the server business who was appointed to direct cloud and enterprise products last month, and Qi Lu, responsible for the Bing search engine and other Internet projects and who was named to oversee Office and the Skype videoconference business and to run a new applications group, according to people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to identified because the discussions are private. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Someone who isn&#8217;t in the running is Gates, 57, who has been working on projects at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, among other things, said two people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ballmer took over the CEO role in 2000 from Gates, his schoolmate at Harvard University. While Ballmer had a boisterous style that made him legendary at company presentations, he largely remained in Gates&#8217;s shadow. Ballmer wasn&#8217;t seen as possessing the same vision for technology or the ability to anticipate changes in the industry, said Williams. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Different Styles &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ballmer was more the executive than the visionary and he missed a few turning points that visionaries wouldn&#8217;t have,&#8221; Williams said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unlike Gates, who dropped out of Harvard to start Microsoft, Ballmer stayed in school and received a degree in applied math and economics. He then joined Microsoft in 1980. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gates and Ballmer had very different management styles. While Gates was Microsoft&#8217;s geeky visionary, Ballmer was its excitable salesman. One video of the CEO on YouTube, entitled &#8220;The Best of Steve Ballmer,&#8221; features clips of him yelping and jumping on stage, wide-eyed and sweating, singing Microsoft&#8217;s virtues. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the 1980s and 90s, Microsoft&#8217;s swift rise to PC software dominance made Ballmer a billionaire many times over. He was the world&#8217;s 44th richest person as of yesterday, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with a fortune of $16.8 billion. Gates, the richest person in the world, has a net worth of $72.4 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Enriched Departure &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a time of important transformation for Microsoft,&#8221; Ballmer wrote in the memo. &#8220;This is an emotional and difficult thing for me to do. I take this step in the best interests of the company I love.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said he plans to continue as one of the company&#8217;s largest owners. Ballmer is the company&#8217;s fifth-largest shareholder, with a 4 percent stake, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With Microsoft shares soaring yesterday on the announcement of his coming retirement, Ballmer&#8217;s net worth jumped about $786 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last month&#8217;s reorganization, Microsoft&#8217;s largest shakeup in a decade, is designed to speed development of hardware and services as the company&#8217;s Windows business suffers from the shrinking PC market and poor demand for Windows-based mobile devices. The shuffle reversed some changes Ballmer made in 2002, when he divided Microsoft into what was then seven individual product units, each led by an executive with operational and financial responsibilities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Changing Executives &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the decade since then, he mainly tinkered with individual businesses. In 2011, Bob Muglia was pushed out as server chief, and in 2006 Ballmer revamped leadership of the Windows and Internet units after development delays for the Windows Vista operating system. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The latest reorganization was seen by analysts as a signal of which executives may be poised to succeed Ballmer. As demand wanes for PCs, the shakeup also sought to turn away from Microsoft&#8217;s original focus on &#8220;putting a PC on every desk in every home,&#8221; Ballmer wrote in a memo at the time. PC shipments fell about 11 percent in the second quarter, for a record fifth straight quarter of declines, according to market research firms IDC and Gartner Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Comprehensive Vision? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ballmer did a very good job turning Microsoft from a bloated monstrosity into a much leaner and meaner machine over the last few years,&#8221; said Microsoft investor Michael Obuchowski, a portfolio manager at North Shore Asset Management LLC in Cold Spring Harbor, New York. &#8220;However, despite the improved operations and much better quality of programming, Microsoft was severely lacking a comprehensive vision that would have allowed the company to stay ahead of the trends.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft also is trying to challenge Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Google in cloud services as more customers opt for software that&#8217;s run over the Web instead of installed on corporate machines. Cloud efforts that were scattered across several divisions were concentrated under two units in the reorganization. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even with all the recent executive changes, there&#8217;s no heir apparent, Obuchowski said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is not going to be an easy search,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The expectations are very high and I don&#8217;t think Microsoft can afford to make a mistake here. I can&#8217;t think of any obvious candidates off the top of my head.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Scott Moritz in New York at smoritz6@bloomberg.net; Sarah Frier in New York at sfrier1@bloomberg.net; Dina Bass in Seattle at dbass2@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editors responsible for this story: Pui-Wing Tam at ptam13@bloomberg.net; Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is moving to reassure employees that a reorganization plan by departing Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer will go ahead. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some members of Microsoft&#8217;s senior leadership team e-mailed their staff Friday to say they remain committed to Ballmer&#8217;s vision and the reorganization, said two people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the e-mails were private. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The communications follow concern at the software maker that any new CEO -- especially an external one -- won&#8217;t keep the company as Ballmer laid out last month in the biggest restructuring in more than a decade. Ballmer is refocusing Microsoft on hardware and Internet-based services, in a bid to move the company away from software for the declining personal-computer industry and onto better footing with Google Inc. (GOOG), Facebook Inc. (FB) and Apple Inc. (AAPL) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s going to be more confusion near-term,&#8221; said Sid Parakh, an analyst at McAdams Wright Ragen in Seattle. &#8220;It just seems like now there&#8217;s the question of how&#8217;s the new person going to look at these changes. From an employee perspective, they are at a point of &#8216;OK, now what do we do here?&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tony Imperati, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;As Planned &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s leadership team also held a previously planned meeting on Friday, said the people with knowledge of the matter. Microsoft&#8217;s board stressed in statements Friday that a new CEO will execute Ballmer&#8217;s strategy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Already behind in mobile and tablets and with new products scrounging up minuscule market share while its core revenue from the Windows operating system shrinks, Microsoft can ill afford to wait and see if a new CEO alters the Ballmer plan. The company&#8217;s stock is down about 37 percent under Ballmer&#8217;s tenure as CEO, which started in January 2000. Last month, Microsoft also reported sales and profit that missed analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now as Microsoft embarks on a new CEO search, it will also have to contend with retaining employees and tamping down unease that for some began with the July reorganization. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft executives and workers in the process of moving into new divisions and roles don&#8217;t know if they will be asked to shift again under new management, said one of the people. Some executives unhappy with their new roles may leave after stock grants and bonuses are given at the end of August, said another person. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft executives have also received an increase in outside job offers since the reorganization and expect that to accelerate as the next CEO remains to be chosen, said another person with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ballmer&#8217;s reorganization, which put all of Microsoft&#8217;s hardware into one unit and shifted the Windows and Windows Phone operating systems under the same executive, was undertaken with the knowledge that a new CEO might end up at the company&#8217;s helm, said another person with knowledge of the matter. It didn&#8217;t make sense to put the changes on hold for as much as a year until a new CEO was in place, the person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Dina Bass in Seattle at dbass2@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editors responsible for this story: Pui-Wing Tam at ptam13@bloomberg.net; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Billionaire Leonard Blavatnik won a
$42.5 million breach of contract award against JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) over claims the bank stuffed a fund with risky mortgage
securities and lost 10 percent of his $1 billion investment.
Blavatnik lost a negligence claim against the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blavatnik, 56, ranked 51st on Bloomberg&#8217;s billionaires
index with a net worth of $15.6 billion, sued JPMorgan in 2009
in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, accusing the
biggest U.S. bank by assets of putting more money into mortgage
securities in his CMMF fund than investment guidelines allowed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Melvin Schweitzer, who presided over a two-week
trial this year, ruled that J.P. Morgan Investment Management
breached its contract with Blavatnik&#8217;s CMMF fund by exceeding a
20 percent cap on mortgage securities. The judge awarded
$42.5 million in damages plus interest, in a ruling dated Aug.
21 and made public today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan Investment Management classified some mortgage
investments in the account as asset-backed securities,
increasing the amount of the fund&#8217;s mortgage assets to as much
as 60 percent of the portfolio, Schweitzer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Whether JPMIM had its own understanding that the &#8216;asset-backed securities&#8217; category included some types of mortgage-backed securities is of no moment,&#8221; Schweitzer said. &#8220;There is
no evidence that this was ever communicated to CMMF during the
negotiations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clear Guidelines &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guidelines for the account were clear, that the
investments had to be liquid and low-risk, with returns similar
to a typical money market fund, Blavatnik said in a statement.
He asked for $100 million in damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I hope that this decision sends a clear message to
JPMorgan that they have to honor their obligations to their
clients,&#8221; Blavatnik said. &#8220;There are a lot of people out there
who, I understand, feel they have been wronged by JPMorgan but
cannot afford to take on a huge bank. They shouldn&#8217;t have to.
JPmorgan should do the right thing because it is the right thing
to do.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schweitzer found in favor of J.P. Morgan on Blavatnik&#8217;s
claim of negligence and breach of fiduciary duty, saying that
evidence shows that the securities were &#8220;relatively safe and
desirable&#8221; at the time they were bought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Subsequent developments caused the securities to become
illiquid and JPMIM advised CMMF to wait out the storm rather
than sell at deeply discounted prices,&#8221; Schweitzer said. &#8220;The
court finds that JPMIM acted reasonably in light of the
information that was available to it at the time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan Chase, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is CMMF LLC v. J.P. Morgan Investment Management
Inc., 601924-09, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noah Holdings Ltd. (NOAH), a Chinese
wealth-management company, sank 17 percent in New York after
JPMorgan Chase  Co. downgraded the stock amid a weaker outlook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American depositary receipts of Noah dropped the most in
two months to $13.76 at 3:26 p.m. in New York, trimming this
year&#8217;s rally to 136 percent. Trading volume was five times the
90-day average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan cut Noah to neutral from the equivalent of buy,
citing the prospects for softer product sales in the second-half
of this year. The Shanghai-based company lifted its 2013 net
income forecast earlier this month and said second-quarter
profit jumped 133 percent. The stock traded at 12.8 times
estimated earnings after valuation surged to a  multiple of 22
on Aug. 12, the highest level in two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The structural story is increasingly reflected in
valuations and would wait for better entry points on the
stock,&#8221; JPMorgan analysts led by Joshua Klaczek wrote in a note
dated Aug. 23. The stock is &#8220;somewhat of a show-me story in
second half, given recent volatility.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VMware Inc. (VMW), the largest maker of
software that lets computers run multiple operating systems,
said it&#8217;s hiring Tony Scott, former chief information officer at
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), for the same position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott, who left Microsoft in May after five years, will
report to Pat Gelsinger, chief executive officer of VMware, the
company said in a statement today. Scott&#8217;s departure was
announced in June, when Microsoft said he planned to focus on
personal projects. Prior to that, Scott served as CIO at Walt
Disney Co. (DIS) and chief technology officer at General Motors Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VMware&#8217;s hiring of a new CIO comes days after Microsoft CEO
Steve Ballmer announced plans to resign within a year, after
missing opportunities to take the maker of Windows software
beyond personal computers and into a leading position in
products such as smartphones, Web search and tablet computing.
VMware is Microsoft&#8217;s main rival in the market for so-called
virtualization software, which lets companies combine multiple
tasks on a single server. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VMware is holding its VMworld conference beginning today in

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s next chief executive officer will need the expertise and strategic vision that can help the biggest software maker confront a broad range of threats that Steve Ballmer, for all his expertise as a salesman, was never able to repel. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft requires a product person like Marissa Mayer, who oversaw some of Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s most-popular services including its home page, and was brought in to turn around Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO), according to analysts and executive recruiters. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new CEO will also need to help Microsoft hone its strategy, comparable to Lou Gerstner&#8217;s overhaul of International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) The challenge: making up for a lost decade when Microsoft fell behind Google and Apple Inc. (AAPL) in smartphones, tablets and Web search -- and pushing it deeper into areas such as cloud computing, wearable technology and online advertising. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a challenge akin to searching for a needle in a haystack, knowing the needle isn&#8217;t likely there,&#8221; said Robert Sutton, a professor at Stanford University and author of several books on corporate management. &#8220;This is a massive effort in strategy, leadership and culture.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Within Microsoft, Tony Bates, Satya Nadella, Qi Lu and Terry Myerson are the leading choices, people with knowledge of the matter said. Microsoft should look carefully within Google for possible successors, executive recruiters said. The operator of the world&#8217;s most-popular search engine is known for a fast-moving culture that has enabled it to find and succeed in new markets, such as cloud computing and mobile, where its Android software now runs 75 percent of the world&#8217;s smartphones. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activist investors from Carl Icahn to Daniel Loeb and Bill Ackman are ratcheting up their campaigns, increasingly targeting America&#8217;s biggest companies and seeking the ouster of chief executive officers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Taking executive scalps has paid off for shareholders at companies such as Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO), Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) and Nutrisystem Inc. (NTRI), according to data compiled by Bloomberg. There have been flops, too, including Ackman&#8217;s CEO replacement efforts at J.C. Penney Co. Its stock has fallen 62 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Targeting management adds to decades-old routine activist demands for mergers, breakups or dividends to boost equity prices. Just three days ago, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said he&#8217;s retiring within a year -- four months after activist fund manager ValueAct Capital Partners LP&#8217;s Jeffrey Ubben disclosed a $1.9 billion Microsoft stake. ValueAct has been seeking a board seat, a person with knowledge of the matter said earlier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Where activists are successful in getting a board to listen to them on a CEO search the track record is quite mixed,&#8221; said William Mills, a corporate lawyer at Cadwalader, Wickersham  Taft LLP, who has advised both companies and activists. &#8220;Yahoo and Chesapeake Energy so far are looking like successes. J.C. Penney (JCP) is probably the most notable failure. There are several other situations where the jury is still out.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) trader Javier Martin-Artajo was released from police custody after telling a Madrid court he opposed attempts by U.S. prosecutors to extradite him on charges he hid trading losses that cost the bank $6.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The former trader turned himself in yesterday morning after being contacted by investigators, a Spanish police official said. He was released after a hearing in Madrid yesterday in which he said he was unwilling to be extradited, according to a spokeswoman for the National Court. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. this month charged Martin-Artajo, a Spanish citizen, and Julien Grout, a French citizen, with trying to hide the losses stemming from trades by Bruno Iksil, the Frenchman at the center of the case who became known as the London Whale. Grout and Martin-Artajo face up to 20 years in jail if convicted of the most serious counts, including conspiracy and wire fraud. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The likelihood is fairly significant that he would go back,&#8221; said Ivan Mercado, managing partner at Mercado  Rengel, a law firm in Spain that works on U.S. extradition cases. &#8220;Spain and the U.S. have an extradition agreement. He can&#8217;t just say he doesn&#8217;t want to go.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Bank&#8217;s Negotiations &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s losses prompted investigations on two continents, U.S. congressional hearings and an internal review that led to a 50 percent pay cut for Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, who the board said bore some responsibility for lapses. Regulators in the U.K. and U.S. are preparing to impose fines on the bank as soon as mid-September, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said last week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Most people don&#8217;t want to jump off cliffs,&#8221; said Deborah Borda during a conversation last week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She was in New York to talk about the 10th anniversary of the opening of Walt Disney Concert Hall, the Frank Gehry masterpiece that shimmers in downtown L.A. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The high-voltage CEO and president of the Los Angeles Philharmonic doesn&#8217;t just lean in. She jumps, runs, bikes and skillfully separates patrons from their money. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This talent has been perfected over the years at the two dinners she typically consumes with the affluent before and after performances. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since arriving in L.A. in 2000, Borda got Disney Hall built, created a $140 million endowment, discovered Gustavo Dudamel, and started YOLA (Youth Orchestra of L.A.) -- her version of Venezuela&#8217;s highly regarded El Sistema music program -- for disadvantaged kids. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We spoke over lunch with Muse at Bloomberg&#8217;s New York headquarters. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hoelterhoff: How are you celebrating? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Borda: We have several free neighborhood concerts featuring Julie Andrews, who&#8217;s a board member, narrating &#8220;Peter and the Wolf.&#8221; One stop is the City of Hope cancer hospital. Then on Sept. 30, Gustavo conducts a varied program including Bach, Mahler, Cage, Ades. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hoelterhoff: That hall took forever to get built. I remember hearing about it in the late 1980s! &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Glittering Hall &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Borda: The place was still a hole in the ground when I got there. Frank had actually designed it before Bilbao, which a lot of people don&#8217;t realize because of the delay. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hoelterhoff: I never get tired of looking at it, it&#8217;s so unusual. It broke the box look. Any changes as the model became reality? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Borda: At first, the skin was not stainless steel, but stone. Briefly, after Bilbao opened, titanium was considered. It sparkles and is an ideal surface for a town with a lot of rainy weather, which is not our problem in L.A. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hoelterhoff: The orchestra had a sizable deficit when you took over. How long did you need to erase it? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Borda: We&#8217;ve had a balanced budget since 2003. Right now, the budget is over $110 million which is second only, I think, to the Met in the world of American music. We need to raise about $30 million every season. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I really want to say this: It&#8217;s a business, but you have to be motivated by an absolute love of the art form. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Hollywood Bowl &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hoelterhoff: You run two venues: Disney Hall and the Hollywood Bowl. I see that Wayne Shorter is celebrating his 80th at the Bowl. John Williams appears over the Labor Day weekend. How many people do you employ? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Borda: 106 musicians, 132 full time regular employees, around 1,000 seasonal employees: ushers, parking lot attendants, custodial, and so on. We have around 170 events in the hall and around 70 at the Bowl. That doesn&#8217;t count our education stuff and YOLA concerts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Bowl is where Dudamel made his debut in 2005, when someone cancelled and he&#8217;d just won the Mahler competition. It still took two years before he signed a contract. By then, others had noticed he was an extraordinary talent. I remember being at Tanglewood and seeing reps from the Chicago Symphony and the Boston Symphony. I got a little worried. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hoelterhoff: You&#8217;re finishing your Mozart opera cycle this season with a production of &#8220;Cosi fan tutte&#8221; by architect Zaha Hadid. Any more opera plans featuring star architects? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Changing World &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Borda: Probably not. I don&#8217;t like repeating myself. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hoelterhoff: What&#8217;s the most dramatic change you&#8217;ve observed in your world? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Borda: The decline of subscriptions. Within 20 years, the subscription rate will be down to 15 or 20 percent. It makes it a real challenge financially and artistically. This is an on-demand society now. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hoelterhoff: What else interests you beyond music? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Borda: I take a broad view of culture, from theater to film and food. I just got back from a 10-day biking trip through Burgundy. Look, I am interested in life. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(Manuela Hoelterhoff is executive editor of Muse, the arts and leisure section of Bloomberg News.) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Muse highlights include Laurie Muchnick on books and Mike Di Paola on ecology. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the writer of this story: Manuela Hoelterhoff at mhoelterhoff@bloomberg.net. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Billy at dbilly@bloomberg.net. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A U.S. housing regulator is seeking at least $6 billion from JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) to settle civil claims the bank sold bad mortgage bonds to government-backed finance companies Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC), according to a person briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, is fighting the Federal Housing Finance Agency&#8217;s latest request, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. The lawsuit is scheduled to go to trial in June, according to a filing in federal court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The FHFA sued JPMorgan and 17 other banks over faulty mortgage bonds two years ago in an effort to recoup some of the losses taxpayers were forced to cover when the government took over the failing mortgage finance companies in 2008. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are regulated by FHFA, have taken $187.5 billion in federal aid since then. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Peter Garuccio, a spokesman for FHFA, and Justin Perras, a spokesman for the bank, declined to comment. The Financial Times reported the $6 billion minimum settlement request earlier today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;False Statements &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The FHFA accused JPMorgan and its affiliates of making false statements and omitting material facts in selling $33 billion in mortgage bonds to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from Sept. 7, 2005 through Sept. 19, 2007. The regulator said executives at JPMorgan, Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns Cos., which were acquired by JPMorgan in 2008, knowingly misrepresented the quality of the loans underlying the bonds, among other things, according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is telling employees that a reorganization plan by departing Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer will go ahead, seeking to reassure senior managers who are concerned that the search for a successor will throw turnaround efforts into disarray. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some members of Microsoft&#8217;s senior leadership team e-mailed their staff on Aug. 23 to say they remain committed to Ballmer&#8217;s vision and the reorganization, said three people with knowledge of the matter. Some Microsoft executives have seen an increase in outside job offers since the July restructuring plan and others may be tempted to leave after stock grants and bonuses are awarded in late August, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the communications were private. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even as it hunts for a CEO who may change tack, Microsoft&#8217;s board needs managers to stay focused on the reorganization plan, the biggest shift in more than a decade. Ballmer is emphasizing hardware and Internet-based services, shifting away from software for the declining personal-computer industry and putting Microsoft on better footing to compete with Google Inc. (GOOG), Facebook Inc. (FB) and Apple Inc. (AAPL) in mobile devices and online advertising. &lt;/p&gt;

Walt Disney Co., Weather Channel LLC and music-video service
Vevo LLC for Apple TV, stepping up the pace of bringing on new
video content to its $100 Internet-connected set-top box. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The material was added today with a software update, said
Christine Monaghan, a spokeswoman for Apple. Two applications
from Disney, Disney Channel and Disney XD, will have live and
on-demand content, and will be available to subscribers of pay-TV services that carry the channels. Vevo and the Weather
Channel will be available without a cable or satellite
subscription, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is adding more programming
to Apple TV after years of calling it a &#8220;hobby&#8221; product and
mainly keeping it as a tool to stream Internet video from iTunes
or Netflix Inc. (NFLX) on a television. In June, Apple made ESPN and
HBO programming available to customers who subscribe to those
channels through their pay TV service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple is competing against Roku Inc. and Microsoft Corp. to
deliver Web video. Yet by adding applications from programmers
and restricting access for some material to pay-TV subscribers,
Apple is taking a different approach than Intel Corp. (INTC) and Sony
Corp. (6758), which are negotiating deals to build services that will
compete with existing cable and satellite plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latest update, Apple also added material from the

Institution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OGX Petroleo  Gas Participacoes SA (OGXP3),
the worst performing oil stock in emerging markets, said it will
return nine oilfield licenses in Brazil while retaining those it
has in partnership with other producers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OGX &#8220;concluded that it&#8217;s not recommendable, at the current
time, to assume exploratory risk in new areas where it hasn&#8217;t
formed ventures with other companies,&#8221; the Rio de Janeiro-based
explorer said in a Brazilian regulatory filing today. In a
government auction in May, OGX picked up the nine blocks plus
four licenses with partners Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) of the U.S.,
France&#8217;s Total SA (FP) and Brazil&#8217;s QGEP Participacoes SA. (QGEP3) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning the assets is part of a business strategy
revaluation after the company said July 1 it wouldn&#8217;t develop
three fields. OGX also said at the time that it may shut its
only oil-producing asset, the Tubarao Azul field, next year. OGX
said Aug. 14 it hired Blackstone Group LP for &#8220;ongoing efforts
to assess its capital structure.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OGX has declined 83 percent this year, more than any other
emerging-market oil company worth at least $100 million,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The stock fell 7.4
percent to 75 centavos cents at 11:28 a.m. in Sao Paulo today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneur Eike Batista&#8217;s flagship company said it will
have to pay a fine of about 3.4 million reais ($1.4 million) for
returning the oil blocks. Brazil&#8217;s oil regulator, known as ANP,
can now reassign the blocks to the second highest bidders.
Batista&#8217;s company had promised investors OGX would pump 730,000
barrels a day by 2015. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is short of cash to pay $5.4 billion it owes
to international oil companies, Oil Minister Sherif Ismail said
last week, as the upheaval following the military&#8217;s July
overthrow of president Mohamed Mursi scares away tourists and
foreign investors. Total&#8217;s investment is the second in Egypt
this year after buying Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA)&#8217;s retail and commercial
fuel operations in May, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchase &#8220;is fully aligned with our strategy of growth
in the Middle East,&#8221; Thomas Rebeyrol, managing director of
Total Egypt, said in the statement. Once the Chevron and Shell
deals are complete, Paris-based Total projects annual sales in
Egypt of more than 3 million metric tons and a 14 percent share
of the country&#8217;s service stations, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of the deal wasn&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A gambling website picked Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) Chief Executive Officer Stephen Elop, who has presided over a 62 percent decline in market value, as the favorite to become Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s new CEO. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Elop, a former Microsoft executive, has 5-to-1 odds to be hired as Steve Ballmer&#8217;s replacement, according to Ladbrokes Plc (LAD), the U.K.-based gambling operator. He leads a pool including internal candidates Kevin Turner and Julie Larson-Green and outsiders like Apple Inc. (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook -- a 100-to-1 dark horse. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft is searching for a CEO who can help the biggest software maker fight back against competition in mobile, search, video, gaming and personal-computing development. Microsoft said last week Ballmer, its leader since 2000, would step down within the next 12 months. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Elop was the president of Microsoft&#8217;s business division, where he was in charge of Microsoft Office, before taking the top job at Nokia. The mobile-phone maker announced a strategic partnership with Microsoft just months after Elop became CEO. Elop likened his company&#8217;s mobile position at the time to a burning oil platform on the verge of being engulfed in flames. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Sept. 10, 2010, when the Espoo, Finland-based company hired Elop, it was trading at 7.79 euros a share. Nokia fell 1 percent to 2.96 euros yesterday in Helsinki. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) managing
director Jason Lee was indicted by a grand jury on a rape charge
stemming from the alleged assault on a 20-year-old woman at a
Long Island, New York, home, court records show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee, 37, was arrested and charged with first-degree rape on
Aug. 21 in the town of East Hampton after police went to his
Clover Leaf Lane vacation home and learned that a woman had been
sexually assaulted inside the residence, where several people
had gathered, according to a police statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A grand jury indicted Lee on three charges: one count of
first-degree rape, which carries a maximum sentence of 25 years
in prison, and two misdemeanor counts of assault and sexual
misconduct, according to online state court records. Lee, who is
free on $20,000 cash bail, is scheduled to be arraigned before
Judge Barbara R. Kahn in Suffolk County Court in Riverhead on
Sept. 20, court records show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The police statement didn&#8217;t identify Lee&#8217;s employer. Lee,
who lives in New York, is head of convertibles at Goldman Sachs

&lt;p&gt;Capital One Financial Corp. (COF), the
lender that gets more than half its revenue from credit cards,
hired two bankers with experience advising firms in the oil and
gas industries as it expands its securities business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Barclays Plc (BARC) banker Russ Johnson and Bob
Mertensotto, who worked for JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), will fill
newly created positions, according to a statement today from the
McLean, Virginia-based company. Johnson, who co-led oil and gas
leveraged finance at Barclays, will be head of energy investment
banking, while Mertensotto will lead energy debt-capital
markets, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson and Mertensotto will be in charge of Capital One&#8217;s
energy-banking office in Houston and report to Jim McBride, head
of the energy-banking group within capital markets, the company
said. Mertensotto began at the bank today, while Johnson joined
last week, Michael Bulger, a Capital One spokesman, said in an

&lt;p&gt;The hires are the second and third this month announced by

&lt;p&gt;Norman Matloff's op-ed article, ``Stop Blaming Indian Companies for Visa Abuse,'' claims that a Senate reform bill scapegoats India for visa abuses. It is important to clarify that the legislation neither targets companies nor immigrants from India or any other countries in its reform of the H-1B visa system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The reforms in our bipartisan bill affect all companies the same way, whether they are based in India or Indiana, Boston or Beijing. In general, the Senate bill greatly expands access to H-1B visas, by raising the annual cap from 65,000 visas to as many as 180,000 visas a year based on market demand for highly skilled immigrant employees. Because this bill helps high-tech companies and highly skilled immigrants, it is endorsed by every major high-tech organization and groups representing highly skilled immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Senate bill, however, does make critical changes to ensure that the H-1B visa process only allows companies to hire foreign workers when they are needed, not when they are replacing the jobs or lowering the wages of American workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here is what is happening today. Rather than using the system solely to supplement gaps in the domestic workforce --which is what Congress intended -- there are some companies that only hire foreign tech workers with the hopes of eventually staffing these foreign workers into U.S. companies when a particular need arises. These staffing companies are based in different parts of the world, including here in the U.S. They make their money by hiring foreign workers who will then be staffed out to other companies for substantially cheaper wages than what it would have cost to hire a qualified American.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The marketing materials of these staffing companies boast about their ``outsourcing expertise'' and say that their advantage is their ability to conduct what they call ``labor arbitrage,'' which is -- in their own words -- ``transferring work functions to a lower-cost environment for increased savings.'' While this practice isn't illegal, there isn't a single elected official who will defend continuing this practice in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here is how we solve this problem. We increase the fees companies will have to pay for work visas if they choose to continue operating in an environment where a large percentage of their employees are temporary foreign workers. And, we ban this practice for companies that have more than 50 percent of their workers on temporary visas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Raising these fees will accomplish two important goals. First, it will provide the necessary funds to secure our border without raising taxes or adding to the deficit. Second, it will level the playing field for American workers so that they don't lose out on good jobs here in the U.S. because it is cheaper to hire a foreign worker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is time to reform our system to make us the most competitive in the world, ensuring that Americans who work hard to obtain science and technology degrees can find jobs when they graduate from school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Charles E. Schumer is a U.S. senator from New York.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intellectual Ventures Management LLC, led by a former chief technology officer of Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), is seeking $3 billion for a fund that would give it steady cash flow from patents and invention rights, according to an investor presentation obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Invention Investment Fund III will purchase patents, patent licensing rights and applications as well as other invention rights, according to the April presentation from the Bellevue, Washington-based firm. The firm, founded in 2000, has historically made some of its money from suing over patent infringements. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mercury Capital Advisors LLC, an advisory firm that helps firms raise money from institutional investors, is the fund&#8217;s placement agent. Kyle Mahoney, a spokesman for Intellectual Ventures, declined to comment on the fundraising. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Intellectual Ventures is among a growing number of investment firms seeking to take advantage of investor appetite for predictable cash flow. Last week, Harbert Management Corp. announced a separate account with California Public Employees&#8217; Retirement System, the largest U.S. pension fund, that will provide cash distributions from contracts to sell power plants&#8217; capacity and energy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Intellectual Ventures was founded by Nathan Myhrvold, former chief strategist and chief technology officer at Microsoft, along with Edward Jung, Peter Detkin and Greg Gorder. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Firm&#8217;s Founders &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jung, who is Intellectual Ventures&#8217; CTO, was previously chief software architect and adviser to executive staff at Microsoft. Detkin was a vice president and assistant general counsel at Intel Corp., where he managed the company&#8217;s patent and licensing departments, and Gorder was a partner at law firm Perkins Coie LLP. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like previous funds, the firm&#8217;s new offering will primarily make investments in technology invention rights. The firm makes its money from legal settlements, strategic sales of portfolios, retail licensing and subscription-based licensing, according to the presentation. This year, it has brought lawsuits for patent infringement against several companies, including HSBC Holdings Plc, SunTrust Bank Inc., JPMorgan Chase  Co., Motorola Mobility Holdings LLC and Toshiba Corp. (6502) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Intellectual Ventures and RPX Corp. this year led a group of companies that bought license rights to Kodak&#8217;s digital-imaging portfolio for $527 million. Kodak used the proceeds to pay off bankruptcy debt. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Management Fee &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new fund will have a 20-year life, according to the presentation, which is twice as long as an average private-equity fund. The fund will charge a 2 percent management fee on committed capital for 10 years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The goal for the firm&#8217;s third fund is larger than the $2.8 billion Intellectual Ventures raised for its previous vehicle in 2008. The firm made 240 investments out of Fund II last year, according to the presentation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s 2008 and 2003 vehicles were producing average annual cash yields of 12 percent and 19 percent as of Dec. 31, respectively, the presentation shows. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Intellectual Ventures manages six funds with total committed capital of about $6 billion. In 2010, it raised a &#8220;global good fund&#8221; focused on solving problems in the developing world and a second &#8220;invention science fund&#8221; that invests in inventions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Sabrina Willmer in New York at swillmer2@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Christian Baumgaertel at cbaumgaertel@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Senate Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations asked energy-market regulators to
hand over &#8220;key documents&#8221; from a probe of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
as lawmakers examine banks&#8217; roles in commodities markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who leads the panel, and
John McCain of Arizona, its ranking Republican, sent a letter to
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission seeking records from
the agency&#8217;s inquiry and settlement with JPMorgan, according to
a copy of the Aug. 2 request obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawmakers asked the FERC to include a 70-page document
outlining investigators&#8217; findings, which was cited in articles
by the New York Times. The regulator kept that document private
when announcing a $410 million accord with JPMorgan last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The committee has repeatedly investigated Wall Street firms
in the wake of 2008&#8217;s credit crisis, chronicling Goldman Sachs
Group Inc.&#8217;s sales of mortgage-linked instruments and JPMorgan&#8217;s
handling of botched derivatives bets. In an interview last
month, Levin said lawmakers would use subpoena power to examine
banks&#8217; dealings in physical commodities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have been into this issue for a long time and it&#8217;s a
very, very significant issue,&#8221; Levin said July 23 of his
panel&#8217;s look at banks&#8217; businesses tied to energy and natural
resources. The potential for conflicts of interest or price
manipulation &#8220;is huge,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential for mergers and
acquisitions within the U.K. water industry still exists even
amid a regulatory price review as the low cost of debt among the
companies is attractive, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Further MA in the sector cannot be discounted,&#8221;
JPMorgan analysts Edmund Reid and Chris Gallagher wrote in a
note to clients yesterday. &#8220;The recent Borealis approach for
Severn Trent (SVT) shows that infrastructure funds are willing to look
through the regulatory review.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LongRiver Partners, a group led by Canada&#8217;s Borealis
Infrastructure Management Inc., abandoned its 5.3 billion-pound
($8.2 billion) bid for Coventry-based Severn Trent in June.
Under local rules, bidders can&#8217;t return with a new approach for
six months. Severn Trent is the second-largest publicly traded
U.K. water company, trailing United Utilities Group Plc. (UU/) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares of Pennon Group Plc (PNN), the U.K.&#8217;s third-largest
publicly traded water company, rose as much as 1.9 percent in
London today after JPMorgan raised its rating on the stock to
overweight from neutral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysts cited Pennon&#8217;s lack of exposure to the review
that U.K. regulator Ofwat is conducting to set prices water
companies can charge from 2015 through 2020. Ofwat&#8217;s final
determinations are due to be published in December 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In upgrading Pennon, the analysts noted its &#8220;sizeable
waste business Viridor, which means it has less exposure to the
review than its peers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alcatel-Lucent SA named former
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) banker Jean Raby as chief financial and
legal officer as part of the networking-equipment maker&#8217;s
reorganization under Chief Executive Officer Michel Combes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raby, who was a partner and managing director at Goldman&#8217;s
investment-banking division until last year, will start in the
new role next month and move to Paris, Alcatel-Lucent said today
in a statement. The 49-year-old will take on responsibilities
left by outgoing CFO Paul Tufano. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combes, who took over in April after predecessor Ben Verwaayen&#8217;s asset sales and firings failed to turn around the
company, is trying to keep Alcatel-Lucent&#8217;s cash from dwindling
further after seven consecutive years of declines. Raby brings
investment-banking expertise as the company tries to cut debt by
2 billion euros ($2.7 billion) by the end of 2015 by selling
shares on the stock market or through further asset sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;His extensive knowledge of the industry and his deep
understanding of global financial markets in the widest sense
will be of great value as we drive ahead with the implementation
of the Shift Plan announced in June,&#8221; Combes said in the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Alcatel-Lucent fell 1 percent to 1.90 euros at
9:51 a.m. in Paris. They had jumped 92 percent this year through
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Loans Rate &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raby, born in Canada and trained as a lawyer, holds a
Bachelor of Laws from the Universite Laval in&#160;Quebec City, a
Master of Philosophy in International Relations from the
University of Cambridge in the U.K. and a Master of Laws from
Harvard Law School. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcatel-Lucent in December pledged its 39,000-strong patent
portfolio as collateral for a 2-billion-euro loan deal
underwritten by Credit Suisse Group AG and Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Paris-based equipment maker is now seeking to reduce
the rate on part of these loans, with Morgan Stanley, Credit
Suisse and Deutsche Bank AG arranging the transaction, a person
with knowledge of the matter said this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the coming months, Combes will have to deal with job
cuts and asset sales as part of his bid to reorganize a company
that has lost more than $10 billion since it was created through
a 2006 merger. The Frenchman is also in talks with potential
research partners, which could become Alcatel-Lucent investors.
Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) already agreed to buy a minority stake. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), within weeks of announcing plans by Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer to retire, will probably boost its dividend amid calls by an activist shareholder to return more cash to investors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ValueAct Holdings LP, which in April disclosed a stake of about $1.9 billion in the world&#8217;s largest software maker, has been seeking a return of more money, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Microsoft is poised to increase the quarterly dividend by 13 percent to 26 cents a share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s policy for the last several years has been to boost the quarterly dividend in September in line with increases in operating income, which rose 23 percent in the latest fiscal year. While too big a payout might require Microsoft to incur a tax on cash held overseas, an overly modest increase would put the company at odds with investors clamoring for more. ValueAct has until Aug. 30 to decide whether to mount a proxy battle for representation on Microsoft&#8217;s board. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft has a target on its back,&#8221; said Kim Caughey Forrest, an analyst at Pittsburgh-based Fort Pitt Capital Group Inc., which manages $1.4 billion in assets, including Microsoft shares. &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if technology companies that generate a lot of cash, regardless of where it&#8217;s domiciled, would consider bigger dividend increases, because the activist investor has really come into play in the last 18 months, and not just at Microsoft.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Denmark&#8217;s bank regulator reprimanded
Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE) for inadequate management of market risks two
months after ordering Denmark&#8217;s biggest lender to add $18
billion in risk weighted assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Supervisory Authority said yesterday the
Copenhagen bank must ensure control of market risks across the
company, weigh risks against returns, and safeguard against
alterations to risk models driving changes in assessments. The
agency also called for greater transparency in decision making. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Copenhagen-based agency ordered the improvements after
reviewing a study on the bank&#8217;s risk management systems that
Danske paid for and that was requested by Denmark&#8217;s 14-member
Financial Council, which advises the FSA on key cases. The FSA
said it received the analysis, conducted by the consulting firm
Oliver Wyman, on June 18. The review was ordered to determine
whether Danske had taken on more risk than it budgeted for and
whether its assessments mirrored reality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danske agreed to increase capital allocated to meet its
solvency requirements, the FSA said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank has taken steps to improve risk management, the
FSA said. It is hiring an external consultant to assess its
models, and the market risk committee hired four people earlier
this year, bringing total employees in the unit to about 46.
Management has agreed to hire more people as needed, the FSA
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danske was identified by a government panel as one of
Denmark&#8217;s too-big-to-fail banks earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New rules in India provide that not less than 50 percent of

independent directors and they should be appointed for a period
of three years, the Forward Markets Commission said on its
website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Forward Markets Commission shall appoint four
independent directors, the regulator said in the rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, directors should satisfy criteria of &#8220;fit and
proper person,&#8221; and the appointment of the chief executive
officer shall be subject to prior approval of the commission,
the regulator said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exchanges have to furnish information related to the board
and corporate governance to the commission by Sept. 2. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;EU Investigation Finds China Solar-Panel Makers Got Aid &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese solar-panel makers received subsidies, a European
Union investigation showed, increasing the likelihood of EU
tariffs on imports of the renewable-energy technology from China
to counter trade-distorting state aid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission has concluded in the probe opened
last November that Chinese manufacturers of crystalline silicon
photovoltaic modules or panels, and cells and wafers used in
them, benefited from preferential lending, tax programs and
other aid, an EU official said yesterday in Brussels. The
inquiry is one of two that the commission is conducting into
alleged unfair Chinese trade in solar goods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission on Aug. 2 approved an agreement with China
to curb Chinese shipments of solar panels as part of a parallel
probe into below-cost sales, a practice known as dumping.
Chinese manufacturers that take part in the pact are being
spared provisional EU anti-dumping duties as high as 67.9
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission is engaged in a political balancing act as
it seeks to limit Chinese competition against European
manufacturers. On Aug. 7, the commission decided against
imposing preliminary anti-subsidy tariffs on Chinese solar

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Jo
White will meet Sept. 12 with the heads of exchanges and other
self-regulatory organizations to discuss last week&#8217;s trading
halt in Nasdaq-listed stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The meeting at the SEC will address the market data
dissemination system involved in last week&#8217;s halt as well as
other critical market systems and infrastructure issues,&#8221; John
Nester, an SEC spokesman, said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nasdaq&#8217;s Aug. 22 shutdown stopped trading in more than
2,000 U.S. stocks for three hours. The outage stemmed from a
communication error between another exchange and a network that
Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ) operates to disseminate data on quotes and
prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White also said after the outage that the SEC should
advance a proposal that would require exchanges and other
entities that facilitate trading to test the reliability of
their technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ex-JPMorgan Trader Released, Saying He Opposes Extradition &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) trader Javier Martin-Artajo was
released from police custody after telling a Madrid court he
opposed attempts by U.S. prosecutors to extradite him on charges
he hid trading losses that cost the bank $6.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former trader turned himself in yesterday morning after
being contacted by investigators, a Spanish police official
said. He was released after a hearing in Madrid yesterday in
which he said he was unwilling to be extradited, according to a
spokeswoman for the National Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. this month charged Martin-Artajo, a Spanish
citizen, and Julien Grout, a French citizen, with trying to hide
the losses stemming from trades by Bruno Iksil, the Frenchman at
the center of the case who became known as the &#8220;London Whale.&#8221;
Grout and Martin-Artajo face as many as 20 years in jail if
convicted of the most serious counts, including conspiracy and
wire fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo, 49, oversaw trading strategy for Iksil&#8217;s
synthetic portfolio at JPMorgan&#8217;s chief investment office in
London, while Grout was a trader who worked for him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo&#8217;s lawyer, Lista Cannon, didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to a call seeking comment yesterday. He &#8220;is confident
that when a complete and fair reconstruction of these complex
events is completed, he will be cleared of any wrongdoing,&#8221; a
spokeswoman for his law firm said earlier this month. Jennifer
Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a hearing yesterday, Martin-Artajo&#8217;s lawyer filed
documents in which his client denied the allegations, according
to a court official who asked not to be identified because they
weren&#8217;t authorized to speak publicly. The U.S. now has 40 days
to file sworn statements in support of its extradition request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extradition process &#8220;can take up to several months,&#8221;
said Ivan Mercado, managing partner at Mercado  Rengel, a law
firm in Spain that works on U.S. extradition cases. Mercado is
not involved in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spokeswoman for the court said Martin-Artajo&#8217;s
passport has been confiscated. Another court official said that
wasn&#8217;t the case, but that he can&#8217;t leave Spain without court
approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grout is living in France and isn&#8217;t a fugitive, his lawyer,
Edward Little, a partner at Hughes Hubbard  Reed LLP in New
York, said in an Aug. 12 interview, two days before his client
was charged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He visited the U.S. last month with confidence he was not
being indicted and moved to France to save money and look for a
job,&#8221; Little said at the time. France has no obligation under
its extradition treaty with the U.S. to send Grout to New York.
Little declined to comment yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Amazon Drops Price Parity Clause for German Retailers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon (AMZN) told Germany&#8217;s antitrust regulator it will drop the
company policy, known as the price parity clause, that forced
retailers to offer their lowest price at Amazon marketplace as
well as elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Cartel Office said it is reviewing whether it
can now drop the probe of Amazon&#8217;s policy. The company&#8217;s price
parity clause prevented retailers that offer goods on Amazon&#8217;s
platform from selling them cheaper elsewhere on Internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Germany&#8217;s Cartel Office said it was
surveying 2,400 retailers as it examined the impact of Amazon&#8217;s
price parity clause on Amazon marketplace online retailers. At
that time, the Cartel Office said Amazon may need to remove the
clause if the survey shows it leads to higher prices without
benefit to consumers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;BofA FDIC Suit for $1.7 Billion in Investor Losses Thrown Out &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s lawsuit against the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. over $1.7 billion in investor losses was
dismissed by a federal judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit was based on the bank&#8217;s role as trustee for Ocala
Funding LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein in Washington threw
out the case, saying there weren&#8217;t enough assets to make any
payments on general creditor claims, according to her decision
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case stems from a mortgage-fraud scheme at failed
lender Taylor, Bean  Whitaker Mortgage Corp. From 2002 through
August 2009, Lee Farkas, while he was chairman of Taylor Bean,
sold more than $1.5 billion in fake mortgage loans to Colonial
Bank with the collusion of its employees and diverted more than
$1.5 billion from Ocala Funding, a financing vehicle Taylor Bean
controlled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farkas is serving a 30-year sentence, following conviction
for 14 counts of conspiracy and bank, wire and securities fraud
relating to the scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bank of America v. FDIC, 10-cv-01681, U.S.
District Court, District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Has &#8216;Last Mover Advantage&#8217; on Dark Pools, Adler Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a single market without much fragmentation, stamp
duty and regulations around dark pools, which keep their market
share low, have helped to keep issues associated with high
frequency trading out of Hong Kong, Ashley Alder, CEO of H.K.
Securities and Futures Commission, said at a conference in the
city Aug. 26. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dark pool consultation &#8220;hopefully&#8221; will be out this year,
Alder said in his remarks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dark pool rules will create a market-wide code to replace
current license conditions, according to Alder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong SFC is in discussions with exchanges on
issues including circuit breakers, Alder said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merchants will be better off with a
multibillion-dollar price-fixing settlement with Visa Inc. (V) and
MasterCard Inc. (MA) over swipe fees than they would be if they went
to trial, a court appointed expert said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan O. Sykes, a New York University law professor, found
that U.S. merchants face &#8220;a substantial probability of
failure&#8221; if they proceed with the case, according to a
memorandum filed yesterday in Brooklyn, New York federal court.
Sykes, who was asked by U.S. District Judge John Gleeson to
weigh in on the pact, also found some concerns with legal
releases and the possible impact of certain rule changes
promised in the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The expected returns to continued litigation are highly
uncertain,&#8221; Sykes said in the memorandum. &#8220;Plaintiffs face a
substantial probability of securing little or no relief at the
conclusion of trial.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Announced last July, the settlement was estimated at one
time to be worth as much as $7.25 billion and was described by
lawyers for the plaintiffs as the largest-ever U.S. antitrust
accord. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dozens of major retailers, including the world&#8217;s biggest,
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., (WMT) opposed the deal, claiming merchants
should receive more money. They contend promised rule changes
wouldn&#8217;t be helpful and that the card companies would have too
much freedom to raise fee rates in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The size of the settlement will be reduced based on the
number of retailers that decided to opt out, according to court
documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hearing on final approval of the accord is scheduled for
Sept. 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant
Discount Antitrust Litigation, 05-md-01720, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banco do Brasil SA, Latin America&#8217;s
biggest lender by assets, rose after JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
recommended buying the stock, saying investors are
overestimating the state-controlled bank&#8217;s risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares gained 3.4 percent to 22.84 reais at 1:19 p.m.
in Sao Paulo, the biggest advance on a closing basis since Aug.
22. The rally was the biggest on the MSCI Brazil/Financials
index, which added 1.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan initiated coverage of Banco do Brasil with an
overweight recommendation, saying today in a research note that
concern over the government&#8217;s demand that the Brasilia-based
lender increase financing to spur economic growth is
exaggerated. JPMorgan set a 2014 target price of 28 reais. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see the risk to reward profile as asymmetrically
positive at current very depressed valuation,&#8221; Saul Martinez,
Domingos Falavina and Christopher Delgado, analysts at JPMorgan,
wrote in the research note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banco do Brasil&#8217;s shares trade at 6.1 times Banco do
Brasil&#8217;s estimated earnings for 2014, the lowest ratio among
Latin American banks that JPMorgan covers, the firm said in the
research note. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) pulled out of
Nigeria&#8217;s Olokola liquefied natural gas plant venture, becoming
at least the second partner to withdraw from the project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to divest the 23 percent holding is based on
&#8220;a review of our investment decision, the lack of progress on
the project, and a reprioritization of resources to focus on
growing domestic gas supply,&#8221; Andrew Fawthrop, chief executive
officer of the U.S. oil company&#8217;s Nigeria unit, said today in an
e-mailed statement from Lagos, the commercial capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tumini Green, a spokeswoman in the capital Abuja for state-owned partner Nigeria National Petroleum Corp., didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to two phone calls seeking comments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year BG Group Plc (BG/) withdrew from the OK LNG project,
formed by NNPC in 2007. The remaining partner, Royal Dutch Shell
Plc (RDSA), pulled out in July, according to the Chevron statement.
Shell&#8217;s spokesman in Lagos, Precious Okolobo, declined to
comment when reached today by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NNPC has been informed of Chevron&#8217;s decision, and the
divestment process is being managed in line with the terms of
the shareholder agreement, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, Nigeria&#8217;s third-biggest energy producer, said it
remains committed to Nigeria and continues to pursue other
investments in the West African nation&#8217;s oil and gas industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eurocash SA, Poland&#8217;s largest
distributor of non-durable consumer goods, headed for the
biggest gain in a month after JPMorgan Chase  Co. raised its
recommendation for the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares climbed as much as 4.3 percent and traded 3.2
percent higher to 48.51 zloty as of 12:20 p.m. in Warsaw,
heading for the biggest advance on a closing basis since July
29, as JPMorgan increased its rating to overweight from neutral
and set its price estimate at 54 zloty per share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eurocash, which is merging with Tradis distributor bought
for 1.1 billion zloty ($341 million) in 2011, saw its share
price slump 40 percent since May 31 through yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company offers an &#8220;11 percent potential upside despite
some ongoing challenges in the Tradis segment that are likely to
linger for the next few quarters,&#8221; Michal Kuzawinski, a Warsaw-based analyst at JPMorgan said in a note today. &#8220;Better
macroeconomic outlook&#8221; for the second half of this year
&#8220;should help offset Tradis integration issues&#8221; with prospects
improving into 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan expects the Polish economic growth to quicken to
2.5 percent next year from 1.2 percent seen in 2013, according

&lt;p&gt;Capital One Financial Corp. (COF), the
lender that gets more than half its revenue from credit cards,
hired two bankers with experience advising firms in the oil and
gas industries as it expands its securities business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Barclays Plc (BARC) banker Russ Johnson, 42, and Bob
Mertensotto, 54, who worked for JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), will fill
newly created positions, according to a statement yesterday from
the McLean, Virginia-based company. Johnson, who co-led oil and
gas leveraged finance at Barclays, will be head of energy
investment banking, while Mertensotto will lead energy debt-capital markets, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson and Mertensotto will be in charge of Capital One&#8217;s
energy-banking office in Houston and report to Jim McBride, head
of the energy-banking group within capital markets, the company
said. Mertensotto began at the bank today, while Johnson joined
last week, Michael Bulger, a Capital One spokesman, said in an
e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hires are the second and third this month announced by
Capital One in its securities group as it looks to increase
revenue outside of consumer credit-card lending in the U.S. On
Aug. 14, the firm announced the hiring of former Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. banker Steven Tulip to head the capital-markets
business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two-thirds of aluminum producers
would be losing money because of lower premiums paid on top of
exchange benchmarks if the world&#8217;s biggest metals bourse
approves rules to cut waiting times at its warehouses, according
to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Premiums to obtain the metal will drop 60 percent to about
$100 a metric ton as a result of the new rules the London Metal
Exchange is expected to approve in October, Benjamin Defay, an
analyst at the bank in London, wrote in a report e-mailed today.
The LME proposed to oblige warehouses where waits extend for 100
days or more to let more metal out than they take in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premium that some U.S. buyers paid to get metal rose to
a record this year even as global output outpaced demand and
stockpiles approached 5.5 million tons, enough to supply North
America for 10 months. Consumers led by MillerCoors LLC told a
U.S. Senate hearing last month that some warehouse owners are
using &#8220;unfair&#8221; LME rules to slow deliveries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We estimate about 75 percent of the industry would be
loss making if premia were to fall to $100 a ton versus $250
today,&#8221; Defay wrote. &#8220;It is plausible that prices fall even
further for a period as the market rebalances.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An even bigger drop in premiums would make more than 90
percent of the industry unprofitable, which JPMorgan &#8220;would not
completely discount,&#8221; according to the report. About 60 percent
of the aluminum industry is losing money even with higher
premiums, according to JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;LME Proposal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LME, which monitors more than 700 warehouses, will
introduce the new rules from April 1 if they are approved by the
board in October. U.S. premiums have dropped to the lowest since
December, Laredo, Texas-based researcher Harbor Intelligence
says. Metal premiums are added to exchange benchmarks and cover
a purchase of specific quality of metal in a particular
location, reflecting supply and demand on the physical market,
according to Macquarie Group Ltd. in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incentives offered by warehouses to attract metal plunged
87 percent since July, when the LME proposed new rules to speed
up deliveries, according to Harbor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect this to begin putting pressure on physical
premia as consumers renegotiate terms with producers in coming
months,&#8221; Defay wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aluminum for delivery in three months fell 1.4 percent to
$1,808.50 a ton by 3:02 p.m. on the LME. The metal used in cars
and beverage has declined 13 percent this year, the biggest drop
of the six main metals on the bourse after nickel. Prices
retreated from a record $3,380.15 a ton in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower premiums will probably lead to &#8220;much needed supply
discipline,&#8221; according to the report. Production cuts will pave
the way for higher aluminum prices, Defay wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa SAB (KOFL), the largest
bottler of the soft drink in Latin America, agreed to buy
Brazil&#8217;s Spaipa SA Industria Brasileira de Bebidas in a cash
deal with a total transaction value of $1.86 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal, Coca-Cola Femsa&#8217;s second acquisition in Brazil in
three months, will bolster its volume in South America&#8217;s largest
nation by 40 percent, the Mexico City-based bottler said in a
statement today. When the purchase closes, pending approval by
the Brazilian antitrust authority, the Mexican bottler said it
would account for 39 percent of the Coca-Cola system&#8217;s volume in
Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Spaipa deal is Coca-Cola Femsa&#8217;s largest since its 2002
acquisition of Miami-based Panamerican Beverages Inc., or
Panamco, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and it comes
on the heels of a $4 billion shopping spree in Mexico, Brazil
and the Philippines since June 2011. The Spaipa footprint
provides a &#8220;perfect geographic fit,&#8221; Femsa said in the
statement, linking Coca-Cola Femsa&#8217;s distribution territories in
the states of Sao Paulo and Mato Grosso do Sul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Since the acquisition of Panamco 10 years ago our team
continues strengthening our leading position in the system in
Brazil, while consistently increasing the profitability of this
territory,&#8221; Coca-Cola Femsa Chairman Jose Antonio Fernandez Carbajal said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aug. 29 (Bloomberg) -- A probe of JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s
hiring practices in China has uncovered red flags across Asia,
including an internal spreadsheet that linked appointments to
specific deals pursued by the bank, people with knowledge of the

&lt;p&gt;Aug. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Hissss! That&#8217;s the sound of the air

Ponnuru &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aug. 27 (Bloomberg) -- President Barack Obama is making the
most important economic-policy decision of his second term:
picking a new chairman for the Federal Reserve. We shouldn&#8217;t be

that has been just short of disastrous. &lt;/p&gt;

up in the vetting process (a paid toast at Bashar al-Assad&#8217;s
birthday party, for example) or the administration comes to
believe Senate Democrats will revolt against a Summers
nomination, he&#8217;s going to get the job. &lt;/p&gt;
