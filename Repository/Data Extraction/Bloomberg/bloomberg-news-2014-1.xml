&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommends
selling the South Korean won and the most-accurate forecaster
Scotiabank sees possible interest-rate cuts, as exporter
earnings are wrecked by currency appreciation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman yesterday predicted a 3.1 percent drop in the won
against the dollar, after a 9.8 percent gain in the past two
years against the greenback and a 50 percent rally versus the
Japanese yen. Seven large exporters based their 2014 forecasts
on an average exchange rate of 10 won per yen, 12 percent
stronger than last year&#8217;s 11.23, according to a December survey
by Korea Trade Insurance Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung Electronics Co. reported today fourth-quarter
profit missed analysts&#8217; estimates, after Hyundai Motor Co. last
week predicted the slowest sales growth in eight years. Bank of
Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo may lower the benchmark rate by a
quarter-percentage point as early as Jan. 9 to mitigate the
won&#8217;s gains and spur growth, Goldman forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Exporters are starting to feel the pinch from the
exchange rates,&#8221; Kwon Goohoon, Goldman&#8217;s Seoul-based economist,
said by phone yesterday. &#8220;There seems to be no other immediate
policy options than a rate cut to support growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Korean exports will see a &#8220;significant&#8221; impact should the
yen fall further, while currency volatility poses the biggest
risk to Asia&#8217;s fourth-largest economy, according to minutes of
last month&#8217;s central bank board meeting released on Dec. 31.
Finance Minister Hyun Oh Seok said on Jan. 3 that the
authorities are closely monitoring the yen&#8217;s volatility and
President Park Geun Hye said the Japanese currency&#8217;s weakness
was a burden eroding South Korean companies&#8217; competitiveness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Samsung Earnings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seoul&#8217;s main bourse got off to the worst start since 2007
after Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors Corp. on Jan. 2 predicted a
4.1 percent increase in 2014&#8217;s combined deliveries, the slowest
since 2006, and as analysts cut estimates for profit at Samsung
Electronics. The Kospi index fell 2.6 percent since Dec. 30 as
foreign investors sold more shares than they bought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The won touched 9.96 versus the yen on Jan. 1, the highest
since September 2008, and fell 0.3 percent to 1,068.46 per
dollar at 10:16 a.m. in Seoul, having reached a five-year high
of 1,048 last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares in Samsung Electronics, which got 85 percent of
sales from outside its home market in 2012, slid 4.8 percent
this year. Operating profit was 8.3 trillion won ($7.8 billion)
in the final quarter, the Suwon, South Korea-based company said
in a statement today. That compares with the 10 trillion-won
average of 32 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Currency Fluctuations &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Samsung Electronics is paying close attention to global
foreign-exchange trends and strives to protect its interests
against currency fluctuations,&#8221; the company said in a Jan. 3 e-mailed statement in response to questions. It couldn&#8217;t confirm a
Nov. 29 report by the Korea Economic Daily that the company has
based 2014 plan on a rate of 1,050 won per dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign investors bought a net 3.1 trillion won of Kospi
stocks last year, while dumping Indonesian and Thai shares,
exchange data show, as South Korea is positioned to benefit from
a recovery in the U.S. and Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overseas shipments, which account for about half of Korea&#8217;s
economy, will increase 6.4 percent in 2014, after an estimated
2.2 percent gain last year, the trade ministry said on Jan. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stronger won brings down import costs, helping companies
counter falling overseas income. Steel giant Posco is seeking a
natural hedge by paying for imports of raw materials in foreign
currency earned abroad, spokesman Jeong Yong Min said in a Jan.
3 e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Crying Foul&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smaller exporters with fewer hedging tools are &#8220;crying
foul over what they see as an unfair advantage Japanese rivals
are gaining from the retreating yen,&#8221; Oh Joo Hyun, Korea
Trade&#8217;s head of foreign exchange risk management, said Jan. 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Japan, Toyota Motor Corp. will post a record operating
profit of 2.4 trillion yen for the year ending March 31,
according to a Dec. 30 report from the Sankei Newspaper. The
Bank of Japan, which has embarked on an unprecedented stimulus
and debased its currency, has scope to expand purchases even
more, according to 71 percent of economists polled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rising Risk &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Korean policy makers may now become more vocal as risks
rise in respect to an erosion of Korea&#8217;s external position,&#8221;
Sacha Tihanyi, a Hong Kong-based strategist at Scotiabank, said
yesterday. &#8220;Risks are rising and I&#8217;d be looking for the won to
weaken off for a bit, particularly given the weaker levels of
the yen. There is also the rising risk that the Bank of Korea
eases policy as a counterweight to won strength.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The won will decline to 1,070 versus the dollar by the end
of March, Tihanyi forecasts. That&#8217;s weaker than the median
estimate of 1,064 in a Bloomberg survey of 37 strategists. He
predicted the won will strengthen to 9.54 against the yen at the
end of 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman recommended selling the won with a target of 1,100
per dollar, without specifying a timeframe. The yield on five-year sovereign debt fell five basis points this week to 3.26
percent, amid speculation the Bank of Korea will trim the key
rate from 2.5 percent. The yield added 26 basis points in 2013.
All 15 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News expect no change
this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer inflation has stayed below the BOK&#8217;s target range
of between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent since May 2012. South
Korea&#8217;s current-account surplus will narrow to $38 billion this
year after reaching $63 billion last year, while the economy
will expand 3.8 percent from an estimated growth of 2.8 percent
in 2013, according to central bank projections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Korea is a victim of its own success as the economy is in
better shape than most Asian neighbors,&#8221; Suresh Kumar Ramanathan, regional currency strategist in Kuala Lumpur at CIMB
Investment Bank Bhd., said in a Jan. 3 interview. &#8220;The won&#8217;s
strength has become a problem for exporters like Samsung. It can
be quite dangerous and policy makers can&#8217;t intervene or engage
in a race to the bottom without causing a reaction elsewhere in
the region.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), vying with Sony
Corp. (6758) for the lead in a new generation of game consoles, said
consumers purchased more than 3 million Xbox One players in
2013, following the Nov. 22 debut of the device in 13 countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, announced the
tally today on its Xbox news website. The company is trying to
keep pace with Sony&#8217;s PlayStation 4, which went on sale a week
earlier in North America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies were neck and neck in early December, with
each selling more than 2 million units in their first 18 days.
The $499 Xbox One and the $399 PlayStation 4 have more powerful
graphics and entertainment functions than older models. To
distinguish its machine, Microsoft has touted its motion-sensing
camera, the ability to control live TV and exclusive games like
&#8220;Ryse: Son of Rome&#8221; and &#8220;Dead Rising 3.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sony&#8217;s PS4 clearly bounced back from our mixed early-2013
supply chain checks, and appears to have a slight momentum edge
among core gamers,&#8221; Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W.
Baird  Co., said today in a note. &#8220;However, we view the
console battle as too close to call, with both platforms selling
well over the holidays.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan Race, a spokesman for Sony, didn&#8217;t immediately respond
to an e-mail requesting comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft fell 2.1 percent to $36.13 at the close in New
York. The stock gained 40 percent last year. Sony American
depositary receipts advanced 0.7 percent to $17.30 after rising
54 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heartland, the bar in Tokyo&#8217;s
Roppongi Hills complex where bankers from Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. partied before the 2008
financial crisis, has shut its doors after more than a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bar, downstairs from the Japan headquarters of Goldman
Sachs and Barclays Plc (BARC) as well as the former Japan head office
of Lehman, is closed as of today, Kan Yamamoto, a spokesman for
Kirin Holdings Co. (2503), said by phone. The Tokyo-based brewer opened
the bar in 2003 to promote its Heartland-brand beer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The brand has gained enough support from our customers
now,&#8221; with sales growing at more than 10 percent annually in
recent years, Yamamoto said. There are no plans to move or
reopen the bar in the immediate future, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once an exuberant party venue where the champagne started
flowing at 5 p.m., Heartland suffered a 30 percent drop in
revenue after Lehman went bankrupt and Goldman Sachs cut back
staff in Japan, leaving it with fewer customers. The bar in
recent years saw an influx of new patrons from Google Inc. (GOOG) and
Apple Inc. (AAPL), both of which moved their Japan headquarters to
Roppongi Hills as financial firms vacated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heartland and Goldman Sachs were both original tenants in
Mori Building Co.&#8217;s Roppongi Hills development, a complex
including offices, shops, restaurants, apartments, a hotel, an
art museum and a movie theater. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the financial crisis, bankers from upstairs would
order as many as 100 champagne glasses for parties and offer
them to bar staff and strangers, Mai Shioya, a manager at
Heartland, said in April last year. After the crisis, customers
drank less even with new tenants such as the tech companies
moving into the complex, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2009, after overseas financial companies cut about
16 percent of their Japan workforce in 15 months, or 4,300 jobs,
Heartland hosted a &#8220;pink-slip party&#8221; to help unemployed
bankers network and find new jobs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets, named Dan Dees co-head of the
global technology, media and telecom group and shuffled managers
in its Asia-Pacific operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George Lee, current head of the TMT group, will become the
unit&#8217;s chairman, as well as chief information officer for the
investment banking division, the New York-based firm said
yesterday in memos to the staff. David Wells, a spokesman for
the company, confirmed the authenticity of the memos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dees will move from Hong Kong to San Francisco and become
co-head of TMT alongside Anthony Noto. A former Internet analyst
and chief financial officer of the National Football League,
Noto works out of New York. He helped Goldman Sachs win the lead
underwriting spot on last year&#8217;s initial public offering of
Twitter Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dees and Noto will run a group that ranked first in
advising technology, media and telecom companies on mergers and
acquisitions. Those industries accounted for more than a quarter
of deal volume last year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The TMT sectors continue to evolve rapidly on a global
basis and present significant strategic opportunities for our
clients and for the firm,&#8221; Richard J. Gnodde, David Solomon and
John S. Weinberg, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s co-heads of investment
banking, said in a memo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), which agreed to
pay $2.6 billion to resolve criminal and civil allegations it
facilitated Bernard Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme, &#8220;failed miserably&#8221;
as a financial institution, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;One reason, among others, that Madoff was able to get
away with his crime for so long was that JPMorgan had an
inadequate and inefficient anti-money-laundering program,&#8221;
Bharara said at a press conference today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest bank in the U.S. by assets, avoided
prosecution by entering into an accord with Bharara&#8217;s office
that acknowledged oversight lapses related to an account Madoff
used to fund his fraud. The bank said it will pay $1.7 billion
to settle the U.S. allegations, $350 million in a related case
by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, plus
$543 million to cover separate private claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The bank connected the dots when it came to its own
profits, but not when it came to its own legal obligations,&#8221;
Bharara said, adding that the bank was aware of Madoff&#8217;s
questionable transactions as early as 1994. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank didn&#8217;t file any suspicious activity
reports required under federal banking rules, Bharara said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Timeline Chart &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Bank Secrecy Act is a law that requires financial
institutions to establish and maintain effective anti-money
laundering compliance programs and to know their customer,&#8221;
Bharara said. &#8220;It is not a tip. It is not a suggestion. It is a
legal requirement enforceable through criminal sanction. Today&#8217;s
charges have been filed because in this regard, JPMorgan as an
institution failed and failed miserably.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the press conference, Bharara displayed a timeline chart
with comments by JPMorgan employees who suspected Madoff&#8217;s
fraud, which ended when he was arrested in December 2008 and
cost investors about $17 billion. Madoff is serving a 150-year
federal prison sentence in North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan fund manager wrote in December 1998 that
Madoff&#8217;s returns are &#8220;possibly too good to be true&#8221; and that
there were &#8220;too many red flags&#8221; for the bank to do business
with Madoff, according to the timeline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2007, a senior JPMorgan chief risk officer said
&#8220;there is a well-known cloud over the head of Madoff and that
his returns are speculated to be part of a Ponzi scheme,&#8221;
according to the exhibit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Regulatory Probes &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. agreement includes the largest ever bank
forfeiture and also the largest ever Department of Justice
penalty, Bharara said. JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer
Jamie Dimon, agreed in 2013 to pay $15.7 billion to resolve
other U.S. regulatory probes into practices including mortgage-bond sales and energy trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We recognize we could have done a better job pulling
together various pieces of information and concerns about Madoff
from different parts of the bank over time,&#8221; Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for JPMorgan, said in an e-mailed
statement. &#8220;We do not believe that any JPMorgan Chase employee
knowingly assisted Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From late 1986 to the Madoff firm&#8217;s collapse, the Ponzi
scheme &#8220;was conducted almost exclusively through a demand
deposit account and other linked cash and brokerage accounts
held at JPMorgan,&#8221; prosecutors said in a criminal information
in Manhattan federal court. &#8220;Virtually all client investments
were deposited into the primary Madoff Securities account at
JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. and virtually all client &#8216;redemptions&#8217;
were paid from a linked disbursement account.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Vantage Point&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPMorgan, because of its vantage point as Madoff&#8217;s
banker, had plenty of reasons to be uniquely suspicious about
him. Warning signs abounded,&#8221; Bharara said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The volume, movement and use of funds should have generated
suspicions among JPMorgan employees, Bharara said. From 1986 to
2008 &#8220;an astounding $150 billion&#8221; went in and out of Madoff&#8217;s
JPMorgan account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2006, a derivatives trading desk in JPMorgan&#8217;s London
office offered products linked to Madoff&#8217;s performance and
invested its own money in Madoff&#8217;s feeder funds, Bharara said.
By October 2008, the bank was so concerned about Madoff&#8217;s
returns that it redeemed $275 million it had in the funds, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mid-1990s, the bank learned Madoff and a client of
JPMorgan&#8217;s Private Bank were engaged in questionable banking
processes known as &#8220;round-trip transactions&#8221; that amounted to
what Bharara said was a &#8220;check-kiting scheme.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closed Account &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These transactions were so questionable that another U.S.
bank involved in the transactions filed a suspicious activity
report and closed Madoff&#8217;s account, Bharara said. JPMorgan
allowed the transactions to continue for close to a decade, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It took until after the arrest of Madoff, one of the
worst crooks this office has ever seen, for JPMorgan to alert
authorities to what the world already knew,&#8221; George Venizelos,
the FBI assistant director in charge, said in a statement today.
&#8220;We all need to be invested in making our markets safer and
more equitable. The FBI can&#8217;t do it alone. Traders, compliance
officers, analysts, bankers, and executives are the gatekeepers
of the financial industry. We need their help protecting our
markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bharara said today his office plans for &#8220;every penny&#8221; of
the $1.7 billion to go to &#8220;help make Bernie Madoff&#8217;s victims
closer to whole.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wall Street&#8217;s biggest banks say the slump in emerging-market assets that left equities trailing advanced-nation shares by the most since 1998 last year will prove more than a fleeting selloff. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommends investors cut allocations in developing nations by a third, forecasting &#8220;significant underperformance&#8221; for stocks, bonds and currencies over the next 10 years. JPMorgan Chase  Co. expects local-currency bonds to post 10 percent of their average returns since 2004 in the coming year, while Morgan Stanley projects the Brazilian real, Turkish lira and Russian ruble will extend declines after tumbling as much as 17 percent in 2013. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China symbolized the increasing power of the developing world during the worst of the global financial crisis and delivered outsized returns, Morgan Stanley says some of the same nations may now prove to be laggards as the U.S. Federal Reserve scales back unprecedented stimulus and interest rates rise. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index is down 3.1 percent this year, compared with a 0.8 percent drop in the developed-market index, and hit a four-month low yesterday as data from China showed weakness in manufacturing and services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. boosted legal
reserves following accords tied to the collapse of Bernard
Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme and said the cost of settlements reduced
fourth-quarter net income by about $850 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank added about $400 million to litigation reserves in
the 2013 fourth quarter on a pretax basis, the New York-based
company said today in a regulatory filing. JPMorgan is the
largest U.S. bank by assets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should sell Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) because a bear market in bonds
will hurt trading revenue, analysts at Societe Generale SA (GLE) wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy UBS AG (UBSN), while Morgan Stanley (MS) and
Credit Suisse Group AG were given hold ratings, analysts
including Andrew Lim wrote in a note today that began coverage
of the five firms. Fixed-income trading revenue will drop by
&#8220;low-single-digit&#8221; percentages, while equity trading climbs by
the same amount, the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve&#8217;s decision to taper its monthly bond
purchases probably will lead to lower prices for similar assets,
the analysts wrote. Revenue from fixed-income, currencies and
commodity trading, or FICC, probably fell to $73 billion at the
10 largest global investment banks in 2013, about half the level
of 2009, according to industry analytics firm Coalition Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect FICC weakness to be an ongoing structural theme
-- not a temporary issue -- in a rising U.S. long interest-rate
environment,&#8221; the analysts wrote. More money will move into
equities &#8220;as investors veer away from the bond bear market,&#8221;
they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulatory limits on leverage will force Goldman Sachs to
curtail its capital return policy and Credit Suisse (CSGN) to take more
actions to boost its ratios, the analysts wrote. Goldman Sachs
and Morgan Stanley, both based in New York, probably will show
they hold more risk-weighted assets after regulators review
their trading books, pushing down their capital ratios,
according to the note. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exponent Private Equity LLP, a

consider ways to refinance the borrowings of a tool rental firm
it owns, said two people with knowledge of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinancing, planned to be about 300 million pounds

&lt;p&gt;Exponent, which bought London-based HSS in October 2012 for

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) agreed to pay
$1.7 billion to settle U.S. claims that it facilitated Bernard Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme, the largest in U.S. history, resolving
yet another legal obstacle facing the embattled bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest bank in the U.S. by assets, entered
into a deferred-prosecution agreement with Manhattan U.S.
Attorney Preet Bharara, acknowledging oversight lapses related
to an account Madoff used to fund his multibillion-dollar fraud.
Separately, the bank agreed to pay $543 million to resolve
private claims over losses tied to the scheme, according to a
person with direct knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. agreement includes the &#8220;largest ever bank
forfeiture and also the largest ever Department of Justice
penalty,&#8221; Bharara said today in a statement. JPMorgan, led by
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, agreed in 2013 to pay
$15.7 billion to resolve other U.S. regulatory probes into
practices including mortgage-bond sales and energy trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank still faces criminal inquiries into its energy
trading practices, which were subject to a $410 million civil
settlement with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in
July. Along with other banks, the firm also faces a probe into
the possible manipulation of interest rates and currency
benchmarks in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG recruited Yusof Annuar Yaacob, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s Malaysia chairman for
corporate finance, as its country head, according to four people
with knowledge of the appointment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yusof Annuar, 48, will start work as the German bank&#8217;s
chief country officer and head of Malaysian corporate banking
and securities from the end of February, said one the people,
who asked not to be named because the information is private.
His appointment was approved by the nation&#8217;s central bank last
week, one of them said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank is building its presence in Southeast Asia as
economic growth in the region outperforms developed nations. The
firm handled 208 million ringgit of equity-linked deals in
Malaysia last year, ranking it sixth among foreign lenders,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The amount is about a
quarter of second-placed Goldman Sachs&#8217;s share, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yusof Annuar, a former chief financial officer at Malaysian
mobile-phone company Axiata Group Bhd., joined Goldman in
November 2010. The New York-based bank helped manage some of the
country&#8217;s biggest initial share sales last year, including
offerings by Westports Holdings Bhd. and UMW Oil  Gas Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman also made about $500 million arranging three bond
sales for state-owned 1Malaysia Development Bhd., a person
familiar with the matter said in May 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candice Sun, a Deutsche Bank spokeswomen in Hong Kong,
declined to comment by e-mail. Reuters first reported on the
appointment yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yusof Annuar is the latest in several recent key
appointments by Deutsche in Southeast Asia over the past year.
It also tapped Tan Boon-Kee, another former Goldman employee, as
head of client coverage in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phumchai Kambhato, a former country head of investment
banking at UBS, joined as head of Thai corporate banking and
finance. Philip Lee, a former head of Southeast Asia investment
banking at JPMorgan Chase  Co., is now the German bank&#8217;s vice
chairman for Southeast Asia and Singapore head. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. prosecution of JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) was deferred by a federal judge after the bank
agreed to pay $2.6 billion to resolve criminal and civil
allegations it failed to stop Bernard Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Cutler, JPMorgan&#8217;s general counsel, pleaded not
guilty today on behalf of the bank to two violations of the Bank
Secrecy Act in connection with Madoff at an arraignment before
U.S. District Judge P. Kevin Castel. The judge deferred
prosecution of the case until January 2016, when the case will
be dismissed if the bank complies with the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The required judicial intervention to protect the
integrity of the process is not necessary,&#8221; Castel ruled. He
set the next hearing for Jan. 15, 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest bank in the U.S. by assets, avoided
prosecution by entering into an accord with the office of
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara that acknowledged
oversight lapses related to a JPMorgan account Madoff used to
fund his fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank said it will pay $1.7 billion to settle the U.S.
allegations and $350 million in a related case by the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency, plus $543 million to cover
separate private claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Reports &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bharara said yesterday that the criminal charges will be
dismissed after two years if JPMorgan complies with the
agreement and implements reforms of its anti-money laundering
compliance program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While JPMorgan had been Madoff&#8217;s bank for decades and
discovered questionable transactions as early as 1994, the New
York-based bank didn&#8217;t file any suspicious activity reports
required under federal banking rules, Bharara said. JPMorgan
acknowledged in the accord that it ignored red flags for about
15 years that Madoff used his account to run a fraud, Bharara
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. agreement includes the largest ever bank
forfeiture and also the largest ever Department of Justice
penalty, Bharara said. JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer
Jamie Dimon, agreed in 2013 to pay $15.7 billion to resolve
other U.S. regulatory probes into practices including mortgage-bond sales and energy trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accord brings its legal settlements from the past two
years to more than $29 billion and further eroding its once-record earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The civil case is U.S. v. JPMorgan 14-CV-0063, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) traders
Javier Martin-Artajo and Julien Grout aren&#8217;t evading authorities
in the U.S., where they face charges of engaging in securities
fraud to hide losses, their lawyers told a judge in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The men, who are accused of hiding losses that eventually
surpassed $6.2 billion on wrong-way derivatives bets, haven&#8217;t
appeared to answer the charges because they live outside the
U.S., the lawyers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attorneys objected to a statement by Joseph
Boryshansky, a lawyer for the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, who told U.S. District Judge George Daniels at a
hearing today that Martin-Artajo and Grout were &#8220;fugitives&#8221;
from the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Martin-Artajo is not a fugitive. He&#8217;s a Spanish
citizen who did not flee,&#8221; his lawyer, William Leone, told
Daniels. &#8220;For Mr. Boryshansky to get up and assert Mr. Martin-Artajo is a fugitive from justice is completely out of line.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc Weinstein, a lawyer for Grout, also said his client
hadn&#8217;t fled the U.K. to evade extradition to the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He was fired, so he could not attempt to live and be
unemployed in England,&#8221; Weinstein said. &#8220;He, his wife and two
small children moved back to France. He is a citizen of
France.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Parallel Suit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo, who now lives in Spain, oversaw trading
strategy for the synthetic portfolio at the bank&#8217;s chief
investment office in London. Grout was a trader who worked for
him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both men were named in an indictment filed by prosecutors
in the office of Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in
September. The SEC alleged in a parallel suit that the two men
engaged in a scheme to enhance the portfolio&#8217;s apparent
performance and thereby curry favor with their supervisors.
Daniels is presiding over the SEC case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boryshansky said federal prosecutors probably would seek to
delay proceedings in the parallel SEC suit so the criminal case
can proceed first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Queliz, a spokeswoman for Bharara&#8217;s office, and
Peter Donald, a spokesman for the New York office of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, declined to comment about the status of
pending extradition proceedings for both men. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a conference in Manhattan in October, Lorin Reisner,
head of the criminal division of Bharara&#8217;s office, said that
federal authorities expect that Martin-Artajo would eventually
be extradited to the U.S. He called Grout&#8217;s case a &#8220;more
complicated&#8221; matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniels said today he would wait for a formal request from
prosecutors for a delay in the SEC case. He scheduled the next
hearing for May 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are SEC v. Martin-Artajo, 13-cv-5677, and U.S. v.
Martin-Artajo, 13-cr-00707, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yelp Inc. (YELP), the service for online
restaurant and local business reviews, climbed to a record after
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) boosted its 12-month target share price for
the company by 19 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares rose 7.9 percent to $78.42 at 4 p.m. in New
York. Yelp&#8217;s market capitalization has surged more than fivefold
since the San Francisco-based company&#8217;s initial public offering
in March 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yelp is succeeding at getting advertisers to buy their
promotions in most U.S. cities across many different industries,
Kaizad Gotla, an analyst at JPMorgan, wrote today in a report.
The growth could lead the stock to $89 in 12 months, compared
with his earlier estimate of $75, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s significant room for strong revenue growth and
margin expansion for Yelp as it remains relatively
underpenetrated in local advertising,&#8221; Gotla wrote. &#8220;The pace
of innovation in new advertising products is accelerating and
the company is making good progress towards closing the loop for
advertisers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan report comes two days after Telsey Advisory
Group raised its stock price prediction on Yelp to $95 from $62
on advertising growth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and UBS AG (UBSN) are
among banks that received federal requests for information about
trades in mortgage-backed securities after the financial crisis,
two people briefed on the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation is in early stages, said the people, who
asked not to be named because the inquiries were confidential.
JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. lender by assets, disclosed the probe
in an August filing, saying it received subpoenas and requests
for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program
and the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s office in Connecticut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest global banks lost billions of dollars on
mortgage-backed debt during the financial crisis as U.S. home
prices plunged and the market for such assets dried up. While
the securities rebounded after the crisis, markets remained
illiquid with wide spreads between bids from buyers and sellers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc (BARC), Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley (MS) and Royal Bank of Scotland Plc
are also under scrutiny in the probe, the Wall Street Journal
reported yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for New York-based JPMorgan and Zurich-based UBS,
as well as the banks named by the Journal, said their firms had
no comment. The SEC&#8217;s John Nester and Troy Gravitt at the
special inspector general for TARP in Washington declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset Management has been
buying South Korean electronics and auto stocks in recent weeks,
saying concern that the won&#8217;s strength will erode exports is
overblown after valuations fell to eight-year lows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have been adding into weakness,&#8221; Grace Tam, a Hong
Kong-based global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset, which
oversees about $1.5 trillion, said by phone yesterday. She
declined to name specific stocks. &#8220;People worry about the
competitiveness of Korean exports. We think this is overdone.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kospi index has dropped 4.9 percent from last year&#8217;s
high on Oct. 30 as the won strengthened 5.9 percent against the
yen. The benchmark index&#8217;s valuation fell to about the same
level as its companies&#8217; net assets last week, a 50 percent
discount versus the MSCI All-Country World Index, the widest gap
since July 2005. Samsung Electronics Co. (005930), the world&#8217;s biggest
maker of handsets and televisions, has slumped 14 percent while
Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) and Kia Motors Corp. (000270), South Korea&#8217;s largest
automakers, fell at least 12 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo may lower the
nation&#8217;s benchmark interest rate by a quarter-percentage point
as early as tomorrow to mitigate the won&#8217;s gains and spur
growth, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Hyundai Motor and
Kia Motors predicted the slowest growth in combined deliveries
since 2006 on Jan. 2, while Samsung Electronics posted its first
profit decline in nine quarters yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Global Outlook &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International investors sold a net $2.2 billion of Kospi
shares since the end of October, snapping a record stretch of
inflows into Asia&#8217;s fourth-largest economy. The Kospi fell less
than 0.1 percent to 1,958.96 at the close today. Samsung
Electronics slipped 1 percent, while Hyundai Motor climbed 0.2
percent. The two stocks comprise more than 20 percent of the
Kospi&#8217;s weighting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging-market stocks trailed developed-nation equities by
the most since 1998 last year, leaving the MSCI Emerging Markets
Index at the biggest valuation discount since 2004. The
developing-nation gauge trades for 1.5 times net assets, or
about 31 percent below the multiple on the MSCI World Index,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improving growth in advanced economies including the U.S.
will give South Korean exporters a boost in coming months, Tam
said. The International Monetary Fund plans to raise its global
growth forecast in coming weeks, Christine Lagarde, the fund&#8217;s
managing director, told reporters in Nairobi yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Korean market is still very cheap,&#8221; Tam said.
&#8220;Recent declines gave us good entry points.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. will pay $2.6
billion to resolve criminal and civil allegations that it failed
to stop Bernard Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme, putting banks on notice
that they may be punished for their clients&#8217; misdeeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan avoided prosecution by acknowledging in an accord
with the U.S. yesterday that it ignored red flags for almost two
decades that Madoff used his account there to run a fraud. The
bank will pay $1.7 billion to settle the government&#8217;s
allegations, $350 million in a related case by the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency, plus $543 million to cover separate
private claims, the firm said in a filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement includes the &#8220;largest ever bank forfeiture
and also the largest ever Department of Justice penalty&#8221; for a
violation of the Bank Secrecy Act, Bharara said today in a
statement. The actions take JPMorgan one step closer to
resolving a slate of probes that have engulfed the bank since
the 2008 financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon,
agreed in 2013 to pay $15.7 billion to resolve other U.S.
regulatory probes and still faces investigations of its hiring
practices in China and the possible manipulation of interest
rates and currency benchmarks in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street firms have spent years fighting claims by
Madoff&#8217;s victims that the companies ignored wrongdoing to
continue reaping fees. Madoff, 75, maintained accounts with
JPMorgan for more than 20 years before confessing to running a
fraud that cost investors about $17 billion. He&#8217;s serving a 150-year federal prison sentence in North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bafin Slams Deutsche Bank for Monte Paschi Accounting, Welt Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG incorrectly accounted for a derivative
transaction with Monte dei Paschi, Welt reported, citing a
letter the German regulator Bafin sent to the bank in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bafin official Frauke Menke wrote in the letter that
Deutsche Bank&#8217;s alleged provision of false information to Bafin
and other authorities is unacceptable, the German newspaper
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Errors were made due to inefficient communication between
departments at the company and were later corrected, Welt
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An inadequate investigation of the matter gives the
impression that Deutsche Bank doesn&#8217;t take its announced
cultural change seriously, Menke said, according to Welt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sven Gebauer, a spokesman for Bafin, declined to comment on
the details of the Welt story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regina Schueller, a spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank, also
declined comment on the Welt report. &#8220;We cooperate with
regulatory authorities and, together with them, seek to
investigate questions thoroughly and promptly,&#8221; she said in an
e-mailed response to questions from Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Former UBS Banker Weil Pleads Not Guilty in Tax-Probe Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raoul Weil, once a top UBS AG banker, pleaded not guilty to
charges that he conspired to use Swiss bank secrecy to help
thousands of Americans cheat on their taxes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weil, 54, appeared yesterday in federal court in Fort
Lauderdale, Florida, where his lawyer entered the plea on his
behalf. Weil, a Swiss citizen, first appeared in the court Dec.
16, five years after he was indicted and declared a fugitive. He
was arrested Oct. 2 after checking into a hotel in Bologna,
Italy, and later extradited to the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We look forward to coming back to Florida and defending
him when we have a trial date,&#8221; Weil&#8217;s attorney, Aaron Marcu,
said outside the courtroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former head of UBS AG&#8217;s global wealth-management
business, Weil is the highest-ranking banker charged in a U.S.
crackdown on offshore tax evasion. If he doesn&#8217;t plead guilty
and cooperate with prosecutors, they must prove that he oversaw
60 private bankers who helped UBS make $200 million a year by
managing $20 billion in assets not declared to the Internal
Revenue Service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weil is free on $10.5 million bail and staying under house
arrest in New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prove their case, prosecutors will rely on
&#8220;substantially&#8221; the same evidence that led UBS, the biggest
Swiss bank, to pay $780 million in February 2009 to avoid
prosecution, Mark Daly, a U.S. Justice Department trial
attorney, said at Weil&#8217;s bail hearing on Dec. 16. The Zurich-based bank admitted it helped defraud the U.S. by setting up
accounts that taxpayers hid from the IRS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At last month&#8217;s hearing, Marcu said his client didn&#8217;t know
about a rogue division of bankers. Swiss regulators concluded
that &#8220;Weil was not involved and was not aware of any wrongdoing
by any of these underlings who were multiple levels below him,&#8221;
said Marcu of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP in New York.
&#8220;The weight of the evidence at the very best, very best, is
equivocal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS must cooperate on &#8220;any matter related to the
government&#8217;s criminal investigation&#8221; of its cross-border
business, according to the deferred-prosecution agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Weil cooperates with prosecutors, they can urge a judge
to give him a shorter sentence. He faces as long as five years
in prison. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;SP Loses German Ruling Over Lehman Ratings, Faces Trial &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard  Poor&#8217;s, a unit of McGraw-Hill Financial that
provides credit ratings services, lost a bid to block a lawsuit
by a German investor over its rating of Lehman Brothers&#8217; debt
before the investment bank collapsed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Frankfurt appeals court ruled that the lawsuit was
properly served and the case can be heard at lower court. The
investor bringing the suit seeks EU30,000 for losses incurred
because of Lehman certificates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany&#8217;s top civil court ruled last year that investors
can sue SP in German courts over ratings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP spokeswoman Daniela Markovic didn&#8217;t immediately reply
to an e-mail seeking comment &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is: OLG Ffm, 21 U 23/11. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;SEC Promotes Lawyer Who Investigated JPMorgan London Whale Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Osnato, who helped lead a U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission case against JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s handling
of a $6.2 billion trading loss, was named head of a unit that
investigates complex financial instruments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Osnato, 41, joined the SEC in 2008 and became assistant
director for the New York office in 2010, the SEC said Jan. 6 in
a statement. He will run a unit that looks into potential
misconduct linked to asset-backed securities, derivatives and
other instruments, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of a $920 million settlement with U.S. and U.K.
regulators, JPMorgan agreed to pay $200 million to resolve SEC
claims that it violated securities laws in handling its 2012
trading loss. The Whale nickname was derived from the size of
the trading positions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the world&#8217;s second-largest energy company by market value, will report a drop in
fourth-quarter profit after oil and natural gas production
declined amid slumping prices for the commodities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income during the period was &#8220;comparable&#8221; to the $5
billion earned during the third quarter, the San Ramon,
California-based company said in a statement yesterday. That
compares with a $7.25 billion profit posted during the final
three months of 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron joins U.S. competitors such as ConocoPhillips (COP) hurt
by slumping oil and gas output as weakening demand growth in the
world&#8217;s largest economies pressures prices. Chevron
underperformed its biggest U.S. rivals -- Exxon Mobil Corp. and
ConocoPhillips -- last year in stock performance and lagged the
industry average by almost half. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron really struggled on production last year but it
looks like they&#8217;re going to turn that around in 2014,&#8221; Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones  Co. in St. Louis who
rates Chevron shares a buy, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron is expected to report per-share profit of $2.87,
excluding some extraordinary items, when full fourth-quarter
results are released on Jan. 31. That&#8217;s the average of 17
analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John S. Watson plans
to spend almost $40 billion on floating platforms, gas-export
terminals and exploratory wells this year as part of a plan to
boost worldwide output 20 percent by the end of 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Declining Output &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron pumped the equivalent of 2.564 million barrels of
crude daily during October and November, according to the
statement. That&#8217;s almost 4 percent lower than the full-quarter
average of 2.668 million from the year-earlier period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the decline in output, the company has no chance of
meeting its full-year output target announced in March of 2.65
million barrels a day, Youngberg said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ConocoPhillips warned investors this week that fourth-quarter production slipped to a nine-year low because of bad
weather in the U.S. and the North Sea that interfered with
operations. The Houston-based company said Jan. 7 that output
dropped to a daily average equivalent to 1.475 million barrels a
day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ConocoPhillips is scheduled to release full quarterly
results on Jan. 30, as is Exxon, the world&#8217;s biggest energy
company by market value. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banking clients at DBS Group Holdings
Ltd. (DBS) will soon get investing assistance from Watson, the same
International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) technology that triumphed
over human &#8220;Jeopardy!&#8221; contestants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Singapore-based bank plans to begin using the tool,
which can answer questions in conversational language and learn
from responses, to aid financial planners in guiding its wealth-management unit&#8217;s affluent customers, IBM said today. Watson
will analyze large volumes of financial data to help DBS,
Southeast Asia&#8217;s largest lender, offer more customized service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement gives IBM a proving ground as it tries to
show clients the value of its Watson technology. The Armonk, New
York-based company announced today it&#8217;s creating a separate
division for Watson to spur growth after six consecutive
quarters of falling revenue. IBM will invest more than $1
billion in the unit, including $100 million in venture funding
for businesses that develop applications based on the
technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based in New York with a staff of 2,000, the new unit will
be separate from IBM&#8217;s hardware, software and services
divisions, said Stephen Gold, vice president of Watson
Solutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s the first time that IBM is bringing together all of
the disparate functions that support a business,&#8221; Gold said in
an interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s a kind of doubling down.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;High-Profile Bet &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As sluggish demand for computer hardware has dragged down
sales, IBM has been selling off businesses to focus on more
profitable, faster-growing areas such as data analytics and
cloud computing. Watson is one of its highest-profile bets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;By putting these parts of the business into one group, I
can do things I couldn&#8217;t do,&#8221;  Michael Rhodin, who will lead
the Watson Group as senior vice president, said in an interview
today in New York. &#8220;I can make decisions much, much faster on
how to redeploy resources over new opportunities and new ideas.
It&#8217;s what the whole structure is all about -- it&#8217;s about
speed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rhodin, previously head of IBM&#8217;s Software Solutions Group,
will continue to report to fellow Senior Vice President Steve Mills, who oversees software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has stumbled amid the industrywide shift into the cloud
era, where information is stored online instead of onsite. The
transition has eroded demand for traditional hardware and
spawned a new crop of competitors. To cope, IBM has spent more
than $7.5 billion since 2010 on 43 software business
acquisitions, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Big Data &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, the company purchased cloud-computing storage
provider SoftLayer Technologies Inc. for about $2 billion. IBM
will adapt Watson&#8217;s technology so it can be delivered through
SoftLayer&#8217;s cloud infrastructure, it said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson and other big-data services, which let customers
mine vast troves of information to make better decisions, were
the company&#8217;s biggest focus in 2013, Chief Executive Officer
Ginni Rometty said in March. IBM boosted its expected sales from
the data-analysis business to $20 billion in 2015, compared with
an earlier forecast of $16 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM shares fell less than 1 percent to $187.38 at the close
in New York. The stock fell 2.1 percent in 2013, the year&#8217;s lone
decliner in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Watson Group will also include an incubator for
businesses to build on the technology, which IBM began offering
to outside developers in November. The goal was to have three
apps developed on the platform ready to enter the market early
this year, the company said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two-Way Street &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has received about 890 requests from programmers to
build applications in Watson&#8217;s so-called developer ecosystem,
Rhodin said today. The company declined to comment on the number
allowed to use the services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has to be selective in choosing clients who can use
Watson because customers must upload large amounts of data
before the system can work, Rhodin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s work on both sides here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;To even get
started, you have to first find all of your data. For a lot of
companies, that is proving to be harder than they thought it was
going to be.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DBS is willing to invest S$15 million ($12 million) over
three years in IBM&#8217;s technology, and it plans to extend the
Watson service beyond wealth management to its small-business
and payment services, CEO Piyush Gupta said today at a briefing
in Singapore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has collaborated on Watson-based projects with health-care organizations, including insurer WellPoint Inc. and
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. The company is also
working with Nielsen Holdings NV and Royal Bank of Canada on
services that use Watson to interact with customers. Those first
projects will show other potential clients Watson&#8217;s promise,
Gold said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The immediate focus is to ensure the success of those
early engagements,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a much more interactive way
to work with clients and partners.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel is considering selling its
first euro-denominated bonds since 2010, following Poland,
Slovakia and Ireland in taking advantage of historically low
yields as the Federal Reserve begins tapering stimulus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government hired Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc. and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to arrange the transaction, according
to a person familiar with the situation, who asked not to be
identified because the information isn&#8217;t public. The sale may
take place in the next few weeks, according to the person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nations are being drawn by low yields before the Fed
further reduces its $85 billion monthly bond-purchase program
after deciding to trim its buying by $10 billion at its most
recent meeting Dec. 18. Israeli two-year yields were 1.25
percent today compared with a 10-year average of 3.44 percent.
Poland sold 2 billion euros ($2.7 billion) of 2024 bonds
yesterday, Ireland issued 3.75 billion euros of 10-year bonds
Jan. 7 and Slovakia is selling 15-year euro securities today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For European-based investors, it has a nice
diversification element,&#8221; Michael J Roche, an emerging-market
strategist at Seaport Group LLC, said in a telephone interview
from New York yesterday. &#8220;It has the faster growth of an
emerging market, offers extra yield and it is an improving
credit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on Israel&#8217;s euro-denominated bonds maturing in
2020 was little changed at 2.06 percent at 5:42 p.m. in Tel
Aviv. The country sold the debt on March 2010 to yield 4.7
percent. The yield on the country&#8217;s euro-denominated bonds due
in 2015 rose for the first time in six days, advancing one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point to 0.91 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Corporate Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel last tapped international bond markets 12 months
ago, when it issued $2 billion of 10- and 30-year paper. The
country is rated A+ by Standard  Poor&#8217;s, the fifth highest
investment grade, and equivalent A1 by Moody&#8217;s Investors
Service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shlomi Bidani, a spokesman for Barclays in Israel, and a
public relations representative for Goldman Sachs who couldn&#8217;t
be identified because of company policy, yesterday declined to
comment when contacted by Bloomberg. Calls made to Citigroup and
an e-mail sent to the Finance Ministry seeking comment weren&#8217;t
returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate issuers have also been selling Eurobonds, defined
as securities sold in a currency other than that of the issuer.
Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4), Brazil&#8217;s state-run oil company, issued
3.1 billion euros of notes Jan. 7 in the company&#8217;s biggest
offering in that currency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. and European oil
companies will pay more for Abu Dhabi crude when the end of a
75-year partnership reduces their direct stakes in the emirate&#8217;s
output, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp., BP Plc, Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) and Total
SA (FP) lose their rights as shareholders in the company operating
Abu Dhabi&#8217;s onshore oil fields after their joint venture expires
this week. The international companies will then start paying a
premium of 11 cents a barrel over Abu Dhabi&#8217;s official selling
price for Murban grade crude, the two people said, declining to
be identified because the contract terms are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As long as their crude price is reasonably competitive
and they&#8217;re feeding their trading arms, it&#8217;s something they can
deal with,&#8221; Robin Mills, head of consulting at Manaar Energy
Consulting and Project Management, said by telephone from Dubai
today. &#8220;The companies will be betting that they can trade the
crude to add more than 11 cents of value.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end of an accord accounting for more than half of the
output from OPEC&#8217;s fourth-largest supplier further weakens, at
least temporarily, the role of international companies in the
group, as member nations seek to retain more oil wealth. Abu
Dhabi holds most of the reserves in the United Arab Emirates,
which pumped 2.76 million barrels a day in December, or 9.2
percent of all oil supplied by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Murban Pricing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expiring partnership between the international
companies and state-run Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., or Adnoc,
accounts for about 1.5 million barrels a day of Murban crude,
the U.A.E.&#8217;s main blend. Murban for December costs $113.85 a
barrel under Abu Dhabi&#8217;s retroactive monthly pricing system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adnoc will take full control of the unit operating the
fields while completing a bidding process to award new
concessions, according to a statement from the producer
yesterday. Until a new concession agreement is reached, Exxon,
Shell, BP and Total will buy Murban crude from Adnoc under six-month contracts that will replace some of the oil they would
have taken as equity partners, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Dhabi has pumped oil from its onshore fields under
concession deals with Exxon, Shell, Total, BP and Portugal&#8217;s
Partex Oil  Gas, or their predecessors, that have been in
effect since January 1939. Adnoc became a partner in the 1970s,
forming Abu Dhabi Co. for Onshore Oil Operations, or ADCO, in
which the five foreign partners held a 40 percent stake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Production Loss &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;BP, Shell, Total and Exxon, each of whom held a 9.5
percent interest, will see an end to some 150,000 barrels a day
of annual production and the loss of about $50 million of annual
fixed income,&#8221; Deutsche Bank AG analyst Lucas Herrmann wrote in
a note today. &#8220;More surprising is that at this stage there has
been no temporary extension and that Adnoc, the state oil
company, has taken full control of the fields.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four companies, which retain some stakes in Abu Dhabi&#8217;s
offshore production, are among 11 from the U.S., Europe and Asia
that submitted bids in October for new production agreements in
the Persian Gulf emirate. Partex, the smallest partner in ADCO
with a 2 percent stake, wasn&#8217;t invited to bid. Adnoc may take
until January 2015 to choose new partners, Abdulla Nasser Al Suwaidi, the company&#8217;s director general, said in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interim Agreements &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adnoc at first considered signing yearlong oil supply
contracts with BP, Exxon, Shell and Total, the people with
knowledge of the matter said. By signing six-month agreements
instead, the state producer will have greater flexibility in the
event concession agreements are reached earlier than next
January, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen at BP, Exxon and Shell declined to comment. Total
media representatives didn&#8217;t immediately comment when contacted
by phone. An Adnoc spokesman declined to provide additional
comment beyond what the company said in the statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Korea National Oil Corp. and Italy&#8217;s Eni SpA (ENI) have said
they&#8217;re bidding for the new concessions. The remaining bidders
are Japan Oil Development Co., China National Petroleum Corp.,
Norway&#8217;s Statoil ASA, Occidental Petroleum Corp. of the U.S. and
Russia&#8217;s OAO Rosneft, according to Energy Intelligence Group. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. companies including Ford Motor
Co. (F) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) are poised to boost business investment
to a record in 2014, using a growing cash hoard to propel
corporate spending past last year&#8217;s $2 trillion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officers are buying new machinery and
investing in real estate as a U.S. budget deal and growth in
Europe signal a rebound in customer demand. That marks a
reversal from four years ago, when companies began restraining
spending from pre-recession levels and made do with the oldest
equipment in 15 years, according to BMO Capital Markets Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The U.S. is on the verge of an early capex recovery, one
that is likely to have some considerable legs,&#8221; said Brian Belski, BMO chief investment strategist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEOs who raised dividends and increased share repurchases
in recent years now must lay the groundwork for future profit
increases, said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC. Investment will rise 6.7 percent,
after a gain of about 2.6 percent in 2013, according to UBS
Securities LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;ve got the cash and they have no choice,&#8221; said
Scott Davis, a Barclays Plc analyst in New York who covers
industrial companies including General Electric Co. and
Honeywell International Inc. (HON) &#8220;They need to grow and they don&#8217;t
want to lose market share.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major broadcasters are heading for a
showdown in their bid to block a Barry Diller-backed company
from upending the industry&#8217;s economics by offering subscribers
live television over the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court will say as soon as tomorrow whether
it will consider the claim by companies including Walt Disney
Co. (DIS)&#8217;s ABC and 21st Century Fox Inc. (FOX) that Aereo Inc.&#8217;s business
is built on copyright violations, obtaining broadcast signals
for free and distributing them for a profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both sides in the dispute are seeking a high court hearing,
increasing the chances the justices will step in. If so, the
case will determine the fate of Aereo, a startup that threatens
the billions of dollars in retransmission fees broadcasters get
from pay-TV systems that provide signals to subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing short of a watershed moment,&#8221; said David Bank, a media analyst with RBC Capital Markets. &#8220;If the Supreme
Court agrees to hear it, we&#8217;re going to finally resolve the
issue.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal appeals court in New York ruled that Aereo, which
provides broadcast signals to subscribers after capturing them
with thousands of small antennas, isn&#8217;t violating broadcasters&#8217;
copyrights. Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)&#8217;s NBCUniversal and CBS Corp. (CBS) are
joining Disney and Fox in urging reversal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decision to take up the case this month would mean a
Supreme Court ruling by early July. The justices could also ask
the Obama administration for input, a step that would delay a
resolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Retransmission Fees &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retransmission fees have become increasingly important for
broadcast networks, supplementing advertising revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadcasters are expected to reap more than $4.29 billion
in fees paid by satellite and cable companies this year, a 30
percent gain from last year, according to research firm SNL
Kagan. That revenue is projected to reach $7.15 billion by 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fox and CBS have said they may abandon their broadcast
signals and become cable networks if Aereo continues unabated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We need to be able to be fairly compensated for our
content,&#8221; 21st Century Fox President and Chief Operating
Officer Chase Carey said at an industry conference last year.
&#8220;We can&#8217;t sit idly by and let an entity steal our signal. We
will move to a subscription model if that&#8217;s our only recourse.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversion to a cable network would mean that broadcast
signals would no longer be freely available over the airwaves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cable Switch &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should broadcasters make the switch, it would affect about
12 percent of households, according to estimates based on data
from SNL Kagan and Nielsen. About 100 million of 114 million
U.S. homes with televisions subscribe to pay-TV services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diller, the billionaire investor who helped create the Fox
network, says New York-based Aereo may eventually get as much as
35 percent of U.S. households to subscribe if it overcomes legal
challenges. The service charges customers $8 a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DirecTV, Time Warner Cable Inc. and Charter Communications
Inc. are considering using the same approach, capturing free
broadcast-TV signals to avoid paying retransmission fees,
according to people with knowledge of the companies&#8217; plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cable companies could use Aereo&#8217;s approach in an effort
to bypass or reduce the fees they now pay, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court fight centers on a provision in the federal
copyright law that gives owners the exclusive right to perform
their works &#8220;publicly.&#8221; The appeals court said Aereo&#8217;s service
was legal because the separate antennas let each customer create
a distinct copy of a broadcast program for viewing, so no public
transmission was taking place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Technical Detail&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broadcasters argued in their appeal that Aereo is
trying to use a &#8220;technical detail&#8221; to circumvent well-established legal rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is no dispute that Aereo has developed a business
model around the massive, for-profit exploitation of the
copyrighted works of others,&#8221; the broadcasters argued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aereo is taking the unusual step of encouraging Supreme
Court review of a ruling in the company&#8217;s favor, saying it wants
to resolve legal doubt. That stems in part from rulings by two
federal trial judges declaring another company&#8217;s similar system
to be a copyright violation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Litigation has &#8220;created uncertainty that undermines
Aereo&#8217;s efforts to expand its footprint and further develop its
business,&#8221; the company told the court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chet Kanojia, chief executive officer of Aereo, told
Bloomberg Television yesterday that &#8220;it will become clear what
the road map looks like on the legal front over the next few
months&#8221; if the Supreme Court takes up the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NFL Backing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower court disagreement often prompts the high court to
consider a case, though the justices tend to wait until the same
issue has been decided differently at the appeals court level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Football League and Major League Baseball,
whose games appear on broadcast TV, are backing the media
companies. The broadcasters also have support at the high court
from companies that produce television programs, including Time
Warner Inc. and Viacom Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC) is taking a middle ground in the
debate, saying that while Aereo&#8217;s service violates the copyright
laws, the broadcasters&#8217; arguments go too far and threaten
legitimate services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The local TV broadcast industry is run separately from the
national networks and would face a different challenge if Aereo
is found to be legal. Local broadcasters act as affiliates of
the national networks and negotiate separate deals with pay-TV
operators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Consolidating Business &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local broadcasters have consolidated in the last few years,
a move partly spurred by the growth in retransmission revenue as
well as the value of their broadcasting bandwidth, also known as
spectrum, parts of which could be sold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation led to more than $10 billion in acquisitions
last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Aereo&#8217;s
legality could threaten the value of those deals, according to
Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s super-complicated from an investor perspective,&#8221; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court case is American Broadcasting Companies
v. Aereo, 13-461. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to
decide whether a rival drink-maker can sue Coca-Cola Co. (KO) for
allegedly deceiving consumers about the amount of pomegranate
juice in one of its beverages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal appeals court barred the suit by Pom Wonderful
LLC, saying Food and Drug Administration regulations authorize
the Coca-Cola product&#8217;s name. The label on the drink says
&#8220;Pomegranate Blueberry Flavored Blend of 5 Juices,&#8221; with the
first two words appearing in larger letters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pom Wonderful says the label is misleading because the
drink contains only 0.3 percent pomegranate juice and 0.2
percent blueberry juice. Apple and grape juice constitute 99
percent of the juice, Pom Wonderful says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court ruling &#8220;undermines the transparency that
health-conscious consumers rightly expect so that they can make
informed decisions about what they eat and drink,&#8221; Los Angeles-based Pom Wonderful said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola says the label accurately tells consumers that
the product is a blend of fruits and tastes like pomegranate and
blueberry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are confident our labeling fully complies with
applicable FDA regulations, as the lower courts have
consistently found,&#8221; the Atlanta-based company said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legal question is whether the Lanham Act, which
authorizes false-advertising suits, can apply even when the FDA
regulates a product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A San Francisco-based federal appeals court threw out the
suit saying, &#8220;we must respect the FDA&#8217;s apparent decision not
to impose the requirements urged by Pom.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justices Samuel Alito and Stephen Breyer didn&#8217;t take part
in the court&#8217;s action today, raising the prospect that only
seven members of the court will participate in the case. As is
the court&#8217;s custom, Alito and Breyer gave no reasons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Pom Wonderful v. Coca-Cola, 12-761. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after getting $3 billion more
expensive in two years, Monster Beverage Corp. (MNST) could still be a
desirable target for beverage companies in need of a sales jolt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long-standing subject of takeover speculation is
increasing revenue faster than every major U.S. soft drink
maker, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That includes
Coca-Cola Co. (KO), which is poised to report its first annual sales
drop since the financial crisis. Coca-Cola may be motivated to
bid for the maker of Monster and Worx brand energy drinks and 
Peace Tea to protect their distribution agreement, said Stifel 
Financial Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monster&#8217;s growth would be costly to buy, and any suitor
would have to weigh the risk of betting on energy drinks at a
time when health concerns about caffeine-rich products have
spurred a U.S. regulatory investigation. Still, even at a 41
percent premium, the $16 billion purchase could boost Coca-Cola&#8217;s earnings, according to Bank of Montreal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be an expensive acquisition because of the
growth,&#8221; Jack Russo, a St. Louis-based analyst at Edward Jones
 Co., said in a phone interview. &#8220;Certainly any buyer that
wants to get into this category has to look at the regulatory
environment and see that there are a lot more alarm bells going
off about energy drinks. Those two things need to be weighed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. agreed to lease 120,000 square feet in a new tower in
Manhattan&#8217;s East Village for its Watson Group, developer of the
technology that beat &#8220;Jeopardy!&#8221; champion Ken Jennings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, based in Armonk, New York, will bring the occupancy of
the Fumihiko Maki-designed building at 51 Astor Place to 73
percent, said Ed Minskoff, founder of developer Minskoff
Equities. The 400,000-square-foot (37,000-square-meter), 12-story tower was completed about four months ago, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minskoff started construction in the aftermath of the
credit crash without any tenants committed. The project tested
the appetite of New York&#8217;s technology and media companies for
new offices at a time when they were flocking to converted
factories and warehouses elsewhere in the area known as Midtown
South, roughly from 30th to Canal streets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I always said from the day we announced we were going to
develop this property, it would lease after people could walk
through it,&#8221; Minskoff said in a telephone interview. &#8220;Now that
they&#8217;re walking through it, the response from most of the people
we&#8217;re doing deals with is, &#8216;Wow.&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the deal, the tower will be named the IBM Watson
Building, Minskoff said. Watson is cloud-based technology that
answers questions in plain language and learns from the
responses. It&#8217;s known for beating Jennings after he won a record
74 straight &#8220;Jeopardy!&#8221; matches against other humans in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lori Bosio, a spokeswoman for IBM, declined to comment on
the lease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Facebook, Yahoo &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minskoff declined to reveal terms of the agreement, saying
only that it would be for between 10 and 20 years. He said in
general, tenants are paying rents that are &#8220;in the range&#8221; of
the $88 to $115 a square foot he said he was seeking in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc. and Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) last year took space in
buildings completed in the early 20th century. Facebook is
leasing offices at 770 Broadway, which is across the street from
51 Astor Place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our entrance looks straight into their space,&#8221; Minskoff
said. &#8220;All that did was reinforce in my mind the value of the
Astor Place location.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson&#8217;s move to Manhattan was reported by Forbes on its
website on Jan. 8. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) unit
denied dumping a Singapore private wealth client&#8217;s shares it
held as collateral and said it&#8217;s still owed money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quah Su Ling sued Goldman Sachs International in London,
accusing it of breach of contract for selling her shares in
Blumont Group Ltd., Asiasons Capital Ltd. (ACAP) and LionGold Corp. and
depressing their prices. Goldman Sachs International countersued
for $12.3 million it says it&#8217;s still owed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs International sold the shares in an &#8220;orderly
and measured manner -- consistent with industry practice and
accepted standards -- over the course of three weeks,&#8221; the bank
said in court papers filed in London and made available this
week. The lawsuit is Quah&#8217;s &#8220;attempt to delay or avoid
repayment of debt.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of the three Singapore companies tumbled with
Asiasons falling 62 percent on Oct. 4, while Blumont declined 56
percent and LionGold was down 42 percent. Over three days from
Oct. 4, the declines erased $6.9 billion from Singapore&#8217;s bourse
value. The Monetary Authority of Singapore and the city&#8217;s stock
exchange said they would probe activities around the shares of
the companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quah, the Chief Executive Officer of IPCO International
Ltd., claimed Goldman Sachs demanded she repay $48 million
within 1 1/2 hours on Oct. 2 and started selling her shares. The
bank hadn&#8217;t informed her previously of any shortfall in her
margin loan or give her reasonable time to make payment, Quah
said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edward Naylor, a Hong Kong-based spokesman for Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment on the lawsuit. Quah didn&#8217;t respond
to two e-mails or a call to her office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has also been sued in London by James Hong,
an executive director at Blumont. Hong claimed the bank breached
its duties by &#8220;arbitrarily&#8221; selling his shares in the three
Singapore commodity companies held as collateral, according to
the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators around the world have stepped up oversight of
capital markets after the global financial crisis in 2008.
Singapore&#8217;s central bank established a 13-member council in 2010
with the goal of boosting corporate governance standards and
investor confidence. The Singapore Exchange, Southeast Asia&#8217;s
biggest bourse, said after the decline of the three stocks it
plans to add circuit breakers in 2014 to halt trading for 10
minutes when shares move 10 percent in either direction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Quah Su Ling v Goldman Sachs International.

&lt;p&gt;Los Angeles gasoline advanced for
the first time in seven days after Chevron Corp. (CVX) reported
malfunctions at the El Segundo refinery in Southern California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fuel&#8217;s discount to futures narrowed after Chevron&#8217;s
279,000-barrel-a-day El Segundo plant had a compressor trip Jan.
11, according to regulatory filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbob in Los Angeles gained 3.5 cents to 9.5 cents a
gallon below New York Mercantile Exchange futures as of 2:04
p.m. East Coast time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery breakdown may lower fuel production at the
same time as two tankers, the Overseas Athens and the Maersk
Mikage, headed for Los Angeles, IHS Inc. (IHS) data show. Both vessels
were chartered to load fuel from the U.S. West Coast in the next
week for delivery abroad, according to ship-fixture data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-grade, or CARB, diesel in Los Angeles
strengthened 0.5 cent against ultra low sulfur diesel futures on
the Nymex to a discount of 6 cents a gallon. Jet fuel in Los
Angeles dropped 1 cent to 5.5 cents a gallon under ULSD futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbob in San Francisco was unchanged at a discount of 24
cents a gallon versus futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retail gasoline in California fell 0.5 cent to $3.639 a
gallon, according to Heathrow, Florida-based AAA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3-2-1 crack spread, assuming two barrels of Carbob
gasoline and one barrel of CARB diesel in Los Angeles is refined
out of three barrels of Alaska North Slope crude, widened 64
cents to $9.78 a barrel at 2:06 p.m. New York time, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in Portland, Oregon, a
benchmark for the U.S. Pacific Northwest, gained 0.5 cent to a
discount of 17.5 cents a gallon. Low-sulfur diesel there
weakened 0.25 cent to 5.5 cents a gallon under ULSD futures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) investors want a target for annual returns -- as long as it&#8217;s higher than the one that pays a bonus to Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and his top deputies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the New York-based firm set to report a fourth straight year of lower profitability than it had in the decade before the financial crisis, shareholders are waiting for Goldman Sachs to end its status as the only major investment bank that won&#8217;t declare a public profitability target. The company&#8217;s board of directors set a 10 percent return-on-equity target for top executives to earn their long-term bonuses, a level that even Blankfein has called &#8220;hardly aspirational.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the lack of a target hasn&#8217;t prevented Goldman Sachs&#8217;s stock from almost doubling in the past two years, executives have been asked for a goal by analysts and investors during six of the last seven earnings calls and conference presentations. The most recent request came after third-quarter trading revenue dropped the most among the nine largest global investment banks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It does come up a lot with investors, how long do they have?&#8221; said Roger Freeman, a Barclays Plc (BARC) analyst in New York. &#8220;It&#8217;s a question of time -- whether the environment for dealers gets better fast enough to avoid being in a difficult position of having to put a target out there that&#8217;s meaningfully higher than where they&#8217;re at.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C) and JPMorgan Chase 
Co. helped publish a guide to bond finance for clean-energy and
climate projects after a record year for the market in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Credit Agricole Corporate
and Investment Bank also helped draft guidelines for issuers and
investors, Citigroup said in an e-mailed statement. The Green
Bond Principles advise on the use, management and reporting of
bond proceeds, as well as on evaluating and choosing projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors are buying bonds to fund growth of clean energy
promoted by governments from the U.S. to China. Green bonds sold
by development banks, projects and companies reached about $14
billion last year, a record, according to Bloomberg New Energy
Finance. Banks such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Deutsche Bank
AG and HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) support the principles, Citi said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commodities cycle that sent
prices rising almost fourfold over 10 years is reversing and
will eventually drive raw materials into a structural bear
market, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth in shale oil output will keep U.S. energy prices
low, reinforcing economic growth and leading to more tapering of
government stimulus, the bank said in a report dated yesterday.
That will cut raw-material demand in emerging markets and lead
to weakened currencies that will encourage more production. The
new cycle is the opposite of the &#8220;super cycle&#8221; that ran from
2002 through 2011, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you about one commodity out there that has a
bullish supply-side story,&#8221; Jeffrey Currie, head of commodities
research at Goldman, said at the company&#8217;s investor conference
in London today. &#8220;A decade of higher commodity prices generated
a supply response.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities posted the first annual drop in five years in
2013 as supply exceeded demand for corn to sugar to nickel and
investors lost faith in precious metals as a store of value amid
signs that economies are improving. As higher prices spurred
miners and farmers to boost production at time when China&#8217;s
economic growth slowed, Citigroup Inc. said the &#8220;super cycle&#8221;
of gains has ended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The rotation away from emerging markets and towards
developed market demand as well as the supply increase,
particularly the U.S. shale revolution, are creating a new
commodity cycle,&#8221; Currie said in the report. &#8220;On net, this new
commodity cycle eventually suggests a structural bear market in
commodities, but we believe that is still in the distant
future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Weakening Currencies &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new cycle will lead emerging market nations to increase
production to raise cash to make up for weakening currencies,
which will further weaken prices and reinforce the U.S.
recovery, Goldman said. A &#8220;structural&#8221; bear market is only in
the future because of transportation, processing and
distribution bottlenecks, Goldman said. Surging U.S. oil output
is largely trapped in the country and copper smelters are
failing to process rising supplies from mines, according to the
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodity cycles last about 25 to 30 years, with the first
half spent on building production capacity to meet demand and
the next 10 to 15 years spent on building capacity to consume,
Currie said. Returns in the last 10 to 15 years will be positive
for industries such as petrochemicals, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Precious Metals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s Enhanced Commodity Index will fall 3
percent in the next 12 months, with precious metals dropping 15
percent on top of last year&#8217;s 30 percent decline and agriculture
falling 11 percent after sliding 18 percent in 2013, Goldman
said. Industrial metals are forecast to decrease 5 percent and
livestock 3 percent, according to the report. Energy will lose 1
percent, after gaining 5.6 percent in 2013, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold prices will fall to $1,050 an ounce in 12 months from
$1,246 an ounce now, while copper will be at $6,200 a metric ton
from $7,283 a ton now as the market moves into surplus, the bank
said. A record soybean crop in South America will send prices to
$9.50 a bushel from $12.7325 a bushel now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Brent will be at $100 a barrel in 12 months and West
Texas Intermediate oil at $90 a barrel, price risk is &#8220;skewed
to the downside,&#8221; Currie said in the report. Uncertainty about
oil supplies due to geopolitical risks in Libya and South Sudan
means the bank is neutral commodities over the next three
months, with prices forecast to return 3 percent in the period. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL) didn&#8217;t infringe a patent
owned by Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Motorola Mobility unit over mobile-phone
technology, a U.S. appeals court ruled Jan. 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling, posted on the website of the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, affirms a victory
Apple won at the U.S. International Trade Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility had unsuccessfully claimed Apple
infringed six patents in a case before the ITC. The sole patent
on appeal involves a way to control the delivery of data to
applications on a wireless device. The three-judge panel of the
Federal Circuit said the commission was correct to rule that
Cupertino, California-based Apple used a different technique. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, based in Mountain View, California, inherited the
case when it bought Motorola Mobility in 2012 for $12.4 billion.
The purchase was made in part to get Motorola Mobility&#8217;s trove
of more than 17,000 patents, which Google hoped would be used to
counter attacks that its Android operating system was infringing
Apple and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) patents. Thus far, the strategy hasn&#8217;t
resulted in a significant legal victory against either company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent in this case also has been asserted against
Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Motorola Mobility LLC. V. U.S. International
Trade Commission, 13-1666, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit (Washington). The ITC case is In the Matter of Certain
Wireless Communication Devices, Portable Music and Data
Processing Devices, Computers and Components Thereof, 337-745,
U.S. International Trade Commission (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Technology Patent Case Accepted by Top Court at Google&#8217;s Urging &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review a patent ruling
that Google Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) say threatens to open
information-technology companies to new infringement lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices on Jan. 10 said they will hear an appeal by
Limelight Networks Inc., which is fighting a suit by Akamai
Technologies Inc. (AKAM) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
over Akamai&#8217;s patented method for redirecting requests for
Internet content to ensure access during periods of high demand.
The companies compete with one another in that field. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal appeals court said Akamai could sue Limelight
even though no single company performed every aspect of the
patented method. Akamai says Limelight takes all but one step
and induces its customers to perform the final step. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which
specializes in patent cases, ruled that Limelight could be sued
for inducing infringement. The ruling marked a change for the
Washington-based court, which had previously barred such suits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, Cisco, Oracle Corp. (ORCL), Red Hat Inc. (RHT), Symantec Corp. (SYMC)
and Xilinx Inc. (XLNX) are backing Limelight, which is based in Tempe,
Arizona. Those companies said in a court filing that the
decision would leave technology companies vulnerable because
products like smartphones &#8220;can be used in an almost infinite
combination of ways by other companies and consumers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration also urged the nation&#8217;s highest
court to intervene and rule for Limelight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akamai, which is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, told
the Supreme Court it shouldn&#8217;t hear the case. The company said
the rule overturned by the Federal Circuit allowed circumvention
of patents &#8220;in the form of contrived &#8216;non-infringing&#8217; multiple-actor scenarios.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court is already preparing to consider another
technology patenting case in its current term, which runs
through June. In that case, the court will decide when software
can be patented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akamai won a $45.5 million jury award at an earlier stage
in the litigation. In a separate part of its ruling, the Federal
Circuit said a trial judge was correct to set aside that award. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drugmakers including Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Pfizer
Inc. sided with Akamai at the appeals court level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Limelight Networks v. Akamai Technologies,
12-786. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Daiichi Sankyo Wins Dismissal of Apotex Suit Over Drug Patent &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daiichi Sankyo Co. won dismissal of an Apotex Inc. lawsuit
that sought a court finding that its plan to market a generic
form of the blood pressure drug Benicar didn&#8217;t infringe a
Daiichi-held patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman in Chicago said
that because Daiichi had disclaimed the patent over which Apotex
sued, there was no legal controversy over which she could rule.
Her decision was released Jan. 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apotex sued Tokyo-based Daiichi in 2012. A finding of non-infringement would have enabled it to compete sooner with
generic drug maker Mylan Inc., which also plans to bring a form
of Benicar to market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Daiichi disclaimed the patent and in 2006 asked the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration to de-list it, the agency
never acted on that request, the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Apotex Inc. v. Daiichi Sankyo, 12-cv-9295, U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Broadcasters Get U.S. Supreme Court Review in Bid to Stop Aereo &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadcasters will get a U.S. Supreme Court hearing in their
fight to stop Aereo Inc., the company that is threatening the
industry&#8217;s decades-old business model by selling live television
programming over the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices on Dec. 10 agreed to hear an appeal by media
companies including Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s ABC, 21st Century Fox
Inc. (FOX), Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)&#8217;s NBCUniversal and CBS Corp. (CBS) They contend
that Aereo, which is backed by Barry Diller, is violating their
copyrights by using thousands of dime-sized antennas to obtain
broadcast signals without paying fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal appeals court in New York ruled that Aereo, which
provides broadcast signals to subscribers after capturing them
with thousands of small antennas, isn&#8217;t violating broadcasters&#8217;
copyrights. Broadcasters say the ruling created a blueprint that
might let cable and satellite providers avoid paying
&#8220;retransmission&#8221; fees to carry programming. With those fees
estimated to exceed $4 billion this year, some broadcast
companies say they may convert to cable channels if Aereo isn&#8217;t
shut down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower court decision &#8220;is already transforming the
industry and threatening the very fundamentals of broadcast
television,&#8221; the broadcasters argued in their appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aereo joined the broadcasters in urging Supreme Court
review, saying the company needs legal clarity so it can pursue
plans for growth. In separate cases, two federal trial judges
ruled that another company&#8217;s similar system was a copyright
violation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Litigation has &#8220;created uncertainty that undermines
Aereo&#8217;s efforts to expand its footprint and further develop its
business,&#8221; the New York-based company told the court. Aereo,
which offers service in 10 cities, said Jan. 8 that it has
raised $34 million to fund expansion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under its normal scheduling practices, the Supreme Court
will hear arguments in April and rule by early July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is American Broadcasting Companies v. Aereo,
13-461. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Dow Jones Accuses Ransquawk of Misappropriating Its News &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News Corp. (NWSA)&#8217;s Dow Jones  Co., the publisher of the Wall
Street Journal, accused the Ransquawk financial news aggregation
service of illegally redistributing news from its DJX subscriber
service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real-Time Analysis  News Ltd., Ransquawk&#8217;s U.K.-based
owner, republishes on its website and through audio broadcasts
Dow Jones&#8217;s news headlines within seconds after they appear on
DJX, according to the complaint filed Jan. 9 in federal court in
Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Because Ransquawk distributes news copied verbatim from
DJX in competition with DJX without incurring the costs Dow
Jones incurs to originate the news, Ransquawk is able to offer
its products and services at a substantially lower price than
Dow Jones can offer similar products and services,&#8221; according
to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company seeks at least $5 million in damages for
misappropriation of &#8220;hot news&#8221; as well as for interfering with
contractual relationships by obtaining the news without a DJX
subscription, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives of Real-Time Analysis  News didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, competes with
Dow Jones in providing financial news and services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Dow Jones  Co. v. Real-Time Analysis  News
Ltd., 14-0131, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the U.S. bank

&lt;p&gt;The lender issued 6.75 percent, variable rate notes due in

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s quarterly profit fell 7.3 percent on $2.6

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa (KOFL) SAB, the world&#8217;s
biggest franchised bottler of the soft drink, sank to a seven-week low on concern Mexico&#8217;s junk food tax is making sugary
drinks more expensive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares fell 1.8 percent to 151.10 pesos at the close of
trading in Mexico City, the lowest since Nov. 26. The stock has
declined 23 percent in the past year. The benchmark IPC index
climbed 0.7 percent today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1 peso per liter levy on sugary drinks that took effect
Jan. 1 increases the price 13 to 14 percent, said Karla Miranda,
an analyst at Corporativo GBM SAB in Mexico City, who expects
the stock to be volatile until the company releases earnings.
Femsa draws about 40 percent of its revenue from Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Bottling is going to be more expensive,&#8221; Miranda said.
&#8220;The market is really nervous about what the outcome will be
regarding results.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arca Continential SAB, Latin America&#8217;s second biggest
bottler of Coca-Cola, fell 1.8 percent to 76.80 in Mexico City
trading, the lowest level on a closing basis since Nov. 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa yesterday sold $150 million more in 10-year
bonds and $200 million more in 30-year bonds on Monday in part
to repay outstanding debt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s quarterly profit fell 7.3 percent on $2.6 billion of settlements tied to Bernard Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme as rising legal costs ended the firm&#8217;s three-year streak of record annual earnings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter net income declined to $5.28 billion, or $1.30 a share, from $5.69 billion, or $1.39, a year earlier, according to a statement today from New York-based JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank. Results excluding the Madoff settlement and other one-time items were $1.40 a share. Twenty-two analysts surveyed by Bloomberg estimated $1.37 on average. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 57, is whittling down the firm&#8217;s list of legal woes that include allegations it misled buyers of mortgage bonds, rigged markets and turned a blind eye to suspicious activity by customers.

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest U.S. bank, said it replaced 2 million payment cards after the breach of consumer data at retailers including Target Corp.

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) amassed more U.S. patents than any other company for the 21st straight year, helped by its push into big-data services, which glean insights by mining large quantities of information. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s 6,809 patents in 2013 scored an annual record, the company said today in a statement. With inventors from 41 countries, more than 31 percent of the patents came from overseas. South Korea&#8217;s Samsung Electronics Co. and Tokyo-based Canon Inc. (7751) ranked second and third. While computer-related patents can take almost three years to process, the annual list shows where companies are seeking growth opportunities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As sluggish demand for computer hardware has dragged down revenue, IBM is focusing more on fast-growing areas such as analytics and cloud computing. Last week, IBM said it&#8217;s forming a separate division for its Watson tool -- a so-called cognitive technology that can analyze vast amounts of data and answer questions in plain English. Bernie Meyerson, vice president for innovation at IBM, said the unit relies on recent patents. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The work on cognitive is based on numerous of the patents that were just issued related to Watson,&#8221; Meyerson said in an interview from IBM&#8217;s headquarters in Armonk, New York. &#8220;That new division is now a major commercial focus. By funding research in that area, you will fund patents in that area.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soccer governing body FIFA signed a
new accord with Visa Inc. (V) through 2022, extending an agreement
that started amid controversy in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s biggest bank-card network is the fifth FIFA
partner to commit to both the 2018 and 2022 World Cups,
following Adidas AG (ADS), Coca-Cola Co., Hyundai-Kia and Anheuser-Busch InBev NV. (ABI) This year&#8217;s edition of the quadrennial event
will be in Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re delighted to have such a strong global brand by our
side until at least 2022,&#8221; FIFA President Sepp Blatter said in
an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa joined FIFA&#8217;s roster of sponsors following a dispute
between the soccer body and its previous credit card sponsor
MasterCard Inc. (MA) that was only settled after FIFA agreed to pay
$90 million in compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MasterCard had been a FIFA partner for 16 years and argued
it was contractually obliged to a first right of renewal. The
case hurt FIFA&#8217;s reputation with a judge describing its dealings
as &#8220;anything but fair play&#8221; and said its negotiators &#8220;lied&#8221;
to both MasterCard and Visa. Following the verdict FIFA fired
its then marketing director Jerome Valcke, who&#8217;s since returned
as its general secretary, its most senior administrative
official. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s corporate and
investment bank allocated 4.2 percent less for employee
compensation last year as the division&#8217;s revenue was little
changed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit&#8217;s $10.8 billion in compensation fell to 30 percent
of revenue, excluding accounting adjustments, from 32 percent in
2012, according to figures posted today on the New York-based
firm&#8217;s website. The amount equals $207,368 for each of the
division&#8217;s 52,250 employees. The unit employed 52,022 people a
year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, has struggled to
meet expense goals amid surging litigation costs and efforts to
improve compliance. The company wouldn&#8217;t penalize employees for
losses tied to bad loans sold by firms it acquired amid the
financial crisis, including Bear Stearns Cos. and Washington
Mutual Inc.&#8217;s banking operations, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to look at JPMorgan and say you&#8217;re going to
blame people at JPMorgan, the existing employees, for what
happened with Bear Stearns and WaMu,&#8221; said Dimon, 57. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
never blamed employees broadly for mistakes we made away from
them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compensation at the corporate and investment bank, run by
Mike Cavanagh, 48, and Daniel Pinto, 51, includes salaries,
bonuses, benefits and the cost of deferred pay from previous
years. Figures for average pay don&#8217;t represent what individuals
actually receive and are calculated by dividing the total
compensation expense by the number of employees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Satter, an adviser for U.S.
news service Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, has been barred
from Russia and was told by an embassy official that his
presence in the country was considered &#8220;undesirable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satter has been banned from entering Russia for five years
for overstaying a visa last year, the Foreign Ministry said
today in a statement. His application, using a notification
number provided by the Foreign Ministry and submitted to the
Russian embassy in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, was rejected
last month, according to a statement yesterday on RFE&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was not a matter of my having done something,&#8221; Satter
said in a video published on the Guardian newspaper&#8217;s website.
&#8220;No accusations were made against me. It was a statement that
my presence on the territory of the Russian Federation was
undesirable. So we see a tendency toward a return to Cold War
tactics and even beyond.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. embassy has lodged a diplomatic protest, according
to RFE&#8217;s statement. The often tense relationship between Russia
and the U.S. has shown improvement during talks in the past
months about resolving the conflict in Syria after souring when
American ex-security contractor Edward Snowden arrived in Moscow
in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Soviet Union &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satter didn&#8217;t immediately respond to e-mailed questions
about his visa. The author of three books on Russia and the
Soviet Union and the Financial Times&#8217; correspondent in Moscow
from 1976 to 1982 had moved to the Russian capital in September,
according to his website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satter spent about five days in Russia &#8220;illegally&#8221; in
November, according to the Foreign Ministry. He received his
accreditation from the ministry on Nov. 21 and was supposed to
immediately go to the Federal Migration Service to get his long-term visa, although he showed up there only on Nov. 26,
according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His case was heard by a district court in Moscow on Nov.
29, where he was fined and ordered to leave the country, the
ministry said. Satter left Russia on Dec. 4. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany&#8217;s anti-euro AfD party is set
to announce the candidacy of Hans-Olaf Henkel, a former European
chief for International Business Machines Corp (IBM), in a coup that
might help broaden its appeal in European Parliament elections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Alternative for Germany, or AfD in German, took 4.7
percent in September&#8217;s federal elections to narrowly miss out on
seats in the country&#8217;s lower house of parliament. Presenting
Henkel in Berlin today may help the party to clear the 3 percent
hurdle in May&#8217;s European elections to gain its first legislative
seats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fact the AfD is still there, despite the euro crisis
having taken a back seat, shows that a large number of AfD
supporters aren&#8217;t just euro skeptics, but that the AfD taps into
a pool of right-wing voters,&#8221; Manfred Guellner, who heads the
pollster Forsa, said in an interview. That makes it &#8220;more than
likely&#8221; the AfD will enter the European Parliament. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AfD&#8217;s failure to win Bundestag seats last year bucked a
trend that has seen anti-European parties gain support in
countries from the U.K. to Greece, raising the prospect of a
shift in power in the 766-seat European Parliament. By contrast,
German support for the European Union rose to a record in a poll
last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the AfD opposes the euro and advocates Greece&#8217;s exit
from the 18-nation single currency, it is not expressly anti-EU.
AfD leader Bernd Lucke has said he won&#8217;t ally with parties such
as France&#8217;s Front National and Dutchman Geert Wilders&#8217; Party for
Freedom, which have said they may form an anti-EU bloc. Lucke is
due to hold a press briefing at 2 p.m. in Berlin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AfD delegates will vote on the party&#8217;s list of candidates
for the European elections at a Jan. 25 convention in the
southern town of Aschaffenburg. Polls suggest the AfD would take
about 5 percent if elections were held now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anne Pfeiffer, a JPMorgan (JPM) Chase 
Co. managing director for real estate who led the bank&#8217;s $23
billion Strategic Property Fund until retiring in October, has
died. She was 61. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She died on Jan. 12 in her Manhattan home following a 20-month battle with pancreatic cancer, according to her husband,
Paul Pfeiffer. She had been under hospice care since Christmas
Eve, he said yesterday in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A member of JPMorgan&#8217;s real-estate financing unit for
almost 35 years, Pfeiffer managed a seven-person portfolio-management team as head of the New York-based bank&#8217;s commingled
property funds, which are pension trusts catering to retirement
and governmental plans. Under her leadership, the Strategic
Property Fund, JPMorgan&#8217;s core real-estate portfolio, was the
largest of its kind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Anne has been a masterful portfolio manager, an
inspirational leader, a talented colleague and a true friend,&#8221;
Kevin Faxon, the bank&#8217;s head of real estate for the Americas,
wrote in a letter to clients in July to announce her retirement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors in the Strategic Property Fund, of which she was
senior portfolio manager, included the Public School Teachers
Pension  Retirement Fund of Chicago and the New York City
Employees&#8217; Retirement System, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The assets included the Landmark Center in Boston,
Century Park in Los Angeles and International Toy Center in New
York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fund Portfolio &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other real-estate funds she oversaw included the Special
Situation Property Fund, with $3.1 billion of assets; the
Alternative Property Fund, with $647 million in holdings; the
Diversified Commercial Property Fund, a $372.8 million defined-contribution vehicle; and the $2.3 billion U.S. Income  Growth
Fund, according to an overview of the investments last February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2002 to 2008, Pfeiffer was on the board of directors
at the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries,
and president in 2007 and 2008. The Chicago-based association of
institutional real-estate professionals addresses industry
issues and promotes research, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfeiffer was elected to the board of the Real Estate
Information Standards for a three-year term starting in January
2012. The group is sponsored by the National Council of Real
Estate Investment Fiduciaries and the Pension Real Estate
Association &#8220;to facilitate informed investment decision-making,&#8221; according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Dearly Loved&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Anne was a friend and mentor to so many people she worked
with at the firm,&#8221; her husband said, summarizing the e-mails he
had received since her death. &#8220;She was dearly loved and revered
among her co-workers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anne Shultz Pfeiffer was born on Aug. 10, 1952, in Aurora,
Illinois. Her father, Robert Shultz, was a Dartmouth College-educated businessman who had a manufacturing firm in the Chicago
area. Her mother, Elizabeth, was a registered nurse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She attended Naperville Central High School in Naperville,
Illinois, before completing a Bachelor of Business
Administration degree at Southern Methodist University in
Dallas. A certified public accountant, Pfeiffer began her career
at Coopers  Lybrand, where she was a supervising accountant,
before the firm merged with Price Waterhouse in 1998. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfeiffer joined JPMorgan in 1979 as the senior finance
officer and served as head of the finance group, as a senior
asset manager and an acquisitions officer, according to
JPMorgan&#8217;s website. She was responsible for the origination,
analysis and negotiation of commercial real-estate transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her passions included travel and art, and she played a
mentoring role to young women in finance and business, according
to Paul Pfeiffer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to her husband, her survivors include their two
children, Christof and Kirsten, and her mother. A sister, Mary,
and brother Nicholas preceded her in death. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peru plans to cut its coca crop, the
world&#8217;s largest, in half as police increase eradication of the
plant that forms the base ingredient of cocaine, the
government&#8217;s drugs czar said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eradication will reduce the crop to 32,000 hectares (79,000
acres) by 2016, the lowest in at least a decade,  curbing
exports of cocaine to countries such as Brazil and Spain, Carmen Masias told reporters in Lima today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Ollanta Humala increased spending on eradication
and crop substitution after Peru overtook Colombia in 2012 to
become the world&#8217;s largest grower of coca leaf, according to the
United Nations. Coca cultivation fell to 54,360 hectares last
year, 13 percent less than when Humala took office in 2011, as
police destroyed plants at a faster pace than drug gangs
replaced them, according to government estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re very optimistic that we&#8217;ll continue increasing the
areas of eradication and reducing growing areas,&#8221; Masias said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peru boosted counter-narcotics spending to $387 million
last year from $311 million in 2012, including $109 million in
foreign aid. The government is purchasing 24 Russian helicopters
to support the drugs fight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humala increased the target for eradication this year to
30,000 hectares from an initial 26,000 hectares, Masias said.
Police for the first time will begin removing coca plants in the
valley of the Apurimac, Ene and Mantaro Rivers, the largest
growing area, where holdout members of the Maoist guerrilla
group Shining Path remain active. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alaska plans to jump-start a $45
billion natural gas export project by pitching in more than 10
percent of the cost and joining Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), BP Plc (BP/),
ConocoPhillips and TransCanada Corp. (TRP) as an equity partner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement between the state and the four companies
outlines a framework in which Alaska would take as much as a 25
percent stake in a proposed gas processing plant, an 800-mile
(1,287-kilometer) pipeline from Alaska&#8217;s North Slope and a
liquefaction facility in the Kenai Peninsula. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governor Sean Parnell has asked the Alaska legislature to
approve the deal and give state agencies the ability to
negotiate shipping and leasing arrangements, according to a
statement released today by the Alaska Department of Natural
Resources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is the first time we&#8217;ve had all of the parties
aligned on a path forward,&#8221; Joe Balash, the department&#8217;s
commissioner, said in a phone interview today before the
announcement. The deal gives the project a &#8220;good shot&#8221; at
proceeding, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joint venture renews a prolonged effort to harvest
Alaska&#8217;s vast reserves of gas, which have remained largely
untapped since the 1968 discovery of the Prudhoe Bay oil field.
The North Slope holds more than 35 trillion cubic feet of
discovered gas, almost four times the U.K.&#8217;s reserves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas shipments may begin as early as 2021, giving Alaska a
foothold in an increasingly competitive race to supply Asian
countries with liquefied natural gas, or LNG, from North
America. ConocoPhillips has a small LNG export plant in Nikiski
on the Kenai peninsula, the only such facility in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cost Estimates &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the project is expected to cost $45 billion, the
final bill could reach as much as $54 billion, according to a
November 2013 Black and Veatch Ltd. study produced for the
state. The producers estimated in a February 2013 letter to
Parnell that the cost could reach $65 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the terms of the agreement, Alaska will assume a 20
to 25 percent stake in the entire project. TransCanada has
agreed to pay the state&#8217;s costs for its share in the $22 billion
gas processing facility and pipeline in exchange for a lower
tariff for shipping the gas. That would represent a $5.5
billion investment, Balash said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state would pay as much as $5.75 billion for its share
of the $23 billion liquefaction facility, which would be capable
of shipping 18 million metric tons of LNG a year. The producers
would pay the remaining portion of the $45 billion total project
cost, Balash said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fund Project &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The equity stake will allow Alaska to help fund the project
and control transportation costs, he said. Alaska may sell part
of its stake in the project to a number of LNG buyers, allowing
it to reduce what it owes for the liquefaction facility, Balash
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state&#8217;s project carries a higher price tag than similar
efforts to export gas from the Canadian coast that could be
finished as soon as 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petroliam Nasional Bhd., the Malaysian state energy
company, is proposing to spend as much as $15 billion on a
terminal and pipeline to export gas from a site near Prince
Rupert, British Columbia, along Canada&#8217;s Pacific Coast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countries including Canada, the U.S. and Mozambique are
competing for a share of global gas demand set to increase
almost 50 percent by 2035, according to the International Energy
Agency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two largest U.S. home lenders
are feeling the bite of competition from smaller firms as
mortgage originations tumble at the fastest rate since 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New loans at Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), the biggest, fell 38
percent to $50 billion in the fourth quarter from the third
quarter, the bank said in a statement yesterday. At JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) originations decreased 42 percent to $23.3 billion,
outpacing the 27 percent fourth-quarter drop forecast by the
Mortgage Bankers Association for the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big banks are facing dual challenges of increased
competition and a plunge in home loan refinancing after the
Federal Reserve said it planned to reduce monthly bond purchases
and sent mortgage rates soaring. Smaller lenders are helped
because the market is shifting to one led by mortgages for home
purchases, favoring firms that can capture the buyers&#8217;
attention, said Clifford Rossi, a former Citigroup Inc. (C) risk
manager who now teaches at the University of Maryland&#8217;s Robert
H. Smith School of Business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A lot of these guys are using the internet and social
media platforms to reach borrowers more directly,&#8221; Rossi said.
Due to their &#8220;ability to be more nimble and opportunistic in
the marketplace, you will see more companies like that be able
to do more.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avianca Holdings SA, Colombia&#8217;s

among Latin American carriers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares rose 4.1 percent to 4,405 pesos at 3:09 p.m. in
Bogota, extending the rally this month to 19 percent, which
makes the stock the best performer on the Colcap. They fell 18

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan initiated coverage last month of the company&#8217;s
American depositary receipts with an overweight rating, or the
equivalent of buy, and a $24 price target. In a research note

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Practically every analyst has a much higher target than
the price right now,&#8221; Juan Pablo Vieira, a Medellin-based
trader at brokerage Serfinco SA, said by phone. &#8220;It&#8217;s being
supported by the good numbers the company keeps publishing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The airline said today that passengers during the holiday
period from Dec. 13 to Jan. 12 rose to a record 1.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avianca&#8217;s ADRs are rated the equivalent of buy by six other
analysts, with no hold or sell ratings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treasuries are having their best
start to a year since 2010 as investors from Jeffrey Gundlach to
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. say the Federal Reserve will keep its
benchmark interest rate at almost zero into 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. government securities have returned 0.7 percent in
2014 through yesterday, the most for the first two weeks in four
years, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.
Treasuries fell after a report showed a New York manufacturing
index increased this month more than forecast. Fed officials
Charles Evans and Dennis Lockhart are scheduled to speak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors who late last year anticipated stronger U.S.
data were forced to buy Treasuries this year to cover short
positions as growth appears to be losing momentum,&#8221; said Nick Stamenkovic, a fixed-income strategist at broker RIA Capital
Markets Ltd. in Edinburgh, referring to bets that an asset price
will fall. &#8220;While we expect the Fed to continue with its
tapering program, it&#8217;s unlikely that interest rates will rise
any time soon.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmark 10-year note yield rose one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 2.88 percent at 8:33 a.m. New York
time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the
2.75 percent security due November 2023 was 98 28/32. The yield
will be 3.43 percent by year-end, according to the weighted
average estimate of more than 60 forecasters surveyed by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Jobs Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasuries surged on Jan. 10 after a government report
showed the world&#8217;s biggest economy added 74,000 jobs in
December, versus the gain of 197,000 projected by a Bloomberg
News survey of economists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. government securities are rallying after debt due in
10 years and longer tumbled 13 percent 2013, the biggest loss
among 144 sovereign bond indexes globally compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gundlach, whose DoubleLine Total Return Bond Fund (DBLTX) beat 81
percent of its competitors in the past year with a 0.5 percent
gain, said short-term interest rates will stay low into 2016.
Gundlach, who is based in Los Angeles, said he&#8217;s not so sure
that Treasury yields are headed higher, speaking yesterday in a
webcast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, said
yesterday there probably won&#8217;t be an interest-rate increase
until early 2016. The Fed will probably conclude its bond-purchase program in late 2014, he said at an event in Frankfurt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs Strategic Income Fund (GSZAX) gained 4.4 percent
over the past year, beating 92 percent of its peers, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The fund is run by Jonathan
Beinner and Michael Swell in New York, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fed Speakers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evans, who was among officials who voted in favor of
reducing stimulus at the Fed&#8217;s Dec. 18 meeting, said last month
he wanted to see more signs that inflation would accelerate and
job-market gains would continue before changing policy. Lockhart
said two days ago that weak payroll growth last month should not
discourage policy makers from reducing monthly bond purchases as
long as the economy continues to strengthen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Open Market Committee last month said it will
continue to keep interest rates exceptionally low &#8220;well past&#8221;
a decline in the jobless rate below 6.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed has kept its target for overnight loans between
banks in a range of zero to 0.25 percent for five years. The
chance of an increase by January 2015 are about 23 percent,
according to futures contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year&#8217;s rally in Treasuries was interrupted yesterday
when Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser said the economy
was on &#8220;firmer footing&#8221; and the central bank&#8217;s decision to cut
debt purchases was a step in the right direction. Plosser votes
on monetary policy this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Taper Vote &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Policy makers in December announced plans to cut their
monthly bond purchases to $75 billion a month from $85 billion
starting in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports today will show manufacturing in the New York
region climbed to a four-month high in January, while producer
prices increased in December, based on surveys of economists by
Bloomberg News. The Fed is scheduled to publish its Beige Book
business survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Bank raised its global growth forecasts, saying
the easing of austerity policies in advanced economies supports
their recovery, improving the outlook for exports from
developing nations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Washington-based lender sees the world economy
expanding 3.2 percent this year, compared with a June projection
of 3 percent. U.S. growth will be 2.8 percent, the bank said in
its Global Economic Prospects report published twice a year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) amassed more U.S. patents than any other company for the
21st straight year, helped by its push into big-data services,
which glean insights by mining large quantities of information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s 6,809 patents in 2013 scored an annual record, the
company said yesterday in a statement. With inventors in 41
countries, more than 31 percent of the patents came from
overseas. South Korea&#8217;s Samsung Electronics (005930) Co. and Tokyo-based
Canon Inc. (7751) ranked second and third. While computer-related
patents can take almost three years to process, the annual list
shows where companies are seeking growth opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As sluggish demand for computer hardware has dragged down
revenue, IBM is focusing more on fast-growing areas such as
analytics and cloud computing. Last week, IBM said it&#8217;s forming
a separate division for its Watson tool -- a so-called cognitive
technology that can analyze vast amounts of data and answer
questions in plain English. Bernie Meyerson, vice president for
innovation at IBM, said the unit relies on recent patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The work on cognitive is based on numerous of the patents
that were just issued related to Watson,&#8221; Meyerson said in an
interview from IBM&#8217;s headquarters in Armonk, New York. &#8220;That
new division is now a major commercial focus. By funding
research in that area, you will fund patents in that area.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung claimed the No. 2 spot in the U.S. patent tally,
which it has held since 2007. It received almost 4,700, an 8
percent drop from the previous year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, only two U.S. companies made the top 10 in
addition to IBM. In 2013, it was software maker Microsoft Corp.
and phone-chip maker Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM); the year before it was
Microsoft and General Electric Co. (GE) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc., which ranked 11th, and Apple Inc., coming in
at 13th, both rose into the top 20 for the first time together,
research firm IFI Claims Patent Services said in a statement.
BlackBerry Ltd. was 20th in 2013, up from 29th the previous
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Allergan Wins Order Blocking Copies of Lumigan Until 2027 &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allergan Inc. (AGN) won a patent-infringement lawsuit that will
prevent copies of its Lumigan 0.01% glaucoma treatment from
entering the U.S. market until 2027. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novartis AG (NOVN)&#8217;s Sandoz unit, Actavis Plc (ACT), Hi-Tech Pharmacal
Co. and Lupin Ltd. (LPC) would infringe Allergan&#8217;s patents on the
medicine, U.S. District Judge Michael Schneider in Tyler, Texas,
said in an opinion posted on the court&#8217;s website yesterday. The
judge also rejected arguments that the patents were invalid, and
ordered that regulatory approval not be granted until they
expire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lumigan, which comes in different solution formulas,
generated $452.7 million in sales for the nine months ended
Sept. 30 and accounts for about 10 percent of the Irvine,
California-based company&#8217;s revenue. The solution slows the
progression of glaucoma, which can cause blindness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case involved five patents. Four expire in 2025 and the
fifth in 2027, according to the website of the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The generic-drug companies argued that the patents were
little different from ones covering Lumigan 0.03%. An appeals
court last year upheld a patent on that treatment that expires
in August. The judge said the newer patents are for a solution
that limited red eyes, which caused some patients to stop taking
the treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonnie Jacobs, a spokeswoman for Allergan, said the company
had no comment. Officials with the generic-drug makers either
had no immediate comment or didn&#8217;t immediately respond to
queries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lumigan is Allergan&#8217;s second-biggest drug, after Restasis
eye drops. Allergan yesterday received a new patent on Restasis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Allergan Inc. v. Sandoz Inc., 11-cv-00441, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Texas (Tyler). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Microsoft Sued for Infringement by Former Litigator&#8217;s Client &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s largest software company, was
sued for infringement by a company whose lawyer has litigated
patent cases in the past for Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IpLearn-Focus LLC filed its lawsuit Jan. 10 in federal
court in San Francisco. The Mountain View, California-based
company is represented by Matthew D. Powers of the Tensegrity
Law Group LLP of Redwood Shores, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Powers, who left New York-based Weil Gotshal  Manges LLP
in 2011 to form a patent-litigation firm, represented Microsoft
in cases including a lawsuit filed in June of that year against
TiVo Inc. (TIVO) He defended the Redmond, Washington-based software
maker in a 2007 case brought by patent owner I4i LP, according
to court files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of yesterday afternoon, the electronic docket for the
IPLearn-Focus lawsuit didn&#8217;t show an entry of any motion by
Microsoft to disqualify Powers. No counsel for Microsoft is
listed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit concerns three patents covering learning
methods and systems that use a remote sensor. IpLearn-Focus said
Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox video-game console and services infringe
patents 8,475,174, 8,538,321 and 8,538,320. According to the
database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, those are the
only three patents belonging to IpLearn-Focus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which doesn&#8217;t have a functioning website, also
is listed as the owner of patent application 20140004498, which
was published in the office&#8217;s database Jan. 2. That application
is related to the use of detached sensors in a learning
environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IpLearn-Focus said in court filings that it put Microsoft
on notice of its alleged infringement on Nov. 1 and that at the
time the complaint was filed it had received no response from
the software maker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said it&#8217;s seeking money damages and a
reasonable royalty. It asked that damages be tripled for
Microsoft&#8217;s allegedly deliberate infringement. It also requested
attorney fees and litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mailed request
for comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is IpLearn-Focus LLC v. Microsoft Corp., 14-cv-00151, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
(San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Matryoshka to Be Mark of Federal Agency, Voice of Russia Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An image of the nesting dolls known as Matryoshka dolls
will be used as a trademark for Russia&#8217;s Federal Agency for the
Commonwealth of Independent States, Compatriots Abroad and
International Humanitarian Cooperation, the Voice of Russia
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mark will be used at events prompting international
development in which Russia is involved, as well as on various
Russian air carriers, according to Voice of Russia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexi Mukhin, general director of Russia&#8217;s Center for
Political Information, told Voice of Russia the Matryoshka
symbol was chosen because it has &#8220;a deep philosophical
meaning&#8221; standing for &#8220;motherhood and fertility.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logotype that accompanies the image has already been
created and registered in the six official languages of the
United Nations, Voice of Russia reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blur&#8217;s Alex James Seeks to Register &#8216;Britpop&#8217; in U.K., BBC Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musician Alex James is seeking to trademark &#8220;Britpop&#8221; in
the U.K. for use on alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, the BBC
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James has applied to register the mark with the U.K.&#8217;s
Intellectual Property Office, according to the BBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The performer, a member of the band Blur, has a farm in
Oxfordshire and, with celebrity chef Jamie Oliver, produces
&#8220;the Big Feastival,&#8221; a food and music gathering, the BBC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James&#8217;s farm produces eight kinds of cheese, with such
names as Blue Monday, Figgy Pudding and Farleigh Wallop, the
news service reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;University of Toronto Refunds Students&#8217; Copyright License Fees &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students at the University of Toronto were given a C$13
($11.87) refund for fees they paid to Access Copyright, Canada&#8217;s
copyright licensing agency, the Varsity student newspaper
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the university ended its license with Access
Copyright in December, it chose to refund the fees, according to
the Varsity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content-producers&#8217; organizations, including the Canadian
Authors Association, the Canadian Publishers Council and the
Canadian Educational Resources Council have gone on record with
their disapproval of the school&#8217;s choice to end the license,
saying the university isn&#8217;t respecting their work, the Varsity
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the school&#8217;s present policy, if 10 percent or less of
a work is used by a professor, the school considers this fair
use under Canadian copyright law, and no license is required,
according to the Varsity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Energy Panel Head Decries Number of Fracking Secret Claims &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The head of a panel convened by the Obama administration to
look at safety issues related to hydraulic fracturing said trade
secrets claims about fracking made by the oil and gas industry
harm the industry itself, EE Publishing&#8217;s EnergyWire reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor John M. Deutch of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, at a meeting at the U.S. Energy Department of the
panel he heads, said people are &#8220;dramatically interested&#8221; in
the makeup of fracking fluids and that the industry&#8217;s trade
secret claims damage public&#8217;s confidence, according to
EnergyWire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same meeting, Eric Milito of the American Petroleum
Institute, said he disagreed with Deutch and the disclosures
being made by the industry are adequate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The committee was meeting to look at the effectiveness of
the FracFocus website, on which oil and gas drillers identify
the chemicals they use in their fracking fluids, according to
EnergyWire. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asian currencies are poised to
extend declines amid concern an increase in borrowing costs in
China and a weakening yen threaten economic growth in the
region, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A trend of bearish&#8221; Asian currencies will &#8220;kick off,&#8221;
JPMorgan analysts including Hong Kong-based Bert Gochet wrote in
a report yesterday. &#8220;Worries over China&#8217;s tight liquidity
stance generate downside risks to growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s money market rates jumped in December to a six-month high, raising concern that tighter lending conditions may
slow the world&#8217;s second-largest economy. The yen&#8217;s 15 percent
decline over the past year is fueling speculation that a cheaper
currency may help Japanese companies grab export market share
from its competitors in South Korea and Taiwan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Philippine peso touched the weakest level since 2010
yesterday on concern the Federal Reserve may accelerate the
withdrawal of stimulus as the U.S. economy improves. The
Malaysian ringgit posted its biggest two-day drop since
November, while the South Korean won fell 1.3 percent from the
five-year high set in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed started reducing its monthly bond purchases in
January by $10 billion to $75 billion, reducing capital flows to
emerging markets. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index of stocks has
slid as much as 16 percent since May 22, when the Fed signaled
its stimulus program could be trimmed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cash Squeeze &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s seven-day repurchase rate surged to 4.98 percent
today in Shanghai, the highest level since Jan. 2, according to
National Interbank Funding Center. New yuan loans slumped to a
one-year low in December and money-supply growth eased, central
bank data showed on Jan. 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cash squeeze will persist this month because
authorities are determined to curb shadow-banking financing and
reduce banks&#8217; reliance on interbank funding amid concerns about
delinquent loans, Haitong International Securities Co., part of
China&#8217;s second-largest brokerage, said in a Jan. 15 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yen, which traded at 104.33 per dollar today, may yet
reach 115 this year as the Bank of Japan weighs more stimulus to
offset a sales-tax increase, former board member Nobuyuki
Nakahara said in an interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Bank on Jan. 14 raised its forecast for global
growth to 3.2 percent this year, while lowering the estimates
for China and other emerging-market economies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Purest Expression&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on conversations with customers, JPMorgan said local
bond funds haven&#8217;t received any inflows so far this year. It
would be the first time that has happened in January since 2008,
JPMorgan said, citing data from research company EPFR Global. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysts recommend selling the ringgit as the &#8220;purest
expression of positioning for a lack of EM local bond inflows.&#8221;
Foreign investors held 45 percent of ringgit-denominated debt in
November, the most among 10 developing countries, making
Malaysia susceptible to capital outflows, according to Credit
Suisse Group AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan advises further &#8220;underweight&#8221; the Philippine
peso, saying local interest rates are too low. Investors should
also exit a bet that the South Korean won will rise as the yen
weakens. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s board is considering Ericsson AB Chief Executive Officer Hans Vestberg as a potential successor to departing leader Steve Ballmer, according to people briefed on the search. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vestberg, 48, is in the running alongside other candidates, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the process is private. Microsoft cloud-computing chief Satya Nadella and former Nokia Oyj CEO Stephen Elop, as well as other outsiders, are also on the list, people familiar with the search have said. The board hasn&#8217;t yet reached a decision and who is under consideration is still subject to change. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s lead independent director John Thompson, who is heading the search, wrote in a December blog post that the board plans to complete a search in the &#8220;early part of 2014.&#8221; He said the board started with more than 100 candidates and has since narrowed the list. Ballmer said last August that he planned to retire within a year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We never comment on rumors and speculation,&#8221; said Ola Rembe, a spokesman for Stockholm-based Ericsson, in response to questions about Vestberg&#8217;s Microsoft candidacy.

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) fell the most in two months after the firm, which relies more on trading than any of its competitors, said revenue from that business dropped 13 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Trading generated $15.7 billion in 2013, or about 46 percent of the firm&#8217;s total, according to a statement today from New York-based Goldman Sachs. That was the lowest percentage since 2002. Fourth-quarter net income dropped 19 percent, to $2.33 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 59, reported a fourth straight year of lower profitability than the firm achieved in the decade before the financial crisis. Goldman Sachs&#8217;s return on equity, a gauge of profitability, was 11 percent last year, and the company has struggled to reach 10 percent in the past three years, a level Blankfein has called &#8220;hardly aspirational.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year&#8217;s profit &#8220;serves as a reminder that the glory days of posting 20 percent-plus ROE is a distant memory,&#8221; said Euan Sanderson, a money manager at Standard Life Investments, which has more than $270 billion in assets under management. &#8220;Higher capital levels and regulatory constraints make it more challenging for Goldman to be Goldman.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shares of the company fell 2 percent to $175.17 at 4:15 p.m., the biggest decline since Nov. 7. While the shares have doubled since December 2011, they are still below their pre-crisis peak of $247.92 on Oct. 31, 2007. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is leading a
rebound in bank lending to mining and energy companies, which
are taking out the most loans since 2011 to refinance debt as
commodity prices slump and acquisitions slow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raw-material industries boosted borrowing by 17 percent
last year to $684.7 billion, after a 22 percent drop in 2012,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. The top lenders were U.S. banks
JPMorgan at $57.1 billion, Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) at $47.1 billion
and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) at $37.8 billion. The figures reflect
transactions involving more than one bank and include credit
lines, project or term loans and trade finance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While increased scrutiny from regulators is prompting
JPMorgan and other banks to exit physical commodity businesses
such as warehouses and power plants, lending rose as companies
including Rio Tinto (RIO) Group and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) Plc refinanced
to take advantage of low borrowing costs. Tumbling metal prices
also eroded revenue at mines and smelters last year during the
first commodity slump since the recession of 2008, while the
value of mergers and acquisitions slid 31 percent, data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was generally not a good year for commodities in 2013,
and that required companies to raise external financing,&#8221; said
Larry Landry, vice chairman of investment banking for JPMorgan
in New York. &#8220;There will be less opportunistic-driven
refinancing in 2014, but hopefully that will be offset by a
meaningful pickup in mergers and acquisitions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is planning
to increase fixed pay for some senior staff and traders in
Europe as regulators prepare to limit bonuses in the region,
according to a person with knowledge of the plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank plans to make so-called role-based payments to
some senior bankers and traders in addition to their annual
salaries and bonuses, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because the plans haven&#8217;t been made public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are seeking ways to sidestep tougher European Union
bonus rules, which will apply for the first time to awards given
in 2015, based on this year&#8217;s performance. Regulators are
preparing to outlaw bonuses that are more than twice fixed pay
in what lawmakers called irresponsible risk-taking that helped
spark the 2008 global financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders will be able to ask national regulators to exempt
staff earning as much as 1 million euros ($1.4 million), the
European Banking Authority said on Dec. 13. The EBA would have
to approve any such waiver, while senior managers aren&#8217;t
eligible for the exemption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britain was home to 2,188 investment bankers earning more
than 1 million euros in 2012, the highest amount in the EU,
while Spain had 37, according to the London-based EBA. France
and Germany had 117 and 100 respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said today that fourth-quarter fixed-income,
currency and commodities trading revenue was $1.72 billion, down
15 percent from a year earlier. Revenue from the equities
division dropped 27 percent to $1.68 billion from a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sky News reported the news earlier today. David Wells, a
spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) reported the highest annual earnings in three years as underwriting revenue surged to a record and the firm&#8217;s reliance on trading fell to the lowest level in more than a decade. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Net income climbed 8 percent in 2013 to $8.04 billion, the New York-based company said today in a statement. In the fourth-quarter, profit dropped 19 percent to $2.33 billion, or $4.60 a share, from $2.89 billion, or $5.60, a year earlier. That surpassed the $4.18 average estimate of 25 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 59, reported a fourth straight year of lower profitability than the firm achieved in the decade before the financial crisis, and the stock fell as much as 2.1 percent. Goldman Sachs&#8217;s return on equity, a gauge of profitability, was 11 percent last year, and the company has struggled to reach 10 percent in the past three years, a level that Blankfein has called &#8220;hardly aspirational.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A former JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
executive was barred from the brokerage industry for allegedly
passing inside information on corporate mergers to a friend, the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Michael Gutman, a vice president in the conflicts
office at JPMorgan&#8217;s brokerage unit, shared tips on deals from
March 2006 to October 2007 with Christopher John Tyndall, who
then made trades based on the information, the brokerage
industry&#8217;s self-regulator said in a statement today. Tyndall was
also barred, Finra said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;David Gutman had the keys to the kingdom through his
position at JPMorgan as a gatekeeper with special access to
material, non-public information,&#8221; Cameron Funkhouser, a Finra
vice president, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gutman tipped Tyndall, then a broker at New York-based
Meyers Associates LP, to at least 15 pending corporate mergers
and acquisitions, Finra said. Tyndall then passed the
information to 13 of his retail customers and invested
personally in at least two securities, according to the
complaint. The scheme generated more than $9 million in profits,
Finra said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In settling the claims, Gutman and Tyndall didn&#8217;t admit or
deny wrongdoing. Susan Brune, Gutman&#8217;s lawyer, declined to
comment, as did JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony. George
Meierhofer, a lawyer for Tyndall, didn&#8217;t immediately return a
phone call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp., the second-biggest U.S. lender, took in more investment-banking fees than larger rival JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) for the first time since acquiring Merrill Lynch  Co. during the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fees for debt and equity issuance, as well as advice for activities including mergers, rose 17 percent to $6.41 billion last year at Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America. That edged out New York-based JPMorgan&#8217;s $6.33 billion in such revenue for the first time since 2008. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bank of America&#8217;s investment-banking operations, run by Christian Meissner and overseen by Chief Operating Officer Thomas Montag, benefited from a record year in debt underwriting as corporations took advantage of all-time low rates for junk bonds ahead of Federal Reserve plans to withdraw stimulus. The question is whether the firm&#8217;s business can maintain its top rank when rates rise, said Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales Partners LLC in New York. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not even close to sustainable,&#8221; Peabody said in a telephone interview of the jump in fees from debt. &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t shock me if fixed-income revenues, issuance and trading, were down 20 percent in 2014. Over the course of the year, rising rates will become a dislocative factor that will cut that pipeline at some point.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, cut the portion of revenue it pays employees to the second-lowest level as a public firm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compensation for 2013, which includes salaries, benefits, bonuses and the expense of deferred pay awarded in prior years, fell 2.6 percent from 2012 to $12.6 billion, the New York-based company said today in a statement. Revenue in the same period was little changed at $34.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 59, allocated 37 percent of revenue for pay in 2013, compared with 38 percent the previous year. While the average ratio has dropped by more than 6 percentage points since 2008, compared with the five years before the financial crisis, Blankfein has said he&#8217;s wary of cutting too much and losing top performers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s always a war for talent,&#8221; Blankfein said at an investor conference in November. &#8220;We&#8217;re always under pressure for good people. I would say this isn&#8217;t the most intense period of that war that we&#8217;ve ever experienced, but it&#8217;s always there and we&#8217;re always conscious of it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related: Goldman Posts Record Underwriting Revenue as Trading Dips&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter net income fell 19 percent to $2.33 billion, or $4.60 a share, Goldman Sachs said today.

&lt;p&gt;Gaby Abdelnour, a former JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) regional chief who expanded the bank&#8217;s business in
Asia, was questioned by U.S. investigators about his knowledge
of a hiring program at the center of an international bribery
probe, a person briefed on the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abdelnour, who stepped down as head of JPMorgan&#8217;s Asia-Pacific business in 2012 and later worked as a senior adviser at
Bain Capital LLC, was met by FBI agents while traveling through
a New York-area airport late last year and then interviewed,
said the person, asking not to be named because the probe isn&#8217;t
public. Abdelnour and the bank haven&#8217;t been accused of
wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting with a former JPMorgan executive shows how a
probe of the firm&#8217;s hiring practices has escalated since the
bank said in August the Securities and Exchange Commission had
sought information on its employment of certain people in Hong
Kong and client relationships. Authorities are examining whether
JPMorgan hired people in Asia so that their relatives in
government would steer business to the firm, people with
knowledge with the investigations have said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abdelnour didn&#8217;t respond to messages left at his home in
Manhattan. Several past and present JPMorgan employees in Hong
Kong have retained attorneys, mainly paid for by the bank, one
of the people familiar with the inquiry said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) plans to invest $1.2 billion to expand its cloud services,
bolstering a business it&#8217;s counting on for growth after spending
$2 billion last year to acquire SoftLayer Technologies Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, the world&#8217;s largest provider of technology
services, plans to add 15 new data centers worldwide by the end
of 2014, said Lance Crosby, chief executive officer of
SoftLayer. IBM is winding down its separate SmartCloud
Enterprise product as early as the first quarter of this year,
except for a premium service that will be offered along with
SoftLayer&#8217;s, he said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is trying to keep up as customers shift from buying
their own computer servers to relying on the cloud, where data
and applications are delivered online instead of being stored
locally. A slump in demand for hardware has contributed to six
straight reported quarters of declining revenue, forcing the
Armonk, New York-based company to adapt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s the transformation that IBM is in right now,&#8221;
Crosby said. &#8220;That&#8217;s why we are spending the money.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new investment shows that IBM views SoftLayer as one of
its biggest bets. The price the technology giant paid to acquire
the Dallas-based company last year was the biggest it has
disclosed for a takeover since the purchase of software company
Lotus Development Corp. in 1995, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Data Centers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SoftLayer has added about 2,400 customers since the
takeover, up from about 20,000 at the time of the acquisition,
Crosby said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM didn&#8217;t specify how soon it will invest the $1.2 billion
nor how it was budgeting for the expense. The company averages
about $4 billion a year in capital expenditures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SoftLayer is becoming the backbone for IBM&#8217;s cloud
business, with related services being integrated with the
platform, Crosby said. The 15 new data centers will bring the
company&#8217;s total to 40 locations in 13 countries, IBM said today
in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is fundamental because this allows us global
coverage,&#8221; Erich Clementi, senior vice president of global
technology services, said in an interview. &#8220;We are continuing
to invest in where we think the growth areas are going to be
over the next years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Government Contracts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the centers will serve the Washington area to better
support possible government contracts, Crosby said. While IBM
won a cloud-computing contract of as much as $1 billion with the
U.S. Department of the Interior last August, the industry is
filled with new rivals eager to convert IBM&#8217;s hardware customers
into cloud users. In October, IBM abandoned a court fight over
the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency&#8217;s decision to award
Amazon.com Inc a $600 million cloud-computing contract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM clients using SmartCloud Enterprise, its previous
service, have already been switched to the newer product. Crosby
said some of the employees who worked on SmartCloud Enterprise
have moved to SoftLayer, while others have found positions
elsewhere at IBM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company declined to comment on whether any jobs were
lost due to the closing of SmartCloud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM reported more than $1 billion in sales from cloud
services last quarter, the first time it has disclosed revenue
from that segment. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
is looking into how IBM reports its revenue from the cloud
business, the company said in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Watson Division &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plans for investment in SoftLayer&#8217;s cloud platform
follows IBM&#8217;s move last week to create a new business division
around its Watson technology, which can analyze large volumes of
data and answer questions in conversational language. IBM will
invest more than $1 billion in the unit and give it its own
headquarters in New York. Watson&#8217;s big-data services, which let
customers mine vast troves of information, will be run on
SoftLayer&#8217;s cloud, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM shares climbed less than 1 percent to $190.09, the
highest since September, at the close in New York. Technology
companies in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index were little
changed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) is seeking to sell
pipeline and storage operations in Texas and Louisiana that
together may fetch more than $1 billion, people familiar with
the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron is working with Jefferies Group LLC to find buyers
for at least four natural gas and crude oil pipeline operations,
said two of the people, who asked not to be named because the
process is private. The San Ramon, California-based company
began sending out offering materials this week, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diversified energy companies have been seeking to sell or
spin off transportation and storage operations to cut costs and
focus on exploration. Chevron sold a pipeline business in the
Northwestern U.S. last year to Tesoro Logistics LP, while Royal
Dutch Shell Plc and Chesapeake Energy Corp. made similar
divestitures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron is looking to sell the West Texas LPG Pipeline LP,
a natural gas pipeline 20 percent owned by Atlas Pipeline
Partners LP, one of the people said. It&#8217;s also seeking buyers
for a gas storage facility in West Texas, a crude oil terminal
close to the Gulf of Mexico, and at least one of its pipelines
in Louisiana, this person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Spokesman Kent Robertson declined to comment on the
sale as did Jefferies spokesman Richard Khaleel. The company
plans to sell some oil and gas assets to focus on exploration
prospects in Iraq, Canada, and Australia, Chevron&#8217;s Chief
Financial Officer Pat Yarrington said in a conference call with
analysts in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron will report a fourth-quarter decline in profit amid
a slump in oil and natural gas production, according to a
statement on Jan. 9. The company, run by Chairman and Chief
Executive John S. Watson, plans to spend close to $40 billion on
new terminals and wells under a plan to boost output by 20
percent by the end of 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s shares have dropped about 4 percent this
year, giving it a market value of over $230 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sean Meeker, who departed Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. last month as the head of loan and loan credit-default swap trading, is joining Microsoft Corp. co-founder Paul Allen&#8217;s Vulcan Capital fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meeker will start Feb. 15 as a credit specialist on the
fixed-income money management team, reporting to director Ben Kolpa, the Seattle-based firm said today in an e-mailed

&lt;p&gt;Meeker, who will be based in Seattle, joined Goldman Sachs
in 2003 and was named a managing director in 2010. Fourth-quarter fixed-income, currency and commodity trading revenue was
$1.72 billion, down 15 percent from a year earlier, the New

&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s top opposition leader
Narendra Modi promised voters cheaper goods and 100 &#8220;smart
cities&#8221; in unveiling steps to boost Asia&#8217;s third-biggest
economy as he seeks to unseat the ruling Congress party. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modi&#8217;s Bharatiya Janata Party will create a stabilization
fund to combat Asia&#8217;s fastest inflation and form special courts
to try those who hoard goods, he said in New Delhi yesterday. A
Modi-led government would also improve the rail network and
power supply in the world&#8217;s second-most populous nation, he told
thousands of party workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The country has never witnessed such a debacle before,&#8221;
Modi, the chief minister of western Gujarat state, said at the
end of a three-day party meeting to devise a strategy to win
elections due by May. &#8220;The 2014 elections are not just for a
change of government, but a fresh ray of hope for Indians.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modi is seeking to harness voter anger over higher prices
of everything from onions to medicine to win power in a nation
where more than 800 million people live on less than $2 per day.
The focus on economic issues also helps draw the spotlight away
from criticism from opponents who accuse him of complicity in
2002 anti-Muslim riots in Gujarat, which killed more than 1,000
people and left Modi barred from entering the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Modi is a natural communicator, and his ability to take
the conversation forward is helping people forget about his
past,&#8221; said N. Bhaskara Rao, chairman of the New Delhi-based
Centre for Media Studies. &#8220;He&#8217;s now batting with a huge lead
and his electoral feet are firmly set.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Majority &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opinion polls show Modi&#8217;s BJP leading Prime Minister
Manmohan Singh&#8217;s Congress party, with neither winning a
majority. The emergence of the anti-graft Aam Aadmi Party, which
is planning to contest the national vote after taking power in
Delhi state last month, has added further uncertainty to the
election outcome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singh&#8217;s 10-year-old government has struggled to control
spending after implementing programs to boost rural wages and
provide cheap food, putting India at risk of a credit-rating
downgrade to so-called junk status. Modi said he planned to
establish a real-time database of agriculture goods and prices
to bring down costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ninety percent of the time, these methods of predicting
inflation don&#8217;t work because you&#8217;re tailing and can&#8217;t draw ahead
of the curve,&#8221; said Rajiv Kumar, an economist and former
secretary-general of the Federation of Indian Chambers of
Commerce and Industry. &#8220;The devil is really in the details.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Brand India&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a convention-style speech to cheering party leaders,
Modi pledged to improve education and health facilities, create
more jobs, and attract more tourists as part of building &#8220;Brand
India.&#8221; He called for more satellite cities to drive economic
growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Urbanization should not be seen as a challenge, but as an
opportunity,&#8221; Modi said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2001, when Modi took office, Gujarat&#8217;s economy has
grown 10.1 percent a year on average over the 11-year period
ended March 2012, compared with 7.6 percent nationwide,
according to the Planning Commission and data compiled by
Bloomberg. Companies such as Ford Motor Co. (F) and Reliance
Industries Ltd. announced investments in the state in that time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;ll be very, very difficult for Modi to replicate the
Gujarat model unless the BJP gets an absolute majority in the
elections,&#8221; said Satish Misra, a political analyst at the
Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi-based policy group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Sacrifice&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his speech, Modi also took swipes at Rahul Gandhi, the
Congress party&#8217;s vice president whose family has dominated
Indian politics for more than six decades. His mother Sonia
Gandhi, the party&#8217;s president, overruled other senior leaders
last week who wanted Rahul named as the party&#8217;s formal prime
minister candidate to counter Modi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When defeat is imminent, which mother will sacrifice her
son,&#8221; Modi said, referring to Sonia and Rahul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress leaders have sought to discredit Modi, with Singh
saying earlier this month that Modi &#8220;would be disastrous for
the country&#8221; and presided over a &#8220;mass massacre.&#8221; A party
resolution last week said communal forces threaten &#8220;to rupture
the very basic fabric of our nation&#8217;s unity and social
cohesion.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The riots followed the killing of Hindu activists in a
train fire, a blaze for which Muslims were later found guilty.
While human rights groups accuse Modi of failing to control
subsequent violence, he denies wrongdoing and a Supreme Court-appointed panel found no evidence that he made decisions that
prevented victims from receiving help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dynasty &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modi didn&#8217;t mention the riots and avoided statements that
would appeal to BJP stalwarts who favor a more predominate role
for Hinduism in India. Hindus make up about 80 percent of the
population, with Muslims accounting for 13 percent, according to
the CIA World Factbook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modi instead attacked India&#8217;s dynastic politics without
referring to the Gandhis by name. Rahul Gandhi&#8217;s great-grandfather, grandmother and father all served as prime
ministers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They think it is below their dignity to fight against a
person who was born in a backward class, one whose mother used
to clean dishes in the neighborhood, a person who used to sell
tea in railway compartments,&#8221; Modi said, referring to himself.
&#8220;Those having prominent surnames feel it insulting to fight
against those who are known for their work.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Corporativo ONO SA is close to
hiring banks for an initial public offering, according to two
people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Spanish cable operator may pick Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) in the coming weeks for the IPO after
inviting banks to bid for the work, the people said, asking not
to be identified before a final decision is made. Madrid-based
ONO held talks with investment banks in December and could sell
shares this year if it decides to proceed, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broadband provider could be valued at about 6.4 billion

2012 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, said Francisco Salvador, a Madrid-based strategist
at FGA/MG Valores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ONO&#8217;s Ebitda in 2012 rose 0.5 percent to 752 million euros,
a company statement showed. ONO had about 1.9 million
residential customers and 118,000 small-office and home-office
clients at the end of September. Its net debt at the time was
3.3 billion euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Apart from its big debt level, its main handicap is that
the company hasn&#8217;t been able to grow as fast as its peers while
the broadband market in Spain is becoming more and more
competitive,&#8221; Salvador said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Telefonica, Jazztel &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ONO&#8217;s 11.125 percent bonds maturing in July 2019 rose 0.9
cents on the euro this month to a record high 110.9 cents as of
5 p.m. yesterday in Madrid, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Rosalia Portela said at an industry
conference in the northern Spanish city of Santander in
September that an IPO was &#8220;a priority, our goal, and we expect
to be able to carry it out in the future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ONO has faced increasing price competition from rivals such
as Telefonica SA (TEF), Spain&#8217;s biggest phone company, and Jazztel
Plc. The company&#8217;s third-quarter Ebitda fell 9.3 percent from a
year earlier to 172 million euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among ONO&#8217;s shareholders, representatives for Thomas H. Lee
Partners, Providence Equity Partners Inc. and CCMP Capital LLC
didn&#8217;t comment. Representatives for JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank and
ONO also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been speculation that ONO may be a takeover
target for Newbury, England-based mobile-phone operator Vodafone
Group Plc (VOD) as Europe&#8217;s telecommunications industry undergoes a
wave of mergers and acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nomura Holdings Inc., the most-accurate forecaster of Bank of Korea action in the past six
months, is sticking with its outlook for interest-rate increases
after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. predicted a cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kwon Young Sun, Hong Kong-based economist at Nomura, has a
4 percent prediction for 2014 economic expansion, faster than
the central bank&#8217;s 3.8 percent, as a rebounding U.S. economy and
a stronger dollar ease pressure on exports. The gap between
three- and 10-year sovereign yields widened to a three-year high
of 79 basis points on Jan. 8 on growth optimism. The won slid
1.1 percent against the greenback this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo, set to retire on
March 31, will hand off a two-speed economy as exports boom and
household debt damps domestic demand. While political pressure
for rate cuts may intensify as President Park Geun Hye faces
municipal elections on June 4, Nomura sees few economic reasons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A solid job market, bottomed-out inflation and improved
GDP growth suggest no need to cut rates,&#8221; said Kwon, who was
the only analyst among 16 to predict the BOK would be on hold
rather than cut in September 2012. &#8220;However, if the new BOK
governor turns out to be very dovish, there is a political risk
of a rate cut even though macro situations improve,&#8221; he said in
a Jan. 17 e-mail interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Board members kept the benchmark rate unchanged at 2.5
percent on Jan. 9, citing strength in Asia&#8217;s fourth-biggest
economy. That day the central bank projected growth will
accelerate from 2.8 percent in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Political Pressure &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruling party lawmaker Chung Woo Taik urged the BOK to cut
its interest rate significantly to help the economy, Yonhap
Infomax reported on Jan. 8. Easing the pace of won gains would
be an efficient policy to protect exporters, Chung said,
according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The political pressure may intensify as the municipal
ballots are the biggest elections since Park took office in
February 2013, according to a Jan. 13 report by Woori Investment
 Securities fixed-income strategist Peter Park. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs expects a 25 basis point rate cut &#8220;in the
near term&#8221; on concern about tightening domestic financial
conditions, Seoul-based economist Kwon Goohoon wrote in a Jan. 9
report. It sees a 3.7 percent expansion in the Korean economy
this year, a Jan. 16 report showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Weaker Won &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The won weakened 0.4 percent to 1,063.60 per dollar
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield on
Korea&#8217;s three-year government bonds fell one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, this year to 2.9 percent while 10-year
rates rose eight basis points to 3.65 percent, Korea Exchange
Inc. prices show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is a bias for the dollar to rise against the
won, there is still the chance of a rate cut to revive the local
economy, Adam McCabe, who helps oversee $6 billion as deputy
head of Asian fixed income at Aberdeen Asset Management Plc in
Singapore, said in a Jan. 15 interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Korea has one of the region&#8217;s more appealing bond
markets,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There is room for the Korean central bank
to ease monetary policy if it needs to as the domestic economy
continues to disappoint.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ups and Downs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economy may not improve as projected by the central
bank, said Moon Dong Hoon, managing director in the fixed-income
division of KB Asset Management, which oversees 15 trillion won
($14.1 billion) of assets. Ups and downs in the economy may
prompt monetary authorities to lower rates, Seoul-based Moon
said in an interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Household debt rose to an all-time high of 991.7 trillion
won as of Sept. 30, central bank data showed. Sizable
liabilities and external uncertainty can be a drag on private
consumption and corporate investment, the BOK said on Jan. 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea will probably begin to raise rates in the
fourth quarter, according to the median estimate of 28
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Eight analysts from
Barclays Plc to HSBC Holdings Plc expect a 25 basis point
increase by the third quarter, while Goldman and ING Bank NV
project a cut in the first and second quarters respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exports will increase 6.4 percent this year after an
estimated 2.2 percent gain in 2013, the trade ministry said on
Jan. 1. The unemployment rate was 3 percent last month, close to
the record low of 2.9 percent in November. Producer prices fell
0.4 percent in December from a year ago, the least since
September 2012. Consumer-price inflation of 1.1 percent last
month accelerated from a 14-year low of 0.9 percent in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The underlying trend in growth and job creation is still
positive, with manufacturing, trade and commerce continuing to
add jobs in December,&#8221; said Wai Ho Leong, a Singapore-based
economist at Barclays. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) said Berlin&#8217;s
public transport provider only has itself to blame for signing
an &#8220;unfortunate&#8221; derivatives contract that led to $200 million
in losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s lawyer, Laurence Rabinowitz, told a London court
on the first day of a trial that the timing of Berliner
Verkehrsbetriebe&#8217;s 2007 credit-default swap &#8220;could hardly have
been worse&#8221; because it coincided with the start of the global
financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Rather than simply accepting that it had been
unfortunate,&#8221; Rabinowitz said today that BVG &#8220;cast around for
someone other than itself to blame.&#8221; JPMorgan sued the
transport organization to recover $204 million plus interest it
says it is owed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BVG, which has run the German capital&#8217;s trains and buses
for more than 80 years, argues it wasn&#8217;t sophisticated enough to
understand the transaction and was misled by JPMorgan and the
bank&#8217;s law firm, Clifford Chance LLP. The owner of OK! Magazine,
dentists and elderly care homes have sued lenders over the sale
of derivatives they say they didn&#8217;t need or fully comprehend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined
to comment. BVG didn&#8217;t immediately respond to e-mails seeking
comment. Anna Ward, a spokeswoman for London-based Clifford
Chance, said the law firm should never have been sued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the claims against us are misconceived and
entirely without merit and we will continue to defend our
position robustly,&#8221; Ward said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;0.19 Percent &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chance of any defaults in the underlying portfolio for
the swap were 0.19 percent when it was signed, Rabinowitz said.
One of the companies linked to the transaction was Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., which collapsed in 2008, sparking
turmoil in the markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Taking on a small risk, even vanishingly small, isn&#8217;t the
same thing as taking on no risk at all,&#8221; Rabinowitz said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps are agreements for one party to pay
another if a target goes bankrupt or fails to pay its debts. The
product can be used as a type of insurance, or to speculate on
the credit-worthiness of companies or assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan staff &#8220;shut their eyes&#8221; to the fact that BVG had
misunderstood the &#8220;complex credit derivative&#8221; it was signing,
the transport body said in legal documents. Bank employees knew
BVG had no experience in this type of transaction, and gave a
misleading presentation about its risks, according to the
documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Let Down&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;BVG was badly let down by Clifford Chance,&#8221; which had a
conflict of interest because it simultaneously advised both
JPMorgan and the BVG, the German company said in the documents.
The law firm should have turned down the work, or ceased to act,
because of the risk of a conflict of interest, BVG said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan fought for three years to have the case heard in
the U.K., with the European Court of Justice ruling in its favor
in 2011. BVG had sought a trial in Germany. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial is scheduled to last for 10 weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is: JPMorgan Chase Bank  Anr v Berliner
Verkehrsbetriebe, High Court of Justice, Queen&#8217;s Bench Division
Commercial Court: 08-1052 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) unit won
a bid to halt Singaporean wealth-management client Oei Hong Leong&#8217;s lawsuit over trading losses on the Brazilian real in
favor of private arbitration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling was made in a closed hearing today at
Singapore&#8217;s High Court. Oei&#8217;s lawyer Siraj Omar said he planned
to appeal the decision. Edward Naylor, a Hong Kong-based
spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to comment on the verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oei sued Goldman Sachs International in Singapore and the
parent company in New York, alleging the bank misled him into
trading real-yen options. He sought at least $31 million in
damages in each lawsuit. The bank has rejected allegations that
it acted improperly or cheated him, according to a letter it
wrote to Oei in July and filed in court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oei said he relied on the bank&#8217;s advice that the real was a
stable and liquid currency anchored to the U.S. dollar before
betting in May the yen would fall against the Brazilian
currency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real has fallen 12 percent since May 15 against the
yen, the second-worst performer among 16 major currencies
tracked by Bloomberg, after the South African rand. The real has
declined three straight years as widening budget deficits
threaten to trigger Brazil&#8217;s first credit-rating downgrade since
2002. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs plans to ask a U.S. judge to dismiss the
lawsuit there in favor of arbitration or move it to Singapore,
according to court papers filed in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have not brought this claim because I have lost money
in the trades,&#8221; Oei said in court papers filed in December. &#8220;I
trusted and relied on Goldman Sachs and they abused and breached
that trust.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Oei Hong Leong v Goldman Sachs International.

&lt;p&gt;When her sister graduated from
Harvard University in 1981, Kathy Matsui&#8217;s father gave her a
choice: Get accepted, or get ready for a lifetime of labor
raising roses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the farm in Salinas, California, to Harvard and
Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. in Tokyo, the family work ethic has
underpinned a career that lifted Matsui to the top of her
profession. Now, 14 years after publishing her ideas on how to
upend gender roles in the Japanese workforce under a doctrine
known as womenomics, Matsui has the ear of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who made her research into a plank of his growth plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Warmness alone doesn&#8217;t make flowers bloom,&#8221; Andy Matsui,
whose daughter later became Goldman Sachs&#8217; first female partner
in his native Japan, said in a telephone interview last month.
&#8220;You never hear a success story for a spoiled child.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kathy Matsui arrived 24 years ago at her first brokerage
job in Tokyo at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities speaking
conversational Japanese. The mother of two, now 48 and fluent,
joined Goldman Sachs as chief Japan equity strategist in 1994
and was ranked the No. 1 stock market forecaster for Japan in
2000, 2001 and 2006 by Institutional Investor magazine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matsui&#8217;s interest in gender issues was piqued by her own
climb. She published the first womenomics report in August 1999,
arguing that equalizing roles in the workforce was a better
solution to Japan&#8217;s shrinking labor pool than loosening
immigration laws or raising the birth rate. Back then, the
proportion of working-age women with jobs was 56.7 percent,
according to the Statistics Bureau. In 2012, it was 60.7
percent, a record, though still not high enough, she says. In
the U.S., 69 percent of women between 25 and 54 had jobs in
2011, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Change Needed &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s aging population and a debt burden twice as big as
its economy mean more must be done fast, according to Matsui. By
2035, one third of all Japanese will be 65 or older, up from 23
percent in 2010, according to the National Institute of
Population and Social Security Research. Japan could expand its
workforce by 8 million and increase its gross domestic product
as much as 14 percent by raising women in employment to about 80
percent, the same level as men, Matsui wrote in an April report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have to convince the Japanese people that running a
marathon with one leg is going to take a very long time,&#8221;
Matsui said in an interview last month. &#8220;It&#8217;s still an alien
concept that women might be working full-time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Work Ethic &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matsui attributes her own work ethic to growing up in
Salinas. She attended Japanese language school on Saturdays,
went to church on Sundays and cut flowers by hand after classes
the rest of the week. Her mother, Mary, toiled in the family
nursery every day and learned English at night while raising
four children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Despite wearing four layers of gloves, you still ended up
with thorns in your hands,&#8221; Kathy Matsui said. &#8220;But we got
used to it, that was our life. In my family, money didn&#8217;t just
fall from the sky.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With degrees in social studies from Harvard in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, and international affairs from Baltimore-based
Johns Hopkins University, Matsui visited Japan for the first
time in 1986 on a Rotary scholarship. She moved to Tokyo to be
with Jesper Koll, now her husband, whom she met during an
internship at Mitsui Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Vital Component&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invoking Matsui by name in a Sept. 25 essay for the Wall
Street Journal, Japan&#8217;s Abe said womenomics is a &#8220;vital
component&#8221; of his growth strategy. The premier has said he
wants a society where &#8220;women can shine&#8221; by eliminating waiting
lists for childcare and training mothers returning to work. He
has encouraged publicly-traded companies in Japan to have at
least one female executive and set a goal of women holding 30
percent of leadership positions in all areas of society by 2020,
when Tokyo hosts the summer Olympics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Since he elevated this issue and made it a core part of
his growth strategy agenda, people started waking up,&#8221; Matsui
said. &#8220;The fact that he is even mentioning it is massive
progress compared to any of his predecessors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Promoting women&#8217;s rights in Japan has long been a losing
battle. The World Economic Forum ranked the Asian nation 105th
out of 136 nations in its 2013 Global Gender Gap Report, which
measures economic, political, education and health differences
between men and women. Iceland was No. 1, followed by Finland
and Norway. The U.S. was 23rd and China 69th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Female Managers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Japan, female executives make up about 11 percent of
managerial jobs in the private sector, according to 2012 data
from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. Women are paid
about 71 percent as much as men, according to the ministry.
About 62 percent of Japanese women quit their jobs after their
first child is born, according to the IPSS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of Matsui&#8217;s friends did. She thought about what would
happen if they kept working and it prompted her to write the
first report on gender in the workplace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Very few of my Japanese clients reacted to it at the
time, though that wasn&#8217;t surprising since 99.9 percent of them
were male,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Since I had &#8217;three strikes&#8217; against me
as an inexperienced, foreign, female strategist, I knew the only
way I could succeed was to write differentiated research.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competitors noticed a report that went past stock picking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The female labor participation had risen in the 1990s,
but I found it interesting how she shed light on it,&#8221; said
Chisato Haganuma, chief equity strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ
Morgan Stanley Securities Co., who has been Matsui&#8217;s competitor
for about 20 years. &#8220;It was a very good report and strategy in
that it highlighted a change in our society rather than just
talking about which stocks would rise and fall.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stock-Picking &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a study released on Oct. 1, 2010, Matsui listed 44
public companies in industries from daycare to nursing and food
preparation that she said reflected women&#8217;s values. They rose 86
percent through Dec. 27, compared with a 55 percent increase for
the Topix index, according to Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her broader forecasts for Japanese equities have usually
been bullish, a stance that paid off last year when the Nikkei
225 Stock Average (NKY) beat every developed-market index. In
November, she raised her 12-month projection for the Topix to
1,450, about 11 percent higher than the gauge&#8217;s 2013 close and a
level unseen since 2007. The measure rose 0.2 percent to
1,295.95 yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logic, intuition and contacts inform the calls, said Hiromi
Suzuki, a Tokyo-based analyst at Goldman Sachs who has worked
with Matsui since 1994, when they started the firm&#8217;s strategy
team for Japanese stocks. She described Matsui, who was named
managing director in 1998 and partner in 2000, as a serious,
energetic and honest person who doesn&#8217;t micromanage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Long Hours &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;She&#8217;s tough mentally and physically and sticks to her
schedule,&#8221; Suzuki said in an interview on Jan. 10. &#8220;She always
tries her best to fulfill what she intends to do. Even if she
has five minutes to the deadline, she focuses on what she can do
within that time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nanny has enabled Matsui to work long hours and travel,
while her husband, Koll, runs Japanese equity research at
JPMorgan Securities Japan Co. The biggest challenge came in
2001, after her second child was born, when she was diagnosed
with breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Just when I thought nothing could go wrong, everything
went wrong,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You just don&#8217;t know what twists and
turns life brings. I was naturally shocked when I received my
diagnosis, but facing my mortality at the age of 36 was actually
a giant wake-up call.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She took eight months off to recuperate in California with
her parents and received chemotherapy. She returned to Goldman
Sachs wearing a wig, deciding that staying at home all the time
would be more stressful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Demonstrating Womenomics&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I saw how hard she worked when she faced difficulties and
I learned what it&#8217;s like to be a strategist,&#8221; said Naoki Kamiyama, who worked for Matsui from 2000 to 2002 and is now
chief equity strategist at Merrill Lynch Japan Securities Co.
&#8220;In a way, she&#8217;s demonstrating womenomics by herself. It&#8217;s
perfectionism. She embodies it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matsui&#8217;s travel usually keeps her away from her family for
two to three months a year, triggering &#8220;maternal guilt,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;While it may be a sign that you&#8217;re really busy, I always
feel guilty about spending so much time away from my husband and
children.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yoga at 8 a.m. on Saturdays helps her body, and Nutella, a
Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, warms her spirit. When times are
toughest, though, Matsui said she thinks about her mother. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) will join Royal
Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce leading
the debt sale to finance a C$8.5 billion Alberta oil refinery
that has the backing of the provincial government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks will work as joint-lead underwriters for bonds to
finance the Sturgeon upgrader and refinery in Redwater, Alberta,
Ian MacGregor, chairman of North West Upgrading Inc., one of the
partners in the joint venture, said through spokeswoman Shauna
MacDonald. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project is expected to be 80 percent financed by debt
with the rest coming from equity, so long as the project
maintains an investment grade credit rating, North West said in
a Dec. 4 statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has incurred C$1.5 billion of the project&#8217;s
cost and the Alberta government and the other partner in the
venture, Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ), have committed to
further financing through the purchase of C$600 million of
subordinated debt, North West said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alberta&#8217;s government, which has the top AAA rating from
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, Standard  Poor&#8217;s and DBRS,
has agreed to pay down three-quarters of the debt over 30 years
through the processing fees it will pay the refinery to process
the bitumen the government already receives as royalties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government is expected to supply 75 percent of the
bitumen to the project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project is expected to commence operations in September
2017, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toronto-Dominion Bank won top spot among underwriters of
Canadian government debt last year after it managed the sale of
the largest provincial bond ever: C$5 billion of debt to fund a
hydroelectric project in Newfoundland and Labrador, which itself
won a loan guarantee from the federal government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBC was the top underwriter of corporate debt in Canada
last year with CIBC coming in third and JPMorgan in 16th place,
according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abu Dhabi will pay Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)
and Inpex Corp. more to pump oil at the largest field off the
emirate&#8217;s coast as it extends a contract with the companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon and Japan&#8217;s Inpex lengthened their deal for the Upper
Zakum field in the Persian Gulf by 15 years through 2041, the
Asian company said today in a statement, without giving further
terms. The companies may get about $2.85 a barrel, up from $1 a
barrel, International Oil Daily reported, without citing anyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They sought better terms to help pay for artificial islands
to support drilling equipment as output capacity of Murban-grade
crude rises to 750,000 barrels a day by 2017 from about 600,000
barrels now, Ali Hassan Al-Marzooqi, a senior vice president at
the field&#8217;s operating unit, said yesterday. Output may expand to
1 million barrels a day by 2024, he said. Inpex said the joint
venture operating at Upper Zakum is considering the plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon confirmed that the extension was approved by the
Supreme Petroleum Council, Abu Dhabi&#8217;s top oil policy body. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon and Inpex are also among 11 U.S., European and Asian
operators bidding at Abu Dhabi&#8217;s largest onshore concession. Abu
Dhabi National Oil Co. began running the fields producing about
1.5 million barrels a day of Murban-grade crude on its own after
a 75-year concession with its partners ended this month,
Director General Abdulla Nasser Al Suwaidi said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seeking Investors &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates, is seeking
investors to help it boost capacity to 3.5 million barrels of
crude a day by 2017 from about 3 million now. The U.A.E. was the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries&#8217; fourth-largest
producer in the last month, figures compiled by Bloomberg show.
Partners in Abu Dhabi&#8217;s oil fields also receive allocations of
crude equal to the proportion of their holding in the deposit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adnoc, as Abu Dhabi National Oil is known, holds 60 percent
of the Upper Zakum venture, Inpex 12 percent and Exxon the rest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Dhabi Marine Operating Co., another state-led venture
operating a collection of fields, plans to boost production
capacity to as much as 800,000 barrels a day in 2017 from
620,000 barrels now, before expanding to 1 million barrels in
2020, Chief Executive Officer Ali Al-Jarwan said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) quit working on
Tianhe Chemicals Group&#8217;s planned $1 billion initial public
offering in Hong Kong amid a U.S. probe into hiring practices,
two people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank gave up the mandate as questions arose over
Joyce Wei, a former employee, whose father is Tianhe Chemicals
Chairman Qi Wei, the people said, asking not to be identified
because the information is private. UBS AG (UBSN), which is also
advising on the IPO, hired Wei toward the end of last year, two
people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. authorities are examining whether New York-based
JPMorgan hired people in Asia so that their relatives in
government would steer business to the firm, people with
knowledge with the investigations have said. Gaby Abdelnour,
former head of the bank&#8217;s Asia-Pacific business, was questioned
by U.S. investigators about his knowledge of the hiring
practices, a person briefed on the matter said last week.
Abdelnour and the bank haven&#8217;t been accused of wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investment banks are super cautious at the moment,&#8221;
Philippe Espinasse, a former head of equity capital markets for
Asia at Nomura Holdings Inc. and author of &#8220;IPO: a Global
Guide,&#8221; said by phone from Hong Kong today. &#8220;They might have
quite a bit to lose by staying on the deal if there were a
direct link between the company&#8217;s senior management and someone
they employ.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase 
Co. are among the banks shortlisted to help India sell part of
its stake in Axis Bank Ltd. (AXSB), four people with knowledge of the
matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JM Financial Ltd. (JM) was also among the preferred investment
banks that may be hired to manage the share sale of the
country&#8217;s third-largest private-sector lender by assets, said
the people, asking not to be identified before a public
announcement. The government will sell about half of its 20.7
percent stake in the bank, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale valued at 57 billion rupees ($927 million) is part
of India&#8217;s efforts to narrow its budget gap and prevent a
sovereign credit-rating downgrade to so-called junk status.
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh&#8217;s government has raised 13 percent
of the targeted 400 billion rupees it planned to raise by March
31, according to the Disinvestment Department&#8217;s data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks will get a fee of one rupee for managing the
issue while the expenses will be paid by the government, the
people said. The share sale will probably happen before mid-February, two people said. Finance ministry spokesman D.S. Malik
wasn&#8217;t available for comment when called in his office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India Economic Affairs Secretary Arvind Mayaram said in
December the government is considering selling its stake in Axis
Bank, which is held by the Specified Undertaking of the Unit
Trust of India, or SUUTI, a state-run asset manager that also
owns stakes in Larsen  Toubro Ltd. and ITC Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government plans to sell its 171.9-billion rupee stake
in billionaire Anil Agarwal-owned Hindustan Zinc Ltd., according
to Commerce Minister Anand Sharma. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nickel, the best-performing
industrial metal this year, may extend its rally as Indonesia&#8217;s
ban on unprocessed ore exports crimps supply, according to
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman raised its 12-month price target on the metal used
in stainless steel to $16,000 a metric ton from $15,000,
analysts including Christian Lelong said in a report today. That
would mean a 10 percent gain from now. Goldman also listed zinc
and palladium among its top picks on tightening supplies, while
iron ore and copper have &#8220;the greatest downside&#8221; risks, it
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nickel climbed 4.8 percent this year, the most among the
six major metals on the London Metal Exchange as Indonesia
restricted shipments starting Jan. 12. The global nickel market
may swing into a deficit next year, Barclays Plc and Macquarie
Group Ltd. estimate, while Citigroup Inc. forecasts the price at
$17,000 a ton this quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are increasingly bullish on nickel on a 12-month
horizon,&#8221; Lelong and other analysts said in the report. &#8220;The
marginal cost of nickel supply will rise sharply as a result of
the recent ban on unprocessed ore exports from Indonesia, with
the potential for a shortage of nickel ore in late 2014.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s base case scenario is for a balanced nickel
market in 2014 and a moderate deficit in 2015, which assumes
some relaxation of the export ban by Indonesia, the top producer
of mined nickel. Prices will &#8220;substantially overshoot&#8221; the
bank&#8217;s projections if the country doesn&#8217;t relax the ban,
according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nickel for delivery in three months on the LME touched
$14,750 a ton on Jan. 17, the highest since Oct. 30, and traded
at $14,560 a ton at 1:33 p.m. in Hong Kong. Copper was little
changed at $7,318 a ton and is down 0.6 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron ore and copper may decline 21 percent and 15 percent,
respectively, amid forecast surpluses this year, according to
the bank&#8217;s report. Its 12-month estimate for copper was
unchanged $6,200 a ton, it said. The outlook for the next 12
months for zinc was also remained the same at $2,100 a ton. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When SurveyMonkey Inc. Chief Executive Officer Dave Goldberg wanted to buy out investors from his Internet company and attract new ones who wouldn&#8217;t balk at his aim to stay private, he steered clear of traditional startup financiers in the venture-capital community. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead, Goldberg turned to an entirely different adviser: JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jimmy Lee, vice chairman of the investment bank who normally works on multibillion dollar deals, traveled from New York to SurveyMonkey&#8217;s headquarters in Palo Alto, California, to brainstorm Goldberg&#8217;s options. Goldberg later hired JPMorgan to lead a $350 million syndicated loan for the online survey provider as part of an $800 million recapitalization the closely held company completed last year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Considering what a small company we are, SurveyMonkey isn&#8217;t something Jimmy would usually spend time on,&#8221; Goldberg, who is married to Facebook Inc. (FB) Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, said in an interview. The recapitalization, which also involved selling $444 million in equity to Goldberg, Tiger Global Management LLC and Google Inc. (GOOG), valued SurveyMonkey at $1.35 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wall Street investment banks -- from JPMorgan to Bank of America Corp. and Credit Suisse Group AG (CS) -- are increasingly catering to closely held technology startups, especially in Silicon Valley. While firms led by Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) have long cultivated relationships with venture capitalists and entrepreneurs to later earn fees managing initial public offerings and advising on acquisitions, many banks have expanded the roster of services in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s co-head
of investment banking in Brazil, Fabio Bicudo, will leave the
company 10 months after taking the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs confirmed his departure yesterday in an e-mailed statement. The firm declined to say whether it will
replace Bicudo, who has led Brazil investment banking since
March with co-head Antonio Pereira. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bicudo said in a separate statement he had been invited to
lead a Brazilian company he declined to name. Reuters reported
that Bicudo will become chief executive officer of Eneva SA, the
utility controlled by EON SE and former billionaire Eike
Batista, citing a person familiar with the matter. Eneva
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least nine managing directors in Brazil left Goldman
Sachs during 2013 after the bank halted its growth plans when
the economy expanded less than analysts estimated. Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s revenue from investment banking had been falling in
Brazil while trading and wealth-management fees increased,
people familiar with the matter said last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a quarter of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s roughly 45-person Brazil
investment-banking division have departed, four people with
knowledge of the moves said in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our headcount in Brazil is going to be steady at around
300 people, though it may go up 5 percent or down 5 percent,&#8221;
Stephen Scherr, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s chief for Latin America and
global head of the investment bank&#8217;s financing group, said in an
interview in New York in October. &#8220;The composition of the
people is going to change -- and that is by design,&#8221; Scherr
said, declining to comment on specific departures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bicudo and Pereira were named co-heads of investment
banking for the country after Daniel Wainstein, one of only two
Goldman Sachs partners who are Brazilian, left the company in
June after 13 years. Wainstein joined New York-based Greenhill 
Co. in October. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM)&#8217;s server business is dragging down sales and profits,
hurting the division&#8217;s value just as Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) is said
to be considering an acquisition of the asset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s revenue declined for a seventh straight quarter amid
plunging demand for its x86 servers. The slump weighed on the
hardware unit, where profit slid $750 million in the fourth
quarter from a year earlier because of &#8220;business model issues
due to market shifts,&#8221; Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter
said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenovo, the world&#8217;s largest maker of personal computers,
has resumed talks to acquire the x86 unit, a person with direct
knowledge of the matter said this week. Discussions with Armonk,
New York-based IBM had broken up in May over the price of the
asset, then valued at $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion, and the
unit&#8217;s performance has continued to decline since. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This will increase Lenovo&#8217;s negotiation power over the
price,&#8221; Jun Zhang, an analyst with Wedge Partners Corp., said
in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s x86 servers, which are named for a chip design used
by Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., have become a
commodity item amid increasing competition with companies such
as Hewlett-Packard Co. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most U.S. stocks rose as investors assessed earnings from companies including Norfolk Southern Corp., Coach (COH) Inc., International Business Machines Corp. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Norfolk Southern, the second-largest U.S. eastern railroad, climbed 4.8 percent after posting a fourth-quarter profit that exceeded analysts&#8217; estimates. BlackBerry Ltd. rose 8.6 percent as the smartphone maker said it plans to sell most of its Canadian real estate to raise cash for its turnaround plan. Coach, the largest U.S. luxury handbag maker, slumped 6 percent after sales missed analysts&#8217; estimates. IBM slid 3.3 percent as revenue declined for a seventh consecutive quarter amid weaker demand for servers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Three stocks rose for every two that declined in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. (SPX) The U.S. equity benchmark added less than 0.1 percent to 1,844.86 at 4 p.m. in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 41.10 points, or 0.3 percent, to 16,373.34 for a second day of declines. About 6.3 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, 3 percent above the three-month average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Earnings are all that matters,&#8221; Dan Morris, who helps oversee about $564 billion as global investment strategist at TIAA-CREF Asset Management in New York, said in a phone interview. &#8220;To see the justification for meaningful higher prices, we just need to wait for earnings to catch up and accelerate a bit and that may take a quarter or two.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Quarterly Results &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Twenty-five companies in the SP 500 including Northern Trust Corp., Netflix Inc. and EBay Inc. report earnings today. Of the 86 index members that have posted results so far this season, 70 percent have beaten estimates for profit and 65 percent have exceeded sales projections, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Per-share profit for companies in the benchmark probably climbed 6 percent in the fourth quarter, while sales increased 2.2 percent, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A five-year rally that lifted the SP 500 up more than 170 percent from a bear-market low has boosted equity valuations to near the highest level since 2009. The index trades at 15.6 times the estimated earnings of its members, more than the five-year average multiple of 14.1, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Mixed Earnings &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Dow is diverging from the SP 500 by the most in more than two years amid weaker results from companies such as Johnson  Johnson and IBM. The average difference between their performance in the past three days has been 0.5 percentage point, the most since October 2011. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Earnings have been mixed,&#8221; David Chalupnik, head of equities at Nuveen Asset Management in Minneapolis, said in a phone interview. His firm manages about $120 billion. &#8220;If we as a country, we as a world, stay in the muted economic growth we&#8217;ve experienced in the past two years, the market probably can&#8217;t support the valuations here. We need better economic numbers and we need earnings to follow that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Traders are buying record amounts of options that pay off if the calm that is blanketing markets proves temporary. Outstanding call options on the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX) has reached a record 8.4 million, exceeding the previous high of 7.7 million in March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The contracts, which expire today, are used by investors as insurance against losses because the VIX usually climbs when equities fall. Investors are positioning for stock swings with more than 180 companies in the SP 500 getting ready to release quarterly results by the end of next week. The VIX slid 0.2 percent today to 12.84, bringing its decline for 2014 to 6.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Norfolk Southern &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Energy, consumer-discretionary and industrial stocks rose the most among 10 main industries in the SP 500, climbing more than 0.2 percent. Telephone and raw-materials companies dropped at least 0.7 percent for the worst performance. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Norfolk Southern jumped 4.8 percent to $92.94. The company&#8217;s profit exceeded analysts&#8217; forecast amid higher shipments of chemicals, automotive and agricultural products. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;BlackBerry rose 8.6 percent to $10.78. The company said in a statement that it will work with CBRE Group Inc. to sell vacant properties as well as occupied space it will then lease back from the new owners. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Textron (TXT) Inc. advanced 5.3 percent to $38. The manufacturer of Cessna aircraft said it earned 60 cents a share in the fourth quarter. That beat the average analyst estimate by 1 cent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brinker International Inc. (EAT), which owns Chili&#8217;s Grill  Bar restaurants, climbed 6.5 percent to $49.72. The restaurant chain reported second-quarter profit and sales above analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Nuance, Coach &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nuance Communications Inc. jumped 7.8 percent to $16.05. The provider of voice applications to corporate customers said first-quarter preliminary adjusted earnings per share probably amounted to 23 cents to 24 cents, more than the 20-cent average estimate of analysts. The company predicted profit of 18 cents to 21 cents a share in November. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Coach slid 6 percent to $49.38. Revenue for the quarter through Dec. 28 amounted to $1.42 billion, missing the average analyst estimate of $1.48 billion. The maker of luxury accessories posted earnings per share of $1.06, falling short of the $1.11 that analysts had projected. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;IBM, Motorola &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM (IBM) dropped 3.3 percent to $182.25 for the biggest retreat in the Dow. The world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider said revenue declined to $27.7 billion in the three months through December. Profit dropped at the company&#8217;s hardware unit partly because of its x86 server business, according to Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) slumped 12 percent to $3.67 for the biggest drop since October. The maker of processors for personal computers predicted that revenue will be from $1.29 billion to $1.38 billion in the first quarter. The average analyst projection had called for sales of $1.37 billion, according to a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Motorola Solutions Inc. fell 3.9 percent to $64.51. The mobile communications company forecast first-quarter profit below analyst estimates and said it expects sales to decline between 4 percent and 6 percent. Analysts were predicting a 2 percent revenue gain. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Lu Wang in New York at lwang8@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Lynn Thomasson at lthomasson@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Libyan Investment Authority, the north African nation&#8217;s sovereign wealth fund, sued Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) in the U.K. over investments worth more than $1 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman Sachs abused the relationship of trust and confidence with the then newly-formed LIA, being the sovereign wealth fund of the Libyan people,&#8221; a spokesman for the fund, who declined to give his name in line with company policy, said in an e-mailed statement today. The fund suffered &#8220;significant losses.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Libya&#8217;s sovereign wealth fund built up assets of about $60 billion under Muammar Qaddafi, who was deposed and killed in a 2011 coup. The LIA lost about $1.75 billion betting on structured products in 2007 and 2008, about $900 million of which was with Goldman Sachs, its former chairman said in June 2012. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Opinion: What Was Goldman Sachs Doing With Libya's Options Bets?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The details of the lawsuit, filed Jan. 21 at London&#8217;s High Court, aren&#8217;t yet public. Fiona Laffan, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is probing Goldman Sachs&#8217;s dealings with the LIA for possible violations of American anti-corruption laws. The fund has said it is cooperating with the authority. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fund Size &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Libya has the second-largest sovereign wealth fund in Africa with about $65 billion, according to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, and the 20th largest in the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mohsen Derregia, the fund&#8217;s former chairman, said in March of last year it had demanded an explanation from Societe Generale SA (GLE) on how derivative contracts lost about $1 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Losses between 15 and 16 percent are considered acceptable, but our shares devalued by up to 80 percent,&#8221; he said in an interview. &#8220;We want to know what happened.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The case is: The Libyan Investment Authority v.

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is paying a
lower relative cost to borrow than before the financial crisis
even after ceding more than a year&#8217;s profit to settle disputes
linked to faulty mortgages and Bernard Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. bank borrowed $5.25 billion yesterday in
an offering that included 10-year securities yielding 1.125
percentage points more than Treasuries, the narrowest spread
among similar JPMorgan notes since 2005. The measure, used to
gauge creditworthiness, has contracted from 1.33 points a year
ago and is the tightest among similar-maturity bonds of Wall
Street competitors including Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They still command some of the best rates among the big
universal banks, by all means,&#8221; Chris Baker, a credit analyst
at Morningstar Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s after spending more than $23 billion on legal
settlements in 2013, which helped end a three-year streak of
record annual earnings even as it led the world in corporate-bond underwriting for the sixth straight year. While litigation
expenses may remain elevated in 2014, JPMorgan&#8217;s earnings power
means any legal issues should be manageable, according to
Standard  Poor&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurs from Silicon Valley to Wall Street say they don&#8217;t care much for Bitcoin as a currency to supplant the U.S. dollar. As a payment technology they could use to undercut Visa Inc. (V), Western Union Co. (WU) or Citigroup Inc. (C), they say they like it a lot more. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As Bitcoin&#8217;s value gyrates, these investors have said that the headlines about its price and chatter about which retailers accept it obscure the real merit of what Satoshi Nakamoto, the name given to the anonymous person or people who created Bitcoin, delivered five years ago. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;At some point, I had an &#8216;aha!&#8217; moment and realized that Bitcoin was best understood as a new software protocol through which you could rebuild the payments industry in ways that are better and cheaper,&#8221; Chris Dixon, a partner at Menlo Park, California-based venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, wrote in a blog post. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is Bitcoin Real Money?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin enthusiasts say they are building a system to move money across the Internet securely and at a lower cost than existing wire transfers, bank debits or remittances. If they can eliminate the friction created by middlemen and create easy-to-use consumer tools, Bitcoin businesses may claim a piece of the revenue and still deliver lower costs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s solar
venture and U.S.-based First Solar Inc. (FSLR) bid for projects in
India for the first time, enticed by government grants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ReNew Solar Power Ltd. bid for 50 megawatts, according to a
list from state-run Solar Energy Corporation of India. The
company is a unit of ReNew Power Ventures Pvt., a developer
backed by a $385 million investment from Goldman Sachs, Sumant
Sinha, chief executive officer of ReNew Power, said by e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Solar, the world&#8217;s biggest maker of thin-film modules
and a top panel supplier in India, bid for 30 megawatts. The
Tempe, Arizona-based company is diversifying into building
plants and selling power, betting that&#8217;s a better way to make
money than competing with Chinese rivals on panel sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tender is the most attractive yet in a market expected
to draw $11.7 billion of investment by 2017 as the cost of solar
power drops to equal that of other sources, according to
Bloomberg New Energy Finance. For the first time, India is
offering grants that will improve plants&#8217; revenue security by
allowing them to produce power more cheaply rather than relying
on cash-strapped state utilities to pay above-market tariffs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World Bank-backed Azure Power India Pvt. and Welspun Energy
Ltd., a unit of Leon Black&#8217;s Apollo Global Management LLC-backed
Welspun Group, entered bids for the most capacity, 200 megawatts
and 160 megawatts respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solar Energy Corp. will evaluate technical bids first and
open the financial offers by the end of February, Managing
Director Rajendra Nimje said this week. Previous tenders in the
country drove rates for solar power down to record lows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Bidding will be more rational this time,&#8221; as a recovery
in panel prices from a three-year slide and the rupee&#8217;s
volatility raise project costs, Gaurav Sood, managing director
of French developer Solairedirect SA&#8217;s local unit, said in an e-mail. Solairedirect, which bid for 30 megawatts of capacity, won
a project with a record-low bid in a December 2011 auction after
pledging to sell solar power 30 percent cheaper than the world
average at the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) employees
discussed why they shouldn&#8217;t reveal to their client, Berlin&#8217;s
transport authority, what the bank stood to gain from a complex
derivative deal that&#8217;s now at the center of a U.K. court case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phone transcripts cited by Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe in a
London trial show JPMorgan staff referring to Matthias Meier, an
employee in the German company&#8217;s finance department, before the
2007 transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to show to Meier that we are making so much
money on it right?&#8221; Johannes Banner, a JPMorgan salesman, asked
a colleague in 2006, according to BVG&#8217;s court documents. Another
banker called Meier a &#8220;pain in the a--e&#8221; and said they should
&#8220;sting&#8221; him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan sued the firm, which operates Berlin&#8217;s trains and
buses, in 2008 for about $200 million it says it&#8217;s owed from the
credit-default swap transaction. The lender argues BVG was only
a victim of bad luck and the deal turned costly because of
unprecedented events in financial markets during 2008. The case
went to trial in London this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim Lord, a lawyer for BVG, told the court yesterday the
transport authority had never properly understood the so-called
&#8220;synthetic, single-tranche collateralized debt obligation&#8221; and
was misled by JPMorgan and its lawyers at Clifford Chance LLP. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MGM China Holdings Ltd. (2282) fell the
most in seven months, leading declines among Macau casinos after
JPMorgan Chase  Co. cut its rating to neutral and recommended
investors trim holdings of rival operators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operator controlled by MGM Resorts International (MGM)
declined 6.6 percent, the most since June 11, to HK$32.65 at the
close in Hong Kong trading. Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. fell
5.5 percent to HK$76.95. Sands China Ltd. (1928) and SJM Holdings Ltd. (880)
dropped 4.1 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the sector is at risk of entering a period
where there is more room for downside rather than upside
surprise,&#8221; Kenneth Fong, a Hong Kong-based analyst at JP
Morgan, wrote in a research note published today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market has already priced in a &#8220;significant growth&#8221;
assumption from the future projects while insufficient labor and
gaming-table allocations may add risks, he said. The bank
expects the industry&#8217;s revenue growth to slow to 17 percent this
year, according to the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casino revenue in Macau, the only place in China where
casino gambling is legal, rose 19 percent to $45.2 billion last
year, about seven times that of the Las Vegas Strip. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. quit working on Tianhe Chemicals
Group&#8217;s planned $1 billion initial public offering in Hong Kong
amid a U.S. probe into hiring practices, two people with
knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank stepped out as questions arose over Joyce
Wei, a former employee, whose father is Tianhe Chemicals
Chairman Qi Wei, the people said, asking not to be identified
because the information is private. UBS AG (UBSN), which is also
advising on the IPO, hired Wei toward the end of last year, two
people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. authorities are examining whether JPMorgan hired
people in Asia so that their relatives in government would steer
business to the firm, people with knowledge with the
investigations have said. The bank hasn&#8217;t been accused of
wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives of JPMorgan and UBS declined to comment.

&lt;p&gt;Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told McGraw
Hill Financial Inc. (MHFI) Chairman Harold W. McGraw III in an Aug. 8,
2011 phone call that Standard  Poor&#8217;s downgrade of the U.S.
debt would be met by a response and that the company would be
held accountable, SP said in a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McGraw said the call occurred after SP was the only credit
ratings company to downgrade the U.S. debt. The company claims
the government sued in retaliation for the downgrade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government officials have said the downgrade was based on
an error by SP. The Justice Department last year accused SP of
lying about its ratings being free of conflicts of interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney&#8217;s office in
Los Angeles, which brought the lawsuit, declined to comment on
the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Department officials have previously said the
lawsuit was unrelated to the downgrade. &lt;/p&gt;

Banking Authority that would create widespread waivers to the
curbs, a European Parliament lawmaker said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU assembly last year clinched a deal on rules
curtailing the bonus culture that lawmakers blamed for fueling
the 2008 financial crisis. At least three parliament members
have vowed to fight to keep the EBA from weakening the rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a proposal is issued, lawmakers will have an objection
period before it can become law. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn&#8217;t long after Ericsson AB Chief Executive Officer Hans Vestberg was identified as a contender for the top job at Microsoft Corp. before phones were ringing off the hook at the telecom supplier&#8217;s Stockholm offices. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Jan. 15 revelation was the main topic in at least one hastily convened meeting the next morning, according to a person who attended and isn&#8217;t allowed to speak publicly on the matter. A Stockholm-based senior engineer said he scanned headlines first thing that day and was shocked by the news, even as he took pride in the prospect of Vestberg running Microsoft. The candidacy is likely to be discussed at an Ericsson board meeting before the end of the month, another person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vestberg joins a growing list of executives whose staff were jolted by news that their boss is being wooed by another company -- in this case, to succeed Microsoft&#8217;s Steve Ballmer. Alan Mulally of Ford Motor Co. and EBay Inc.&#8217;s John Donahoe have also been tipped for the job in recent months. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Such exposure can cause frustration in the executive suite and confusion in employee ranks, diverting energy from the day-to-day execution of business. It might result in infighting among deputies seeking to fill a void left by the departing or distracted executive. To board members, it can also seem like their CEO has been double-dealing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Westpac
Banking Corp. pushed back their forecasts for when Australia&#8217;s
central bank will lower interest rates, with the strongest
inflation in two years offsetting rising joblessness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They join Bank of America Corp. and Royal Bank of Canada,
which shifted their predictions in the past three months. The
estimates for delayed easing come as reports paint a mixed
picture of the economy&#8217;s transition to new growth sources amid
the ebbing of a mining boom. Having priced in a 26 percent
chance of a first-quarter rate cut after the weak jobs report on
Jan. 16, swaps traders slashed the odds to 11 percent after Jan.
22 data showed inflation was accelerating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are some fundamental problems in the economy,&#8221;
said Stephen Walters, JPMorgan&#8217;s chief economist in Australia,
citing below-trend growth and rising unemployment in a phone
interview yesterday. &#8220;Yet, an inflation number like that makes
it difficult for the Reserve Bank to do anything about those
issues in the near term.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A report this week showed the trimmed mean gauge of core
prices unexpectedly rose 2.6 percent in the last three months of
2013 from a year earlier, climbing above the mid-point of the
central bank&#8217;s target range and the strongest reading since
2011. That followed data showing the worst annual drop in full-time jobs in more than two decades. Australia&#8217;s Treasury
predicts the unemployment rate will increase to 6 percent by
July 1, the highest since 2003, from 5.8 percent in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pickup in the pace of consumer-price gains is &#8220;almost
exclusively&#8221; due to a decline in the Australian dollar last
year, Bill Evans, chief economist at Westpac, wrote in an e-mailed report yesterday. The acceleration will prove short-lived
and policy rates will be cut once the data confirms this
outlook, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Secondary Impact&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Weakness in domestic demand will contain the secondary
impact on inflation from the weaker currency,&#8221; Evans wrote.
&#8220;The Reserve Bank is likely to require convincing evidence of
our assessment of inflation risks before it opts for lower
interest rates.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia&#8217;s cash rate stands at a record-low 2.5 percent.
Westpac now sees it at 2 percent by the end of 2014, after two
0.25 percentage point reductions in the second half. That
compares with a previous call for cuts in the second and third
quarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America said in a Jan. 10 note that the RBA will
trim its benchmark to 2.25 percent by mid-year, from an earlier
prediction for February. RBC pushed its call for a quarter-point
cut to the three months through June, from December 2013
previously, according to an Oct. 14 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The median forecast of 29 economists is for the cash rate
to remain unchanged through 2014, according to a Bloomberg News
survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lower Aussie &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Australian dollar fell 0.2 percent this week to 87.68
U.S. cents as of 9 a.m. in Sydney and yesterday touched 87.32,
the lowest level since July 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further declines may be limited by prospects inflation
pressures will keep the central bank from lowering its key rate
further after slashing it 2.25 percentage points over two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RBA has indicated it would prefer a lower exchange rate
to stimulate the economy. Governor Glenn Stevens said last month
in an Australian Financial Review interview that a level of 85
U.S. cents would be &#8220;closer to the mark.&#8221; The Aussie won&#8217;t
fall to that level until the final quarter of this year,
according to the median of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Policy makers will probably keep trying to verbally drive
the local currency lower, according to JPMorgan&#8217;s Walters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, &#8220;it&#8217;s very difficult, seemingly, for the Aussie
to break meaningfully to the downside,&#8221; said Walters, who sees
the currency at 87 by Dec. 31. &#8220;The onus is going to be on the
cash rate to do the work.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) agreed to sell its low-end server business for $2.3 billion to Lenovo Group Ltd. (992), decreasing its reliance on computer hardware as sales of the products plunge. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The deal price includes about $2 billion of cash, with the rest coming in shares of Beijing-based Lenovo, the two companies said today in a statement today. The transaction now faces regulatory scrutiny, including a likely national-security review that could slow or scuttle the purchase. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related: IBM Predicts Success in U.S. Review of Levono Deal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM reported its seventh straight quarter of declining revenue this week, hurt by a shrinking computer-hardware business. While the company will continue to sell a range of higher-end servers and mainframes, offloading the x86 division removes a low-margin business from its books. Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty is focusing more on software and services in a bid to reignite sales and meet an ambitious goal of $20 a share in earnings by next year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We were no longer in a position to get the kinds of returns that we wanted,&#8221; Steve Mills, senior vice president of software and systems at Armonk, New York-based IBM, said in an interview. &#8220;We wouldn&#8217;t do this if we didn&#8217;t see the obvious taking place in the market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Share Slide &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s announcement followed on-again, off-again negotiations between the two sides. Talks had broken down last year over the price of the asset, then valued at $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion. The negotiations resumed in November, according to Lenovo Chief Financial Officer Wong Wai Ming. Lenovo disclosed earlier this week that it was in preliminary discussions about an unnamed acquisition, spurring speculation that the agreement was finally close to being reached. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM shares gained less than 1 percent to $182.73 at the close in New York. The hardware slump has taken a toll on the stock over the past year: It slid 2.1 percent in 2013, making IBM the only decliner in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Trading of Lenovo&#8217;s shares, meanwhile, was halted today because of the agreement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As part of the deal, Lenovo will get IBM servers that use x86 processors, an industry-standard technology developed by Intel Corp. The transaction also includes BladeCenter and Flex System blade-style servers -- slim devices that slide into racks -- along with switches that run corporate computer networks. IBM will keep its System z mainframes, Power servers, storage systems and other higher-end hardware. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The x86 division&#8217;s more than 7,000 employees are expected to move to Lenovo, Mills said. He declined to comment on whether there would be job cuts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Value Versus Volume &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The idea is to stick to products where IBM can add value. The x86 server business has become an industry of large volumes and slim margins -- where one competitor&#8217;s products are hard to distinguish from another&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Value is something that we are very good at selling,&#8221; Mills said. &#8220;Volume is a challenge.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Revenue at IBM&#8217;s systems and technology business, which sells mainframes, servers and other hardware, declined 26 percent last quarter. The segment&#8217;s gross margin -- the percentage of sales remaining after taking out production costs -- also is getting squeezed. It fell 3.5 percentage points to 36 percent last year. That compares with an 89 percent margin for its software business. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;They continue to divest their lower-margin hardware business line and this is just continuing down that path,&#8221; Brian Marshall, an analyst at ISI Group in New York, said in an interview. He has the equivalent of a sell rating on the shares. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;PC Expansion &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lenovo comes to the deal from the opposite perspective. As the world&#8217;s largest maker of personal computers, it already sells millions of relatively low-margin products. The x86 servers run on the same technology as PCs, and the transaction will help Lenovo escalate competition with current rivals such as Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) and Dell Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s agreement also builds on Lenovo&#8217;s 2005 purchase of IBM&#8217;s PC unit for $1.25 billion, excluding debt. That acquisition gave Lenovo a foothold in the U.S. and put it on the path to ultimately unseating Hewlett-Packard as the top PC maker last year. As part of the legacy of that agreement, Lenovo operates a U.S. base in Morrisville, North Carolina, potentially mitigating concerns that a Chinese company is taking over IBM&#8217;s server business. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though the PC industry is suffering its worst-ever decline, Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing has maintained growth by adding mobile devices and pushing ThinkPad notebooks into markets across Europe and South America. Along the way, Lenovo&#8217;s shares have climbed for five straight years. The stock hit a 52-week high in the past week, making Yang&#8217;s 7.7 percent stake worth $1.06 billion. The 49-year-old has a net worth of $1.3 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Biggest Acquisition &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Buying the x86 server division -- the biggest acquisition in Lenovo&#8217;s history -- will give it more insulation against the PC slump. While IBM has struggled with the business, the products have higher margins than laptops and they&#8217;ll add about $4.6 billion in annual revenue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This deal is relatively transformational for Lenovo,&#8221; said Alberto Moel, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in Hong Kong. &#8220;If Lenovo can control expenses and enjoy some of the higher gross margins in this business, which are above Lenovo&#8217;s PC margins, then this could be a very good deal for them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yang had been seeking to increase Lenovo&#8217;s share of the global server business to between 5 percent and 10 percent within three years. Today&#8217;s deal beats that goal by itself. Lenovo will have about 14 percent of the market when the transaction is completed, up from less than 2 percent now, Senior Vice President Peter Hortensius said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Corporate Equipment &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lenovo&#8217;s 2005 deal with IBM vaulted Lenovo from the No. 8 PC maker to third. The company later bought control of Germany&#8217;s Medion AG and NEC Corp.&#8217;s PC division in Japan. The acquisitions helped Lenovo reach the top spot in PC shipments in the second quarter of last year. Lenovo kept that position in the latest quarter, helped by a 6.6 percent increase in shipments, according to research firm Gartner Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The overall PC industry is hurting, though, with shipments shrinking 10 percent in 2013, according to Gartner. Yang wants to build future growth on mobile devices and information technology, supplying equipment and services to corporate and government customers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;For the past 20 years, PCs were our core business,&#8221; he said in an interview. &#8220;This deal will meet our strategy and give us a good foundation for the enterprise business. We hope we quickly can build it into $10 billion in annual sales, from $4.6 billion now.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Enterprise Services &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM was the third-largest seller of x86 servers in the third quarter, trailing Hewlett-Packard and Dell, according to IDC. It sold $1.21 billion worth of the machines in the period, accounting for 13 percent of the industry&#8217;s $9.52 billion total. Lenovo didn&#8217;t rank among the top 10. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Due to the strong IBM client base, Lenovo can enter the top-tier enterprise services market,&#8221; Tony Yang, an analyst at BOCI Research Ltd. in Hong Kong, said in a report. &#8220;The service business will be Lenovo&#8217;s major driver in the future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even so, selling servers to Internet companies has become more challenging. Google Inc., Facebook Inc. and other online services are increasingly building their own data centers with custom machines that use Intel technology. That cuts server sellers out of the loop. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Deal Funding &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;To pay for the purchase, Lenovo can draw on a cash hoard that was worth $2.46 billion as of Sept. 30. The company said in October that it could also finance a large purchase by issuing equity. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since selling the PC division to Lenovo, IBM has divested other units, including printers and retail-store systems. The recent performance of the server business made it logical to offload it as well, Mills said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our business model is to seek out areas of the IT industry where we could get both growth and profits,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If one of those things falls away, then we obviously move to other approaches.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, the Lenovo deal isn&#8217;t certain to close. The transaction may trigger a U.S. security review -- especially since it involves a Chinese buyer. Proposed transactions by Chinese companies accounted for about 20 percent of reviews in 2012 by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The panel consists of the heads of federal agencies, including the departments of Commerce, Defense, Homeland Security, Justice and State, and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Amid concerns about hacking and cyber espionage by China, the country has become the committee&#8217;s most highly scrutinized nation, supplanting the U.K. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Submitting Information &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lenovo&#8217;s Hortensius said the company wouldn&#8217;t have done the deal if they didn&#8217;t think it would pass U.S. regulators. To move the process along, IBM will soon submit information to regulators, said Chris Padilla, the company&#8217;s vice president for governmental programs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even if the deal clears those hurdles, Lenovo could still lose some IBM customers in the U.S., though that may be offset by gains in its home market of China, said Stephen Yang, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Sun Hung Kai Financial. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Lenovo may still face some headwinds selling servers to American institutions and corporates due to worries over counterintelligence,&#8221; Yang said. &#8220;Lenovo would likely focus on growing its China market first, like they&#8217;ve always done with any business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Alex Barinka in New York at abarinka2@bloomberg.net; Edmond Lococo in Beijing at elococo@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editors responsible for this story: Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.net; Michael Tighe at mtighe4@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will allow overseas customers to have their personal data stored outside the U.S., a response to concerns about allegations of U.S. government spying, Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Smith told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that while other companies oppose the idea, it&#8217;s become necessary following leaks about the U.S. National Security Agency&#8217;s data-collection programs. A spokeswoman at Microsoft confirmed his comments. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The move comes as technology companies from Microsoft to Google Inc. (GOOG) grapple with customer concerns after revelations by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. Details about the extent of NSA spying have &#8220;created a crisis of confidence&#8221; when it comes to users trusting U.S. Internet companies and undermines potential economic growth, Kevin Bankston, policy director for the Washington-based Open Technology Institute, told reporters on a conference call last week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a panel discussion earlier yesterday in Davos, Smith told the audience that Microsoft doesn&#8217;t turn over information stored in its data centers and requires requests made by governments to go through the due process of law. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bond investors are losing their
aversion to difficult-to-trade corporate debt that handed them
some of the biggest losses in the credit crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield note buyers demand to own older, smaller
junk bonds that trade infrequently has shrunk to an average 0.25
percentage point this month from more than 1 percentage point a
year ago, according to Barclays Plc data. JPMorgan Chase  Co.
money manager Jim Shanahan said he&#8217;s preferring &#8220;good credit
quality and less liquidity&#8221; when picking bonds, while Howard Marks, the head of distressed debt investor Oaktree Capital
Group LLC (OAK), said he&#8217;s finding bigger potential gains in private,
less-traded debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evaporating premium for illiquid assets is showing the
depths to which money managers are reaching to boost returns
after a five-year rally that pushed relative yields on junk
bonds to the least since August 2007. With Federal Reserve
monetary policies suppressing interest-rate benchmarks for a
sixth year, credit buyers are showing more concern that they&#8217;ll
miss out on a continued rally than get stuck with debt that lost
26 percent during the market seizure in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For the past several years, people have been concerned
about liquidity,&#8221; said Eric Gross, a credit strategist at
Barclays in New York. &#8220;Now we&#8217;re hearing more about people
seeking out illiquid bonds.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fragile Market &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such debt tends to be more vulnerable to price swings when
market sentiment deteriorates, because there are fewer buyers to
bid on it when investor withdrawals force money managers to
sell. Those risks intensified after stricter banking rules
accelerated a pullback by Wall Street dealers that used their
own money to facilitate trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary dealers that trade directly with the Fed cut their
holdings of corporate bonds by 76 percent to $56 billion after
peaking at $235 billion in 2007, Fed data through March show.
After the central bank changed the way it reported the holdings
in April, net speculative-grade bond holdings fell as much as 24
percent to a low of $5.63 billion in May before rising to $7.7
billion on Jan. 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors are demanding an average yield of 5.94 percent to
own bonds sold at least 18 months ago in batches of less than
$250 million, Barclays data show. That compares with an average
5.7 percent for newer debt offerings of at least $500 million.
The gap, which averaged 0.5 percentage point last year and 0.92
percentage point in 2012, reached as much as 1.95 percentage
points at the peak of the financial crisis in March 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Classic&#8217; Cycle &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on MGM Resort International&#8217;s $238 million of
6.875 percent notes, which were issued in 2006 and mature in
April 2016, has dropped 2.4 percentage points during the past
year to 1.85 percent, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
That compares with a decline of 0.5 percentage point to 5.4
percent on the casino owner&#8217;s $1.25 billion offering of nine-year, 6.625 percent securities in December 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As people continue to look for yield and performance,
they&#8217;re willing to move into less-liquid areas of the market,&#8221;
said Shanahan, who manages high-yield credit investments for
JPMorgan&#8217;s $1.5 trillion asset management unit. &#8220;You&#8217;re seeing
a classic market cycle of people looking for pockets of value.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Intoxicating Brew&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With corporate borrowers selling record volumes of debt to
lock in all-time low yields amid global central bank stimulus,
&#8220;there is a tremendous and potentially unsustainable amount of
paper in investors&#8217; hands, and this harsh reality is causing
much angst,&#8221; according to a McKinsey  Co. and Greenwich
Associates report in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard Fisher, a
former managing partner of a fund that bought distressed debt,
said in a speech last week that he&#8217;d &#8220;have to hire Sherlock
Holmes to find a single distressed company priced attractively
enough to buy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five years after the Fed started holding benchmark rates at
about zero and pumping more than $3 trillion into the financial
system to ignite growth, Fisher warned in the Jan. 14 remarks to
the National Association of Corporate Directors that signs are
emerging that Fed stimulus has made for &#8220;an intoxicating
brew.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Economic Boost &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as the central bank starts slowing monthly bond
purchases to $75 billion from $85 billion, yields on dollar-denominated speculative-grade bonds have fallen to 6.21 percent,
0.22 percentage point from the record low in May 2013, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The securities, which provide bigger cushions of extra
yield over benchmark rates than higher-rated debt, are governed
by idiosyncratic deal documents and aren&#8217;t as frequently traded.
While trading in speculative-grade bonds has risen, volumes have
failed to keep pace with a market that&#8217;s expanded 71 percent
since 2008 as Wall Street&#8217;s biggest banks reduce their holdings
of riskier assets in the face of new regulations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculative-grade, or junk, bonds are rated below Baa3 by
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and lower than BBB- at Standard 
Poor&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors are emboldened by a U.S. economy that will
probably expand by 2.8 percent this year and 3 percent in 2015
from 1.9 percent in last year, according to a Bloomberg survey
of 83 economists. High-yield bond funds have received $3.85
billion of deposits since the end of September, according to
data compiled by Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, as investors
gained conviction that the U.S. economic recovery was
strengthening. The unemployment rate dropped to 6.7 percent by
Dec. 31 from 10 percent in October 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More Homework &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Money has found it very easy to flow into public,
mainstream things,&#8221; said Marks, Oaktree&#8217;s chairman, in a Dec.
10 presentation for investors. &#8220;The best credit opportunities
are in niche markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the firm is earning about 11.5 percent to extend
loans to smaller companies, about twice as much as the yield on
a junk bond of comparable quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These deals are small and &#8220;entirely illiquid,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;It requires a lot of due diligence.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publicly traded business-development corporations, which
lend to the smallest and riskiest companies, attracted $4.1
billion last year, the most since 2007, as the firms known as
BDCs gained an average 16.4 percent. The firms are juicing
returns by borrowing about 50 cents for every dollar raised from
equity investors, up from 36 cents in 2011, according to data
compiled by Keefe, Bruyette  Woods analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Filling Gap &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BDCs and other alternative asset managers that lend to
small and mid-sized companies are filling a role traditionally
dominated by banks, J.P. Morgan Asset Management&#8217;s Shanahan said
in a telephone interview. Holding smaller, less-traded
securities can boost investor returns while maintaining a higher
level of credit quality, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Credit is good and likely to be good over the horizon,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;People become less concerned about liquidity as
you&#8217;re less likely to need it in the near term.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in credit markets, the cost to protect against
losses on U.S. and European corporate bonds jumped to the
highest in five weeks. La Banque Postale SA is turning to the
covered bond market to fund its mortgage business that has grown
by about 50 percent over the past four years and can no longer
be financed solely by customer deposits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Credit Benchmarks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark used to hedge against losses or
to speculate on creditworthiness, rose 1.5 basis points to 67
basis points as of 9:52 a.m. in New York, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. In London, the Markit iTraxx Europe Index
of 125 companies with investment-grade ratings increased 2.6 to
75.2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both gauges, which typically rise as investor confidence
deteriorates and fall as it improves, are trading at the highest
intraday levels since Dec. 19. Credit swaps pay the buyer face
value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the
value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000
annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banking unit of France&#8217;s postal service, which has a
home loan portfolio of 50 billion euros ($67.8 billion), will
now fund 20 percent of that business with covered securities,
according to Stephane Magnan, head of asset and liability
management at the bank in Paris. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lender is now the sixth-biggest mortgage lender in
France, having taken market share from Credit Agricole SA (ACA) and
BNP Paribas SA, according to SP. The bank&#8217;s business expanded
even as France&#8217;s economy struggles to grow after exiting
recession last year and unemployment touches a 16-year high. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs International Chairman
Peter Sutherland said curbs on migration are &#8220;ridiculous&#8221; as
employers struggle to find skilled workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is ridiculous to stop migration when the demographic
profile of so many countries demands it,&#8221; including the U.K.,
he said after a panel discussion today at the World Economic
Forum in Davos, Switzerland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access to sufficient skilled workers is &#8220;getting worse&#8221;
in many developed countries, while immigrants&#8217; role in society
is &#8220;overwhelmingly positive,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immigration has become a growing issue in British politics
in recent years as opponents of U.K. membership of the European
Union, which allows free movement of workers from across the
bloc into Britain, have become more vocal. Prime Minister David Cameron&#8217;s Conservatives say they want to see net annual
migration from outside the EU cut to below 100,000, and a leaked
Home Office document last month suggested an annual cap on
migration from within the bloc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some politicians, including Business Secretary Vince Cable
from Cameron&#8217;s Liberal Democrat coalition partners and
Conservative London Mayor Boris Johnson, have expressed
skepticism about immigration controls, warning they could hamper
British businesses. &lt;/p&gt;

(GS) is the right investor for Dong Energy A/S, a top official of Denmark&#8217;s ruling Social Democrats said, defending the Wall Street firm against criticism from other parliament members. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s European merchant banking unit is seeking to buy an 18 percent stake in state-controlled Dong, a utility in need of new equity after losing money on failed natural gas bets. Some Danish lawmakers want to block the 8 billion-krone ($1.5 billion) purchase, saying Goldman Sachs bears responsibility for the global financial crisis and that the government is giving the New York-based company too much control. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;If we were to not deal with banks until we had bashed all those who deserved to get bashed, we would never get anywhere, and we have to move on,&#8221; Benny Engelbrecht, the Social Democrats&#8217; business spokesman, said in an interview in Copenhagen. &#8220;Applying that kind of logic would leave us without any banks to work with.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the government&#8217;s Dec. 3 proposal, Goldman Sachs will be able to veto a possible sale of new shares or hybrid capital, any change in Dong&#8217;s senior management or acquisitions before a possible 2018 initial public offering. The state will retain a 57.3 percent stake in Skaerbaek-based Dong, which also operates offshore wind parks and explores for oil and gas. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Fascinated&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other minority owners are ATP and PFA, the country&#8217;s two largest pension funds, as well as five local energy companies. Neither will get the same veto powers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Red-Green Alliance, which has 12 of 179 seats in parliament, says the state, not Goldman Sachs, should inject the money that Dong needs. The alliance, which includes former members of Denmark&#8217;s communist party, has filed more than 100 questions to the finance ministry regarding the sales process and the privileges given to Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We would have liked if the government had considered who Goldman are and what they want,&#8221; Stine Brix, the deputy financial speaker for the party, said in an interview. &#8220;Goldman has a very doubled-faced story. On one hand, everybody is fascinated with how good they are, but they also act without guilt or remorse.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Abusive&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs in July 2010 agreed to pay $550 million and change its business practices to settle the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s claims that the firm misled investors in a 2007 product linked to subprime mortgages. The firm didn&#8217;t admit or deny wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A U.S. Senate subcommittee&#8217;s report in 2011 said Goldman Sachs relied on &#8220;abusive&#8221; sales practices and was rife with conflicts of interest that encouraged putting profits ahead of clients. While Goldman Sachs said it disagreed with many of the Senate report&#8217;s finding, the firm also noted that it undertook a review of its business practices and released a 63-page report on its findings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a long-term investment and we support the management team&#8217;s current strategy across the company&#8217;s activities, including the significant renewable energy investments,&#8221; Sophie Ramsay, a London-based spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, said in an e-mailed reply to questions. &#8220;This strategy, supported by the Danish State and other minority shareholders, will create value for all shareholders in the years to come.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Morally Wrong &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Selling to Goldman Sachs is morally wrong, jeopardizes Denmark&#8217;s green agenda and will prove to be a financial mistake, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, a former Danish prime minister, was quoted as saying in an interview published by newspaper Politiken today. Nyrup Rasmussen, a Social Democrat, has also served as leader of the Europe-wide socialist group in the European Union. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bjarne Corydon, Denmark&#8217;s current finance minister and also a Social Democrat, defended the sale in an interview broadcast by TV2 News. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I can understand that there&#8217;s a debate about banks&#8217; behavior in the wake of the financial crisis,&#8221; Corydon said in response to Nyrup Rasmussen&#8217;s comment. &#8220;Dong was in a situation where money was needed. We have chosen a proactive answer, the green answer, by going with the investment strategy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Opposition Growing &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Danish People&#8217;s Party, which has 22 seats in Denmark&#8217;s assembly, initially backed the government&#8217;s plan to find private investors for Dong. Now the party has threatened to withdraw its support. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t understand why Goldman should be able to hire and fire the management or why they need to be able to veto the strategy when it&#8217;s already in place,&#8221; said Rene Christensen, financial spokesman for party. &#8220;The government says there&#8217;s no need to worry about the clauses, but that only made us more curious as to why they had to make them in the first place.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even as opposition to the Goldman Sachs deal is growing, the government will probably be able to pass the proposal with the support of the Conservative Party and the Liberals Party, Engelbrecht of the Social Democrats said. The Liberals are Denmark&#8217;s biggest opposition party. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Engelbrecht last year led lawmakers&#8217; push for rules that require Denmark&#8217;s biggest lenders, including Danske Bank A/S to hold additional capital reserves to prevent a future banking crisis. While Goldman played a role in the financial crisis, the bank is no worse than others, Engelbrecht said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman is getting bashed for the same reason Danske Bank got bashed. It&#8217;s the icon of capitalism and greed, though at a whole different level than Danske Bank,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The critics forget that this investment is being made by the division in Goldman that actually specializes in renewables, and with the level of professionalism displayed by Goldman, that&#8217;s not a bad thing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Peter Levring in Copenhagen at plevring1@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Jonas Bergman at jbergman@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) gave Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon a 74 percent raise to $20 million last year, bringing his pay closer to where it stood before he was penalized for faulty oversight of botched derivatives bets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The board&#8217;s compensation package for Dimon, 57, who also serves as chairman, included $18.5 million in restricted stock, the New York-based lender said today in a regulatory filing. His salary was unchanged at $1.5 million and he got no cash bonus, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Board members decided to keep Dimon&#8217;s pay below previous peak levels after criminal and regulatory probes cost JPMorgan more than $23 billion in settlements during 2013. The directors cut his 2012 package in half last January to $11.5 million, saying he bore &#8220;ultimate responsibility&#8221; for failures that led to derivatives trading losses in the London Whale episode. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In raising Dimon&#8217;s pay, the board of directors cited &#8220;sustained long-term performance; gains in market share and customer satisfaction; and the regulatory issues the company has faced and the steps the company has taken to resolve those issues,&#8221; according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The restricted stock vests 50 percent after two years and 50 percent after three years, the bank said. Awarding Dimon&#8217;s total bonus in shares ties his pay &#8220;to the company&#8217;s future performance, including continued progress on the company&#8217;s regulatory agenda,&#8221; the firm said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Performance Priority &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The board&#8217;s compensation committee is led by Lee Raymond, 75, Exxon Mobil Corp.&#8217;s former chairman and CEO. JPMorgan&#8217;s stock climbed 33 percent last year, matching the 81-company Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Financials Index. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Obviously they paid more attention to the operational performance and stock-price performance and less to the litigation issues,&#8221; said Joseph Sorrentino, a managing director at Steven Hall  Partners, a New York-based compensation consulting firm. &#8220;Maybe there&#8217;s an argument that settling those items at those levels and removing the uncertainty there, maybe that&#8217;s worth something as well, but hard to know.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake, 44, received 80,346 shares, worth $4.65 million at the price of $57.875, the level at which Dimon&#8217;s shares were valued. Chief Operating Officer Matt Zames, 43, received stock valued at $9.75 million, as did Mike Cavanagh, 48, co-head of the firm&#8217;s corporate and investment bank. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Shareholder Support &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Daniel Pinto, 51, the other co-head, received the same total pay as Cavanagh, and it was structured differently because of compensation rules in the U.K. where Pinto is based, according to a person briefed on the awards. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Any cash awards for named executives will be disclosed in the firm&#8217;s proxy statement later this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon became CEO at the end of 2005 and added the title of chairman a year later. His reputation as a top manager, along with his pay, has fluctuated since then. While JPMorgan emerged from the financial crisis as the only large U.S. bank to avoid quarterly losses, the trading debacle in 2012 prompted some investors to call for splitting his dual roles. Shareholders rejected that proposal at a meeting in May. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon was paid $49.9 million for 2007, including special stock awards. During the financial crisis a year later, he took only a $1 million salary. He got $15.2 million for 2009, and $23 million for each of the two years that followed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Settlement Costs &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In last year&#8217;s third quarter, the bank posted its first loss on Dimon&#8217;s watch after taking a $7.2 billion charge to cover the cost of mounting litigation and regulatory probes. The deficit ended the firm&#8217;s streak of three record annual profits. Full-year net income fell 16 percent to $17.9 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon pushed last year to resolve government investigations, including at least eight Justice Department probes listed in the firm&#8217;s quarterly report in October. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Settlements since then have included a record $13 billion deal to resolve inquiries into mortgage-bond sales. The bank paid $2.6 billion and avoided criminal prosecution while settling claims it failed to stop Bernard Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme. The firm also paid more than $1 billion last year tied to the botched derivatives bets, which lost more than $6.2 billion in 2012. In that case, U.S. and U.K. regulators faulted its oversight of a trader known as the London Whale because his positions were so large. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon told journalists earlier this month that he couldn&#8217;t predict whether he might be able to put the legal disputes behind the bank this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Michael J.

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is working
for EBay Inc. (EBAY) as it faces calls from Carl Icahn to split off its
PayPal unit, people with knowledge of the matter said, the
investment bank&#8217;s latest assignment with a technology company
facing an activist investor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is a long-time adviser to EBay on a number of
issues, Amanda Miller, spokeswoman for the online marketplace,
said while declining to discuss the specifics of the bank&#8217;s current
role regarding Icahn&#8217;s efforts. &#8220;We did not engage them specifically 
for this matter,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank also has advised Apple (AAPL) Inc. and
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the people said, asking not to be identified
discussing private information. Apple faces calls for a bigger
stock buyback from Icahn, and Microsoft recently said it will
allow ValueAct Capital Management LLC President Mason Morfit to
join its board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment banks are building up practices that advise
companies on how to deter and respond to activists, as the
investors garner more money and institutional backing. Funds
managed by activists have almost tripled over five years, to $93
billion at the end of last year from about $32 billion in 2008,
according to data compiled by Hedge Fund Research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Goldman Sachs, the activist defense practice has been
spearheaded by partner Bill Anderson, who joined the bank in
2000. Anderson was previously an MA lawyer at Simpson Thacher 
Bartlett LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Engaging Activists &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icahn informed EBay last week he had begun purchasing the
online marketplace&#8217;s shares and was nominating two directors to
its board, the company said. Icahn called a separation of PayPal
-- one of EBay&#8217;s faster-growing businesses -- from the company a
&#8220;no-brainer&#8221; in an interview on Bloomberg TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tony Imperati, a spokesman for Microsoft, declined to
comment, as did Andrew Williams, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, companies have been more proactively engaging
activists before their efforts become public. Icahn&#8217;s demands
for for the PayPal split were disclosed by the San Jose,
California-based company in its quarterly earnings report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EBay Chief Executive Officer John Donahoe spoke with Icahn
last week and said on a conference call the company should stay
together, citing how the intertwined entity helps fund PayPal&#8217;s
expansion into areas such as mobile. The payments unit boosted
sales 19 percent last quarter, outpacing 12 percent sales growth
at EBay&#8217;s marketplace unit, which faces stiff competition from
Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Technology Targets &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icahn&#8217;s EBay investment follows a string of actions by
activists taking on Silicon Valley technology firms, especially
as some of the companies&#8217; rapid growth rates slow. Icahn has
this week tweeted that he increased his stake in Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is proposing that the company commit to buying back at
least $50 billion worth of shares in fiscal 2014, something that
Apple is recomending investors vote against. Goldman Sachs
advised Apple&#8217;s board as it weighed an earlier push from
Greenlight Capital Inc.&#8217;s David Einhorn to issue more preferred
stock which would pay a higher dividend than common stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft signed a pact to cooperate with ValueAct in
August, four months after the activist fund disclosed a stake of
about $1.9 billion in the software maker and at the deadline for
proxy contests ahead of a November annual meeting. ValueAct, the
San Francisco-based firm headed by Jeffrey Ubben, has since
increased its stake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the agreement, Microsoft said it would allow
Morfit to join the board and hold regular meetings with Morfit,
directors and select management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology companies Hewlett-Packard Co., Juniper Networks
Inc. and Riverbed Technology Inc. are also facing activist
pressure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week&#8217;s decline in financial
markets isn&#8217;t surprising because the value of those assets has
risen sharply during the past year, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It would be very abnormal if we didn&#8217;t have consolidating
moves in the assets that have gone up so much,&#8221; Blankfein, 59,
said today in a Bloomberg Television interview with Erik Schatzker and Stephanie Ruhle at the World Economic Forum in
Davos, Switzerland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI World Index fell 1.5 percent, the most since
August, as of 11:18 a.m. in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average headed toward its biggest weekly drop since 2012 and the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 2.1 percent today, the most since
June. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index slid 1.5 percent,
extending its loss for the year to 5.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market is working through &#8220;jitters&#8221; amid a repricing
of emerging-market assets, Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn
said in a separate interview. While the recent moves are &#8220;not
extraordinary,&#8221; investors should expect larger swings than in
the past as banks that serve as market-makers pull back amid new
restrictions and capital rules, Cohn said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As we continue to regulate markets and continue to
increase capital charges, you&#8217;ve seen all of the banks&#8221; reduce
capital they commit to trading, Cohn said. &#8220;We need to get used
to seeing more and more moves like this. This is just a natural
evolution of where markets are headed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) has
controls in place to avoid conflicts of interest when clients
request jobs for their children, Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;ve had people who say, &#8216;Look, my kid&#8217;s in the blankety-blank business school in the United States, and really would
like a job in finance, really would like a job at Goldman
Sachs,&#8217;&#8221; Blankfein, 59, said today in a CNBC interview at the
World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. &#8220;I&#8217;m thinking about
how it could look, and so we have a lot of processes to vet
these things.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked if he had seen any hiring that appeared to be a
bribe, Blankfein said, &#8220;Not firsthand.&#8221; U.S. regulators are
looking at hiring practices in China amid an investigation into
JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein joined Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman in
pointing out that many talented employees happen to be children
of powerful leaders in China and in other parts of the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you precluded yourself from hiring any kid that was
affiliated with somebody or whose parent was an important
official or important industrialist or executive, you wouldn&#8217;t
have very many people left,&#8221; Blankfein said. &#8220;Who do you think
the kids are that are multicultural and filling Harvard Business
School?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMP Capital Australian Corporate
Bond Fund (AMPACBA), which outperformed its peers over the past decade,
prefers U.S. and European banks to the South Pacific nation&#8217;s
lenders on improving economic prospects in those two regions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY), 2013&#8217;s best-performing corporate
bond, is the fund&#8217;s biggest holding, the AMP website shows. BNP
Paribas SA, JPMorgan Chase  Co. are among the top 10, which
include Westpac Banking Corp. as the only Australia-based
lender. The AMP fund returned 6.2 percent in 2013, beating 21 of
its peers, according to Morningstar Australia Pty. It topped the
ranks of funds that invest mainly in Australian bonds over the
past decade with an average return of 7.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia&#8217;s growth will trail the U.S. for the first time
in four years as a mining boom cools, according to a Bloomberg
survey of economists. The cost premium for protecting debt of
the Big Four Australian banks over U.S. counterparts touched the
most in almost six years this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The kind of banks that we&#8217;ve identified in places like
the U.S., in parts of Europe and the U.K., and to a lesser
extent in Australia, were all going to benefit from economies
that were improving,&#8221; said Mark Beardow, 46, who runs the A$2
billion ($1.75 billion) fund in Sydney. &#8220;Many parts of the
global corporate bond market are continuing to meaningfully
deleverage, particularly financials.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Six-Year High &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average cost of credit-default swaps on Commonwealth
Bank of Australia, Westpac and the country&#8217;s next two biggest
lenders versus the seven biggest U.S. banks widened to 17.4
basis points on Jan. 3, the most since March 2008. It was 12.4
basis points as of yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beardow, who talked by telephone yesterday, manages the
fund in Sydney with Jeff Brunton and David Carruthers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. economic growth will quicken by 0.9 percentage point
this year to 2.8 percent, based on Bloomberg News surveys of
economists. The euro area&#8217;s economy will go to a 1 percent
expansion from a 0.4 percent contraction. In Australia, the pace
will pick up by 0.35 percentage point to 2.75 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bonds of London-based Lloyds returned about 8 percent
on average last year, the most among the biggest 50 corporate
issuers in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch&#8217;s Global Corporate
 High Yield Index. The bank&#8217;s debt issued in Australia returned
4.95 percent in 2013, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
indexes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Big Four &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The returns beat the bonds of Commonwealth Bank, Westpac,
Australia  New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. and National
Australia Bank Ltd., the nation&#8217;s four biggest lenders. The
latter topped the list with a 4.71 percent gain, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens cut the
benchmark interest rate to a record low of 2.5 percent last year
to maintain economic growth as the economy struggles to
diversify amid a drop-off in mining investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beardow said he favors shorter-term securities in case
yields rise. The fund&#8217;s duration was 1.39 years in December,
versus 2.76 years for the benchmark it uses to gauge
performance, according to the AMP website. Duration is a measure
of a portfolio&#8217;s sensitivity to changes in bond yields, and a
smaller figure offers more protection should borrowing costs
increase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. 10-year yields will be 3 percent to 3.5 percent by
year-end, he said, from 2.76 percent as of 1:31 p.m. today in
Sydney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australian 10-year yields will climb to 4.25-4.75 percent,
according to Beardow, from 4.05 percent today. Yields on U.S.
and Australian government securities due in 10 years and longer
have a correlation of 0.948. A figure of 1 means they move in
lock-step. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Fair Value&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Now we think rates are largely fair value,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;We see fair value continuing to edge up.&#8221; The RBA will keep
its benchmark at 2.5 percent this year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Evans, the top-ranked chief economist at Westpac, says
Stevens will need to cut the benchmark rate to 2 percent. Evans
is the most accurate forecaster on Australia&#8217;s economy,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would expect to see yields down in this country,&#8221;
Evans said in a Jan. 24 interview. &#8220;That would suggest that you
should be buying bonds. We&#8217;re not concerned about any credit
risks associated with the banking sector. Bank bonds would
similarly track the capital appreciation that we&#8217;re expecting in
government bonds.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten-year yields will fall to 4 percent by year-end, Evans
said in a Bloomberg survey of banks conducted Jan. 16 to Jan.
21. It was the lowest forecast among 15 responses. An investor
who bought today would earn about 4 percent if the forecast is
correct, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AMP Australian Corporate fund can invest up to 30
percent of its assets in global corporate bonds, Beardow said.
The challenge is to generate income with company notes and
protect returns against higher borrowing costs, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re pretty positive about the economy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We
want to be particularly active around the possibility that
yields do rise very sharply, and we&#8217;re keeping duration pretty
short.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa SAB, the world&#8217;s
biggest franchised bottler of the soft drink, tumbled to  a 21-month low after PepsiCo Inc. announced last week that it will
invest $5 billion in Mexico over five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Femsa dropped 3.7 percent to 137.82 pesos at 2:59
p.m. in Mexico City, the lowest on closing basis since May 2012.
The decline was the biggest among the 35 members of the
benchmark IPC stock index, which fell 0.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico City-based Coca-Cola Femsa has dropped 13 percent
since the beginning of the year, when a tax on junk food took
effect. PepsiCo, based in Purchase, New York, said last week
that it will expand its food and beverage business in Mexico,
citing the nation&#8217;s growing middle class and opportunities for
long-term growth. The maker of Cheetos and Pepsi Cola controls
more than 65 percent of Mexico&#8217;s sales of sweet and savory
snacks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is always going to be a strong dominance of Coca-Cola here, but with new taxes the consumer is going to be more
aware of the price environment if Pepsi is able to reduce
prices, increase competition or introduce new products,&#8221;
Cristina Morales, an analyst at Punto Casa de Bolsa SA de CV in
Mexico City, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico represents a &#8220;tremendous opportunity&#8221; for growth,
PepsiCo Mexico President Pedro Padierna said in an e-mailed
statement last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jose Castro, the head of investor relations at Coca-Cola
Femsa, didn&#8217;t immediately return a request for comment today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon, who got a 74 percent raise for his work in
2013, stands to reap a separate and bigger payday within months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s board of directors, having delayed a decision
for more than a year, has yet to say whether Dimon, 57, can
collect 2 million stock options originally granted in 2008 and
now worth about $34 million. Last week, the board increased his
annual pay to $20 million from $11.5 million a year ago, when he
was penalized for faulty oversight of botched derivatives bets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Dimon&#8217;s incentive package was created six years ago,
JPMorgan grew to become the nation&#8217;s largest bank with shares
outperforming the industry, and then snapped a three-year run of
record profits as costs from government probes surged. The
board&#8217;s decision to boost Dimon&#8217;s annual pay despite mounting
legal settlements shows he probably will get the full options
award, said Alan Johnson, founder of compensation-consulting
firm Johnson Associates Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s obvious the board wanted to send a signal about what
they think of him,&#8221; Johnson said. &#8220;It&#8217;d be very inconsistent
to say, &#8216;You&#8217;re our guy, and we want to send an emphatic public
message that we think very highly of you.&#8217; And then, &#8216;Oh by the
way, you didn&#8217;t earn this over the last five years.&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese leaders are unlikely to
roll out major new economic policies to boost growth this year,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials who fought deflation last year through measures
including quantitative easing, monetary stimulus and increased
government spending will opt for policy stability, said Kathy Matsui, chief Japan strategist at the New York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This year, I don&#8217;t think you are going to get major
bazooka-type policy announcements,&#8221; Matsui said in an interview
to Bloomberg Radio today. &#8220;I think it is more a question of
looking for the fundamental improvement both in the macro
economy and corporate level.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan has pledged to forge ahead with structural reforms
designed to open business opportunities in industries from
health care to agriculture as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe leads
efforts to break the legacy of 15 years of deflation. The
administration&#8217;s attempts helped propel Japan&#8217;s Topix index of
shares up 51 percent last year, its best performance since 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abe&#8217;s stimulus program caused an 18 percent weakening in
the yen against the dollar last year, helping exporters. The
Japanese currency fell 0.1 percent to 102.79 per greenback as of
9:45 p.m. in Tokyo today, while the benchmark 10-year yield was
at 0.63 percent compared with 0.745 percent a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matsui said the depreciation in yen is not completely
beneficial to Japan as it increased the cost of growing fossil-fuel imports in the wake of nuclear-plant shutdowns. Japan
reported a record annual trade deficit for 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The weaker the yen becomes the more expensive that fuel
becomes, so it is not a unanimous positive for everybody,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;Therefore, I think the currency at this kind of level
anywhere from 100 or around 100 yen to a dollar is actually not
too bad for most companies be they exporters or importers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opposition to Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS)&#8217;s planned investment in Dong Energy A/S has opened up a bet
on debt sold by the Danish power and oil producer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on the bonds climbed amid rising resistance to the 8
billion kroner ($1.5 billion) investment, with a former prime
minister saying that selling to the Wall Street firm is morally
and financially wrong and jeopardizes Denmark&#8217;s environmental
agenda. The government is seeking to sell a stake to shore up
the utility&#8217;s finances after failed natural gas bets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would use these recent small declines to buy the bonds
as the debate is only white noise,&#8221; Jens H. Thomsen, a credit
analyst at Jyske Bank A/S, said by phone. &#8220;It&#8217;s very likely
that the deal goes through and that would be very positive for
the credit profile.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on Dong&#8217;s 6.25 percent bond due 3013 rose to 5.78
percent in Copenhagen at the end of last week, the highest since
Nov. 7. It yielded 5.67 percent on Jan. 9 before the criticism
intensified over New York-based Goldman&#8217;s investment. That was
the lowest yield since the note started trading on June 24,
according to Composite Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. Today, the
yield fell to 5.77 percent, the first decline in seven trading
days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steven Donziger, a New York attorney
accused of leading a racketeering scheme in an environmental
lawsuit against Chevron Corp. (CVX), hired appellate attorney Deepak
Gupta of Washington&#8217;s Gupta Beck PLLC to represent him in an
anticipated appeal, the firm said on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial before U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan ended in
November. There is no opinion yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta specializes in Supreme Court and other appellate
litigation on behalf of plaintiffs, with an emphasis on
consumers&#8217; and workers&#8217; rights, class actions and constitutional
law, according to his firm biography. He&#160;argued for the
plaintiffs in&#160;the U.S. Supreme Court case over arbitration, ATT
Mobility v. Concepcion. An adjunct law professor at Georgetown
and American universities, he worked at Public Citizen
Litigation Group before founding his firm in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donziger and a team of other lawyers won a $19 billion
judgment in 2011 on behalf of Ecuadorean rainforest villagers
who claimed Texaco, later bought by Chevron, dumped billions of
gallons of drilling-generated toxic waste from the 1960s through
the early 1990s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, has refused to pay
any of the judgment and is seeking an order from Kaplan barring
Donziger from trying to enforce it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doniziger will also be represented by University of Denver
Law School professors Justin Marceau and John Campbell, whose
students will work with Gupta&#8217;s legal team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Jersey Law Firm Has Role in Hoboken Mayor Threat Claim &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer said Jan. 18 that New Jersey
Republican Governor Chris Christie&#8217;s administration threatened
to withhold Hurricane Sandy aid unless she approved a new office
tower, the disclosure involved a politically connected state law
firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developer of the tower, New York-based Rockefeller
Group, was represented by Wolff  Samson. The New Jersey law
firm was founded by David Samson, Christie&#8217;s top appointee at
the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wolff  Samson said in a statement Jan. 23 that its
&#8220;conduct in the representation of our client was appropriate in
all respects&#8221; and denied Zimmer&#8217;s statements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s presence in Dong Energy A/S will boost the value of the Danish utility and make a listing more likely, a minority owner said, defending the Wall Street bank amid a wave of opposition. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Denmark&#8217;s finance committee decides tomorrow whether Goldman can invest 8 billion kroner ($1.5 billion) in exchange for an 18 percent stake in Dong, which needs fresh equity after losing money on failed natural gas bets. Finance Minister Bjarne Corydon has said Denmark must back the deal to avoid &#8220;gambling&#8221; with Dong&#8217;s future after some lawmakers questioned the bid and a former prime minister called Goldman a &#8220;shady partner.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We want to buy shares to defend our stake in Dong if the finance committee approves the agreement with Goldman, ATP and PFA,&#8221; Gert Vinther Joergensen, chief financial officer of Syd Energi A/S, said by phone. &#8220;The deal makes an initial public offering more likely and increases the value of our shares.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The government pulled a planned IPO of Dong in 2008 as the financial crisis dragged down stock markets across the globe. Dong said Oct. 2 that the new buyers and the government have agreed to seek an IPO when &#8220;conditions are right.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Syd Energi, a power company based in Esbjerg, has said it will invest 450 million kroner in connection with Goldman&#8217;s injection to maintain its current 3.5 percent stake in Dong. Goldman is making its investment via its European merchant banking unit and in partnership with Denmark&#8217;s two largest pension funds, ATP and PFA, which will own 4.9 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A measure of U.S. corporate credit
risk dropped the most in seven weeks as data showed consumer
confidence firming and emerging market stocks snapped three days
of losses. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) sold $3.2 billion of bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark used to hedge against losses or
to speculate on creditworthiness, decreased 2.7 basis points to
69.9 basis points at 4:21 p.m. in New York, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The measure fell the most since Dec. 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors pushed the gauge lower as emerging markets rose
and the Conference Board&#8217;s index of U.S. consumer confidence
climbed to 80.7 in January from a revised 77.5 the prior month,
according to the private research group. An increase in consumer
activity would bolster companies&#8217; ability to repay debts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s an overall improved tone in the global markets with
emerging markets doing much better today than they have in the
last three sessions,&#8221; Adrian Miller, director of fixed-income
strategies at GMP Securities LLC in New York, said in a
telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging-market equities advanced as a surprise rate
increase in India bolstered bets central banks will shore up
their currencies. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index added 0.3
percent to 934.81 at 4:11 p.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apple Risk &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The credit swaps measure typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost to protect the debt of Apple Inc. (AAPL) for five years
jumped 9 basis points to 35 basis points as of 3:18 p.m. in New
York, according to data provider CMA, which is owned by McGraw
Hill Financial Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market. That&#8217;s the biggest rise since Nov.
25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple reported iPhone sales for the holiday season that
missed analysts&#8217; estimates. For its fiscal first quarter ended
Dec. 28, Apple said it sold a record 51 million iPhones, below
analysts&#8217; forecast of 54.7 million handsets. The company also
projected revenue in the current period may fall from a year
earlier, in what would be the first quarterly sales decline
since 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goldman Offering &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs issued $2.5 billion of 2.625 percent, five-year notes to yield 112.5 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The securities may be rated Baa1 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service,
the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street bank with the highest return on equity also
sold $700 million of additional securities to its existing $1
billion of 1.34 percent floating-rate notes that come due in
November 2018. The debt pays 110 basis points more than the
three-month London interbank offered rate, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds of Goldman Sachs were the most actively traded
dollar-denominated corporate securities by dealers today,
accounting for 5.3 percent of the volume of dealer trades of $1
million or more as of 4:47 p.m. in New York, according to Trace,
the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Distress Ratio &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. distress ratio decreased to 5.2 percent in January
from 5.3 percent in December, analysts led by Diane Vazza at
Standard  Poor&#8217;s said in a statement. The ratio has remained
within the 5 percent to 6 percent range over the past 10 months,
which is close to its 2004-2006 average of 5.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP&#8217;s ratio is the number of distressed securities divided
by the total number of speculative-grade issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk premium on the Markit CDX North American High
Yield Index, tied to the debt of 100 speculative-grade
companies, narrowed 12.2 basis points to 337.4, Bloomberg prices
show. Junk or high-risk bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s
and less than BBB- at SP. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to hold investment-grade
corporate bonds rather than government debt was little changed
at 111.8, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. reported profit that
beat analysts&#8217; estimates after lowering its industry-high tax
rate, an effort the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker said will continue
as it repurchases billions in stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer projected an effective tax rate of 27 percent for
this year. That may be difficult to reduce further as the New
York-based company plans to keep bringing back cash from
overseas and is taxed by the U.S. government for doing so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing that anyone&#8217;s doing in a tax-planning
environment that we&#8217;re not doing,&#8221; Frank D&#8217;Amelio, the
company&#8217;s chief financial officer, said today in an interview.
Profit earned in low-tax overseas jurisdictions is taxed at
higher U.S. rates when repatriated for dividends and buybacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors have been watching for a potential breakup of
Pfizer&#8217;s drug business after Chief Executive Officer Ian Read
divested the nutrition and animal health businesses over the
past two years. Pfizer is dividing internal operations into
three units, though any full split probably wouldn&#8217;t happen
until 2017, according to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read today didn&#8217;t comment on whether the company would
actually split. Pfizer&#8217;s established products line, which
consists of medicines that are no longer patent protected, has
attracted the interest of generic-drug makers including Mylan
Inc. and Actavis Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Ford Motor Co. (F) led
U.S. companies that topped analysts&#8217; earnings estimates today,
amid rising consumer confidence and buoyant demand for new
products -- from pickups to cable-TV packages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug manufacturer and carmaker are among the 75 percent
of Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index companies that have exceeded
analysts&#8217; projections this season so far, with more than 350
that have yet to report. Profit at SP 500 companies probably
rose 6.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013, and sales
increased 2.3 percent, estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford benefited from sales of F-Series pickups in the U.S.
and the Focus compact car in China. Pfizer, the world&#8217;s
biggest drugmaker, cut costs to boost earnings. While Apple 
Inc.'s profit also beat estimates, the Cupertino, California-based company posted iPhone sales for the holiday season
that missed analysts' projections yesterday, a sign it needs
new products to fuel growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confidence among U.S. consumers unexpectedly climbed to a
five-month high in January, according to data released by the
the Conference Board today, as optimism about the economy and
labor market improved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The labor market has been the key variable for the
consumer for a very long time and people have generally been
feeling a little bit better over the last three to six months
because the unemployment rate has been falling,&#8221; Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Pierpont Securities LLC in Stamford,
Connecticut, said before the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Health-Care Companies &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All but one of the 14 health-care companies in the SP that
have reported exceeded earnings&#8217; projections, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Almost 56 percent of consumer-discretionary
companies and 87 percent of information-technology businesses
posted higher-than-estimated earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comcast Corp. (CMCSA), the largest U.S. cable company, also
reported results today. Although earnings missed estimates,
sales were higher than projected as the Philadelphia-based
company added TV subscribers for the first time in more than six
years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the companies that topped estimates in the past week
were Microsoft Corp., helped by sales of game consoles and cloud
software, and Netflix Inc., which surged to a stock-price record
after projecting higher-than-estimated customer growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies that fell short in terms of sales included
International Business Machines Corp., while Johnson  Johnson,
the world&#8217;s biggest maker of health-care products, forecast 2014
earnings that was lower than analysts anticipated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A majority of SP 500 companies -- 71 percent -- have yet
to report earnings, including Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) today, followed by
Boeing Co. (BA), Dow Chemical Co. and Facebook Inc. (FB) tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last season, 74 percent of SP 500 companies beat earnings
estimates and 53 percent exceeded sales projections. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A vice president in technology
operations, Gabriel Magee, died after falling from JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s London headquarters, the bank said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 39-year-old fell from 25 Bank Street in the Canary
Wharf area onto a ninth-floor roof, London&#8217;s Metropolitan Police
said, having been called to the scene at 8:02 this morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magee had worked for JPMorgan since 2004 in the corporate
and investment bank&#8217;s technology support department, the New
York-based lender said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are deeply saddened to have lost a member of the
JPMorgan family at 25 Bank Street today,&#8221; said Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan in London. &#8220;Our thoughts
and sympathy are with his family and his friends.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 11-year-old skyscraper is 33 stories high, according to
building-data provider Emporis. It was formerly the European
headquarters of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which filed for
the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history in 2008. The police are
not treating the death as suspicious and no arrests have been
made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan took over the office and began moving investment
banking staff over to the building in January 2012, according to
the lender&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin Shea, an interest-rate
salesman at Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. who has worked at the firm
for 27 years, is retiring, according to a person briefed on the
decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shea, 48, is leaving as of this month, said the person, who
asked to remain anonymous because the decision hadn&#8217;t been made
public. He joined New York-based Goldman Sachs in 1987 and was
named managing director in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shea worked for 12 years as a trader on the bank&#8217;s U.S.
government debt desk before moving to London as part of the
fixed-income sales group, according to a biography on the
website of Fairfield University in Fairfield, Connecticut, where
Shea earned a bachelor&#8217;s degree in economics and English in
1987. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He returned to Goldman Sachs&#8217;s New York office in 2003,
joining the interest-rate product sales team covering
institutions and macro hedge funds, according to the website. He
also serves on the town council for Ho-Ho-Kus, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shea declined to comment when reached at his office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest-rates trading units on Wall Street suffered as the
Federal Reserve decided whether to taper its stimulus efforts.
Rates trading revenue at the 10 largest global investment banks

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s push to export U.S. oil overseas is facing a new obstacle: falling gasoline prices. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A flood of new oil from Texas to the Great Plains has swamped refineries, driving down prices at the pump 10 percent since March, while global oil prices have hovered at about $107 a barrel. That suggests the world crude market is having waning influence on U.S. gasoline, which instead is beginning to track lower-priced domestic oil. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. supplies are having a greater impact because they&#8217;re making up a bigger part of the gasoline market, supplying about 53 percent today, compared with 34 percent less than three years ago. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As cheaper oil translates to cheaper gasoline, Exxon and ConocoPhillips will have a tougher time convincing legislators that ending export restrictions that date back to 1970s oil shortages would benefit the nation, said Sandy Fielden, director of energy analytics at consultant RBN Energy LLC. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If more exports are allowed, &#8220;The most obvious thing that&#8217;s going to happen is that crude prices will go up and so will gasoline,&#8221; Fielden said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investors are betting the trend will continue, and that West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark for oil, will drop about 17 percent by December 2016. A contract for delivery in that month trades at about $80 a barrel, compared with about $97 today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A rate cut is the European Central
Bank&#8217;s best option to respond to rising borrowing costs in euro-area money markets, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overnight interbank rates were above the central bank&#8217;s
benchmark interest rate this month for the longest stretch since
2011. ECB President Mario Draghi said on Jan. 9 that officials
are ready to &#8220;act as needed&#8221; in response to &#8220;unwarranted
tightening of the short-term money markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is only a matter of time before the ECB will have to
address the issue,&#8221; Dirk Schumacher, an economist at Goldman
Sachs in Frankfurt, said in the e-mailed note. A cut in the key
rate &#8220;seems in principle the best option if the ECB wants to
guarantee short-term money market rates close to zero.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Policy makers gathering in Frankfurt on Feb. 6 for their
monthly rate-setting meeting have to assess whether the tighter
financing conditions show a resurgence of tensions that justify
a policy response or simply increased confidence in the region&#8217;s
economic recovery. The bank cut its benchmark rate to a record-low 0.25 percent in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overnight unsecured lending rate for banks in euros was
above that level for the four days through Jan. 21 and climbed
as high as 0.359 percent on Jan. 20. It fell for a fifth day
yesterday, declining to 0.188 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Liquidity Drop &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excess liquidity in the euro area, the surplus cash in the
financial system that isn&#8217;t immediately needed by banks to meet
their obligations, was at 170.3 billion euros ($232.3 billion)
yesterday after dropping last week to 125.5 billion euros, the
least since December 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ECB failed for a second week to sterilize government
bond purchases conducted under the now-terminated Securities
Markets Program. That may be a signal that banks are reluctant
to part with liquidity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank&#8217;s key rate will fall to 0.1 percent and
the deposit rate, which is currently at zero, to minus 0.1
percent by March, according to Barclays Plc and Commerzbank AG
in reports this month. Royal Bank of Canada said the main rate
will be reduced while the deposit rate stays at zero. Alessandro
Giansanti, a rates strategist at ING Bank NV in Amsterdam, said
the benchmark will be cut within three months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schumacher said that while the ECB will probably keep rates
unchanged at the February meeting, an eventual cut in the
benchmark rate to 0.1 percent would be the &#8220;most effective&#8221;
measure. He said that one &#8220;negative side-effect&#8221; of a
reduction may be that a narrowing of spreads between official
rates could curb the incentive of banks to lend to each other. &lt;/p&gt;

infringed his patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices yesterday left intact a federal appeals court

judge overseeing the trial misinterpreted Bruce Saffran&#8217;s patent
and that, under the correct definition of key terms, JJ&#8217;s
Cordis unit wasn&#8217;t using his invention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The January 2011 jury award was the ninth-largest patent
verdict in U.S. history, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. With more than $111 million in interest, the amount
JJ was told to pay reached $593.4 million. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) will pay
International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) a fee that&#8217;s more than
double the typical size should it fail to acquire IBM&#8217;s low-end
server unit, people familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenovo agreed to pay a reverse breakup fee of 8 percent to
9 percent of the $2.3 billion purchase price, or about $200
million, one of the people said, asking not to be identified
because the details are private. Such fees, where a buyer agrees
to compensate the seller for not closing a deal, are typically
about 3.5 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The size of the fee highlights the risk Lenovo agreed to
bear for its largest-ever purchase ahead of a probable national-security review by the U.S. government. While IBM and Lenovo
expect to clear any regulatory hurdles, they are prepared for
the U.S. to ask for concessions before approving the
transaction, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM demanded a higher-than-standard fee from Lenovo, saying
it would continue discussions with prospective bidder Fujitsu
Ltd. if the Chinese company refused to accept the terms, one
person said. Fujitsu expressed a willingness to pay more than
the $2.3 billion Lenovo offered, though it wasn&#8217;t yet ready to
make a firm bid, a person familiar with the matter said Jan. 24. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bernard Madoff victims who withdrew
more money from the con man&#8217;s firm than they invested -- and
were slated for no recovery -- asked to be excluded from JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s $543 million settlement of lawsuits over the fraud
so they can sue the bank on their own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of 193 investors said in a filing yesterday in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan that the accord between JPMorgan
and Irving Picard, the trustee liquidating Madoff&#8217;s defunct
company, doesn&#8217;t cover &#8220;net winners.&#8221; They asked for court
permission to not be part of the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group&#8217;s lawyer, Helen Davis Chaitman of Becker 
Poliakoff LLP in New York, said she intends to file a new
lawsuit on behalf of these and other victims who say they were
harmed in Madoff&#8217;s $17 billion Ponzi scheme, even though they
didn&#8217;t lose their principal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existing settlement is &#8220;inherently unfair,&#8221; Chaitman
said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ponzi scheme&#8217;s net winners have been fighting for their
rights almost since Madoff&#8217;s 2008 arrest. Their argument is that
they are entitled to rely on the brokerage statements received
from the con man&#8217;s firm and should be compensated accordingly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fictitious Statements &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics, ranging from trustee Picard and appeals court
judges to investigators, say that Madoff clients received
fictitious statements incorporating profits from trades that
never happened, and those who lost money should be compensated
first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a measure, Madoff customers&#8217; assets were originally
estimated at $65 billion, including profits -- almost four times
as much as Picard&#8217;s current calculation of the $17 billion
invested and lost when the Ponzi scheme collapsed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who profited from the Ponzi scheme -- though without
getting all the money reflected on their brokerage statements --
also have battled for their right to sue investors who allegedly
knew about the fraud. Picard and the courts have mostly opposed
them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Kornblau, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment on
the group&#8217;s position on the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Warning Signs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, is seeking to
move on from allegations it helped prolong Madoff&#8217;s fraud by
ignoring warning signs and reaping profit from the con man&#8217;s
business. The bank agreed Jan. 7 to pay $1.7 billion to the U.S.
to resolve criminal allegations and $350 million in a case by
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank simultaneously agreed to pay Picard $325 million
to settle his civil lawsuit on behalf of thousands of victims,
and another $218 million to resolve two related class-action
lawsuits that were filed with Picard&#8217;s assistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hearing on the proposed accord is scheduled for Feb. 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaitman said in yesterday&#8217;s filing that victims who
invested with Madoff for years, and believed the trading in
their accounts was real, are entitled to some of their fake
profit because Madoff deprived them of legitimate investment
opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard has estimated there are about 2,500 net winners who
want to recover some or all of the fake profit they saw on their
customer account statements. &#8220;Net losers&#8221; withdrew less money
from Madoff&#8217;s firm than they put in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Parallel Efforts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the class-action lawsuits, JPMorgan is accused of aiding
and abetting embezzlement, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust
enrichment and gross negligence in relation to Madoff&#8217;s fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parallel efforts by the trustee and federal
investigators have resulted in a total recovery for victims of
almost $14 billion, or 82 percent of the lost principal. Picard
has distributed about $4.9 billion to victims, with billions
more held in reserve until legal issues are resolved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaitman and Picard&#8217;s spokeswoman, Amanda Remus, both
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 75, pleaded guilty to fraud in 2009 and is serving
a 150-year sentence at a federal prison in North Carolina.
Others including his brother Peter Madoff, who is serving a 10-year term, have pleaded guilty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five members of Madoff&#8217;s inner circle, who worked for the
con man for decades, are on trial in Manhattan federal court on
charges of helping perpetuate the fraud to get rich. The five
have pleaded not guilty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The liquidation case is Securities Investor Protection
Corp. v. Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, 08-bk-01789, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former JPMorgan Chase  Co. bankers
Michael Scherb and Verne Grinstead raised $375 million from
investors to target acquisitions of mining assets through their
Appian Natural Resources Fund LP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The whole thesis was really created when I was at
JPMorgan, when I could see that traditional sources of capital
were going to dry up to the industry,&#8221; Scherb, who founded
Appian two years ago after leaving the bank, said in a phone
interview from London yesterday. &#8220;I thought that private equity
made sense. I thought it made sense to match long-term capital
to a long-term industry.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Declining prices and a tapering in demand for commodities
has dried up financing for new mining projects as investors
retreat from the industry. Appian started raising funds a year
ago and got commitments of $1 billion from investors, Scherb
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think are real firepower is probably actually double
what our fund size is, so we want to deploy around $750 million
in the space,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have a very strong co-investment
component, a lot of that from investors who didn&#8217;t make it into
the fund, or overflow from investors who did make it into the
fund but wanted to invest more.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appian joins a swathe new private equity funds focused on
the mining industry that are betting on a resurgence in demand
for key commodities like copper, coal and zinc. X2 Resources,
led by former Xstrata Plc (GLEN) Chief Executive Officer Mick Davis, is
seeking to raise at least $3 billion from investors before it
starts buying mines, people with knowledge of the plan said last
week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mining Executives &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jersey-based Appian is run by a six-member management team
including founder Scherb, Grinstead and managing partner Vincent Jacheet, who was part of setting up Bain Capital LLC in Europe.
The team also includes three former mining industry executives
to provide operational experience to the fund, Scherb, who
advised mining firms while at JPMorgan, said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appian has completed three deals, including an acquisition
in Red Eagle Mining Corp. in September which boosted the fund&#8217;s
stake in the company to 15.3 percent, and has invested just
under $100 million so far, he said. Two more acquisitions, one
in Latin America and one in Africa, will be announced by the end
of March, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We really want to deploy our capital over the next two
years, our pipeline is pretty robust,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) and Rio Tinto Group (RIO), the two largest
mining companies, are among mineral producers making or planning
mine disposals that may total a combined $35 billion, Deutsche
Bank AG has estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Africa, Europe &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund is actively bidding on assets being disposed of by
major mining companies, Scherb said. Appian is seeking
acquisitions in North America, Latin America, Africa and Europe
with an investment size of about $10 million to $100 million and
targeting those where first production can be realized within
three years, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appian is looking at five to seven projects or companies
every week and declining about 90 percent of them, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see a lot of value out there, we see valuations having
dropped off tremendously and it allows us good entry
opportunities,&#8221; Scherb said. &#8220;There are good assets out there
that are just unloved by the market or undiscovered by the
market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s main exchange operator will
start trading JPX-Nikkei Index 400 futures this year, according
to the head of the unit that will list the derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Osaka Securities Exchange may offer the contracts from
about November, said President Hiromi Yamaji. Japan Exchange
Group Inc. was formed from the merger of the nation&#8217;s two
biggest bourses last year, with cash trading moving to Tokyo and
OSE managing the derivatives business. The JPX-Nikkei 400, a
measure with member companies selected for higher return-on-equity and profits, began trading this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I am sure that we will start trading the futures within
the year,&#8221; said Yamaji, a former executive at Nomura Holdings
Inc. who was announced as OSE president in April. &#8220;Investors
need futures for hedging purposes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nikkei 225 Stock Average moved an average 1.3 percent
each day last year as it surged 57 percent for the biggest gain
among developed markets. That compares with 0.5 percent average
daily swings on the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. The JPX-Nikkei 400 seeks to divert investors
toward companies that use cash efficiently and have management
that is focused on creating value for investors, Japan Exchange (8697)
and Nikkei Inc., which compile the gauge, said in November. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coface SA, the French credit insurer
owned by investment bank Natixis (KN) SA, is working with its parent
and JPMorgan Chase  Co. as it prepares for an initial public
offering, people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coface may raise about 500 million euros ($678 million) in
an IPO being planned for this year, said one of the people, who
asked not to be named because the details are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natixis plans to sell Coface shares on the stock market by
the end of June as part of a plan to invest more in wholesale
banking, asset management and &#8220;specialized&#8221; financial
services, Chief Executive Officer Laurent Mignon said in
November. The volume of equity capital market deals in Europe
almost doubled last year, data compiled by Bloomberg show,
encouraging companies to line up asset sales for 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokeswomen for the banks declined to comment. A
spokeswoman for Coface didn&#8217;t respond to a request for comment
left outside regular business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coface had an operating profit of 189 million euros on
revenue of 1.57 billion euros in 2012, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, the highest-paid head of a
U.S. bank for 2012, saw his bonus increase 11 percent to $21
million for his work last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, who also serves as chairman, received 88,422
restricted shares on Jan. 28 valued at $14.7 million, according
to a regulatory filing. He also got a cash award amounting to
the typical 30 percent of his total bonus, according to a person
with knowledge of the payout. On that basis, the cash portion of
his bonus would be about $6.3 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS) boosted stock
awards for their CEOs this month after an improving U.S. economy
drove up bank shares in 2013. Goldman Sachs had an 11 percent
return on equity last year, topping its largest Wall Street
rivals, while cutting pay costs amid revenue that was little
changed. The stock jumped 39 percent in the year, more than the
33 percent climb in the SP 500 Financials Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein&#8217;s bonus and $2 million salary amount to $3
million more than what JPMorgan paid CEO Jamie Dimon. It was the
second straight year that Blankfein out-earned his rival.
Blankfein also got a $5 million long-term incentive a year ago
tied to performance targets. Details of any 2014 long-term
incentive will be disclosed later this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pandora Media Inc. (P), the online radio
service, rose to a record high after Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
projected the stock has the potential to more than double in the
next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pandora climbed 11 percent to $36.53 at the close in New
York, its highest price since it sold shares in June 2011. The
stock almost tripled in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares may top $60 in the next year if Pandora doubles
advertising, increases its mix of local commercials to half of
all ads and leverages fixed content costs, Heath Terry, an
analyst at Goldman Sachs in New York, wrote today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The next two years are critical for the development of
Pandora&#8217;s long-term revenue trajectory and royalty rates,&#8221;
wrote Terry, who has a buy rating on the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pandora is chasing the $15 billion spent each year in the
U.S. on local radio advertising by opening sales offices in the
biggest cities. The Oakland, California-based company is seeking
to make its share of U.S. radio ads more closely match its share
of radio listening, which was more than 8 percent last month.
Pandora has said it runs less than 1 percent of U.S. radio ads. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. and Patria
Investimentos SA are poised to benefit from a telecommunications
building boom in Brazil as mobile-phone providers need companies
to construct towers costing $320 million to $820 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman, Patria and at least six other private-equity firms
are backing five local tower builders as phone operators from
Tim Participacoes SA (TIMP3) to Telefonica Brasil SA (VIVT4) shift from
constructing their own towers to contracting the work out.
Operators will seek bids to build about 3,900 towers, more than
half the 6,680 new towers needed in 2014 to improve networks,
according to forecasts from one of the builders, who asked not
to be identified because the estimates aren&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil is trying to boost services and reduce dropped calls
as surging demand for high-speed Internet strains the current
network. The country has about 61,000 towers installed today --
slightly more than in the U.K., which is 1/20th the size and has
a third of the population, said Chahram Zolfaghari, chief
executive officer of builder Brazil Tower Co., the builder
that&#8217;s backed by investment firm 1848 Capital Partners LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re not talking about 10 percent or 20 percent growth -
- it&#8217;s like 100 percent,&#8221; Zolfaghari said in an interview at
Bloomberg&#8217;s Sao Paulo office about the number of towers needed
in Brazil. &#8220;They need to be doubled to properly attend to
current needs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blackstone, Fishman &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Gavea Investimentos Ltda., the Brazilian
hedge-fund firm founded by former central bank president Arminio Fraga, last year unveiled tower-investment fund Cell Site
Solutions, while Patria Investimentos SA, a firm that includes
Blackstone Group LP (BX) among its investors, has allocated 300
million reais ($123 million) of capital to its Highline do
Brasil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other companies planning to build towers in Brazil are T4U
Tower Management, which is backed by Israel&#8217;s Fishman Group; QMC
Telecom International Holdings, whose investors include Peterson
Partners LP and Housatonic Partners; and Brazil Tower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An outside spokeswoman for Goldman declined to comment on
behalf of the company, as did an outside spokesman for Patria.
Representatives from Peterson, Fishman and QMC didn&#8217;t respond to
requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Brazilians are buying smartphones, while providers
like Telefonica&#8217;s Vivo brand and America Movil SAB (AMX)&#8217;s Claro unit
are pushing data services to boost revenue, according to the
companies&#8217; financial reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Regulatory Crackdown &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim was among the companies forced by regulatory agency
Anatel to stop selling new lines for about 10 days in 2012 to
address complaints about dropped calls. The crackdown, along
with millions of reais in fines in the past several years, is
putting pressure on companies to improve customer satisfaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vivo needs 10,000 new towers in the next two years to meet
traffic growth and government quality mandates, Chief Executive
Officer Antonio Carlos Valente said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are starting to feel difficulties in the availability
of steel and labor,&#8221; Valente said about challenges in building
new towers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anatel doesn&#8217;t regulate the tower market and sees demand
increasing significantly in coming years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a good business for tower builders,&#8221; said Anatel
Superintendent Carlos Baigorri. &#8220;Third-party tower builders
will allow operators to focus on their core business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 6,680 new sites needed in Brazil, about 2,780 will
be towers built by the operators themselves or shared towers in
which companies install equipment alongside competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Profitable Sites &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil Tower builds towers for 200,000 reais to 500,000
reais apiece, its CEO says. That values the 3,900 to be built by
third parties at 780 million to 2 billion reais, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Brazil Tower then expects to sell
the sites in bulk for as much as $300,000 each, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tower operating companies including SBA Communications
Corp. (SBAC) and American Tower Corp. (AMT) have been expanding in the past
two years as wireless providers prefer to lease towers rather
than maintain them internally to preserve cash and limit
investments. SBA agreed last month to pay 1.53 billion reais for
2,007 Oi towers, or about 760,000 reais per tower -- more than
twice the rate it paid for a previous acquisition of other Oi
towers, according to Wells Fargo  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have a long-term view of the market,&#8221; Kurt Bagwell,
SBA&#8217;s international president, said in a phone interview. &#8220;We
basically try to predict the growth of the revenue of these
sites over time and we feel that the price we paid for these
works for our business, no problem.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SBA rose 1.9 percent to $92.29 at the close in New York,
while American Tower rose 2 percent to $81.18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Open Door &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cell Site, Brazil Tower, Highline do Brasil, T4U and QMC --
the five largest builders in Brazil -- have the capacity to
construct only as many as 1,600 towers a year, opening the door
for other companies to step in to help build towers, according
to the investor analysis obtained by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Everybody wants to do business in Brazil -- the problem
is that to do business in Brazil is so difficult,&#8221; Brazil
Tower&#8217;s Zolfaghari said. &#8220;Just in the state of Florida, you
have 60 companies like us. Why do you think I&#8217;m in Brazil? Over
there I would be one guy among hundreds.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s
largest oil producer by market value, said fourth-quarter profit
dropped the most in four years as it pumped less natural gas
from wells and energy prices stagnated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income fell 16 percent to $8.35 billion, or $1.91 a
share, from $9.95 billion, or $2.20, a year earlier, the Irving,
Texas-based company said in a statement today. Exxon was
expected to post per-share profit of $1.91, based on the average
of 18 analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s global output dropped for the ninth time in 10
quarters, disappointing investors who had been encouraged when
the company snapped its losing streak during the July-to-September period, said Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward
Jones  Co. Exxon hasn&#8217;t sustained output growth for two
consecutive quarters since the first half of 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Production fell again so the question becomes,&#8216;Have they
already lost the momentum they gained in the last quarter,&#8217;&#8221;
Youngberg said in a telephone interview from St. Louis today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales declined 3.3 percent to $110.86 billion. Exxon&#8217;s
shares fell 1.2 percent to $93.99 at the close in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon pumped the equivalent of 4.216 million barrels of
crude a day during the final three months of 2013, the lowest
fourth-quarter output since 2010, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gas Declines &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 1.5 percent rise in crude production, led by new wells in
the Western Hemisphere, was more than canceled out by a 5.2
percent decline in gas output, the company said. Gas supplies
fell in every region of the world where Exxon does business
except for Canada and South America, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent crude, the benchmark for more than half the world&#8217;s
oil, declined 0.7 percent to an average of $109.35 a barrel
during the final three months of last year. U.S. natural gas
rose 8.8 percent to $3.85 per million British thermal units.
West Texas Intermediate crude, the bellwether U.S. oil, climbed
11 percent to $97.61 a barrel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refining and marketing profit tumbled 48 percent to $916
million. Exxon&#8217;s chemical earnings dropped 5 percent to $910
million, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon earns about three-quarters of its global net income
outside the U.S., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson is
seeking to revive production growth and limit costs amid
shrinking access to the world&#8217;s remaining untapped petroleum
reservoirs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s majority-owned Canadian subsidiary, Imperial Oil
Ltd. (IMO), said profit declined to C$1.056 billion ($946 million), or
C$1.24 a share, from C$1.076 billion, or C$1.26, a year earlier.
Record earnings from processing crude into fuels were more than
offset by slumping prices received for Imperial&#8217;s western
Canadian crude, the Calgary-based company said in a statement
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imperial fell 0.6 percent to C$45.52 in Toronto. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Football League is
creating a personalized video service to take advantage of what
one of its executives called a &#8220;borderline insatiable&#8221;
appetite for its content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NFL Now will begin this summer, said Brian Rolapp, the
league&#8217;s executive vice president of Media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The appetite for NFL content is borderline insatiable,&#8221;
Rolapp said during a press conference in New York, across the
Hudson River from where the league will stage its first outdoor,
cold-weather Super Bowl on Feb. 2 in East Rutherford, New
Jersey. &#8220;Mobile advertising is not the biggest revenue stream,
but it certainly is the fastest growing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ), Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO),
and Proctor  Gamble Co. (PG)&#8217;s Gillette are initial launch partners
for the digital service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The NFL has always focused on reaching as many fans as
possible -- wherever they are,&#8221; Commissioner Roger Goodell
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NFL is the most-watched U.S. sports league, generating
about $10 billion in annual revenue last season. According to
the league, 205 million people tuned into games this past
season, and 34 of the 35 most-watched shows in the fall season
were NFL games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our fans can&#8217;t get enough of our content,&#8221; said Jonathan Kraft, part owner of the New England Patriots and co-chair of
the league&#8217;s Digital Media Committee. &#8220;More and more they are
living their lives on a tablet, on a phone.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The league said that 60 percent of digital consumption
occurs from Tuesday-Saturday with the remaining 40 percent
Sunday and Monday, when a majority of games are played. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dual Revenue &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The venture will be supported by a dual revenue stream,
including advertising, Rolapp said. Additionally, while much of
the content will be free, there will be a subscription component
for premium content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What we hear from advertisers -- we want mobile, we want
video,&#8221; Rolapp said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users can indicate their favorite team or fantasy players
and the content stream will personalize each user&#8217;s feed. The
content will be created by the NFL specifically for mobile
devices instead of repackaged video from television broadcasts,
Rolapp said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks led by Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and Citigroup Inc. say commodities are heading for losses
in 2014 as rising supplies and slowing demand compound slumps
that led to bear markets last year in gold, copper and corn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open interest measuring holdings across the 24 commodities
tracked by the Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI Spot Index (BUSY) fell for three
straight quarters through December, the longest slump since the
global recession in 2008. The super cycle that led commodities
to almost quadruple since 2001 is reversing, with prices set to
drop 3 percent in 12 months, Goldman said. The asset class will
be a &#8220;wallflower&#8221; compared with equities, Citigroup said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raw materials from copper and corn to sugar and coffee will
be in surplus this year after a decade-long bull market spurred
producers to build new mines, drill more wells and expand
planting of crops. Investors pulled a record $43.3 billion last
year from commodity funds tracked by EPFR Global, and hedge
funds cut bullish bets across 18 U.S. futures by 53 percent from
an all-time high in September 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Supply growth is still formidable across most
commodities,&#8221; said Rob Haworth, a Seattle-based senior
investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, which
oversees $115 billion. &#8220;It will take some time for actual
demand trends to start to overwhelm that increasing supply.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP GSCI dropped 0.8 percent this month and 2.2 percent
last year, while the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities
slid 3.5 percent, after surging 20 percent in 2013. The
Bloomberg Dollar Index, a gauge against 10 major trading
partners, has climbed 1.1 percent since the end of December. The
Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index advanced 1.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lagging Equities &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index, which measures
investor returns after some rolling positions are taken into
account, will drop 3 percent in the next 12 months, Goldman said
in a Jan. 12 report. Precious metals will lose 15 percent, while
agriculture will decline 11 percent, the bank said. Industrial
metals will decrease 5 percent, livestock 3 percent, and energy
will fall 1 percent, Jeffrey Currie, the bank&#8217;s head of
commodities research, said in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are still at below-trend GDP growth, and typically in
this environment you see weak commodity returns and low
volatility,&#8221; Currie said by e-mail Jan. 22. &#8220;The expectations
are the U.S. grows near trend, but Europe won&#8217;t, and the
emerging markets won&#8217;t. If the growth was above trend
everywhere, we&#8217;d be jumping into commodities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More Supply &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the 18 euro-area nations emerged from the longest
recession since they began using the currency 15 years ago,
economic growth this year will be just 1 percent, below the
annual average of 1.5 percent since 1997, according to 56
economists in a Bloomberg survey. China, the top user of
everything from zinc to cotton, will expand 7.5 percent, the
slowest pace since 1990, a Bloomberg survey showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP GSCI gauge surged 170 percent from the end of 1999
to Dec. 31, 2009, the most of any decade since the data begins
in 1971. Higher commodity prices encouraged investment in new
production technology and expanded development of farms, oil
reserves and mines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global refined-copper output this year will jump to 22.2
million metric tons, or 55 percent more than in 1999, according
to New York-based researcher CPM Group. Last year&#8217;s record corn
harvest of 13.925 billion bushels in the U.S., the world&#8217;s
largest grower and exporter, was 48 percent bigger than the
harvest 15 years earlier, government data show. World crude-oil
output has expanded by 19 percent since 1999, according to the
U.S. Energy Information Administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Back Seat&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP GSCI lagged behind the MSCI equity index for two
straight years, the first time that&#8217;s occurred since 1998.
Commodities will continue to take a &#8220;back seat&#8221; to other
assets because raw-material gains from 2009 to 2011 were &#8220;built
on unsustainable factors,&#8221; Citigroup analysts including Jon Bergtheil and David Wilson said in a Jan. 6 report. Metals have
&#8220;little encouragement&#8221; from the balance of supply and demand
this year, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;super cycle&#8221; has ended because supply has caught up
with demand, Citigroup said in November 2012. A year later,
analysts led by Ed Morse said the bank &#8220;remains neutral to
bearish commodities&#8221; with muted demand expected in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Producers expanded output, after tight supplies led to a
tripling of the SP GSCI since the end of 1999, with record
prices for commodities including oil, gold and copper. More
supply led to a divergence of commodity and equity markets that
had rallied together since the recession, Goldman&#8217;s Currie said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bullish Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. says commodity bears are &#8220;overly
confident on the reliability of supply&#8221; and underestimate
demand. All but eight of the 65 commodity indices the bank
tracks will gain over the next two years, with five of them
posting double-digit annual returns, analysts led by Colin Fenton wrote in a Dec. 30 report. The &#8220;super cycle&#8221; is &#8220;just
beyond its midpoint,&#8221; and the markets are still in the &#8220;bull
phases,&#8221; JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Monetary Fund raised this year&#8217;s global
growth forecast to 3.7 percent, from an October estimate of 3.6
percent. The jobless rate in the U.S. fell to a five-year low
last month, and Euro-area factory output grew faster than
economists forecast in January, according to Markit Economics.
The U.S. is the top consumer of corn and crude oil. Europe
accounts for about 18 percent of copper demand and 14 percent of
global energy use, Barclays and BP Plc data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caterpillar Inc., the largest maker of mining and
construction equipment, sees global growth this year at 3
percent, up from 2 percent in 2013, the Peoria, Illinois-based
company said in a Jan. 27 statement. That will boost demand for
mined commodities and energy, keeping most prices high enough
&#8220;to make investments attractive,&#8221; the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Demand Continues &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even if we don&#8217;t see a sharp rebound in China, emerging
markets in general, they are still growing, and that economic
growth would bode well for continued demand for food,&#8221; said
Peter Sorrentino, a senior portfolio manager who helps manage
about $4.7 billion at Huntington Asset Advisors in Cincinnati.
&#8220;As the population becomes more affluent, even in slower
growth, diets continue to improve, and demand for higher volumes
of food and better quality, that should continue.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold and silver, after plunging last year by the most since
1981, should see &#8220;a decent rebound coming&#8221; as mines cut back
on output, Sorrentino said. &#8220;It&#8217;s just purely based on physical
volumes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bearish Bets &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds and other large speculators have reduced their
net-long holdings to 735,217 futures and options across 18 U.S.-
traded commodities as of Jan. 21, compared to the all-time high
of 1.56 million, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data
show. Only eight of the 139 funds, including ETFs, in the Lipper
Global Commodity group made money last year, according to fund
data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are &#8220;shades of bearishness&#8221; across commodities,
Morgan Stanley analysts said in a Jan. 17 report. The stronger
dollar in 2014 will be a &#8220;major problem,&#8221; Julien Garran, a
London-based analyst at UBS AG, said in a Jan. 20 report. Supply
growth also puts prices &#8220;at risk,&#8221; Deutsche Bank said in a
Jan. 14 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should stay underweight agriculture, gold and
silver this year, Societe Generale SA said in a Jan. 10 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West Texas Intermediate crude oil will drop 8.1 percent to
$90 a barrel in 12 months, Goldman forecasts. The U.S. is
extracting the most oil since 1989 as producers tap shale-rock
formations, cutting costs for refiners and driving fuel prices
at the pump down 9.8 percent since March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total domestic petroleum consumption averaged 18.8 million
barrels a day in the four weeks ended Jan. 17, the lowest since
Oct. 18., government data show. Global output will rise faster
than demand this year and next, the EIA estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Precious Metals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For gold investors, there&#8217;s &#8220;more pain to come&#8221; after
prices tumbled 28 percent last year, the most since 1981, Morgan
Stanley analysts Peter Richardson and Joel Crane wrote in a
report Jan. 22. The bank cut its 2014 target 12 percent to
$1,160 an ounce. Goldman sees prices at $1,050 in the next 12
months. Investors lost faith in the metal as a store of value
amid a rally in equities and muted inflation. Holdings through
exchange-traded products fell 33 percent in the past year,
erasing $68.8 billion from the value of the funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper prices will slump 13 percent to $6,200 a metric ton,
Goldman projects. Supplies will top demand by 385,000 tons this
year, up from a surplus of 45,000 tons in 2013, the bank said in
a Jan. 21 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Agriculture Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP GSCI Agricultural Index of eight crops fell 22
percent last year, the biggest slump since 1981, as record
harvests from India to the U.S. expanded supplies. Corn futures
have tumbled 50 percent from a record $8.49 a bushel in August
2012. Worldwide wheat output will be at an all-time high for the
fourth time in six years, U.S. government data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global food costs tracked by the United Nations dropped 14
percent from an all-time high in February 2011. J.M. Smucker
Co., the Orrville, Ohio-based maker of Folgers coffee, is
passing along savings from the lower cost of beans via
promotions, Chief Executive Officer Richard Smucker said on a
Nov. 20 earnings conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cost inflation peaked in the six months through Nov. 24 at
General Mills Inc., the maker of Cheerios cereal, and the rate
will &#8220;ease in the second half&#8221; of the fiscal year that ends
May 31, Chief Executive Officer Kendall J. Powell said on an
earnings call Dec. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s adequate inventories in grains and in copper,&#8221;
said Donald Selkin, who helps manage about $3 billion of assets
as chief market strategist at National Securities Corp. in New
York. &#8220;Crude-oil inventories are going to return to excess once
cold weather is done. Commodities should drift lower in an
overall sense, absolutely.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Siddharth Prabhu, the head of
corporate-credit index trading at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., has
left the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiffany Galvin, a spokeswoman for the New York-based bank,
confirmed the departure and declined to comment further. Prabhu,
who didn&#8217;t immediately return an e-mail seeking comment, joined
Goldman Sachs in 2001 and became a managing director in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, which
contains 125 companies from Ford Motor Co. to Staples Inc., is
one of the most liquid credit instruments. Banks, hedge funds
and other money managers have bought and sold a net $81.6
billion of the current high-grade benchmark swaps index as of
Jan. 24, according to the Depository Trust  Clearing Corp.,
which runs a central repository for the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sean Meeker, the head of loan and loan credit-default swap
trading, and Jeff Bahl, the head of U.S. high-yield corporate
bond trading, left Goldman Sachs in December, the bank confirmed
at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leveraged loans and high-risk, high-yield bonds are rated
below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and lower than BBB- at
Standard  Poor&#8217;s. Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a
borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the
defaulted debt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V), the biggest bank-card
network, posted fiscal first-quarter profit that beat analysts&#8217;
estimates as card spending climbed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income for the three months ended Dec. 31 rose 8.8
percent to $1.41 billion, or $2.20 a share, from $1.29 billion,
or $1.93, a year earlier, the Foster City, California-based firm
said today in a statement. The average estimate of 30 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was for adjusted profit of $2.16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf, 48, is seeking ways
to increase business outside the U.S., where Visa gets more than
half its revenue, amid a global shift to electronic payments
from cash. The firm has returned almost $17 billion to investors
since its 2008 initial public offering and last year was the
sixth-best performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average,
gaining 47 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We feel very good about the strong financial
performance,&#8221; Scharf said on a conference call to discuss
results. &#8220;Holiday spend in the U.S. was better than reported.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa rose 1.6 percent to $220.57 at 9:56 a.m. in New York.
The shares have declined 1.7 percent this year, compared with
the 4.7 percent slide of the 30-company Dow. Smaller rival
MasterCard Inc. (MA), which reports results before U.S. markets open
tomorrow, climbed 1.6 percent to $78.97. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) made about
$350 million on &#8220;worthless&#8221; derivatives trades after exerting
&#8220;undue influence&#8221; on managers of the Libyan Investment
Authority, according to the sovereign-wealth fund, the second-largest in Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LIA sued Goldman Sachs on Jan. 21 in London over 
investments of about $1 billion made in 2008. The fund said in 
court documents released today that its executives, who were 
given gifts of chocolate and after-shave by the bank, never 
understood the transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The unique circumstances allowed Goldman Sachs to take
advantage of the LIA&#8217;s extremely limited financial and legal
experience to deliberately exploit its position of influence and
to take advantage in a way that generated colossal losses for
the LIA but substantial profits for Goldman Sachs,&#8221; LIA
Chairman AbdulMagid Breish said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libya&#8217;s sovereign wealth fund built up assets of about $60
billion under Muammar Qaddafi, who was deposed and killed in a
2011 coup. The LIA lost about $1.75 billion betting on
structured products in 2007 and 2008, about $900 million of
which was with Goldman Sachs, its former chairman, Mohsen Derregia, said in June 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trips, Gifts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staff at the New York-based bank offered to train LIA
employees at its London offices, took them on a trip to Morocco
and bought them gifts to build a relationship, the fund said in
the court filing. The 2008 derivatives were linked to shares in
Citigroup Inc. (C), Electricite de France and Banco Santander SA. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V) Chief Executive Officer
Charlie Scharf said he&#8217;s more confident in traditional payment
networks than in virtual currencies like Bitcoin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are certainly some interesting things about Bitcoin
and other things like it, but there are also a great deal of
complexities,&#8221; Scharf said today on a conference call to
discuss quarterly results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Payments networks such as Foster City, California-based
Visa are safer for consumers because of &#8220;the established
network rules we have, the understanding of how things operate,
understanding who the participants are, the fact that the
business that we do has financial institutions on either side of
the transaction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Visa will continue to pay attention to developments
surrounding Bitcoin, &#8220;we feel very comfortable with the
business that we have here,&#8221; Scharf said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa is the biggest bank-card network. Scharf is a former
senior executive at JPMorgan Chase  Co., the largest U.S. bank. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia refused to give a A$25
million ($21.8 million) grant to local fruit processor SPC
Ardmona Ltd. saying parent Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd. (CCL) was capable of
restructuring the company without government support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Amatil is a &#8220;very, very strong business,&#8221; Prime
Minister Tony Abbott told reporters in Canberra today after his
Cabinet decided to turn down the request for aid. &#8220;This is a
business which well and truly has the resources to ensure that
SPC Ardmona is in a strong position to restructure.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbott&#8217;s government, elected in September vowing to cut
taxes and ease red tape for businesses, has said it doesn&#8217;t
believe in &#8220;corporate welfare&#8221; to prop up ailing companies.
Coca-Cola Amatil had applied for temporary tariff protection to
stop imported packaged fruit being dumped into Australia and
sought a government grant to support a restructuring of the
unit&#8217;s operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Amatil, which had pledged to invest A$90 million
in the unit contingent on the grant being approved, said the
decision meant a further A$25 million in aid from Victoria state
wouldn&#8217;t go ahead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will undertake a review of the unit&#8217;s carrying
value and a write down of its assets, with details to be
announced at its full-year results on Feb. 18, it said in a
regulatory statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares in Coca-Cola Amatil declined 11 percent last year,
compared with a 15 percent gain for the benchmark SP/ASX 200
Index. The announcement came after the market closed in Sydney,
and the stock ended down 0.9 percent at A$11.79. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sydney-based company said in a November trading update
it expected earnings before interest and tax in the year ending
Dec. 31 to be as much as 7 percent lower than the previous year,
before significant items. Net income fell 12 percent to A$216
million in the six months through June, Coca-Cola Amatil
reported Aug. 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SPC Ardmona has produced and canned tomatoes, stone fruit
and vegetables in Australia&#8217;s southeast for more than 90 years,
according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s sale of Motorola Mobility holds a clear lesson for Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s acquisition of another smartphone maker, Nokia Oyj (NOK1V): Be a hardware or software company, not both. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lenovo Group Ltd. (992)&#8217;s purchase of Motorola&#8217;s consumer-hardware business, which Google bought two years ago for $12.4 billion including patents, lets the search company refocus on software and exit competition with other manufacturers of smartphones based on its Android software. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft is on track to close its $7.4 billion acquisition of Nokia&#8217;s handset business this quarter, seeking to regain lost ground in a market where its 3.7 percent share is eclipsed by Android and Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPhone. Unless Microsoft can combine software and hardware as expertly as Apple has done with its products, the software maker will be better off without Nokia, according to Michael Cusumano, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#8217;s Sloan School of Management. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s no point in having a hardware unit inside a software company unless you marry the two the way Apple does,&#8221; Cusumano said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While scrapping the Nokia deal isn&#8217;t a likely prospect right now, Cusumano said it could happen later. Microsoft, which is in the middle of a search for a new chief executive officer, has staked its future as a devices and services company. Steve Ballmer, who is retiring as CEO once his successor takes over, reorganized the Redmond, Washington-based company around the strategy last year and sealed the Nokia deal in September to accelerate the transition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the Seattle Seahawks lose to the Denver Broncos in Sunday&#8217;s Super Bowl, the team has rewarded owner Paul Allen -- by beating his old company, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), as an investment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Allen bought the pro football team as a favor to his native city in 1997, when his heart was in basketball and his investing firepower was focused on a heady concept he called the &#8220;wired world.&#8221; The too-early bet on the convergence of television and the Internet flopped, losing him more than $8 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, with Microsoft searching for direction, Allen&#8217;s investments have recovered from that rocky stretch thanks in part to the football team he once said he purchased out of &#8220;civic duty.&#8221; The Seahawks, buoyed by TV broadcast fees, are worth about six times what Allen paid. In the same period, Microsoft shares have a little more than doubled as the Redmond, Washington-based company struggled to make its software relevant to mobile phones and tablets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team&#8217;s success has rewarded Allen, 61, in other ways, showering the programmer and librarian&#8217;s son with affection in a city mad for the Seahawks. Pike Place Market florists sell roses dyed in team colors of blue and green. The &#8220;12th Man&#8221; flags honoring the city&#8217;s famously loud fans adorn lawns, offices and the Space Needle. The crowd cheered Allen at a Jan. 19 playoff game when he raised one of the pennants. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This 12th Man thing is everywhere,&#8221; Bill Gates, the Seattle high school friend who co-founded Microsoft with Allen in 1975, said after appearing on Bloomberg TV in New York last week. &#8220;The whole city is pretty energized.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Microsoft Stake &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, by measures other than the simple change in value, Microsoft performs better. While a sports franchise isn&#8217;t a liquid investment, Allen has been able to whittle his 28 percent Microsoft stake to less than 2 percent, collecting more than $20 billion along the way. He still holds about 100 million shares, which have earned him $800 million in dividends after taxes in the past decade, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes called Microsoft&#8217;s &#8220;other&#8221; founder, Allen published a 2011 memoir, &#8220;Idea Man,&#8221; detailing his productive and at times contentious relationship with Gates. Money hasn&#8217;t been everything to him, post-Microsoft. After a brush with Hodgkin&#8217;s disease led him to leave in 1983, he started using his wealth for &#8220;a life of adventure and discovery,&#8221; as a website promoting the book put it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Electric Guitar &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;He travels on his helipad-equipped yacht to Antarctica, plays electric guitar in all-star bands with famous friends including Dan Aykroyd and collects Impressionist art. The Seahawks aren&#8217;t his only pro team; he acquired what he called his &#8220;first love,&#8221; the Portland Trail Blazers basketball franchise, in 1988. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When his failed investments in cable and technology businesses helped shrink a $36 billion fortune by more than half, Allen a decade ago brought in a new team of professional money managers who diversified into such areas as real estate, insurance and energy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For one of the technology visionaries of the 20th century, low-tech investments led a turnaround. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vulcan Inc., Allen&#8217;s Seattle investment firm, has remade a onetime warehouse district north of downtown into a destination neighborhood of shops, restaurants and offices anchored by Amazon.com Inc. The online retailer agreed to pay Vulcan $1.16 billion for an 11-building campus in the South Lake Union neighborhood in 2012. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Bakken Investment &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2011, Allen, through Vulcan, was the only individual investor in a KKR  Co.-led syndicate that paid $7.2 billion for most of Samson Investment Co., an oil and natural gas producer with interests in more than 7,600 wells, including North Dakota&#8217;s Bakken region. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That same year, Vulcan scored a $1 billion gain on an investment in Plains All American Pipeline LP, a Houston-based pipeline operator. Vulcan also has an investment in Driven Brands Inc., a Charlotte, North Carolina company that includes the Maaco collision-repair chain, Meineke Car Care Centers and Econo Lube N&#8217; Tune  Brakes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Allen declined to comment for this article. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The billionaire also uses his fortune to back research in fields that fascinate him. In September he founded the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, which will try to develop machines that can field user questions and discuss them in natural language -- something like Captain Kirk&#8217;s computer in the &#8220;Star Trek&#8221; TV show. He&#8217;s already committed $500 million to another Seattle lab called the Allen Institute for Brain Science, where researchers are trying to determine which genes are most important for the workings of the brain. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Net Worth &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a real passion for understanding how intelligence works, from the biological perspective as well as the computer perspective,&#8221; said Matt McIlwain, managing director at Madrona Venture Group, a Seattle firm that has invested alongside Vulcan. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Allen&#8217;s net worth, which was $12.4 billion in 2003, has recovered to $15.7 billion, ranking him among the world&#8217;s 60 wealthiest, according to the Bloomberg ranking. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He didn&#8217;t set out to buy the Seahawks, considered by odds makers a slight underdog to the Broncos in the Feb. 2 Super Bowl. Local politicians approached Allen to buy the team when it threatened to move to California. He paid $194 million for the franchise and contributed another $130 million toward construction of a new stadium in Seattle. The team is now worth $1.25 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Asset a &#8216;Jewel&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a jewel of an asset,&#8221; said Steve Patterson, athletic director at the University of Texas and previously a sports business consultant to National Football League owners, including Allen. Patterson was also general manager of the Trail Blazers from 2003 to 2007. While Seattle is only the 13th-largest media market, the Seahawks draw fan support from Portland and other Pacific Northwest cities, making it more like No. 4, Patterson said. They&#8217;ve even drawn the loyalty of fans across the border in Vancouver. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For all of Allen&#8217;s Seahawks success, pro football isn&#8217;t a sure-fire bet, especially because of growing awareness of the dangers of concussions, said New York sports media consultant Chris Bevilacqua. A federal judge this month denied approval of the NFL&#8217;s $914 million settlement of a lawsuit brought by more than 5,000 former players, saying it may be insufficient to cover all future concussion claims. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are risks and rewards across the marketplace, and that&#8217;s one of the risks,&#8221; Bevilacqua said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The connection hasn&#8217;t escaped Allen, whose family foundation said in November that it&#8217;s spending $2.4 million for researchers at his brain lab and the University of Washington to study how blows to the head can damage the brain. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Peter Robison in Seattle at robison@bloomberg.net; Brendan Coffey in Boston at bcoffey10@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Peter Newcomb at pnewcomb2@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most exciting part of elevating Satya Nadella to chief executive officer of Microsoft Corp. may be that it would end the search to replace Steve Ballmer, investors in the world&#8217;s biggest software maker said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 46-year-old native of Hyderabad, India, is a cloud computing whiz with the potential to reverse Microsoft&#8217;s image as a company stranded in the past, said Chad Morganlander, a fund manager at Washington Crossing Advisors. At the same time, he spent two decades working for Ballmer and Bill Gates and shareholders may be disappointed no outside candidate was found, said Donald Selkin of National Securities Corp. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s board is preparing to make Nadella, the company&#8217;s enterprise and cloud chief, its CEO, and is discussing replacing Gates as chairman, according to people briefed on the process who asked not to be identified because the process is private. Microsoft spokesman Frank Shaw declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a safe choice,&#8221; said Kevin Walkush, a business analyst at Jensen Investment Management in Lake Oswego, Oregon. The firm oversees $7.2 billion and has 6.7 million Microsoft shares. &#8220;There&#8217;s a large faction that wants a disruptive tech visionary to take over Microsoft and that group will probably be disappointed. Another group of people think we need a person like Satya who knows the business because it&#8217;s so complex and needs someone that has the inside knowledge.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the third-largest oil
company by market value, said production this year will rise
less than 1 percent as fourth-quarter profit tumbled 32 percent
amid slumping prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude and natural gas output will average the equivalent of
2.61 million barrels a day this year, a 0.5 percent increase
from 2013, the San Ramon, California-based company said in a
slide presentation today. For the final three months of last
year, net income dropped to $4.93 billion, or $2.57 a share,
from $7.25 billion, or $3.70, a year earlier, Chevron said in a
separate statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costs have ballooned at Chevron&#8217;s flagship $54 billion
Gorgon liquefied natural gas development in Australia, which is
almost 75 percent complete, as the company looks to deep fields
in Kazakhstan and the Gulf of Mexico to add supplies. Chevron is
the latest major international energy producer to disclose
production shortfalls while facing surging costs and unplanned
project delays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Production growth is going to be modest this year,&#8221; said
Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James  Associates Inc.
in Houston. &#8220;In the absence of large project startups,
production growth beyond the very low single digits is just not
realistic.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Worst Performing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron slid 4.1 percent, the most since October 2012, to
$111.63 at the close in New York. It was the day&#8217;s worst-performing energy producer in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, the top
two oil companies by market value, reported lower quarterly
earnings this week compared with 2012. Chevron&#8217;s stock
underperformed Exxon and ConocoPhillips last year and lagged the
industry average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent crude, the global benchmark oil price, averaged
$109.35 a barrel in the last three months of 2013, a 78-cent
drop from the prior fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Global crude oil prices and refining margins were
generally lower in 2013 than 2012,&#8221; Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer John Watson said in today&#8217;s statement. &#8220;These
conditions, as well as lower gains on asset sales and higher
expenses, resulted in lower earnings.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per-share results at Chevron matched the average estimate
of 18 analysts. Sales fell 7.3 percent to $56.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron said its fourth-quarter production fell 3.4 percent
to an average of 2.58 million barrels of oil equivalent a day in
the quarter, from 2.67 million barrels a year earlier. Earnings
from oil and gas sales dropped 29 percent to $4.85 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson has said he plans to spend $39.8 billion this year
on gas-export facilities, offshore crude platforms and
exploratory drilling as part of a plan to increase global
production 20 percent by the end of 2017. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) is close to a
programming agreement that would settle litigation over Dish
Network Corp. (DISH)&#8217;s ad-skipping technology, according to two people
with knowledge of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s largest entertainment company, could
receive compensation for technology, known as AutoHop, that lets
Dish subscribers skip commercials in broadcast shows they have
recorded, according to the people, who asked not to be
identified because the discussions are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resolution of the dispute with Dish, the second-largest
U.S. satellite TV service, could make ad-skipping a regular
feature of TV viewing, and ease the tension between Dish and
other programmers. The company is also involved in litigation
with CBS Corp., Comcast Corp.&#8217;s NBC and 21st Century Fox Inc.&#8217;s
Fox over the feature, which threatens to undermine the
effectiveness of network ads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussions to settle the ad-skipping litigation are part
of wider contract talks between Burbank, California-based Disney
and Dish, based in Englewood, Colorado, for future rights to
programming from ABC, ESPN and the Disney Channel. An existing
accord between the parties expired in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By agreeing to let Dish customers skip ads on ABC network
programs they have recorded, Disney could receive higher monthly
subscriber fees, the people said. Broadcast networks have been
asking pay-TV providers for compensation for their over-the-air
programming, similar to what they get for their cable networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Retransmission Fees &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney has said such fees could bring in as much as $500
million annually by 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AutoHop technology, introduced by Dish in May 2012,
lets the company&#8217;s satellite-TV customers skip commercials on
recorded broadcast TV shows. The company had 14 million U.S.
subscribers as of the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dish is working with TV networks to deliver more targeted
ads based on consumer information collected by set-top boxes,
Warren Schlichting, the company&#8217;s senior vice president of media
sales and analytics, said in an interview in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney fell 0.2 percent to $73.11 at 2:25 p.m. in New York.
The stock rose 53 percent last year. Dish gained 0.2 percent to
$56.60 and gained 59 percent in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter Inc. (TWTR), the microblogging
service that went public last year, agreed to buy 900 patents
from International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) to gain access to new
technology and build a defense against infringement suits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement, signed last month and announced today, also
resolves a dispute that prompted IBM to write to Twitter last
year about possible infringement of at least three patents.
Financial terms weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchase &#8220;provides us with greater intellectual
property protection and gives us freedom of action to innovate
on behalf of all those who use our service,&#8221; Ben Lee, legal
director for Twitter, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter had nine patents and 95 pending applications before
its initial public offering in November, far fewer than other
leading technology companies. It said in a regulatory filing
that the lack of intellectual property could make the company a
target for litigation and limit its ability to fight back by
asserting its own patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patent battles are an &#8220;increasing distraction&#8221; for
technology companies, even if Twitter itself wasn&#8217;t facing much
of an immediate threat,  said Richard Doherty, research director
of Envisioneering Group, a technology assessment consulting firm
in Seaford, New York. &#8220;At some point it becomes just a
balancing function to take advantage of warehouses of
intellectual property, like at IBM.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Video Delivery &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its letter to Twitter, IBM cited patents relating to a
networking technique based on common contacts, a way to show
advertisements without interfering with an interactive site, and
using interconnected computers to reduce Web traffic. San
Francisco-based Twitter also will probably gain IBM inventions
related to things like video compression, Doherty said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As Twitter expands and starts delivering video, they need
to increase their intellectual property portfolio,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;We believe some know-how is going along with the patent
transfer, not just patent numbers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patents include some that directly relate to Twitter&#8217;s
business plan. One covers a way to enable compliance with
international shipping requirements. Twitter is seeking to get
more revenue from retailers and is trying to make it easier for
users to shop via its 140-character messages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Messaging Technology &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another of the patents is for improved messaging, according
to information posted on the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
website. Others are less clearly connected, such as a way to
prevent damage to semiconductor chips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Twitter, the deal marks its first patent acquisition,
not counting intellectual property it gained by purchasing other
companies. The companies also entered a cross-licensing
agreement. Of the three patents cited by IBM in its initial
letter to Twitter, only one -- for interconnected computers --
has been assigned to Twitter, according to the patent office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Twitter gained 1.4 percent to $64.35 at 11:52
a.m. in New York. IBM&#8217;s stock was little changed at $176.37. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, which has received the most U.S. patents of any
company for 21 straight years, has made deals with patent-light
technology firms before. The Armonk, New York-based company has
sold patents to Google Inc. (GOOG) to aid the Android software maker&#8217;s
battle with rivals over smartphone technology. A sale of 750
patents to Facebook Inc. helped the social-networking site
settle a lawsuit with Yahoo! Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It illustrates the value of patented IBM inventions and
demonstrates our commitment to licensing access to our broad
patent portfolio,&#8221; Ken King, general manager of intellectual
property for IBM, said in a statement. &#8220;We look forward to a
productive relationship with Twitter in the future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The licensing and sales deals mean IBM has agreements with
almost every technology company in business. Its patents
generate approximately $1 billion a year in licensing income,
about 1 percent of its sales last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ruble&#8217;s plunge in this week&#8217;s
emerging-market selloff holds the promise of more competitive
Russian exports and higher budget revenue, JPMorgan Chase 
Co.&#8217;s asset-management unit and Capital Economics Ltd. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There has been limited official rhetoric about the need
to prevent the ruble from weakening,&#8221; Liza Ermolenko, an
emerging-markets economist at Capital Economics, said by phone
from London. &#8220;A weaker ruble improves competitiveness in
international markets and boosts government revenue from oil.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Finance Ministry canceled a scheduled bond auction amid
the developing-nation rout after selling less than 25 percent of
the securities on offer this month. Russia should abstain from
following Turkey and South Africa in raising interest rates to
bolster the ruble, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said Jan. 29. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruble tumbled to the lowest on record against the
central bank&#8217;s basket of dollars and euros this week as Chinese
manufacturing contracted and the Federal Reserve pushed ahead
with stimulus cuts. That slide helped drive the yield on
Russia&#8217;s February 2027 bond 14 basis points higher on Jan. 29,
the most since June. That compares with a 10 basis-point advance
for similarly dated debt from Mexico, which carries the same
rating at Moody&#8217;s Investors Service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Commodity Dependence &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude oil and natural gas exports account for about 50
percent of Russia&#8217;s budget revenue and President Vladimir Putin
has urged officials to diversify the economy and reduce its
dependence on commodities. Brent was steady yesterday at $107.95
a barrel in London, compared with $36.61 in December 2008,
before the currency reached its previous low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m sure the government is happy seeing the currency
weaken a bit,&#8221; Matias Silvani, who helps manage $35 billion of
emerging-market debt at JPMorgan Asset Management in New York,
said by e-mail yesterday. Russia is facing a &#8220;weaker economy,
exposure to commodities&#8221; and is &#8220;trying to gain
competitiveness,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A weaker currency, managed, helps
on all three fronts.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elvira Nabiullina, the economic aide to Putin who took
charge of Bank Rossii in June, resisted cutting rates last year
to boost economic growth as inflation remained above target. The
economy expanded 1.2 percent in the third quarter from a year
earlier, matching the weakest pace since a 2009 contraction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Auction Axed &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Finance Ministry axed its auction on Jan. 29, citing
market conditions, after issuing 750 million rubles out of 10
billion rubles of 2019 bonds offered at a sale the previous
week. While the ministry plans to sell bonds next week, it&#8217;s not
a problem if the first-quarter borrowing plan isn&#8217;t met,
Konstantin Vyshkovsky, head of Finance Ministry&#8217;s debt
department, told reporters in Moscow yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the local currency depreciates, Russia&#8217;s budget
receives more rubles from taxes and duties paid by energy
companies whose export revenue is priced in dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia&#8217;s budget deficit may be equal to 0.6 percent to 0.7
percent of gross domestic product this year, the Interfax news
service said Jan. 23, citing Siluanov. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on Russia&#8217;s 2027 OFZ bond has increased 50 basis
points this year to 8.4 percent, the highest since July 2012,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. The yield on Mexico&#8217;s debt is
up 26 basis points this year at 7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Third Worst &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruble climbed for the first day in six yesterday,
adding 1 percent to 40.5092 against the basket after 6 p.m. in
Moscow when the central bank ends its market operations. The
ruble lost 6.5 percent against the dollar this year, the worst
performer among the 24 emerging-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg, behind Argentina&#8217;s peso and South Africa&#8217;s rand. The
currency retreated 0.3 percent to 40.6059 by 12:18 p.m. in
Moscow today versus the basket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Many investors are saying that it would be good for the
central bank to raise rates,&#8221; Evgeny Kochemazov, head of fixed
income at Alfa Capital in Moscow, said by phone yesterday.
&#8220;That&#8217;s probably the only way to stabilize the situation in the
currency market, to prevent the growth of OFZ yields.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia is rated Baa1 at Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, the
third-lowest investment-grade category. The yield on the
government&#8217;s April 2020 dollar bonds was steady at 3.83 percent
today. The extra yield investors demand to hold the nation&#8217;s
dollar debt over Treasuries dropped one basis point to 246. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian policy makers are scheduled to discuss borrowing
costs on Feb. 14. Bank Rossii will leave the key one-week rate
at 5.5 percent in the first and second quarter, according to the
median estimate of 22 economists in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economy stands to gain from the ruble&#8217;s drop, according
to Alexei Kudrin, a former Finance Minister. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Overall it&#8217;s positive,&#8221; he said in Moscow yesterday.
&#8220;It will support industry.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) hired Cathrin Petty from U.K. private-equity firm Vitruvian Partners LLP as
co-head of its health-care investment banking team in Europe,
the Middle East and Africa amid rising activity in the sector. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petty, who has almost 20 years of experience in health
care, will work alongside the team&#8217;s current head, Rakesh Patel,
according a memo obtained by Bloomberg News. She will start next
week and report to Laurence Hollingworth. The contents of the
memo, written by Vis Raghavan, head of EMEA banking, were
confirmed by a spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before working as a partner at Vitruvian, Petty spent a
decade at buyout firm Apax Partners LLP, eight of those years as
a partner in the global health-care team, in charge of private-equity investments, the memo shows. Petty, who interned at
JPMorgan in 1994, also worked at Schroders doing buyouts and
venture deals for medical technology and pharmaceutical
companies in Europe, India and the U.S., according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acquisitions in the pharmaceuticals industry globally rose
to $80.1 billion last year from $52 billion in 2012, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Total mergers and acquisitions
are &#8220;set to accelerate&#8221; this year, led by pharmaceutical deals
based on calculations of free-cash flow versus corporate bond
yields, low debt levels and value-to-cost ratios, according to a

&lt;p&gt;When asked last month what kinds of gadget gifts he would be getting for Christmas, Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s Satya Nadella, said to be the board&#8217;s pick for chief executive officer, had an easy answer: Microsoft devices. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nadella, 46, in an interview at a technology conference in Paris, said he had already gotten a new Xbox One game console for his children that he uses to watch movies through Netflix Inc. The India-born executive said he also has a phone made by Nokia Oyj -- a business that Microsoft is buying -- with a 41 megapixel camera. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His task as CEO will be winning over the legions of consumers who are far less enthused about buying Microsoft products. Taking over for Steve Ballmer, Nadella would inherit a company that has been left behind in smartphones, tablets and on the Web and one that&#8217;s racing to transform from its software roots to be a leader in hardware and Internet services. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nadella can draw on 22 years of experience at the Redmond, Washington-based company in roles including head of the enterprise and cloud unit. He will also need to win over skeptics concerned that an insider can&#8217;t move fast enough to make Microsoft a contender again in markets led by Apple Inc., Google Inc. and others, said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets  Co. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Billionaires Alice Walton, George Soros and Marc Benioff are helping to finance a super-political
action committee encouraging former U.S. Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton to run for president, according to a report
filed yesterday with the Federal Election Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each gave $25,000 to Ready for Hillary PAC, organized a
year ago to provide Clinton outside support if she chooses to
seek the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The super-PAC earlier reported raising about $4 million
last year from 30,000 donors, most of them giving small amounts,
such as $20.16. Walton, Soros and Benioff were among 33 people
or companies that gave $25,000 in the second half of 2013, the
FEC report shows. New Yorkers who chipped in to help their
former senator include Roger Altman, the chairman and founder of
New York-based Evercore Partners Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The super-PAC can&#8217;t coordinate with Clinton if she becomes
a candidate. It can, however, sell her campaign its data --
almost 2 million supporters have signed up for the group so far
-- or mobilize voters and advertise for her on its own. The
group, based in Arlington, Virginia, is limiting contributions
to $25,000 even though it is permitted to accept donations in
unlimited amounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its early fundraising success, still more than two years
before Election Day, could give Clinton a competitive advantage;
there&#8217;s no comparable candidate-specific super-PAC for any of
the prospective Republican candidates, who include Kentucky
Senator Rand Paul, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, and New
Jersey Governor Chris Christie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Leading Polls &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinton, 66, dominates other Democrats in voter preference
polls and has said she&#8217;ll make a decision about a White House
campaign sometime this year. A Jan. 30 Washington Post-ABC News
poll found her with 73 percent of support from Democrats and
Democratic-leaning independents, a 6-to-1 lead over her rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;ll think about it in the future sometime,&#8221; Clinton
said Jan. 27 at the National Automobile Dealers Association
convention in New Orleans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walton, the daughter of Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc. founder Sam Walton, is the world&#8217;s 13th-richest
person with a fortune of $33.9 billion, according to the
Bloomberg Billionaires Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice Walton&#8217;s donation underscores the Clintons&#8217;
longstanding ties to business leaders in Arkansas, where Bill Clinton was governor for 12 years prior to becoming president in
1993. The pro-Clinton group also received $25,000 from John Tyson, chairman of Springdale-based Tyson Foods Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Obama Backers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benioff, the chief executive officer of San Francisco-based
Salesforce.com, was a top fundraiser for President Barack Obama&#8217;s 2012 re-election campaign and hosted the president for a
Democratic fundraiser at his residence last November. His wife,
Lynne Benioff, also contributed $25,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soros, who&#8217;s given millions of dollars to Democratic
causes, funded the super-PAC, as did his son Robert Soros,
managing partner of Soros Fund Management LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former advisers to Bill Clinton donating to Ready for
Hillary included Altman, a former deputy treasury secretary, who
gave $5,000. William Galston, a Washington-based Brookings
Institution senior fellow and a former White House domestic
policy adviser, gave $1,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New York Donors &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The super-PAC for Clinton, a U.S. senator from New York
from 2001 to 2009, received $25,000 each from developer William Rudin, chief executive officer of Rudin Management Co. in New
York, and Jon Stryker, a New York architect who gave about $2
million to Priorities USA Action, a super-PAC that helped re-elect Obama and is now converting to a pro-Clinton effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silda Wall, a principal at NewWorld Capital Group LLC, who
is divorcing former New York governor Eliot Spitzer, gave
$5,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pro-Clinton super-PAC received $25,000 from the Houston
law firm of Steve and Amber Mostyn, who gave about $5 million to
Democratic groups and candidates in the 2012 election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ready for Hillary is led by Adam Parkhomenko, a 28-year-old
college student who has advocated for a Clinton presidential
campaign for more than a decade. The super-PAC&#8217;s advisers
include Jeremy Bird, Obama&#8217;s former national field director, and
Harold Ickes and James Carville, who have longstanding ties to
the Clintons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The super-PAC said in an e-mail to supporters that it had
amassed another 7,119 donations last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By limiting its donations to $25,000 per individual, Ready
for Hillary is focusing on grassroots support, Parkhomenko said,
while Priorities USA Action can seek bigger donations.
Parkhomenko said Ready for Hillary doesn&#8217;t plan to run any
television advertising campaigns, leaving that task to other
groups such as Priorities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Priorities, which raised more than $79 million in the 2012
election, will have Obama campaign manager Jim Messina as a co-chairman for the 2016 election, its executive director, Buffy Wicks, said in a statement Jan. 23. &lt;/p&gt;
