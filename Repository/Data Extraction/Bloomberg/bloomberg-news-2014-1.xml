<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommends
selling the South Korean won and the most-accurate forecaster
Scotiabank sees possible interest-rate cuts, as exporter
earnings are wrecked by currency appreciation. </p>
<p>Goldman yesterday predicted a 3.1 percent drop in the won
against the dollar, after a 9.8 percent gain in the past two
years against the greenback and a 50 percent rally versus the
Japanese yen. Seven large exporters based their 2014 forecasts
on an average exchange rate of 10 won per yen, 12 percent
stronger than last year''s 11.23, according to a December survey
by Korea Trade Insurance Corp. </p>
<p>Samsung Electronics Co. reported today fourth-quarter
profit missed analysts'' estimates, after Hyundai Motor Co. last
week predicted the slowest sales growth in eight years. Bank of
Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo may lower the benchmark rate by a
quarter-percentage point as early as Jan. 9 to mitigate the
won''s gains and spur growth, Goldman forecast. </p>
<p>Exporters are starting to feel the pinch from the
exchange rates, Kwon Goohoon, Goldman''s Seoul-based economist,
said by phone yesterday. There seems to be no other immediate
policy options than a rate cut to support growth. </p>
<p>Korean exports will see a significant impact should the
yen fall further, while currency volatility poses the biggest
risk to Asia''s fourth-largest economy, according to minutes of
last month''s central bank board meeting released on Dec. 31.
Finance Minister Hyun Oh Seok said on Jan. 3 that the
authorities are closely monitoring the yen''s volatility and
President Park Geun Hye said the Japanese currency''s weakness
was a burden eroding South Korean companies'' competitiveness. </p>
<h2>Samsung Earnings </h2>
<p>Seoul''s main bourse got off to the worst start since 2007
after Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors Corp. on Jan. 2 predicted a
4.1 percent increase in 2014''s combined deliveries, the slowest
since 2006, and as analysts cut estimates for profit at Samsung
Electronics. The Kospi index fell 2.6 percent since Dec. 30 as
foreign investors sold more shares than they bought. </p>
<p>The won touched 9.96 versus the yen on Jan. 1, the highest
since September 2008, and fell 0.3 percent to 1,068.46 per
dollar at 10:16 a.m. in Seoul, having reached a five-year high
of 1,048 last week. </p>
<p>Shares in Samsung Electronics, which got 85 percent of
sales from outside its home market in 2012, slid 4.8 percent
this year. Operating profit was 8.3 trillion won ($7.8 billion)
in the final quarter, the Suwon, South Korea-based company said
in a statement today. That compares with the 10 trillion-won
average of 32 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Currency Fluctuations </h2>
<p>Samsung Electronics is paying close attention to global
foreign-exchange trends and strives to protect its interests
against currency fluctuations, the company said in a Jan. 3 e-mailed statement in response to questions. It couldn''t confirm a
Nov. 29 report by the Korea Economic Daily that the company has
based 2014 plan on a rate of 1,050 won per dollar. </p>
<p>Foreign investors bought a net 3.1 trillion won of Kospi
stocks last year, while dumping Indonesian and Thai shares,
exchange data show, as South Korea is positioned to benefit from
a recovery in the U.S. and Europe. </p>
<p>Overseas shipments, which account for about half of Korea''s
economy, will increase 6.4 percent in 2014, after an estimated
2.2 percent gain last year, the trade ministry said on Jan. 1. </p>
<p>A stronger won brings down import costs, helping companies
counter falling overseas income. Steel giant Posco is seeking a
natural hedge by paying for imports of raw materials in foreign
currency earned abroad, spokesman Jeong Yong Min said in a Jan.
3 e-mail. </p>
<h2>Crying Foul'' </h2>
<p>Smaller exporters with fewer hedging tools are crying
foul over what they see as an unfair advantage Japanese rivals
are gaining from the retreating yen, Oh Joo Hyun, Korea
Trade''s head of foreign exchange risk management, said Jan. 3. </p>
<p>In Japan, Toyota Motor Corp. will post a record operating
profit of 2.4 trillion yen for the year ending March 31,
according to a Dec. 30 report from the Sankei Newspaper. The
Bank of Japan, which has embarked on an unprecedented stimulus
and debased its currency, has scope to expand purchases even
more, according to 71 percent of economists polled by Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Rising Risk </h2>
<p>Korean policy makers may now become more vocal as risks
rise in respect to an erosion of Korea''s external position,
Sacha Tihanyi, a Hong Kong-based strategist at Scotiabank, said
yesterday. Risks are rising and I''d be looking for the won to
weaken off for a bit, particularly given the weaker levels of
the yen. There is also the rising risk that the Bank of Korea
eases policy as a counterweight to won strength. </p>
<p>The won will decline to 1,070 versus the dollar by the end
of March, Tihanyi forecasts. That''s weaker than the median
estimate of 1,064 in a Bloomberg survey of 37 strategists. He
predicted the won will strengthen to 9.54 against the yen at the
end of 2014. </p>
<p>Goldman recommended selling the won with a target of 1,100
per dollar, without specifying a timeframe. The yield on five-year sovereign debt fell five basis points this week to 3.26
percent, amid speculation the Bank of Korea will trim the key
rate from 2.5 percent. The yield added 26 basis points in 2013.
All 15 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News expect no change
this week. </p>
<p>Consumer inflation has stayed below the BOK''s target range
of between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent since May 2012. South
Korea''s current-account surplus will narrow to $38 billion this
year after reaching $63 billion last year, while the economy
will expand 3.8 percent from an estimated growth of 2.8 percent
in 2013, according to central bank projections. </p>
<p>Korea is a victim of its own success as the economy is in
better shape than most Asian neighbors, Suresh Kumar Ramanathan, regional currency strategist in Kuala Lumpur at CIMB
Investment Bank Bhd., said in a Jan. 3 interview. The won''s
strength has become a problem for exporters like Samsung. It can
be quite dangerous and policy makers can''t intervene or engage
in a race to the bottom without causing a reaction elsewhere in
the region. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), vying with Sony
Corp. (6758) for the lead in a new generation of game consoles, said
consumers purchased more than 3 million Xbox One players in
2013, following the Nov. 22 debut of the device in 13 countries. </p>
<p>Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, announced the
tally today on its Xbox news website. The company is trying to
keep pace with Sony''s PlayStation 4, which went on sale a week
earlier in North America. </p>
<p>The companies were neck and neck in early December, with
each selling more than 2 million units in their first 18 days.
The $499 Xbox One and the $399 PlayStation 4 have more powerful
graphics and entertainment functions than older models. To
distinguish its machine, Microsoft has touted its motion-sensing
camera, the ability to control live TV and exclusive games like
Ryse: Son of Rome and Dead Rising 3. </p>
<p>Sony''s PS4 clearly bounced back from our mixed early-2013
supply chain checks, and appears to have a slight momentum edge
among core gamers, Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W.
Baird  Co., said today in a note. However, we view the
console battle as too close to call, with both platforms selling
well over the holidays. </p>
<p>Dan Race, a spokesman for Sony, didn''t immediately respond
to an e-mail requesting comment. </p>
<p>Microsoft fell 2.1 percent to $36.13 at the close in New
York. The stock gained 40 percent last year. Sony American
depositary receipts advanced 0.7 percent to $17.30 after rising
54 percent last year. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS)''s Glenn Hadden has
left as head of interest-rates trading, citing differences with
his bosses over how the business should be run as the firm seeks
to boost the unit''s returns. </p>
<p>Mitch Nadel and Jakob Horder were named to replace Hadden,
who left this month, according to an internal company memo
today. Horder, who led global structured-rate products, and
Nadel, who was head of liquid flow rates in North America, will
be co-heads of the unit, the firm said. Mary Claire Delaney, a
spokeswoman for the New York-based company, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Ken deRegt, 57, who helped bring Hadden to Morgan Stanley
in 2011, left as head of fixed-income sales and trading last
year to join hedge-fund firm Canarsie Capital Group. Michael Heaney and Robert Rooney were named to replace deRegt in May,
and Hadden said he had differing views on his business than the
new leadership, declining to elaborate. </p>
<p>I''m extremely proud of the success we had at Morgan
Stanley, both me personally and the team we built, Hadden said
in a telephone interview. I have no intention of retiring from
investment finance, and my goal is still to serve clients as
best I can in whatever capacity that is. </p>
<h2>Goldman Hire </h2>
<p>Revenue from rates trading at the the 10 largest global
investment banks dropped 40 percent in the first nine months of
2013, according to analytics firm Coalition Ltd., as investors
stepped back amid speculation over whether the Federal Reserve
would taper its stimulus efforts. Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, 56, said in October that the firm was taking
historically low levels of risk in its rates unit as the
business proved challenging. </p>

<p>Atlantis Resources Corp., a Morgan
Stanley-backed maker of tidal turbines, appointed a former Bank
of England and Royal Mail Plc director as it plans an initial
share sale on London''s Alternative Investment Market. </p>
<p>Atlantis named John Neill non-executive chairman of its
board to help grow the company as it plans to raise about 20
million pounds ($32.7 million) on AIM, Tim Cornelius, chief
executive officer of Singapore-based Atlantis, said today. It
expects to complete the share sale as early as this month. </p>
<p>Atlantis, in which Morgan Stanley holds a 45.7 percent
stake, will spend about half of the proceeds of the share sale
to fund the 86-megawatt first phase of its MeyGen project in
Scotland. Construction is expected to start just after the first
quarter, Cornelius said, with power generation forecast to begin
in early 2015. It may eventually reach a capacity of as much as
398 megawatts. </p>
<p>Scotland offers one of world''s highest subsidies for tidal
power, one of the costliest forms of energy. Scotland''s waters
are estimated to have as much as a quarter of Europe''s tidal
resource. As yet there are no commercial-scale projects in
operation as developers continue to test their devices and raise
the capital needed to install larger facilities. </p>
<p>Neill, the chairman and chief executive officer of Unipart
Group Ltd., is one of the most proven entrepreneurs in the
U.K., if not Europe, Cornelius said by phone. </p>
<p>Neill is a non-executive director at Rolls Royce Plc and

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), which agreed to
pay $2.6 billion to resolve criminal and civil allegations it
facilitated Bernard Madoff''s Ponzi scheme, failed miserably
as a financial institution, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said. </p>
<p>One reason, among others, that Madoff was able to get
away with his crime for so long was that JPMorgan had an
inadequate and inefficient anti-money-laundering program,
Bharara said at a press conference today. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the biggest bank in the U.S. by assets, avoided
prosecution by entering into an accord with Bharara''s office
that acknowledged oversight lapses related to an account Madoff
used to fund his fraud. The bank said it will pay $1.7 billion
to settle the U.S. allegations, $350 million in a related case
by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, plus
$543 million to cover separate private claims. </p>
<p>The bank connected the dots when it came to its own
profits, but not when it came to its own legal obligations,
Bharara said, adding that the bank was aware of Madoff''s
questionable transactions as early as 1994. </p>
<p>The New York-based bank didn''t file any suspicious activity
reports required under federal banking rules, Bharara said. </p>
<h2>Timeline Chart </h2>
<p>The Bank Secrecy Act is a law that requires financial
institutions to establish and maintain effective anti-money
laundering compliance programs and to know their customer,
Bharara said. It is not a tip. It is not a suggestion. It is a
legal requirement enforceable through criminal sanction. Today''s
charges have been filed because in this regard, JPMorgan as an
institution failed and failed miserably. </p>
<p>At the press conference, Bharara displayed a timeline chart
with comments by JPMorgan employees who suspected Madoff''s
fraud, which ended when he was arrested in December 2008 and
cost investors about $17 billion. Madoff is serving a 150-year
federal prison sentence in North Carolina. </p>
<p>A JPMorgan fund manager wrote in December 1998 that
Madoff''s returns are possibly too good to be true and that
there were too many red flags for the bank to do business
with Madoff, according to the timeline. </p>
<p>In June 2007, a senior JPMorgan chief risk officer said
there is a well-known cloud over the head of Madoff and that
his returns are speculated to be part of a Ponzi scheme,
according to the exhibit. </p>
<h2>Regulatory Probes </h2>
<p>The U.S. agreement includes the largest ever bank
forfeiture and also the largest ever Department of Justice
penalty, Bharara said. JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer
Jamie Dimon, agreed in 2013 to pay $15.7 billion to resolve
other U.S. regulatory probes into practices including mortgage-bond sales and energy trading. </p>
<p>We recognize we could have done a better job pulling
together various pieces of information and concerns about Madoff
from different parts of the bank over time, Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for JPMorgan, said in an e-mailed
statement. We do not believe that any JPMorgan Chase employee
knowingly assisted Madoff''s Ponzi scheme. </p>
<p>From late 1986 to the Madoff firm''s collapse, the Ponzi
scheme was conducted almost exclusively through a demand
deposit account and other linked cash and brokerage accounts
held at JPMorgan, prosecutors said in a criminal information
in Manhattan federal court. Virtually all client investments
were deposited into the primary Madoff Securities account at
JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. and virtually all client redemptions''
were paid from a linked disbursement account. </p>
<h2>Vantage Point'' </h2>
<p>JPMorgan, because of its vantage point as Madoff''s
banker, had plenty of reasons to be uniquely suspicious about
him. Warning signs abounded, Bharara said. </p>
<p>The volume, movement and use of funds should have generated
suspicions among JPMorgan employees, Bharara said. From 1986 to
2008 an astounding $150 billion went in and out of Madoff''s
JPMorgan account. </p>
<p>In 2006, a derivatives trading desk in JPMorgan''s London
office offered products linked to Madoff''s performance and
invested its own money in Madoff''s feeder funds, Bharara said.
By October 2008, the bank was so concerned about Madoff''s
returns that it redeemed $275 million it had in the funds, he
said. </p>
<p>In the mid-1990s, the bank learned Madoff and a client of
JPMorgan''s Private Bank were engaged in questionable banking
processes known as round-trip transactions that amounted to
what Bharara said was a check-kiting scheme. </p>
<h2>Closed Account </h2>
<p>These transactions were so questionable that another U.S.
bank involved in the transactions filed a suspicious activity
report and closed Madoff''s account, Bharara said. JPMorgan
allowed the transactions to continue for close to a decade, he
said. </p>
<p>It took until after the arrest of Madoff, one of the
worst crooks this office has ever seen, for JPMorgan to alert
authorities to what the world already knew, George Venizelos,
the FBI assistant director in charge, said in a statement today.
We all need to be invested in making our markets safer and
more equitable. The FBI can''t do it alone. Traders, compliance
officers, analysts, bankers, and executives are the gatekeepers
of the financial industry. We need their help protecting our
markets. </p>
<p>Bharara said today his office plans for every penny of
the $1.7 billion to go to help make Bernie Madoff''s victims
closer to whole. </p>

<p>Wall Street''s biggest banks say the slump in emerging-market assets that left equities trailing advanced-nation shares by the most since 1998 last year will prove more than a fleeting selloff. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommends investors cut allocations in developing nations by a third, forecasting significant underperformance for stocks, bonds and currencies over the next 10 years. JPMorgan Chase  Co. expects local-currency bonds to post 10 percent of their average returns since 2004 in the coming year, while Morgan Stanley projects the Brazilian real, Turkish lira and Russian ruble will extend declines after tumbling as much as 17 percent in 2013. </p> <p>While the economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China symbolized the increasing power of the developing world during the worst of the global financial crisis and delivered outsized returns, Morgan Stanley says some of the same nations may now prove to be laggards as the U.S. Federal Reserve scales back unprecedented stimulus and interest rates rise. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index is down 3.1 percent this year, compared with a 0.8 percent drop in the developed-market index, and hit a four-month low yesterday as data from China showed weakness in manufacturing and services. </p>

<p>Revenue from rates trading at the 10 largest global
investment banks dropped 40 percent in the first nine months of
2013, according to analytics firm Coalition Ltd., as investors
stepped back amid speculation over whether the Federal Reserve
would taper its stimulus efforts. Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, 56, said in October that the firm was taking
historically low levels of risk in its rates unit as the
business proved challenging. </p>
<h2>Goldman Hire </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s rates business had a return on equity -- a
measure of profitability -- of 5 percent to 10 percent in 2012
and aimed to boost that to more than 10 percent, Chief Executive
Officer James Gorman, 55, said in June. Interest-rates trading
involves buying and selling products including U.S. Treasury
notes and bonds, other government debt, inflation-linked
securities and interest-rate derivatives. </p>
<p>Derivatives Week reported the personnel changes yesterday. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley hired Hadden from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
as part of an effort to boost trading revenue from interest-rate
products and currencies. Gorman said in June that the firm had
rebuilt its client coverage in those areas, and Hadden said the
bank had made enormous gains in its share of client
business. </p>
<p>Nadel joined Morgan Stanley in 2010 and was head of the
fixed-income division in Japan before his most recent role in
New York. Horder previously ran the interest-rates trading unit
in Europe, Middle East and Africa. </p>
<h2>CME Suspension </h2>
<p>Jakob and Mitch will focus on aligning the strategy of
global rates with the other business units in fixed income, with
an intense focus on return on equity, Heaney and Rooney said
in the memo. </p>
<p>Rates and currency trading, or so-called macro trading,
contributed more than half of Morgan Stanley''s fixed-income
revenue in 2012, from less than half in 2007, Gorman said in
June. Porat said in 2012 that rates trading was the primary
driver of the increase. </p>
<p>Still, the unit lost at least tens of millions of dollars
in the second quarter of 2011 on a wager on U.S. inflation
expectations, Bloomberg News reported at the time. Hadden lost
more than $200 million in the first half of 2013, the New York
Times reported last year. </p>
<p>Hadden was suspended from accessing all CME Group Inc. (CME)
trading floors for 10 days and fined $80,000 last year to
resolve claims tied to transactions in Treasury futures. The
trades came on Dec. 19, 2008, when Hadden, then at Goldman
Sachs, made orders in the final minute prior to expiration of a
10-year futures contract. </p>
<p>Hadden''s attorney said at the time of the fine that the
trades were routine risk-management procedures and that he had

<p>The U.S. prosecution of JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) was deferred by a federal judge after the bank
agreed to pay $2.6 billion to resolve criminal and civil
allegations it failed to stop Bernard Madoff''s Ponzi scheme. </p>
<p>Stephen Cutler, JPMorgan''s general counsel, pleaded not
guilty today on behalf of the bank to two violations of the Bank
Secrecy Act in connection with Madoff at an arraignment before
U.S. District Judge P. Kevin Castel. The judge deferred
prosecution of the case until January 2016, when the case will
be dismissed if the bank complies with the settlement. </p>
<p>The required judicial intervention to protect the
integrity of the process is not necessary, Castel ruled. He
set the next hearing for Jan. 15, 2016. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the biggest bank in the U.S. by assets, avoided
prosecution by entering into an accord with the office of
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara that acknowledged
oversight lapses related to a JPMorgan account Madoff used to
fund his fraud. </p>
<p>The bank said it will pay $1.7 billion to settle the U.S.
allegations and $350 million in a related case by the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency, plus $543 million to cover
separate private claims. </p>
<h2>No Reports </h2>
<p>Bharara said yesterday that the criminal charges will be
dismissed after two years if JPMorgan complies with the
agreement and implements reforms of its anti-money laundering
compliance program. </p>
<p>While JPMorgan had been Madoff''s bank for decades and
discovered questionable transactions as early as 1994, the New
York-based bank didn''t file any suspicious activity reports
required under federal banking rules, Bharara said. JPMorgan
acknowledged in the accord that it ignored red flags for about
15 years that Madoff used his account to run a fraud, Bharara
said. </p>
<p>The U.S. agreement includes the largest ever bank
forfeiture and also the largest ever Department of Justice
penalty, Bharara said. JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer
Jamie Dimon, agreed in 2013 to pay $15.7 billion to resolve
other U.S. regulatory probes into practices including mortgage-bond sales and energy trading. </p>
<p>The accord brings its legal settlements from the past two
years to more than $29 billion and further eroding its once-record earnings. </p>
<p>The civil case is U.S. v. JPMorgan 14-CV-0063, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Citigroup Inc. (C) and Morgan Stanley
sold $32.5 million of structured notes tied to a U.S. and a
European stock index in offerings that may gain value when the
relevant benchmark declines as well as when it rises. </p>
<p>Citigroup sold the larger $17.6 million offering of 66-month securities on Dec. 30. The notes yield 1.3 times the gains
of the Euro Stoxx 50 Index, as well as the unleveraged absolute
value of as much as 35 percent of losses, according to a
prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. Investors can lose their entire investment if the
index plummets. </p>
<p>The securities, known as dual directional or absolute
return notes, are distinct from other structured notes that
yield a set coupon even when protecting against some losses,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The notes make sense for mildly bullish investors
concerned about moderate, short-term losses, said Deryk Rhodes,
a Boca Raton, Florida-based executive director at Incapital LLC,
a brokerage that specializes in selling structured notes. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) sold $14.9 million of six-year notes that
have a similar structure, Bloomberg data show. The securities,
issued Dec. 30, yield 1.15 times the Standard  Poor''s 500
Index''s gains, according to the prospectus. Should the benchmark
fall as much as 35 percent, the notes would pay the absolute
value of that loss. All capital is at risk if the index falls
any more than that. </p>
<h2>Brokerage Stakes </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley distributed both notes for a maximum fee of
3.5 percent while Citigroup also sold the Euro Stoxx 50 notes on
the same terms. Both banks were stakeholders in the world''s
largest brokerage, known as Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC,
until last year. The company changed its name to Morgan Stanley
Wealth Management in 2012, and its parent completed its purchase
of the wire house last year. </p>
<p>Citigroup estimated its note''s initial value at 93.5 cents
on the dollar, while Morgan Stanley''s was 94.7 cents on the
dollar. </p>
<p>Lauren Bellmare, a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley, and
Scott Helfman, of Citigroup, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts with
values derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and UBS AG (UBSN) are

trades in mortgage-backed securities after the financial crisis,
two people briefed on the matter said. </p>
<p>The investigation is in early stages, said the people, who
asked not to be named because the inquiries were confidential.
JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. lender by assets, disclosed the probe

special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program
and the U.S. Attorney''s office in Connecticut. </p>
<p>The largest global banks lost billions of dollars on

illiquid with wide spreads between bids from buyers and sellers. </p>
<p>Barclays Plc (BARC), Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman

<p>JPMorgan Asset Management has been
buying South Korean electronics and auto stocks in recent weeks,
saying concern that the won''s strength will erode exports is
overblown after valuations fell to eight-year lows. </p>
<p>We have been adding into weakness, Grace Tam, a Hong
Kong-based global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset, which
oversees about $1.5 trillion, said by phone yesterday. She
declined to name specific stocks. People worry about the
competitiveness of Korean exports. We think this is overdone. </p>
<p>The Kospi index has dropped 4.9 percent from last year''s
high on Oct. 30 as the won strengthened 5.9 percent against the
yen. The benchmark index''s valuation fell to about the same
level as its companies'' net assets last week, a 50 percent
discount versus the MSCI All-Country World Index, the widest gap
since July 2005. Samsung Electronics Co. (005930), the world''s biggest
maker of handsets and televisions, has slumped 14 percent while
Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) and Kia Motors Corp. (000270), South Korea''s largest
automakers, fell at least 12 percent. </p>
<p>Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo may lower the
nation''s benchmark interest rate by a quarter-percentage point
as early as tomorrow to mitigate the won''s gains and spur
growth, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Hyundai Motor and
Kia Motors predicted the slowest growth in combined deliveries
since 2006 on Jan. 2, while Samsung Electronics posted its first
profit decline in nine quarters yesterday. </p>
<h2>Global Outlook </h2>
<p>International investors sold a net $2.2 billion of Kospi
shares since the end of October, snapping a record stretch of
inflows into Asia''s fourth-largest economy. The Kospi fell less
than 0.1 percent to 1,958.96 at the close today. Samsung
Electronics slipped 1 percent, while Hyundai Motor climbed 0.2
percent. The two stocks comprise more than 20 percent of the
Kospi''s weighting. </p>
<p>Emerging-market stocks trailed developed-nation equities by
the most since 1998 last year, leaving the MSCI Emerging Markets
Index at the biggest valuation discount since 2004. The
developing-nation gauge trades for 1.5 times net assets, or
about 31 percent below the multiple on the MSCI World Index,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Improving growth in advanced economies including the U.S.
will give South Korean exporters a boost in coming months, Tam
said. The International Monetary Fund plans to raise its global
growth forecast in coming weeks, Christine Lagarde, the fund''s
managing director, told reporters in Nairobi yesterday. </p>
<p>The Korean market is still very cheap, Tam said.
Recent declines gave us good entry points. </p>

that they may be punished for their clients'' misdeeds. </p>
<p>JPMorgan avoided prosecution by acknowledging in an accord
with the U.S. yesterday that it ignored red flags for almost two
decades that Madoff used his account there to run a fraud. The
bank will pay $1.7 billion to settle the government''s
allegations, $350 million in a related case by the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency, plus $543 million to cover separate
private claims, the firm said in a filing. </p>
<p>The agreement includes the largest ever bank forfeiture
and also the largest ever Department of Justice penalty for a
violation of the Bank Secrecy Act, Bharara said today in a

resolving a slate of probes that have engulfed the bank since

<p>JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon,
agreed in 2013 to pay $15.7 billion to resolve other U.S.
regulatory probes and still faces investigations of its hiring
practices in China and the possible manipulation of interest

<p>Wall Street firms have spent years fighting claims by
Madoff''s victims that the companies ignored wrongdoing to
continue reaping fees. Madoff, 75, maintained accounts with
JPMorgan for more than 20 years before confessing to running a
fraud that cost investors about $17 billion. He''s serving a 150-year federal prison sentence in North Carolina. </p>

<h2>Compliance Action </h2>
<h2>Bafin Slams Deutsche Bank for Monte Paschi Accounting, Welt Says </h2>
<p>Deutsche Bank AG incorrectly accounted for a derivative
transaction with Monte dei Paschi, Welt reported, citing a
letter the German regulator Bafin sent to the bank in November. </p>
<p>Bafin official Frauke Menke wrote in the letter that
Deutsche Bank''s alleged provision of false information to Bafin
and other authorities is unacceptable, the German newspaper
reported. </p>
<p>Errors were made due to inefficient communication between
departments at the company and were later corrected, Welt
reported. </p>
<p>An inadequate investigation of the matter gives the
impression that Deutsche Bank doesn''t take its announced
cultural change seriously, Menke said, according to Welt. </p>
<p>Sven Gebauer, a spokesman for Bafin, declined to comment on
the details of the Welt story. </p>
<p>Regina Schueller, a spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank, also
declined comment on the Welt report. We cooperate with
regulatory authorities and, together with them, seek to
investigate questions thoroughly and promptly, she said in an
e-mailed response to questions from Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Courts </h2>
<h2>Former UBS Banker Weil Pleads Not Guilty in Tax-Probe Case </h2>
<p>Raoul Weil, once a top UBS AG banker, pleaded not guilty to
charges that he conspired to use Swiss bank secrecy to help
thousands of Americans cheat on their taxes. </p>
<p>Weil, 54, appeared yesterday in federal court in Fort
Lauderdale, Florida, where his lawyer entered the plea on his
behalf. Weil, a Swiss citizen, first appeared in the court Dec.
16, five years after he was indicted and declared a fugitive. He
was arrested Oct. 2 after checking into a hotel in Bologna,
Italy, and later extradited to the U.S. </p>
<p>We look forward to coming back to Florida and defending
him when we have a trial date, Weil''s attorney, Aaron Marcu,
said outside the courtroom. </p>
<p>The former head of UBS AG''s global wealth-management
business, Weil is the highest-ranking banker charged in a U.S.
crackdown on offshore tax evasion. If he doesn''t plead guilty
and cooperate with prosecutors, they must prove that he oversaw
60 private bankers who helped UBS make $200 million a year by
managing $20 billion in assets not declared to the Internal
Revenue Service. </p>
<p>Weil is free on $10.5 million bail and staying under house
arrest in New Jersey. </p>
<p>To prove their case, prosecutors will rely on
substantially the same evidence that led UBS, the biggest
Swiss bank, to pay $780 million in February 2009 to avoid
prosecution, Mark Daly, a U.S. Justice Department trial
attorney, said at Weil''s bail hearing on Dec. 16. The Zurich-based bank admitted it helped defraud the U.S. by setting up
accounts that taxpayers hid from the IRS. </p>
<p>At last month''s hearing, Marcu said his client didn''t know
about a rogue division of bankers. Swiss regulators concluded
that Weil was not involved and was not aware of any wrongdoing
by any of these underlings who were multiple levels below him,
said Marcu of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP in New York.
The weight of the evidence at the very best, very best, is
equivocal. </p>
<p>UBS must cooperate on any matter related to the
government''s criminal investigation of its cross-border
business, according to the deferred-prosecution agreement. </p>
<p>If Weil cooperates with prosecutors, they can urge a judge
to give him a shorter sentence. He faces as long as five years
in prison. </p>

investigates complex financial instruments. </p>
<p>Osnato, 41, joined the SEC in 2008 and became assistant

a statement. He will run a unit that looks into potential
misconduct linked to asset-backed securities, derivatives and
other instruments, the agency said. </p>
<p>As part of a $920 million settlement with U.S. and U.K.

<p>Yandex NV (YNDX), Russia''s biggest Internet
company, climbed to a record after Morgan Stanley said rising
sales will help extend the stock''s two-fold gain in 2013. </p>
<p>Shares of Yandex rose 4.7 percent to $44.22 in New York,
the highest since its May 2011 U.S. debut. The gain sent
valuations to 29.8 times estimated earnings, or 16 percent above
its historical average. The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index
fell 0.4 percent, led by television company CTC Media Inc. (CTCM) and
wireless carrier VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) </p>
<p>Yandex will report a 30 percent revenue increase for 2013,
helping the stock outperform peers over the next two months
following a record rally last year, Edward Hill-Wood, an analyst
at Morgan Stanley, said in a note yesterday. While Russia is
posting its weakest annual expansion since 2009, retail sales
beat forecasts and inflation-adjusted wages grew, indicating a
robust market for Internet advertising. </p>
<p>People are pricing in Yandex''s exposure to e-commerce,
Anastasia Obukhova, an analyst at VTB Capital in Moscow, said in
a telephone interview. This is one of the few stories which
still provide you with quite high growth. </p>
<p>Sales for 2013 will increase 39 percent to a record 40
billion rubles ($1.2 billion), according to the average of five
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company, based in
The Hague, is set to report earnings Feb. 19. </p>
<p>Yandex is building online payment tools and a marketplace
platform called Yandex Market in a bid to tap into Russian
consumers'' migration to online shopping, Obukhova said. Yandex
reported third-quarter revenue that exceeded analysts''
estimates, helped by online ads after the company extended its
text-based advertising service to Mail.ru Group Ltd. </p>
<h2>Wages Grow </h2>
<p>Russian retail sales rose 4.5 percent in November, topping
the 3.3 percent median forecast of 17 economists in a Bloomberg
survey. Real wages advanced 4.8 percent from a year earlier in
November following a revised 5.4 percent increase the previous
month, and real disposable income rose. </p>
<p>While Russia''s economy probably grew 1.5 percent in 2013,
the worst performance since it shrank 7.8 percent in 2009,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg, speculation the
government may sponsor some form of fiscal stimulus following
the games is growing, Jefferies LLC analysts including David Reynolds wrote in a note dated Jan. 8. </p>
<p>Russia is hosting the Feb. 7-23 Winter Olympics in Sochi, a
resort town along the Black Sea. It''s spending $48 billion on
roads, hotels, airports, stadiums and train lines, about seven
times more than the amount spent on any previous Winter Games. </p>
<h2>ETF Retreats </h2>
<p>The Bloomberg Russia-US gauge slipped to 97.91 after Credit
Suisse Group AG cut ratings on the country''s top three companies
in the telecommunications sector, citing increased price
competition in the Russian market and weak economic growth.
VimpelCom declined 2.2 percent to $12.07 and OAO Mobile
TeleSystems, Russia''s largest wireless carrier, fell 2.9 percent
to $20.17. CTC Media sank 5.2 percent, the most in five months,
to $12.78. </p>
<p>The Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX), the biggest U.S.-traded
exchange-traded fund that holds Russian shares, slipped 0.5
percent to $27.17, the lowest level in four months. Futures on
the RTS index slumped 0.7 percent to 137,760 in U.S. hours, and
the RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in the
index futures, decreased 0.5 percent to 20.62. </p>
<p>United Co. Rusal, a Moscow-based aluminum producer, tumbled
4.1 percent HK$2.34 at 10:39 a.m. in Hong Kong trading, heading
for its biggest loss in a month. The stock jumped 7.5 percent

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX), the world''s second-largest energy company by market value, will report a drop in
fourth-quarter profit after oil and natural gas production
declined amid slumping prices for the commodities. </p>
<p>Net income during the period was comparable to the $5
billion earned during the third quarter, the San Ramon,
California-based company said in a statement yesterday. That
compares with a $7.25 billion profit posted during the final
three months of 2012. </p>
<p>Chevron joins U.S. competitors such as ConocoPhillips (COP) hurt
by slumping oil and gas output as weakening demand growth in the
world''s largest economies pressures prices. Chevron
underperformed its biggest U.S. rivals -- Exxon Mobil Corp. and
ConocoPhillips -- last year in stock performance and lagged the
industry average by almost half. </p>
<p>Chevron really struggled on production last year but it
looks like they''re going to turn that around in 2014, Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones  Co. in St. Louis who
rates Chevron shares a buy, said in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>Chevron is expected to report per-share profit of $2.87,
excluding some extraordinary items, when full fourth-quarter
results are released on Jan. 31. That''s the average of 17
analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John S. Watson plans
to spend almost $40 billion on floating platforms, gas-export
terminals and exploratory wells this year as part of a plan to
boost worldwide output 20 percent by the end of 2017. </p>
<h2>Declining Output </h2>
<p>Chevron pumped the equivalent of 2.564 million barrels of
crude daily during October and November, according to the
statement. That''s almost 4 percent lower than the full-quarter
average of 2.668 million from the year-earlier period. </p>
<p>Given the decline in output, the company has no chance of
meeting its full-year output target announced in March of 2.65
million barrels a day, Youngberg said. </p>
<p>ConocoPhillips warned investors this week that fourth-quarter production slipped to a nine-year low because of bad
weather in the U.S. and the North Sea that interfered with
operations. The Houston-based company said Jan. 7 that output
dropped to a daily average equivalent to 1.475 million barrels a
day. </p>
<p>ConocoPhillips is scheduled to release full quarterly
results on Jan. 30, as is Exxon, the world''s biggest energy
company by market value. </p>

<p>Banking clients at DBS Group Holdings
Ltd. (DBS) will soon get investing assistance from Watson, the same
International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) technology that triumphed
over human Jeopardy! contestants. </p>
<p>The Singapore-based bank plans to begin using the tool,
which can answer questions in conversational language and learn
from responses, to aid financial planners in guiding its wealth-management unit''s affluent customers, IBM said today. Watson
will analyze large volumes of financial data to help DBS,
Southeast Asia''s largest lender, offer more customized service. </p>
<p>The agreement gives IBM a proving ground as it tries to
show clients the value of its Watson technology. The Armonk, New
York-based company announced today it''s creating a separate
division for Watson to spur growth after six consecutive
quarters of falling revenue. IBM will invest more than $1
billion in the unit, including $100 million in venture funding
for businesses that develop applications based on the
technology. </p>
<p>Based in New York with a staff of 2,000, the new unit will
be separate from IBM''s hardware, software and services
divisions, said Stephen Gold, vice president of Watson
Solutions. </p>
<p>It''s the first time that IBM is bringing together all of
the disparate functions that support a business, Gold said in
an interview. It''s a kind of doubling down. </p>
<h2>High-Profile Bet </h2>
<p>As sluggish demand for computer hardware has dragged down
sales, IBM has been selling off businesses to focus on more
profitable, faster-growing areas such as data analytics and
cloud computing. Watson is one of its highest-profile bets. </p>
<p>By putting these parts of the business into one group, I
can do things I couldn''t do,  Michael Rhodin, who will lead
the Watson Group as senior vice president, said in an interview
today in New York. I can make decisions much, much faster on
how to redeploy resources over new opportunities and new ideas.
It''s what the whole structure is all about -- it''s about
speed. </p>
<p>Rhodin, previously head of IBM''s Software Solutions Group,
will continue to report to fellow Senior Vice President Steve Mills, who oversees software. </p>
<p>IBM has stumbled amid the industrywide shift into the cloud
era, where information is stored online instead of onsite. The
transition has eroded demand for traditional hardware and
spawned a new crop of competitors. To cope, IBM has spent more
than $7.5 billion since 2010 on 43 software business
acquisitions, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Big Data </h2>
<p>In July, the company purchased cloud-computing storage
provider SoftLayer Technologies Inc. for about $2 billion. IBM
will adapt Watson''s technology so it can be delivered through
SoftLayer''s cloud infrastructure, it said today. </p>
<p>Watson and other big-data services, which let customers
mine vast troves of information to make better decisions, were
the company''s biggest focus in 2013, Chief Executive Officer
Ginni Rometty said in March. IBM boosted its expected sales from
the data-analysis business to $20 billion in 2015, compared with
an earlier forecast of $16 billion. </p>
<p>IBM shares fell less than 1 percent to $187.38 at the close
in New York. The stock fell 2.1 percent in 2013, the year''s lone
decliner in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. </p>
<p>The Watson Group will also include an incubator for
businesses to build on the technology, which IBM began offering
to outside developers in November. The goal was to have three
apps developed on the platform ready to enter the market early
this year, the company said at the time. </p>
<h2>Two-Way Street </h2>
<p>IBM has received about 890 requests from programmers to
build applications in Watson''s so-called developer ecosystem,
Rhodin said today. The company declined to comment on the number
allowed to use the services. </p>
<p>IBM has to be selective in choosing clients who can use
Watson because customers must upload large amounts of data
before the system can work, Rhodin said. </p>
<p>There''s work on both sides here, he said. To even get
started, you have to first find all of your data. For a lot of
companies, that is proving to be harder than they thought it was
going to be. </p>
<p>DBS is willing to invest S$15 million ($12 million) over
three years in IBM''s technology, and it plans to extend the
Watson service beyond wealth management to its small-business
and payment services, CEO Piyush Gupta said today at a briefing
in Singapore. </p>
<p>IBM has collaborated on Watson-based projects with health-care organizations, including insurer WellPoint Inc. and
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. The company is also
working with Nielsen Holdings NV and Royal Bank of Canada on
services that use Watson to interact with customers. Those first
projects will show other potential clients Watson''s promise,
Gold said. </p>
<p>The immediate focus is to ensure the success of those
early engagements, he said. It''s a much more interactive way
to work with clients and partners. </p>

<p>The largest U.S. and European oil
companies will pay more for Abu Dhabi crude when the end of a
75-year partnership reduces their direct stakes in the emirate''s
output, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil Corp., BP Plc, Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) and Total
SA (FP) lose their rights as shareholders in the company operating
Abu Dhabi''s onshore oil fields after their joint venture expires
this week. The international companies will then start paying a
premium of 11 cents a barrel over Abu Dhabi''s official selling
price for Murban grade crude, the two people said, declining to
be identified because the contract terms are private. </p>
<p>As long as their crude price is reasonably competitive
and they''re feeding their trading arms, it''s something they can
deal with, Robin Mills, head of consulting at Manaar Energy
Consulting and Project Management, said by telephone from Dubai
today. The companies will be betting that they can trade the
crude to add more than 11 cents of value. </p>
<p>The end of an accord accounting for more than half of the
output from OPEC''s fourth-largest supplier further weakens, at
least temporarily, the role of international companies in the
group, as member nations seek to retain more oil wealth. Abu
Dhabi holds most of the reserves in the United Arab Emirates,
which pumped 2.76 million barrels a day in December, or 9.2
percent of all oil supplied by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Murban Pricing </h2>
<p>The expiring partnership between the international
companies and state-run Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., or Adnoc,
accounts for about 1.5 million barrels a day of Murban crude,
the U.A.E.''s main blend. Murban for December costs $113.85 a
barrel under Abu Dhabi''s retroactive monthly pricing system. </p>
<p>Adnoc will take full control of the unit operating the
fields while completing a bidding process to award new
concessions, according to a statement from the producer
yesterday. Until a new concession agreement is reached, Exxon,
Shell, BP and Total will buy Murban crude from Adnoc under six-month contracts that will replace some of the oil they would
have taken as equity partners, the people said. </p>
<p>Abu Dhabi has pumped oil from its onshore fields under
concession deals with Exxon, Shell, Total, BP and Portugal''s
Partex Oil  Gas, or their predecessors, that have been in
effect since January 1939. Adnoc became a partner in the 1970s,
forming Abu Dhabi Co. for Onshore Oil Operations, or ADCO, in
which the five foreign partners held a 40 percent stake. </p>
<h2>Production Loss </h2>
<p>BP, Shell, Total and Exxon, each of whom held a 9.5
percent interest, will see an end to some 150,000 barrels a day
of annual production and the loss of about $50 million of annual
fixed income, Deutsche Bank AG analyst Lucas Herrmann wrote in
a note today. More surprising is that at this stage there has
been no temporary extension and that Adnoc, the state oil
company, has taken full control of the fields. </p>
<p>The four companies, which retain some stakes in Abu Dhabi''s
offshore production, are among 11 from the U.S., Europe and Asia
that submitted bids in October for new production agreements in
the Persian Gulf emirate. Partex, the smallest partner in ADCO
with a 2 percent stake, wasn''t invited to bid. Adnoc may take
until January 2015 to choose new partners, Abdulla Nasser Al Suwaidi, the company''s director general, said in November. </p>
<h2>Interim Agreements </h2>
<p>Adnoc at first considered signing yearlong oil supply
contracts with BP, Exxon, Shell and Total, the people with
knowledge of the matter said. By signing six-month agreements
instead, the state producer will have greater flexibility in the
event concession agreements are reached earlier than next
January, they said. </p>
<p>Spokesmen at BP, Exxon and Shell declined to comment. Total
media representatives didn''t immediately comment when contacted
by phone. An Adnoc spokesman declined to provide additional
comment beyond what the company said in the statement yesterday. </p>
<p>Korea National Oil Corp. and Italy''s Eni SpA (ENI) have said
they''re bidding for the new concessions. The remaining bidders
are Japan Oil Development Co., China National Petroleum Corp.,
Norway''s Statoil ASA, Occidental Petroleum Corp. of the U.S. and
Russia''s OAO Rosneft, according to Energy Intelligence Group. </p>

<p>Major broadcasters are heading for a
showdown in their bid to block a Barry Diller-backed company
from upending the industry''s economics by offering subscribers
live television over the Internet. </p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court will say as soon as tomorrow whether
it will consider the claim by companies including Walt Disney
Co. (DIS)''s ABC and 21st Century Fox Inc. (FOX) that Aereo Inc.''s business
is built on copyright violations, obtaining broadcast signals
for free and distributing them for a profit. </p>
<p>Both sides in the dispute are seeking a high court hearing,
increasing the chances the justices will step in. If so, the
case will determine the fate of Aereo, a startup that threatens
the billions of dollars in retransmission fees broadcasters get
from pay-TV systems that provide signals to subscribers. </p>
<p>It''s nothing short of a watershed moment, said David Bank, a media analyst with RBC Capital Markets. If the Supreme
Court agrees to hear it, we''re going to finally resolve the
issue. </p>
<p>A federal appeals court in New York ruled that Aereo, which
provides broadcast signals to subscribers after capturing them
with thousands of small antennas, isn''t violating broadcasters''
copyrights. Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)''s NBCUniversal and CBS Corp. (CBS) are
joining Disney and Fox in urging reversal. </p>
<p>A decision to take up the case this month would mean a
Supreme Court ruling by early July. The justices could also ask
the Obama administration for input, a step that would delay a
resolution. </p>
<h2>Retransmission Fees </h2>
<p>Retransmission fees have become increasingly important for
broadcast networks, supplementing advertising revenue. </p>
<p>Broadcasters are expected to reap more than $4.29 billion
in fees paid by satellite and cable companies this year, a 30
percent gain from last year, according to research firm SNL
Kagan. That revenue is projected to reach $7.15 billion by 2018. </p>
<p>Fox and CBS have said they may abandon their broadcast
signals and become cable networks if Aereo continues unabated. </p>
<p>We need to be able to be fairly compensated for our
content, 21st Century Fox President and Chief Operating
Officer Chase Carey said at an industry conference last year.
We can''t sit idly by and let an entity steal our signal. We
will move to a subscription model if that''s our only recourse. </p>
<p>Conversion to a cable network would mean that broadcast
signals would no longer be freely available over the airwaves. </p>
<h2>Cable Switch </h2>
<p>Should broadcasters make the switch, it would affect about
12 percent of households, according to estimates based on data
from SNL Kagan and Nielsen. About 100 million of 114 million
U.S. homes with televisions subscribe to pay-TV services. </p>
<p>Diller, the billionaire investor who helped create the Fox
network, says New York-based Aereo may eventually get as much as
35 percent of U.S. households to subscribe if it overcomes legal
challenges. The service charges customers $8 a month. </p>
<p>DirecTV, Time Warner Cable Inc. and Charter Communications
Inc. are considering using the same approach, capturing free
broadcast-TV signals to avoid paying retransmission fees,
according to people with knowledge of the companies'' plans. </p>
<p>The cable companies could use Aereo''s approach in an effort
to bypass or reduce the fees they now pay, the people said. </p>
<p>The court fight centers on a provision in the federal
copyright law that gives owners the exclusive right to perform
their works publicly. The appeals court said Aereo''s service
was legal because the separate antennas let each customer create
a distinct copy of a broadcast program for viewing, so no public
transmission was taking place. </p>
<h2>Technical Detail'' </h2>
<p>The broadcasters argued in their appeal that Aereo is
trying to use a technical detail to circumvent well-established legal rights. </p>
<p>There is no dispute that Aereo has developed a business
model around the massive, for-profit exploitation of the
copyrighted works of others, the broadcasters argued. </p>
<p>Aereo is taking the unusual step of encouraging Supreme
Court review of a ruling in the company''s favor, saying it wants
to resolve legal doubt. That stems in part from rulings by two
federal trial judges declaring another company''s similar system
to be a copyright violation. </p>
<p>Litigation has created uncertainty that undermines
Aereo''s efforts to expand its footprint and further develop its
business, the company told the court. </p>
<p>Chet Kanojia, chief executive officer of Aereo, told
Bloomberg Television yesterday that it will become clear what
the road map looks like on the legal front over the next few
months if the Supreme Court takes up the case. </p>
<h2>NFL Backing </h2>
<p>Lower court disagreement often prompts the high court to
consider a case, though the justices tend to wait until the same
issue has been decided differently at the appeals court level. </p>
<p>The National Football League and Major League Baseball,
whose games appear on broadcast TV, are backing the media
companies. The broadcasters also have support at the high court
from companies that produce television programs, including Time
Warner Inc. and Viacom Inc. </p>
<p>Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC) is taking a middle ground in the
debate, saying that while Aereo''s service violates the copyright
laws, the broadcasters'' arguments go too far and threaten
legitimate services. </p>
<p>The local TV broadcast industry is run separately from the
national networks and would face a different challenge if Aereo
is found to be legal. Local broadcasters act as affiliates of
the national networks and negotiate separate deals with pay-TV
operators. </p>
<h2>Consolidating Business </h2>
<p>Local broadcasters have consolidated in the last few years,
a move partly spurred by the growth in retransmission revenue as
well as the value of their broadcasting bandwidth, also known as
spectrum, parts of which could be sold. </p>
<p>The situation led to more than $10 billion in acquisitions
last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Aereo''s
legality could threaten the value of those deals, according to
Bank. </p>
<p>It''s super-complicated from an investor perspective, he
said. </p>
<p>The Supreme Court case is American Broadcasting Companies
v. Aereo, 13-461. </p>

<p>The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to
decide whether a rival drink-maker can sue Coca-Cola Co. (KO) for
allegedly deceiving consumers about the amount of pomegranate
juice in one of its beverages. </p>
<p>A federal appeals court barred the suit by Pom Wonderful
LLC, saying Food and Drug Administration regulations authorize
the Coca-Cola product''s name. The label on the drink says
Pomegranate Blueberry Flavored Blend of 5 Juices, with the
first two words appearing in larger letters. </p>
<p>Pom Wonderful says the label is misleading because the
drink contains only 0.3 percent pomegranate juice and 0.2
percent blueberry juice. Apple and grape juice constitute 99
percent of the juice, Pom Wonderful says. </p>
<p>The appeals court ruling undermines the transparency that
health-conscious consumers rightly expect so that they can make
informed decisions about what they eat and drink, Los Angeles-based Pom Wonderful said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola says the label accurately tells consumers that
the product is a blend of fruits and tastes like pomegranate and
blueberry. </p>
<p>We are confident our labeling fully complies with
applicable FDA regulations, as the lower courts have
consistently found, the Atlanta-based company said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>The legal question is whether the Lanham Act, which
authorizes false-advertising suits, can apply even when the FDA
regulates a product. </p>
<p>A San Francisco-based federal appeals court threw out the
suit saying, we must respect the FDA''s apparent decision not
to impose the requirements urged by Pom. </p>
<p>Justices Samuel Alito and Stephen Breyer didn''t take part
in the court''s action today, raising the prospect that only
seven members of the court will participate in the case. As is
the court''s custom, Alito and Breyer gave no reasons. </p>
<p>The case is Pom Wonderful v. Coca-Cola, 12-761. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. agreed to lease 120,000 square feet in a new tower in
Manhattan''s East Village for its Watson Group, developer of the
technology that beat Jeopardy! champion Ken Jennings. </p>
<p>IBM, based in Armonk, New York, will bring the occupancy of
the Fumihiko Maki-designed building at 51 Astor Place to 73
percent, said Ed Minskoff, founder of developer Minskoff
Equities. The 400,000-square-foot (37,000-square-meter), 12-story tower was completed about four months ago, he said. </p>
<p>Minskoff started construction in the aftermath of the
credit crash without any tenants committed. The project tested
the appetite of New York''s technology and media companies for
new offices at a time when they were flocking to converted
factories and warehouses elsewhere in the area known as Midtown
South, roughly from 30th to Canal streets. </p>
<p>I always said from the day we announced we were going to
develop this property, it would lease after people could walk
through it, Minskoff said in a telephone interview. Now that
they''re walking through it, the response from most of the people
we''re doing deals with is, Wow.'' </p>
<p>As part of the deal, the tower will be named the IBM Watson
Building, Minskoff said. Watson is cloud-based technology that
answers questions in plain language and learns from the
responses. It''s known for beating Jennings after he won a record
74 straight Jeopardy! matches against other humans in 2011. </p>
<p>Lori Bosio, a spokeswoman for IBM, declined to comment on
the lease. </p>
<h2>Facebook, Yahoo </h2>
<p>Minskoff declined to reveal terms of the agreement, saying
only that it would be for between 10 and 20 years. He said in
general, tenants are paying rents that are in the range of
the $88 to $115 a square foot he said he was seeking in 2012. </p>
<p>Facebook Inc. and Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) last year took space in
buildings completed in the early 20th century. Facebook is
leasing offices at 770 Broadway, which is across the street from
51 Astor Place. </p>
<p>Our entrance looks straight into their space, Minskoff
said. All that did was reinforce in my mind the value of the
Astor Place location. </p>
<p>Watson''s move to Manhattan was reported by Forbes on its
website on Jan. 8. </p>

<p>A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) unit
denied dumping a Singapore private wealth client''s shares it
held as collateral and said it''s still owed money. </p>
<p>Quah Su Ling sued Goldman Sachs International in London,
accusing it of breach of contract for selling her shares in
Blumont Group Ltd., Asiasons Capital Ltd. (ACAP) and LionGold Corp. and
depressing their prices. Goldman Sachs International countersued
for $12.3 million it says it''s still owed. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs International sold the shares in an orderly
and measured manner -- consistent with industry practice and
accepted standards -- over the course of three weeks, the bank
said in court papers filed in London and made available this
week. The lawsuit is Quah''s attempt to delay or avoid
repayment of debt. </p>
<p>Shares of the three Singapore companies tumbled with
Asiasons falling 62 percent on Oct. 4, while Blumont declined 56
percent and LionGold was down 42 percent. Over three days from
Oct. 4, the declines erased $6.9 billion from Singapore''s bourse
value. The Monetary Authority of Singapore and the city''s stock
exchange said they would probe activities around the shares of
the companies. </p>
<p>Quah, the Chief Executive Officer of IPCO International
Ltd., claimed Goldman Sachs demanded she repay $48 million
within 1 1/2 hours on Oct. 2 and started selling her shares. The
bank hadn''t informed her previously of any shortfall in her
margin loan or give her reasonable time to make payment, Quah
said in court papers. </p>
<p>Edward Naylor, a Hong Kong-based spokesman for Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment on the lawsuit. Quah didn''t respond
to two e-mails or a call to her office. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs has also been sued in London by James Hong,
an executive director at Blumont. Hong claimed the bank breached
its duties by arbitrarily selling his shares in the three
Singapore commodity companies held as collateral, according to
the complaint. </p>
<p>Regulators around the world have stepped up oversight of
capital markets after the global financial crisis in 2008.
Singapore''s central bank established a 13-member council in 2010
with the goal of boosting corporate governance standards and
investor confidence. The Singapore Exchange, Southeast Asia''s
biggest bourse, said after the decline of the three stocks it
plans to add circuit breakers in 2014 to halt trading for 10
minutes when shares move 10 percent in either direction. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley said inflation and overspending threaten to push Japan''s finances to the brink, amid signs government-bond investors are preparing for rising consumer prices. </p> <p>An auction of inflation-linked sovereign notes yesterday drew a higher-than-expected price, as investors bid for 2.87 times the amount available. The benchmark 10-year yield on non-protected securities will probably climb to 0.84 percent by the end of 2014, delivering a 0.5 percent loss, based on analyst estimates and data compiled by Bloomberg. That would be the first negative return since 2003, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. </p> <p>The Japanese government has two to three years to curb expenditures or face a possible crisis, according to Robert Feldman, the head of Japan economic research at Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities Co. The government is doubling the nation''s 5 percent sales tax in two steps from this year, as a more than 4 percent jump in welfare expenditures and debt servicing costs next fiscal year is set to outpace revenue growth, according to the Ministry of Finance budget plan. </p> <p>There''s the risk interest payments would swell should the government fail to cut budget deficits when inflation and yields grind higher, Feldman said in an interview in Tokyo on Jan. 8. Absent an increase in tax revenues stemming from a tangible improvement in the real economy, there is a risk of collapse. </p> <h2>Linkers Demand </h2> <p>The ministry sold 300 billion yen ($2.86 billion) of 0.1 percent 10-year inflation-linked notes yesterday at 105.90 yen, exceeding the median estimate of 105.65 in a Bloomberg News survey of 13 traders. The bid-to-cover ratio was 2.87, compared with 3.74 at the prior auction on Oct. 8. Sales have resumes after a five-year halt, with the last offering in August 2008 getting 2.52 times the amount on offer. </p> <p>The yield gap between 10-year nominal government bonds and linkers climbed five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 1.08 percentage points yesterday, and was little changed today. The breakeven rate, which signals bond investors'' expectations of future inflation, may advance to as high as 1.4 percentage points this year, said Yuya Yamashita, a rates strategist in Tokyo at JPMorgan Chase  Co. </p> <p>What''s most important is if there will be wage hikes and also whether they will spread in the country, and I have a positive view on that, said Yamashita. All things equal, faster inflation increases nominal bond yields. </p> <h2>Abenomics Impact </h2> <p>JPMorgan expects 10-year yields to finish this year at 0.8 percent, he said. The benchmark yield was little changed at 0.695 percent today, compared with 2.97 percent for similar-maturity Treasuries. </p> <p>Japan''s government bonds due in one to 10 years have had posted annual losses only three times since 1986, a Merrill Lynch index shows. They last recorded a decline in 2003 at 0.67 percent after yearly slides in 1994 and 1989. </p> <p>Prime Minister Shinzo Abe''s economic policy, which is made up of fiscal spending, monetary easing and growth initiatives, helped pushed inflation to the halfway point of the Bank of Japan''s 2 percent target. Consumer prices excluding fresh food rose 1.2 percent in November from a year earlier, the most in five years. </p> <p>Social-security expenditures will rise 4.8 percent in fiscal 2014 and make up the largest part of total spending at 32 percent, according to the Ministry of Finance''s website. Debt servicing costs, which account for 24 percent of the total, will increase 4.6 percent while revenue grows 3.5 percent. </p> <h2>BOJ Purchases </h2> <p>The central bank has been buying more than 7 trillion yen of government bonds every month since April, keeping the nation''s borrowing costs at the lowest globally </p> <p>Economy Minister Akira Amari told reporters in Tokyo today the BOJ is steadily conducting its monetary policy and that the Group of 20 nations understand Japan''s easing isn''t targeted at foreign exchange rates. </p> <p>The yen slid 0.2 percent to 104.97 per dollar as of 3:47 p.m. in Tokyo from yesterday after plunging 18 percent last year, the most since 1979. Depreciation typically enhances exporters'' competitiveness while boosting inflation through higher import costs. The BOJ might come in for more asset purchases to alleviate the impact on the economy from the planned tax hike, said Alvin Liew, a Singapore-based economist at United Overseas Bank Ltd. We expect longer-term JGB yields to edge higher in 2014 but not much. </p> <h2>Tax Increase </h2> <p>The government will raise the sales levy by 3 percentage points to 8 percent in April and to 10 percent in October 2015. Abe needs to boost tax revenue to close the nation''s budget gap as the government struggles to pay for the care of the world''s fastest-aging society. </p> <p>Budgeting may become increasingly difficult, setting off an unstoppable negative debt spiral, that''s why bold spending cuts are necessary, said Feldman, who previously served as an economist at the International Monetary Fund. Relying too much on tax increases to improve fiscal health is extremely dangerous. </p> <p>Japan''s public debt has ballooned to more than 1 quadrillion yen. The nation''s net liabilities, or total debt less financial assets, will reach 142 percent of gross domestic product this year, compared with 88 percent for the U.S., according to estimates by the International Monetary Fund. </p> <h2>Bond Risk </h2> <p>The cost to protect Japan''s debt for five years against nonpayment was at 45 basis points yesterday, up from 40 at the end of last year, according to data provider CMA. The premium on the credit-default swaps plunged 42 basis points in 2013, following a 62 drop the previous year. </p> <p>You think where the crowded trades are in the system today -- people are riding Japan, Rick Rieder, the chief investment officer for fundamental fixed income at BlackRock Inc., the world''s biggest asset manager, said in a Bloomberg Television interview on Jan. 8. It''s a good trade, but you got to watch it carefully. </p> <p>Japan is the only place in the world where you have fiscal, structural and monetary policy, said Rieder, who runs the $11.4 billion BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities Portfolio. They also have a burden that''s incredibly high in front of them in terms of the size of debt load. In 2014 are we going to have all the signs that things are going reasonably well? I think so in Japan. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Michael J.

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) investors want a target for annual returns -- as long as it''s higher than the one that pays a bonus to Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and his top deputies. </p> <p>With the New York-based firm set to report a fourth straight year of lower profitability than it had in the decade before the financial crisis, shareholders are waiting for Goldman Sachs to end its status as the only major investment bank that won''t declare a public profitability target. The company''s board of directors set a 10 percent return-on-equity target for top executives to earn their long-term bonuses, a level that even Blankfein has called hardly aspirational. </p> <p>While the lack of a target hasn''t prevented Goldman Sachs''s stock from almost doubling in the past two years, executives have been asked for a goal by analysts and investors during six of the last seven earnings calls and conference presentations. The most recent request came after third-quarter trading revenue dropped the most among the nine largest global investment banks. </p> <p>It does come up a lot with investors, how long do they have? said Roger Freeman, a Barclays Plc (BARC) analyst in New York. It''s a question of time -- whether the environment for dealers gets better fast enough to avoid being in a difficult position of having to put a target out there that''s meaningfully higher than where they''re at. </p>

<p>The commodities cycle that sent
prices rising almost fourfold over 10 years is reversing and
will eventually drive raw materials into a structural bear
market, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said. </p>
<p>Growth in shale oil output will keep U.S. energy prices
low, reinforcing economic growth and leading to more tapering of
government stimulus, the bank said in a report dated yesterday.
That will cut raw-material demand in emerging markets and lead
to weakened currencies that will encourage more production. The
new cycle is the opposite of the super cycle that ran from
2002 through 2011, Goldman said. </p>
<p>I can''t tell you about one commodity out there that has a
bullish supply-side story, Jeffrey Currie, head of commodities
research at Goldman, said at the company''s investor conference
in London today. A decade of higher commodity prices generated
a supply response. </p>
<p>Commodities posted the first annual drop in five years in
2013 as supply exceeded demand for corn to sugar to nickel and
investors lost faith in precious metals as a store of value amid
signs that economies are improving. As higher prices spurred
miners and farmers to boost production at time when China''s
economic growth slowed, Citigroup Inc. said the super cycle
of gains has ended. </p>
<p>The rotation away from emerging markets and towards
developed market demand as well as the supply increase,
particularly the U.S. shale revolution, are creating a new
commodity cycle, Currie said in the report. On net, this new
commodity cycle eventually suggests a structural bear market in
commodities, but we believe that is still in the distant
future. </p>
<h2>Weakening Currencies </h2>
<p>The new cycle will lead emerging market nations to increase
production to raise cash to make up for weakening currencies,
which will further weaken prices and reinforce the U.S.
recovery, Goldman said. A structural bear market is only in
the future because of transportation, processing and
distribution bottlenecks, Goldman said. Surging U.S. oil output
is largely trapped in the country and copper smelters are
failing to process rising supplies from mines, according to the
report. </p>
<p>Commodity cycles last about 25 to 30 years, with the first
half spent on building production capacity to meet demand and
the next 10 to 15 years spent on building capacity to consume,
Currie said. Returns in the last 10 to 15 years will be positive
for industries such as petrochemicals, he said. </p>
<h2>Precious Metals </h2>
<p>The Standard  Poor''s Enhanced Commodity Index will fall 3
percent in the next 12 months, with precious metals dropping 15
percent on top of last year''s 30 percent decline and agriculture
falling 11 percent after sliding 18 percent in 2013, Goldman
said. Industrial metals are forecast to decrease 5 percent and
livestock 3 percent, according to the report. Energy will lose 1
percent, after gaining 5.6 percent in 2013, the bank said. </p>
<p>Gold prices will fall to $1,050 an ounce in 12 months from
$1,246 an ounce now, while copper will be at $6,200 a metric ton
from $7,283 a ton now as the market moves into surplus, the bank
said. A record soybean crop in South America will send prices to
$9.50 a bushel from $12.7325 a bushel now. </p>
<p>While Brent will be at $100 a barrel in 12 months and West
Texas Intermediate oil at $90 a barrel, price risk is skewed
to the downside, Currie said in the report. Uncertainty about
oil supplies due to geopolitical risks in Libya and South Sudan
means the bank is neutral commodities over the next three
months, with prices forecast to return 3 percent in the period. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) senior investment
banker Scott Matlock is retiring from the firm, according to a
person with direct knowledge of the situation. </p>
<p>His departure was announced within the bank late last week,
the person said, asking not to be identified because it wasn''t

Stanley and most recently worked as its chairman of
international mergers and acquisitions, based in London. </p>
<p>He has focused in recent years on deals in the media and

British Sky Broadcasting Plc (BSY) and Liberty Global Plc. He has yet

<p>Electric cars including Tesla Motors
Inc. (TSLA)''s Model S pose different risks than gasoline-powered models
while being as safe overall, the top U.S. auto-safety regulator
said. </p>
<p>We believe they don''t pose any greater risks than
gasoline-fueled vehicles, David Friedman, deputy administrator
of the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said
in an interview today at the North American International Auto
Show in Detroit. </p>
<p>Do they pose different risks? Certainly, he said. </p>
<p>Friedman''s agency is investigating two Model S fires in the
U.S. that resulted from battery packs being punctured by road
debris. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Jan. 10 that the company would
replace adapters in the Model S, after at least a half-dozen
reports appeared on a website for Tesla owners saying that wall
plugs had heated, at some point to smoking or melting, as the
cars were being recharged in garages. </p>
<p>The replacement effort will be handled as a recall, though
customers don''t have to take their vehicles to a service center. </p>
<p>A NHTSA team that includes engineers and people who study
consumer behavior is looking at electric cars, said Friedman,
who is leading the agency after the departure of former leader
David Strickland. </p>
<p>People aren''t used to the new challenges that electric
vehicles pose, he said. We''re taking this issue seriously.
We want to make sure electric vehicles are safe. </p>
<p>NHTSA has an interest in seeing electric cars gain consumer
acceptance, as part of its mission is to increase average fuel
economy of U.S. vehicles, he said. </p>
<h2>Tesla Responsive </h2>
<p>Friedman said Musk and his team are doing a good job
responding to regulators'' requests, after a public spat between
company executives and Strickland over who initiated the Model S
investigation. </p>
<p>The other dynamics aren''t important, he said. </p>
<p>Musk and other Tesla executives today took issue with the
adapter replacement and a related software update, made in
December, being labeled a recall. </p>
<p>NHTSA may sometimes call this a recall, Jerome Guillen,
vice president of worldwide sales and service, told reporters in
Detroit today. We call it modern technology. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest U.S. bank, said it replaced 2 million payment cards after the breach of consumer data at retailers including Target Corp. (TGT) </p> <p>The threat to cardholder information is a big deal, it''s not going to go away, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said today on a conference call discussing fourth-quarter results at the New York-based bank. </p> <p>Target, the second-largest U.S. discount chain, said late last year that credit- and debit-card data from 40 million accounts were compromised.

<p>This story is not over, unfortunately, Dimon, 57, said.

All of us have a common interest in being protected. </p> <p>Putnam Bank filed a suit against Target, claiming that the security breakdown cost the lender money because it forced the bank to issue customer alerts and new cards, while reimbursing account holders for losses. Credit-card lender American Express Co. (AXP) said this month that it''s appealing a federal judge''s order approving a $5.7 billion settlement by Visa Inc.

<p>MasterCard had been a FIFA partner for 16 years and argued

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s corporate and

compensation last year as the division''s revenue was little
changed. </p>
<p>The unit''s $10.8 billion in compensation fell to 30 percent

2012, according to figures posted today on the New York-based

year earlier. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, has struggled to
meet expense goals amid surging litigation costs and efforts to
improve compliance. The company wouldn''t penalize employees for
losses tied to bad loans sold by firms it acquired amid the

never blamed employees broadly for mistakes we made away from

<p>Compensation at the corporate and investment bank, run by
Mike Cavanagh, 48, and Daniel Pinto, 51, includes salaries,
bonuses, benefits and the cost of deferred pay from previous

<h2>Allergan Wins Order Blocking Copies of Lumigan Until 2027 </h2>
<p>Allergan Inc. (AGN) won a patent-infringement lawsuit that will
prevent copies of its Lumigan 0.01% glaucoma treatment from
entering the U.S. market until 2027. </p>
<p>Novartis AG (NOVN)''s Sandoz unit, Actavis Plc (ACT), Hi-Tech Pharmacal
Co. and Lupin Ltd. (LPC) would infringe Allergan''s patents on the
medicine, U.S. District Judge Michael Schneider in Tyler, Texas,
said in an opinion posted on the court''s website yesterday. The
judge also rejected arguments that the patents were invalid, and
ordered that regulatory approval not be granted until they
expire. </p>
<p>Lumigan, which comes in different solution formulas,
generated $452.7 million in sales for the nine months ended
Sept. 30 and accounts for about 10 percent of the Irvine,
California-based company''s revenue. The solution slows the
progression of glaucoma, which can cause blindness. </p>
<p>The case involved five patents. Four expire in 2025 and the
fifth in 2027, according to the website of the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration. </p>
<p>The generic-drug companies argued that the patents were
little different from ones covering Lumigan 0.03%. An appeals
court last year upheld a patent on that treatment that expires
in August. The judge said the newer patents are for a solution
that limited red eyes, which caused some patients to stop taking
the treatment. </p>
<p>Bonnie Jacobs, a spokeswoman for Allergan, said the company
had no comment. Officials with the generic-drug makers either
had no immediate comment or didn''t immediately respond to
queries. </p>
<p>Lumigan is Allergan''s second-biggest drug, after Restasis
eye drops. Allergan yesterday received a new patent on Restasis. </p>
<p>The case is Allergan Inc. v. Sandoz Inc., 11-cv-00441, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Texas (Tyler). </p>
<h2>Microsoft Sued for Infringement by Former Litigator''s Client </h2>
<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world''s largest software company, was
sued for infringement by a company whose lawyer has litigated
patent cases in the past for Microsoft. </p>
<p>IpLearn-Focus LLC filed its lawsuit Jan. 10 in federal
court in San Francisco. The Mountain View, California-based
company is represented by Matthew D. Powers of the Tensegrity
Law Group LLP of Redwood Shores, California. </p>
<p>Powers, who left New York-based Weil Gotshal  Manges LLP
in 2011 to form a patent-litigation firm, represented Microsoft
in cases including a lawsuit filed in June of that year against
TiVo Inc. (TIVO) He defended the Redmond, Washington-based software
maker in a 2007 case brought by patent owner I4i LP, according
to court files. </p>
<p>As of yesterday afternoon, the electronic docket for the
IPLearn-Focus lawsuit didn''t show an entry of any motion by
Microsoft to disqualify Powers. No counsel for Microsoft is
listed. </p>
<p>The lawsuit concerns three patents covering learning
methods and systems that use a remote sensor. IpLearn-Focus said
Microsoft''s Xbox video-game console and services infringe
patents 8,475,174, 8,538,321 and 8,538,320. According to the
database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, those are the
only three patents belonging to IpLearn-Focus. </p>
<p>The company, which doesn''t have a functioning website, also
is listed as the owner of patent application 20140004498, which
was published in the office''s database Jan. 2. That application
is related to the use of detached sensors in a learning
environment. </p>
<p>IpLearn-Focus said in court filings that it put Microsoft
on notice of its alleged infringement on Nov. 1 and that at the
time the complaint was filed it had received no response from
the software maker. </p>
<p>The company said it''s seeking money damages and a
reasonable royalty. It asked that damages be tripled for
Microsoft''s allegedly deliberate infringement. It also requested
attorney fees and litigation costs. </p>
<p>Microsoft didn''t immediately respond to an e-mailed request
for comment on the lawsuit. </p>
<p>The case is IpLearn-Focus LLC v. Microsoft Corp., 14-cv-00151, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
(San Francisco). </p>

<p>Asian currencies are poised to
extend declines amid concern an increase in borrowing costs in
China and a weakening yen threaten economic growth in the
region, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. </p>
<p>A trend of bearish Asian currencies will kick off,
JPMorgan analysts including Hong Kong-based Bert Gochet wrote in
a report yesterday. Worries over China''s tight liquidity
stance generate downside risks to growth. </p>
<p>China''s money market rates jumped in December to a six-month high, raising concern that tighter lending conditions may
slow the world''s second-largest economy. The yen''s 15 percent
decline over the past year is fueling speculation that a cheaper
currency may help Japanese companies grab export market share
from its competitors in South Korea and Taiwan. </p>
<p>The Philippine peso touched the weakest level since 2010
yesterday on concern the Federal Reserve may accelerate the
withdrawal of stimulus as the U.S. economy improves. The
Malaysian ringgit posted its biggest two-day drop since
November, while the South Korean won fell 1.3 percent from the
five-year high set in December. </p>
<p>The Fed started reducing its monthly bond purchases in
January by $10 billion to $75 billion, reducing capital flows to
emerging markets. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index of stocks has
slid as much as 16 percent since May 22, when the Fed signaled
its stimulus program could be trimmed. </p>
<h2>Cash Squeeze </h2>
<p>China''s seven-day repurchase rate surged to 4.98 percent
today in Shanghai, the highest level since Jan. 2, according to
National Interbank Funding Center. New yuan loans slumped to a
one-year low in December and money-supply growth eased, central
bank data showed on Jan. 15. </p>
<p>The cash squeeze will persist this month because
authorities are determined to curb shadow-banking financing and
reduce banks'' reliance on interbank funding amid concerns about
delinquent loans, Haitong International Securities Co., part of
China''s second-largest brokerage, said in a Jan. 15 report. </p>
<p>The yen, which traded at 104.33 per dollar today, may yet
reach 115 this year as the Bank of Japan weighs more stimulus to
offset a sales-tax increase, former board member Nobuyuki
Nakahara said in an interview yesterday. </p>
<p>The World Bank on Jan. 14 raised its forecast for global
growth to 3.2 percent this year, while lowering the estimates
for China and other emerging-market economies. </p>
<h2>Purest Expression'' </h2>
<p>Based on conversations with customers, JPMorgan said local
bond funds haven''t received any inflows so far this year. It
would be the first time that has happened in January since 2008,
JPMorgan said, citing data from research company EPFR Global. </p>
<p>The analysts recommend selling the ringgit as the purest
expression of positioning for a lack of EM local bond inflows.
Foreign investors held 45 percent of ringgit-denominated debt in
November, the most among 10 developing countries, making
Malaysia susceptible to capital outflows, according to Credit
Suisse Group AG. </p>
<p>JPMorgan advises further underweight the Philippine
peso, saying local interest rates are too low. Investors should
also exit a bet that the South Korean won will rise as the yen
weakens. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the world''s
largest brokerage, promoted 153 employees to the title of
managing director, an increase from 144 a year earlier. </p>
<p>About 64 percent of those promoted work in the U.S., up
from 50 percent last year, while 22 percent are based in Europe,
the Middle East and Africa, and 14 percent in Asia, according to
Wesley McDade, a spokesman for the New York-based bank. Almost
half of the new class works in the investment banking and
trading division, McDade said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley has cut more than 5,400 jobs since the end
of 2011 as part of Chief Executive Officer James Gorman''s plan
to pare $1.6 billion in expenses. Last year, the bank bought the
rest of a brokerage joint venture with Citigroup Inc. and
reduced capital to its fixed-income trading business in an
effort to double return on equity. </p>
<p>Forty-one of the new managing directors, or 27 percent of
the class, are women. That''s the highest proportion ever, McDade
said. The total number of managing directors is down from the
classes of 2011, when 210 employees were given the title, and
2010, when 232 people were promoted. </p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reported on the latest promotions
yesterday. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is leading a
rebound in bank lending to mining and energy companies, which
are taking out the most loans since 2011 to refinance debt as
commodity prices slump and acquisitions slow. </p>
<p>Raw-material industries boosted borrowing by 17 percent
last year to $684.7 billion, after a 22 percent drop in 2012,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. The top lenders were U.S. banks
JPMorgan at $57.1 billion, Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) at $47.1 billion
and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) at $37.8 billion. The figures reflect
transactions involving more than one bank and include credit
lines, project or term loans and trade finance. </p>
<p>While increased scrutiny from regulators is prompting
JPMorgan and other banks to exit physical commodity businesses
such as warehouses and power plants, lending rose as companies
including Rio Tinto (RIO) Group and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) Plc refinanced
to take advantage of low borrowing costs. Tumbling metal prices
also eroded revenue at mines and smelters last year during the
first commodity slump since the recession of 2008, while the
value of mergers and acquisitions slid 31 percent, data show. </p>
<p>It was generally not a good year for commodities in 2013,
and that required companies to raise external financing, said
Larry Landry, vice chairman of investment banking for JPMorgan
in New York. There will be less opportunistic-driven
refinancing in 2014, but hopefully that will be offset by a
meaningful pickup in mergers and acquisitions. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is planning
to increase fixed pay for some senior staff and traders in
Europe as regulators prepare to limit bonuses in the region,
according to a person with knowledge of the plan. </p>
<p>The bank plans to make so-called role-based payments to
some senior bankers and traders in addition to their annual
salaries and bonuses, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because the plans haven''t been made public. </p>
<p>Banks are seeking ways to sidestep tougher European Union
bonus rules, which will apply for the first time to awards given
in 2015, based on this year''s performance. Regulators are
preparing to outlaw bonuses that are more than twice fixed pay
in what lawmakers called irresponsible risk-taking that helped

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) plans to invest $1.2 billion to expand its cloud services,
bolstering a business it''s counting on for growth after spending
$2 billion last year to acquire SoftLayer Technologies Inc. </p>
<p>The company, the world''s largest provider of technology
services, plans to add 15 new data centers worldwide by the end
of 2014, said Lance Crosby, chief executive officer of
SoftLayer. IBM is winding down its separate SmartCloud
Enterprise product as early as the first quarter of this year,
except for a premium service that will be offered along with
SoftLayer''s, he said in an interview. </p>
<p>IBM is trying to keep up as customers shift from buying
their own computer servers to relying on the cloud, where data
and applications are delivered online instead of being stored
locally. A slump in demand for hardware has contributed to six
straight reported quarters of declining revenue, forcing the
Armonk, New York-based company to adapt. </p>
<p>That''s the transformation that IBM is in right now,
Crosby said. That''s why we are spending the money. </p>
<p>The new investment shows that IBM views SoftLayer as one of
its biggest bets. The price the technology giant paid to acquire
the Dallas-based company last year was the biggest it has
disclosed for a takeover since the purchase of software company
Lotus Development Corp. in 1995, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Data Centers </h2>
<p>SoftLayer has added about 2,400 customers since the
takeover, up from about 20,000 at the time of the acquisition,
Crosby said. </p>
<p>IBM didn''t specify how soon it will invest the $1.2 billion
nor how it was budgeting for the expense. The company averages
about $4 billion a year in capital expenditures. </p>
<p>SoftLayer is becoming the backbone for IBM''s cloud
business, with related services being integrated with the
platform, Crosby said. The 15 new data centers will bring the
company''s total to 40 locations in 13 countries, IBM said today
in a statement. </p>
<p>This is fundamental because this allows us global
coverage, Erich Clementi, senior vice president of global
technology services, said in an interview. We are continuing
to invest in where we think the growth areas are going to be
over the next years. </p>
<h2>Government Contracts </h2>
<p>Two of the centers will serve the Washington area to better
support possible government contracts, Crosby said. While IBM
won a cloud-computing contract of as much as $1 billion with the
U.S. Department of the Interior last August, the industry is
filled with new rivals eager to convert IBM''s hardware customers
into cloud users. In October, IBM abandoned a court fight over
the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency''s decision to award
Amazon.com Inc a $600 million cloud-computing contract. </p>
<p>IBM clients using SmartCloud Enterprise, its previous
service, have already been switched to the newer product. Crosby
said some of the employees who worked on SmartCloud Enterprise
have moved to SoftLayer, while others have found positions
elsewhere at IBM. </p>
<p>The company declined to comment on whether any jobs were
lost due to the closing of SmartCloud. </p>
<p>IBM reported more than $1 billion in sales from cloud
services last quarter, the first time it has disclosed revenue
from that segment. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
is looking into how IBM reports its revenue from the cloud
business, the company said in July. </p>
<h2>Watson Division </h2>
<p>The plans for investment in SoftLayer''s cloud platform
follows IBM''s move last week to create a new business division
around its Watson technology, which can analyze large volumes of
data and answer questions in conversational language. IBM will
invest more than $1 billion in the unit and give it its own
headquarters in New York. Watson''s big-data services, which let
customers mine vast troves of information, will be run on
SoftLayer''s cloud, the company said. </p>
<p>IBM shares climbed less than 1 percent to $190.09, the
highest since September, at the close in New York. Technology
companies in the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index were little
changed. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) rose the most in
almost six months after reporting profit that beat analysts''
estimates on higher equity-trading revenue and record wealth-management earnings. </p>
<p>Shares of the company jumped 4 percent to $33.29 in New
York trading at 12:02 p.m., the biggest intraday gain since July
18 and the highest price since Nov. 18, 2009. Fourth-quarter
profit at the New York-based bank was 50 cents a share excluding
an accounting charge tied to the firm''s own debt, a tax benefit
and legal costs, beating the 44-cent average estimate of 26
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s stock climbed 64 percent in 2013, the most
among the 10 largest global investment banks, as Chief Executive
Officer James Gorman cut costs and improved margins at the
brokerage unit. A 30 percent jump in the Standard  Poor''s 500
Index helped boost equity trading and wealth-management revenue,
while higher legal costs kept return on equity unchanged from
2012 at 5.1 percent. </p>
<p>The market likes what James is doing and his strategy
of relying more on the brokerage for profits, Brad Hintz, an
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co., said in a Bloomberg
Television interview. Now he is moving on to the next
challenge, which is fixed income and the ROE. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX) is seeking to sell
pipeline and storage operations in Texas and Louisiana that
together may fetch more than $1 billion, people familiar with
the matter said. </p>
<p>Chevron is working with Jefferies Group LLC to find buyers
for at least four natural gas and crude oil pipeline operations,
said two of the people, who asked not to be named because the
process is private. The San Ramon, California-based company
began sending out offering materials this week, the people said. </p>
<p>Diversified energy companies have been seeking to sell or
spin off transportation and storage operations to cut costs and
focus on exploration. Chevron sold a pipeline business in the
Northwestern U.S. last year to Tesoro Logistics LP, while Royal
Dutch Shell Plc and Chesapeake Energy Corp. made similar
divestitures. </p>
<p>Chevron is looking to sell the West Texas LPG Pipeline LP,
a natural gas pipeline 20 percent owned by Atlas Pipeline
Partners LP, one of the people said. It''s also seeking buyers
for a gas storage facility in West Texas, a crude oil terminal
close to the Gulf of Mexico, and at least one of its pipelines
in Louisiana, this person said. </p>
<p>Chevron Spokesman Kent Robertson declined to comment on the
sale as did Jefferies spokesman Richard Khaleel. The company
plans to sell some oil and gas assets to focus on exploration
prospects in Iraq, Canada, and Australia, Chevron''s Chief

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the world''s largest brokerage, reported profit that beat analysts'' estimates as equity-trading revenue increased and earnings from wealth management climbed to a record. </p> <p>Fourth-quarter net income fell to $181 million, or 7 cents a share, from $594 million, or 29 cents, a year earlier, the New York-based company said today in a statement. Profit was 50 cents a share excluding an accounting charge tied to the firm''s own debt, a tax benefit and legal expenses, beating the 44-cent average estimate of 26 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley''s stock climbed 64 percent in 2013, the most among the 10 largest global investment banks, as Chief Executive Officer James Gorman cut costs and improved margins at the brokerage unit. A 30 percent jump in the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index helped boost equity trading and wealth-management revenue. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley is a little more levered toward the equity-centric businesses than competitors, Devin Ryan, a bank analyst at JMP Group Inc. in New York, said before the results were announced. There''s positive momentum in those businesses going into 2014. </p> <p>The company''s $1.2 billion addition to legal reserves in the fourth quarter pertained to mortgage-related matters, specifically litigation and investigations related to residential mortgage-backed securities and the credit crisis, according to the statement. </p> <h2>Legal Issues </h2> <p>We are continuing to address many of the legal issues from the financial crisis, Gorman, 55, said in the statement. We look forward to further progress on our strategic goals as we move into 2014 with strength and momentum. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley rose 3 percent to $32.96 in New York trading at 9:51 a.m. The shares have more than doubled since June 2012, and through yesterday were 8.1 percent above the price when Gorman took over at the end of 2009. </p> <p>Revenue excluding accounting adjustments rose to $8.2 billion from $7.47 billion a year earlier. Book value per share climbed to $32.29 from $32.13 at the end of September. </p> <p>The company surpassed revenue expectations with better-than-expected strength in investment banking, global wealth management, and asset management, Keith Horowitz, a Citigroup Inc. analyst, wrote in a note to investors. </p> <h2>Profit Goal </h2> <p>The firm''s return on equity excluding the accounting charge was 5.1 percent for the year, unchanged from 2012. While Morgan Stanley achieved its goals on cost cutting and reducing capital used by the trading business, the firm hasn''t reached its target of doubling ROE, a gauge of profitability. </p> <p>Gorman said in May that the bank can post a 10 percent ROE by this year if regulators allow it to return a reasonable amount of capital to shareholders. The company announced a $500 million stock buyback in July. It repurchased $228 million in the fourth quarter, bringing the yearly total to $350 million. </p> <p>The accounting charge is known as a debt-valuation adjustment, or DVA. It stems from increases in the value of the company''s debt, on the theory it would be more expensive to buy it back. The firm had a $368 million charge from DVA, versus a $511 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2012. </p> <p>Pretax profit from global wealth management, overseen by Greg Fleming, 50, jumped 26 percent to $709 million as revenue climbed to a record $3.73 billion. The division''s pretax profit margin rose to 19 percent from 17 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012. </p> <h2>Margin Target </h2> <p>Morgan Stanley today set a margin target of 22 percent to 25 percent for the fourth quarter of 2015, assuming no change in interest rates or market levels. That was higher than the previous target of 20 percent to 22 percent Gorman laid out in June. </p> <p>The brokerage also provides the firm with a growing deposit base that it''s seeking to use for lending in products such as mortgages and corporate lending. Morgan Stanley is targeting a 70 percent loan-to-deposit ratio next year, up from 55 percent in 2012, and Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said growth in the bank unit will be the biggest driver of ROE improvement. </p> <p>The increase in asset prices globally in 2013 has helped boost performance at the brokerage, which generates more than a third of revenue from fee-based accounts that often earn a percentage of assets. Rising stock indexes have also benefited Morgan Stanley, which is the only Wall Street firm to generate more revenue from equity trading than fixed-income trading. </p> <h2>Equities Trading </h2> <p>In equities trading, headed by Ted Pick, Morgan Stanley''s revenue rose 7 percent from a year earlier to $1.5 billion, excluding DVA. That compared with $904 million at Bank of America Corp. and $1.73 billion at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. UBS AG''s Brennan Hawken had estimated equities revenue of about $1.58 billion, while Wells Fargo  Co.''s Matt Burnell predicted $1.43 billion. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley topped all global investment banks in equity-trading revenue in the third quarter. The firm is now seeing an acute battle for equity traders, Colm Kelleher, head of the investment bank and trading division, said last month. </p> <p>Fourth-quarter revenue from fixed-income sales and trading, run by Michael Heaney and Robert Rooney with commodity trading co-heads Colin Bryce and Simon Greenshields, fell 14 percent to $694 million, excluding DVA. That compared with estimates of $919 million from Wells Fargo''s Burnell and $800 million from UBS''s Hawken. </p> <h2>Interest-Rates Trading </h2> <p>Porat said the firm suffered from weak interest-rates trading revenue. Fixed-income revenue was $1.89 billion at Goldman Sachs and $2.33 billion at Citigroup. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley''s head of interest-rates trading, Glenn Hadden, left earlier this month after two years with the firm. He said he had different views over how the business should be run than Heaney and Rooney, who took over leadership of the fixed-income division last year. Mitch Nadel and Jakob Horder were named to replace Hadden. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley had its lowest share of fixed-income revenue among U.S. peers in at least four years. While the firm''s credit, securitized products and currency units reached their 10 percent return-on-equity goals, low returns in the commodity and interest-rates groups dragged down ROE. Morgan Stanley reiterated its goal of reaching 10 percent ROE firmwide. </p> <p>Given the continued weak performance of FICC, we remain skeptical that Morgan Stanley will achieve even this relatively low financial target, Richard Staite, an analyst at Atlantic Equities LLP in London, said in a note to clients. </p> <h2>Fixed Income </h2> <p>Morgan Stanley exited some units within its fixed-income and commodities division and shrank capital dedicated to that segment. It had $210 billion of risk-weighted assets tied to the division at the end of December. The bank moved up its target for driving that number below $180 billion by one year, to 2015. </p> <p>The Federal Reserve is weighing further restrictions on banks'' trading and warehousing of physical commodities as Congress scrutinizes potential conflicts of interest and manipulation in those markets. The central bank said recent accidents and natural disasters have increased concerns about the businesses. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley agreed last month to sell a unit that stores, trades and transports oil products to a subsidiary of Russia''s OAO Rosneft. Porat said that unit broke even last year on a pretax basis. The firm has also said it''s exploring strategic options for its stake in TransMontaigne Inc., the Denver-based petroleum and chemical transportation and storage company. </p> <h2>Investment Banking </h2> <p>Investment banking, led by Mark Eichorn and Franck Petitgas, generated $1.36 billion in fourth-quarter revenue. That figure, up 11 percent from a year earlier, included $451 million from financial advisory, $416 million from equity underwriting and $495 million from debt underwriting. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley was the second-ranked adviser on global announced mergers and acquisitions in 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was the No. 3 underwriter of global equity, equity-linked and rights offerings, the data show. </p> <p>Asset management reported a pretax gain of $337 million, compared with $221 million in the previous year''s period. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Michael J.

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS)''s planned sale of a
physical oil unit to Russia''s OAO Rosneft will bring the bank in
line with regulators'' efforts to reduce risks posed by such
businesses, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley expects to say it''s also selling its stake
in TransMontaigne Inc., the petroleum and chemical
transportation and storage company, sooner rather than
later, Porat, 56, said today in an interview. The sale to
Rosneft of the oil-merchanting unit, which stores, trades and
transports oil products, will probably be completed in the
second half of this year, New York-based Morgan Stanley said
last month. </p>
<p>The Federal Reserve is weighing more limits on banks''
trading and warehousing of physical commodities as Congress
scrutinizes potential dangers to the financial system, conflicts
of interest and manipulation in those markets. The central bank
this week issued a white paper seeking comment on the risks of
those units and said recent accidents and natural disasters have
increased those concerns. </p>
<p>Our focus on commodities is actually quite consistent
with the tenor of the questions within the white paper, Porat
said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s return on equity will also benefit from
the sale, she said, adding that the oil-merchanting business
broke even last year with $4 billion of risk-weighted assets.
The firm has set a goal of a 10 percent ROE in the fixed-income
and commodities business, and said low returns in commodities
and interest-rates-trading units kept it from achieving that in
2013. </p>
<h2>ROE Drag'' </h2>
<p>The commodities ROE is not near the level it should be,
Porat said. It''s a drag on overall ROE, and we''re very much
focused on that. </p>
<p>The bank moved up its target of holding less than $180
billion of risk-weighted assets in its fixed-income and
commodities unit by one year, to 2015. It had $210 billion in
that division at the end of 2013, down from about $300 billion
18 months earlier. </p>
<p>Risk-weighted assets determine how much capital a bank must
hold against certain activities under Basel III rules. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the world''s
biggest brokerage, set aside a smaller share of revenue to pay
employees at its investment-banking and trading division. </p>
<p>Compensation for staff at the institutional securities unit
fell 2.2 percent to $6.82 billion for 2013, according to figures
posted today on the New York-based firm''s website. Salaries,
bonuses and previous deferred awards equaled 42 percent of
adjusted revenue, down from 45 percent a year earlier. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, 55, joins
counterparts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase 
Co. in cutting the amount of revenue allocated to paying bankers
and traders. Morgan Stanley Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat
said in April that the firm is seeking to set aside about 40
percent of revenue for pay in institutional securities. </p>
<p>Companywide compensation and benefits rose 4.2 percent to
$16.3 billion in 2013 as adjusted revenue increased 8.5 percent
to $33.1 billion. That revenue figure excludes accounting
charges known as debt-valuation adjustments. Those changes stem
from increases in the value of the firm''s debt, on the theory
that it would be more expensive to buy back the securities. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) said Berlin''s
public transport provider only has itself to blame for signing
an unfortunate derivatives contract that led to $200 million
in losses. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s lawyer, Laurence Rabinowitz, told a London court
on the first day of a trial that the timing of Berliner
Verkehrsbetriebe''s 2007 credit-default swap could hardly have
been worse because it coincided with the start of the global
financial crisis. </p>
<p>Rather than simply accepting that it had been
unfortunate, Rabinowitz said today that BVG cast around for
someone other than itself to blame. JPMorgan sued the
transport organization to recover $204 million plus interest it
says it is owed. </p>
<p>BVG, which has run the German capital''s trains and buses
for more than 80 years, argues it wasn''t sophisticated enough to
understand the transaction and was misled by JPMorgan and the
bank''s law firm, Clifford Chance LLP. The owner of OK! Magazine,
dentists and elderly care homes have sued lenders over the sale
of derivatives they say they didn''t need or fully comprehend. </p>
<p>Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined
to comment. BVG didn''t immediately respond to e-mails seeking
comment. Anna Ward, a spokeswoman for London-based Clifford
Chance, said the law firm should never have been sued. </p>
<p>We believe the claims against us are misconceived and
entirely without merit and we will continue to defend our
position robustly, Ward said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<h2>0.19 Percent </h2>
<p>The chance of any defaults in the underlying portfolio for
the swap were 0.19 percent when it was signed, Rabinowitz said.
One of the companies linked to the transaction was Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., which collapsed in 2008, sparking
turmoil in the markets. </p>
<p>Taking on a small risk, even vanishingly small, isn''t the
same thing as taking on no risk at all, Rabinowitz said. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps are agreements for one party to pay
another if a target goes bankrupt or fails to pay its debts. The
product can be used as a type of insurance, or to speculate on
the credit-worthiness of companies or assets. </p>
<p>JPMorgan staff shut their eyes to the fact that BVG had
misunderstood the complex credit derivative it was signing,
the transport body said in legal documents. Bank employees knew
BVG had no experience in this type of transaction, and gave a
misleading presentation about its risks, according to the
documents. </p>
<h2>Let Down'' </h2>
<p>BVG was badly let down by Clifford Chance, which had a
conflict of interest because it simultaneously advised both
JPMorgan and the BVG, the German company said in the documents.
The law firm should have turned down the work, or ceased to act,
because of the risk of a conflict of interest, BVG said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan fought for three years to have the case heard in
the U.K., with the European Court of Justice ruling in its favor
in 2011. BVG had sought a trial in Germany. </p>
<p>The trial is scheduled to last for 10 weeks. </p>
<p>The case is: JPMorgan Chase Bank  Anr v Berliner
Verkehrsbetriebe, High Court of Justice, Queen''s Bench Division
Commercial Court: 08-1052 </p>

<p>A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) unit won
a bid to halt Singaporean wealth-management client Oei Hong Leong''s lawsuit over trading losses on the Brazilian real in
favor of private arbitration. </p>
<p>The ruling was made in a closed hearing today at
Singapore''s High Court. Oei''s lawyer Siraj Omar said he planned
to appeal the decision. Edward Naylor, a Hong Kong-based
spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to comment on the verdict. </p>
<p>Oei sued Goldman Sachs International in Singapore and the
parent company in New York, alleging the bank misled him into
trading real-yen options. He sought at least $31 million in
damages in each lawsuit. The bank has rejected allegations that
it acted improperly or cheated him, according to a letter it
wrote to Oei in July and filed in court. </p>
<p>Oei said he relied on the bank''s advice that the real was a
stable and liquid currency anchored to the U.S. dollar before
betting in May the yen would fall against the Brazilian
currency. </p>
<p>The real has fallen 12 percent since May 15 against the
yen, the second-worst performer among 16 major currencies
tracked by Bloomberg, after the South African rand. The real has
declined three straight years as widening budget deficits
threaten to trigger Brazil''s first credit-rating downgrade since
2002. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs plans to ask a U.S. judge to dismiss the
lawsuit there in favor of arbitration or move it to Singapore,
according to court papers filed in New York. </p>
<p>I have not brought this claim because I have lost money
in the trades, Oei said in court papers filed in December. I
trusted and relied on Goldman Sachs and they abused and breached
that trust. </p>
<p>The case is Oei Hong Leong v Goldman Sachs International.

<p>When her sister graduated from
Harvard University in 1981, Kathy Matsui''s father gave her a
choice: Get accepted, or get ready for a lifetime of labor
raising roses. </p>
<p>From the farm in Salinas, California, to Harvard and
Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. in Tokyo, the family work ethic has
underpinned a career that lifted Matsui to the top of her
profession. Now, 14 years after publishing her ideas on how to
upend gender roles in the Japanese workforce under a doctrine
known as womenomics, Matsui has the ear of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who made her research into a plank of his growth plan. </p>
<p>Warmness alone doesn''t make flowers bloom, Andy Matsui,
whose daughter later became Goldman Sachs'' first female partner
in his native Japan, said in a telephone interview last month.
You never hear a success story for a spoiled child. </p>
<p>Kathy Matsui arrived 24 years ago at her first brokerage
job in Tokyo at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities speaking
conversational Japanese. The mother of two, now 48 and fluent,
joined Goldman Sachs as chief Japan equity strategist in 1994
and was ranked the No. 1 stock market forecaster for Japan in
2000, 2001 and 2006 by Institutional Investor magazine. </p>
<p>Matsui''s interest in gender issues was piqued by her own
climb. She published the first womenomics report in August 1999,
arguing that equalizing roles in the workforce was a better
solution to Japan''s shrinking labor pool than loosening
immigration laws or raising the birth rate. Back then, the
proportion of working-age women with jobs was 56.7 percent,
according to the Statistics Bureau. In 2012, it was 60.7
percent, a record, though still not high enough, she says. In
the U.S., 69 percent of women between 25 and 54 had jobs in
2011, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. </p>
<h2>Change Needed </h2>
<p>Japan''s aging population and a debt burden twice as big as
its economy mean more must be done fast, according to Matsui. By
2035, one third of all Japanese will be 65 or older, up from 23
percent in 2010, according to the National Institute of
Population and Social Security Research. Japan could expand its
workforce by 8 million and increase its gross domestic product
as much as 14 percent by raising women in employment to about 80
percent, the same level as men, Matsui wrote in an April report. </p>
<p>We have to convince the Japanese people that running a
marathon with one leg is going to take a very long time,
Matsui said in an interview last month. It''s still an alien
concept that women might be working full-time. </p>
<h2>Work Ethic </h2>
<p>Matsui attributes her own work ethic to growing up in
Salinas. She attended Japanese language school on Saturdays,
went to church on Sundays and cut flowers by hand after classes
the rest of the week. Her mother, Mary, toiled in the family
nursery every day and learned English at night while raising
four children. </p>
<p>Despite wearing four layers of gloves, you still ended up
with thorns in your hands, Kathy Matsui said. But we got
used to it, that was our life. In my family, money didn''t just
fall from the sky. </p>
<p>With degrees in social studies from Harvard in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, and international affairs from Baltimore-based
Johns Hopkins University, Matsui visited Japan for the first
time in 1986 on a Rotary scholarship. She moved to Tokyo to be
with Jesper Koll, now her husband, whom she met during an
internship at Mitsui Bank. </p>
<h2>Vital Component'' </h2>
<p>Invoking Matsui by name in a Sept. 25 essay for the Wall
Street Journal, Japan''s Abe said womenomics is a vital
component of his growth strategy. The premier has said he
wants a society where women can shine by eliminating waiting
lists for childcare and training mothers returning to work. He
has encouraged publicly-traded companies in Japan to have at
least one female executive and set a goal of women holding 30
percent of leadership positions in all areas of society by 2020,
when Tokyo hosts the summer Olympics. </p>
<p>Since he elevated this issue and made it a core part of
his growth strategy agenda, people started waking up, Matsui
said. The fact that he is even mentioning it is massive
progress compared to any of his predecessors. </p>
<p>Promoting women''s rights in Japan has long been a losing
battle. The World Economic Forum ranked the Asian nation 105th
out of 136 nations in its 2013 Global Gender Gap Report, which
measures economic, political, education and health differences
between men and women. Iceland was No. 1, followed by Finland
and Norway. The U.S. was 23rd and China 69th. </p>
<h2>Female Managers </h2>
<p>In Japan, female executives make up about 11 percent of
managerial jobs in the private sector, according to 2012 data
from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. Women are paid
about 71 percent as much as men, according to the ministry.
About 62 percent of Japanese women quit their jobs after their
first child is born, according to the IPSS. </p>
<p>Many of Matsui''s friends did. She thought about what would
happen if they kept working and it prompted her to write the
first report on gender in the workplace. </p>
<p>Very few of my Japanese clients reacted to it at the
time, though that wasn''t surprising since 99.9 percent of them
were male, she said. Since I had ''three strikes'' against me
as an inexperienced, foreign, female strategist, I knew the only
way I could succeed was to write differentiated research. </p>
<p>Competitors noticed a report that went past stock picking. </p>
<p>The female labor participation had risen in the 1990s,
but I found it interesting how she shed light on it, said
Chisato Haganuma, chief equity strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ
Morgan Stanley Securities Co., who has been Matsui''s competitor
for about 20 years. It was a very good report and strategy in
that it highlighted a change in our society rather than just
talking about which stocks would rise and fall. </p>
<h2>Stock-Picking </h2>
<p>In a study released on Oct. 1, 2010, Matsui listed 44
public companies in industries from daycare to nursing and food
preparation that she said reflected women''s values. They rose 86
percent through Dec. 27, compared with a 55 percent increase for
the Topix index, according to Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>Her broader forecasts for Japanese equities have usually
been bullish, a stance that paid off last year when the Nikkei
225 Stock Average (NKY) beat every developed-market index. In
November, she raised her 12-month projection for the Topix to
1,450, about 11 percent higher than the gauge''s 2013 close and a
level unseen since 2007. The measure rose 0.2 percent to
1,295.95 yesterday. </p>
<p>Logic, intuition and contacts inform the calls, said Hiromi
Suzuki, a Tokyo-based analyst at Goldman Sachs who has worked
with Matsui since 1994, when they started the firm''s strategy
team for Japanese stocks. She described Matsui, who was named
managing director in 1998 and partner in 2000, as a serious,
energetic and honest person who doesn''t micromanage. </p>
<h2>Long Hours </h2>
<p>She''s tough mentally and physically and sticks to her
schedule, Suzuki said in an interview on Jan. 10. She always
tries her best to fulfill what she intends to do. Even if she
has five minutes to the deadline, she focuses on what she can do
within that time. </p>
<p>A nanny has enabled Matsui to work long hours and travel,
while her husband, Koll, runs Japanese equity research at
JPMorgan Securities Japan Co. The biggest challenge came in
2001, after her second child was born, when she was diagnosed
with breast cancer. </p>
<p>Just when I thought nothing could go wrong, everything
went wrong, she said. You just don''t know what twists and
turns life brings. I was naturally shocked when I received my
diagnosis, but facing my mortality at the age of 36 was actually
a giant wake-up call. </p>
<p>She took eight months off to recuperate in California with
her parents and received chemotherapy. She returned to Goldman
Sachs wearing a wig, deciding that staying at home all the time
would be more stressful. </p>
<h2>Demonstrating Womenomics'' </h2>
<p>I saw how hard she worked when she faced difficulties and
I learned what it''s like to be a strategist, said Naoki Kamiyama, who worked for Matsui from 2000 to 2002 and is now
chief equity strategist at Merrill Lynch Japan Securities Co.
In a way, she''s demonstrating womenomics by herself. It''s
perfectionism. She embodies it. </p>
<p>Matsui''s travel usually keeps her away from her family for
two to three months a year, triggering maternal guilt, she
said. While it may be a sign that you''re really busy, I always
feel guilty about spending so much time away from my husband and
children. </p>
<p>Yoga at 8 a.m. on Saturdays helps her body, and Nutella, a
Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, warms her spirit. When times are
toughest, though, Matsui said she thinks about her mother. </p>
<p>I learned a tremendous amount from my mother and
developed a newfound respect for her the minute I became a
mother myself, she said. Whenever I have those moments when
I''m really stressed out, I just think about what my mom had to
go through and it puts everything in perspective. </p>

<p>General Mills issued $750 million of securities in two

to speculate on creditworthiness, added 0.3 basis point from
Jan. 17 to 65.5 basis points as of 4:15 p.m. in New York,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The market was closed
in the U.S. yesterday for the Martin Luther King Jr. Day
holiday. </p>
<h2>General Mills </h2>
<p>The swaps gauge typically rises as investor confidence
deteriorates and falls as it improves. The contracts pay the
buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations,
less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals
$1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt. </p>
<p>When spreads are narrow, obviously it lowers the cost of
potential debt, so in general, you''ll always see corporates come
to market when spreads are tighter, Valeri said. </p>
<p>General Mills also sold $500 million of 3.65 percent, 10-year notes to yield 85 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. The transaction was rated A3 by
Moody''s Investors Service, the credit grader said in a
statement. A portion of the proceeds will be used to repay
commercial paper. </p>
<h2>JPMorgan Offering </h2>
<p>JPMorgan sold $5.25 billion of securities in five parts,
including $1 billion of 4.85 percent, 30-year bonds to yield
112.5 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
Bloomberg data show. Morgan Stanley issued $2 billion of 2.5
percent, five-year notes and $750 million of floating-rate
securities, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>International investors are the most upbeat about the
global economy than at any time in almost five years, buoyed by
the U.S.-led revival of industrial nations, according to the
Bloomberg Global Poll. On the eve of the World Economic Forum''s
annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, 59 percent of Bloomberg
subscribers surveyed last week said the economic outlook is
improving. That''s up from 33 percent in November and marks the
most optimistic result since the poll began in July 2009. </p>
<p>The risk premium on the Markit CDX North American High
Yield Index, tied to the debt of 100 speculative-grade
companies, added 1 basis point to 318.7 basis points from Jan.
17, Bloomberg prices show. High-yield, high-risk bonds are rated
below Baa3 by Moody''s and less than BBB- at SP. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point. </p>
<p>The extra yield investors demand to hold investment-grade
corporate bonds rather than government debt was little changed
at 107.5, Bloomberg data show. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) issued $2.75 billion
of five-year debt after reporting earnings last week that beat
analysts'' estimates. </p>
<p>The owner of the world''s largest brokerage sold $2 billion
of 2.5 percent securities to yield 95 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries and $750 million of floating-rate
notes paying 85 basis points more than the three-month London
interbank offered rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The securities were expected to be rated Baa2 by Moody''s
Investors Service. </p>
<p>The lender joins JPMorgan Chase  Co. and SunTrust Banks
Inc. in selling floating-rate securities today. JPMorgan issued
$750 million of five-year floaters at a relative yield of 63
basis points as part of its $5.25 billion offering, Bloomberg
data show. </p>
<p>It''s been about nine months since New York-based Morgan
Stanley previously sold floaters in benchmark size, meaning
issues that typically are at least $500 million. The bank sold
$700 million of five-year notes in April to yield 128 basis
points more than Libor, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>The lender''s fourth-quarter net income fell to $181
million, or 7 cents a share, from $594 million, or 29 cents, a
year earlier, it said in a Jan. 17 statement. Profit was 50
cents a share excluding an accounting charge tied to the firm''s
own debt, a tax benefit and legal expenses, beating the 44-cent
average estimate of 26 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) will join Royal
Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce leading
the debt sale to finance a C$8.5 billion Alberta oil refinery
that has the backing of the provincial government. </p>
<p>The banks will work as joint-lead underwriters for bonds to
finance the Sturgeon upgrader and refinery in Redwater, Alberta,
Ian MacGregor, chairman of North West Upgrading Inc., one of the
partners in the joint venture, said through spokeswoman Shauna
MacDonald. </p>
<p>The project is expected to be 80 percent financed by debt
with the rest coming from equity, so long as the project
maintains an investment grade credit rating, North West said in
a Dec. 4 statement. </p>
<p>The company has incurred C$1.5 billion of the project''s
cost and the Alberta government and the other partner in the
venture, Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ), have committed to
further financing through the purchase of C$600 million of
subordinated debt, North West said. </p>
<p>Alberta''s government, which has the top AAA rating from
Moody''s Investors Service, Standard  Poor''s and DBRS,
has agreed to pay down three-quarters of the debt over 30 years
through the processing fees it will pay the refinery to process
the bitumen the government already receives as royalties. </p>
<p>The government is expected to supply 75 percent of the
bitumen to the project. </p>
<p>The project is expected to commence operations in September
2017, the company said. </p>
<p>Toronto-Dominion Bank won top spot among underwriters of
Canadian government debt last year after it managed the sale of
the largest provincial bond ever: C$5 billion of debt to fund a
hydroelectric project in Newfoundland and Labrador, which itself
won a loan guarantee from the federal government. </p>
<p>RBC was the top underwriter of corporate debt in Canada
last year with CIBC coming in third and JPMorgan in 16th place,
according to Bloomberg data. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) quit working on

two people with knowledge of the matter said. </p>
<p>The U.S. bank gave up the mandate as questions arose over
Joyce Wei, a former employee, whose father is Tianhe Chemicals
Chairman Qi Wei, the people said, asking not to be identified
because the information is private. UBS AG (UBSN), which is also
advising on the IPO, hired Wei toward the end of last year, two
people with knowledge of the matter said. </p>
<p>U.S. authorities are examining whether New York-based
JPMorgan hired people in Asia so that their relatives in
government would steer business to the firm, people with
knowledge with the investigations have said. Gaby Abdelnour,
former head of the bank''s Asia-Pacific business, was questioned
by U.S. investigators about his knowledge of the hiring
practices, a person briefed on the matter said last week.
Abdelnour and the bank haven''t been accused of wrongdoing. </p>
<p>Investment banks are super cautious at the moment,
Philippe Espinasse, a former head of equity capital markets for
Asia at Nomura Holdings Inc. and author of IPO: a Global
Guide, said by phone from Hong Kong today. They might have
quite a bit to lose by staying on the deal if there were a
direct link between the company''s senior management and someone
they employ. </p>

<p>When SurveyMonkey Inc. Chief Executive Officer Dave Goldberg wanted to buy out investors from his Internet company and attract new ones who wouldn''t balk at his aim to stay private, he steered clear of traditional startup financiers in the venture-capital community. </p> <p>Instead, Goldberg turned to an entirely different adviser: JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) </p> <p>Jimmy Lee, vice chairman of the investment bank who normally works on multibillion dollar deals, traveled from New York to SurveyMonkey''s headquarters in Palo Alto, California, to brainstorm Goldberg''s options. Goldberg later hired JPMorgan to lead a $350 million syndicated loan for the online survey provider as part of an $800 million recapitalization the closely held company completed last year. </p> <p>Considering what a small company we are, SurveyMonkey isn''t something Jimmy would usually spend time on, Goldberg, who is married to Facebook Inc. (FB) Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, said in an interview. The recapitalization, which also involved selling $444 million in equity to Goldberg, Tiger Global Management LLC and Google Inc.

While firms led by Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) have long cultivated relationships with venture capitalists and entrepreneurs to later earn fees managing initial public offerings and advising on acquisitions, many banks have expanded the roster of services in recent years. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s co-head
of investment banking in Brazil, Fabio Bicudo, will leave the
company 10 months after taking the job. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs confirmed his departure yesterday in an e-mailed statement. The firm declined to say whether it will
replace Bicudo, who has led Brazil investment banking since
March with co-head Antonio Pereira. </p>
<p>Bicudo said in a separate statement he had been invited to
lead a Brazilian company he declined to name. Reuters reported
that Bicudo will become chief executive officer of Eneva SA, the
utility controlled by EON SE and former billionaire Eike
Batista, citing a person familiar with the matter. Eneva
declined to comment. </p>
<p>At least nine managing directors in Brazil left Goldman
Sachs during 2013 after the bank halted its growth plans when
the economy expanded less than analysts estimated. Goldman
Sachs''s revenue from investment banking had been falling in
Brazil while trading and wealth-management fees increased,
people familiar with the matter said last year. </p>
<p>About a quarter of Goldman Sachs''s roughly 45-person Brazil
investment-banking division have departed, four people with
knowledge of the moves said in November. </p>
<p>Our headcount in Brazil is going to be steady at around
300 people, though it may go up 5 percent or down 5 percent,
Stephen Scherr, Goldman Sachs''s chief for Latin America and
global head of the investment bank''s financing group, said in an
interview in New York in October. The composition of the
people is going to change -- and that is by design, Scherr
said, declining to comment on specific departures. </p>
<p>Bicudo and Pereira were named co-heads of investment
banking for the country after Daniel Wainstein, one of only two
Goldman Sachs partners who are Brazilian, left the company in
June after 13 years. Wainstein joined New York-based Greenhill 
Co. in October. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) said it will drop its
remaining claims in a lawsuit against Joseph Chip Skowron
after a federal judge ordered the former fund manager and
convicted inside trader to repay $31 million in compensation. </p>
<p>Kevin Marino, a lawyer for Morgan Stanley, said today in a
letter to U.S. District Court Judge Shira Scheindlin in
Manhattan that it has decided to drop the remaining claims for
breach of contract and fraud. </p>
<p>Skowron has already reimbursed Morgan Stanley $6.4 million
for compensation he received while working as a fund manager at
the New York-based bank''s FrontPoint Partners LLC., Marino said
in his letter to the court. He asked the judge for a final order
directing Skowron to reimburse the bank for the remaining
$24.6 million. </p>
<p>The judgment that we secured last month was clearly in
excess of Mr. Skowron''s assets, so to continue to pursue
additional claims was pointless, Marino said in a phone
interview. We secured a judgment so now we''ll proceed to
collecting on it. </p>
<p>Skowron, 44, managed FrontPoint until he was charged by the
U.S. in 2011 with using inside information to avoid $30 million
in losses. He is one of 83 people who have been accused of
insider trading by prosecutors in the office of Manhattan U.S.
Attorney Preet Bharara in probes during the past six years of
hedge fund managers, company insiders and expert networking
firms. So far, 78 of the people charged by the U.S. have been
convicted while none have been acquitted at trial. </p>
<p>Joshua Epstein, a lawyer for Skowron, declined to comment
on Morgan Stanley''s decision to drop the claims. </p>
<h2>Guilty Plea </h2>
<p>The bank sued Skowron after he pleaded guilty to conspiring
to commit securities fraud and obstruct justice. </p>
<p>Scheindlin last month granted Morgan Stanley''s request for
summary judgment, or a ruling before trial, on a faithless
servant claim alleging that Skowron failed to fulfill his
duties to the bank. </p>
<p>In August 2011, Skowron admitted using secret tips he got
from a French physician to help FrontPoint avoid more than $30
million in trading losses on Human Genome Sciences Inc., a
Rockville, Maryland, pharmaceutical firm that was acquired by
GlaxoSmithKline Plc. (GSK) </p>
<p>Skowron, a Yale University and Harvard University-trained
doctor who quit medicine for Wall Street, is serving a five-year
term at McKean Federal Correction Institution in northwestern
Pennsylvania, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons
website. </p>
<p>The case is Morgan Stanley v. Skowron, 12-cv-08016, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>IBM''s revenue declined for a seventh straight quarter amid
plunging demand for its x86 servers. The slump weighed on the
hardware unit, where profit slid $750 million in the fourth

due to market shifts, Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter

<p>Lenovo, the world''s largest maker of personal computers,

New York-based IBM had broken up in May over the price of the
asset, then valued at $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion, and the
unit''s performance has continued to decline since. </p>
<p>This will increase Lenovo''s negotiation power over the

<p>Morgan Stanley is approaching hedge
funds and buyers of distressed debt to gauge interest in a
possible Puerto Rico bond sale to boost the island''s cash flow,
according to three people with knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>The New York-based bank has been talking with investors in
the past week to assess demand for a potential borrowing of as
much as $2 billion, said the people, who requested anonymity
because the conversations are private. </p>
<p>The U.S. territory, rated one step above junk, needs to
borrow through the financial markets or face a possible cut to
speculative grade. The island and its agencies have issued $70
billion of debt. Because the bonds are tax-exempt in all states,
about 70 percent of municipal-debt mutual funds own the
securities, according to Morningstar Inc. </p>
<p>Lauren Bellmare, a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley (MS), declined
to comment. The Government Development Bank, which handles
Puerto Rico''s debt transactions, declined to comment, said Alix
Anfang, a spokeswoman in New York. </p>
<p>Discussions about a potential deal were said to have
revived this past week after talks in November and December
sputtered when Puerto Rico officials didn''t show interest. </p>
<p>The taxable general-obligation deal said to be under
discussion would have maturities of at least five to seven
years. The funds would assist the commonwealth as it struggles
to turn around its shrinking economy. </p>
<h2>10 Percent </h2>
<p>The discussions have cited possible yields of about 10
percent, the people said. </p>
<p>The New York Times reported the discussions between Morgan
Stanley and the funds earlier. </p>
<p>Puerto Rico bonds are luring hedge funds and buyers of
speculative-grade corporate and sovereign debt after the
island''s securities posted their biggest annual decline since
1999. Commonwealth debt lost 20 percent in 2013, compared with a
2.6 percent loss for the entire municipal market, Standard 
Poor''s data show. </p>
<p>The island''s strained finances have also drawn Wall Street
banks and law firms trying to boost trading and advisory fees.
The firms are typically acting on their own, without the
involvement of Puerto Rico officials. </p>
<p>Jones Day, the law firm shepherding Detroit through
bankruptcy, held a seminar last week on the commonwealth''s debt. </p>
<h2>Payment Promise </h2>
<p>Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla, who took office a year
ago, has said the island of 3.6 million people will repay its
obligations on time and in full. The territory''s officials have
also said they have sufficient funds to last them through June
30 without selling bonds. </p>
<p>Puerto Rico debt has rallied this month as investors added
the most money since September to high-yield muni mutual funds,
Lipper US Fund Flows data show. </p>
<p>General obligations maturing in July 2041 traded today at
an average yield of 8.82 percent, down from 9.2 percent at year-end, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Puerto Rico officials plan to sell long-term debt this
month or in February after they said rising interest rates last
quarter prevented issuance of as much as $1.2 billion of sales-tax debt. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is paying a
lower relative cost to borrow than before the financial crisis
even after ceding more than a year''s profit to settle disputes
linked to faulty mortgages and Bernard Madoff''s Ponzi scheme. </p>
<p>The biggest U.S. bank borrowed $5.25 billion yesterday in
an offering that included 10-year securities yielding 1.125
percentage points more than Treasuries, the narrowest spread
among similar JPMorgan notes since 2005. The measure, used to
gauge creditworthiness, has contracted from 1.33 points a year
ago and is the tightest among similar-maturity bonds of Wall
Street competitors including Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley. </p>
<p>They still command some of the best rates among the big
universal banks, by all means, Chris Baker, a credit analyst
at Morningstar Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>That''s after spending more than $23 billion on legal
settlements in 2013, which helped end a three-year streak of
record annual earnings even as it led the world in corporate-bond underwriting for the sixth straight year. While litigation
expenses may remain elevated in 2014, JPMorgan''s earnings power
means any legal issues should be manageable, according to
Standard  Poor''s. </p>

<p>General Dynamics Corp. (GD), the U.S.
government''s No. 3 contractor, reported a fourth-quarter profit
compared with a loss in the same period last year, boosted by
its aerospace unit''s performance. </p>
<p>Net income was $495 million, or $1.40 a share, compared
with a $2.13 billion loss a year earlier when General Dynamics
posted a $2 billion goodwill writedown, according to a statement
today by the Falls Church, Virginia-based company. After one-time items, per-share profit was $1.76, beating the $1.75
average estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Sales rose less than 1 percent to $8.11 billion in the
quarter from the year-earlier period. </p>
<p>General Dynamics, the maker of Abrams tanks and Gulfstream
business jets, is the first among the top five Pentagon vendors
to report fourth-quarter earnings this month. The biggest,
Lockheed Martin Corp., announces its results tomorrow. </p>
<p>While the company didn''t provide estimates for full year
2014 profit and sales, investors in defense companies will be
reacting to guidance and management tone, Credit Suisse
analysts in New York said in a note to clients last week. </p>
<p>Automatic federal-government spending cuts, known as
sequestration, were eased by an agreement in Congress last
month, which may provide some relief to contractors. </p>
<p>The Credit Suisse analysts, including Robert Spingarn,
predicted minimal effects from October''s partial government
shutdown because any lost revenue was likely recovered before
quarter-end. </p>
<p>General Dynamics fell less than 1 percent to $95.30
yesterday in New York trading. It gained 35 percent in the 12
months through yesterday, outpacing the Standard  Poor''s 500
Index (SPX)''s gain of 24 percent. </p>
<p>The loss in last year''s fourth quarter was primarily
attributed to General Dynamics cutting the goodwill value of its
Information Systems and Technology unit by $2 billion because of
the segment''s declining revenue. </p>

discussed why they shouldn''t reveal to their client, Berlin''s
transport authority, what the bank stood to gain from a complex
derivative deal that''s now at the center of a U.K. court case. </p>
<p>Phone transcripts cited by Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe in a
London trial show JPMorgan staff referring to Matthias Meier, an
employee in the German company''s finance department, before the
2007 transaction. </p>
<p>We don''t want to show to Meier that we are making so much
money on it right? Johannes Banner, a JPMorgan salesman, asked
a colleague in 2006, according to BVG''s court documents. Another
banker called Meier a pain in the a--e and said they should
sting him. </p>
<p>JPMorgan sued the firm, which operates Berlin''s trains and
buses, in 2008 for about $200 million it says it''s owed from the
credit-default swap transaction. The lender argues BVG was only
a victim of bad luck and the deal turned costly because of
unprecedented events in financial markets during 2008. The case
went to trial in London this week. </p>
<p>Tim Lord, a lawyer for BVG, told the court yesterday the
transport authority had never properly understood the so-called
synthetic, single-tranche collateralized debt obligation and
was misled by JPMorgan and its lawyers at Clifford Chance LLP. </p>

<p>The nickel market remains oversupplied and prices will hover near current levels, according to a report by Morgan Stanley (MS) today that contrasts with forecasts from Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for a rally. </p> <p>Prices for the metal used in stainless steel production will stay close to current spot levels in 2014 unless there is both a sustained pick-up in global steel demand and more supply-side production discipline, Morgan Stanley analysts Peter Richardson and Joel Crane wrote in a report today. This compares with Goldman raising its 12-month price target to $16,000 per metric ton from $15,000 yesterday. </p> <p>Insufficient global output cuts will contain prices amid expected production ramp-ups at mines this year and as miners seek lower costs by producing more material, according to the Morgan Stanley report. Goldman analysts saw a potential shortage by the end of 2014 following the Indonesian ban. Nickel has climbed 6.3 percent this year, the most among the six main metals traded on the London Metal Exchange. </p> <p>Despite the implementation of the ban on exports from Indonesia, nickel remains our least favorite base metal exposure, the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote.

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Westpac
Banking Corp. pushed back their forecasts for when Australia''s
central bank will lower interest rates, with the strongest
inflation in two years offsetting rising joblessness. </p>
<p>They join Bank of America Corp. and Royal Bank of Canada,
which shifted their predictions in the past three months. The
estimates for delayed easing come as reports paint a mixed
picture of the economy''s transition to new growth sources amid
the ebbing of a mining boom. Having priced in a 26 percent
chance of a first-quarter rate cut after the weak jobs report on
Jan. 16, swaps traders slashed the odds to 11 percent after Jan.
22 data showed inflation was accelerating. </p>
<p>There are some fundamental problems in the economy,
said Stephen Walters, JPMorgan''s chief economist in Australia,
citing below-trend growth and rising unemployment in a phone
interview yesterday. Yet, an inflation number like that makes
it difficult for the Reserve Bank to do anything about those
issues in the near term. </p>
<p>A report this week showed the trimmed mean gauge of core
prices unexpectedly rose 2.6 percent in the last three months of
2013 from a year earlier, climbing above the mid-point of the
central bank''s target range and the strongest reading since
2011. That followed data showing the worst annual drop in full-time jobs in more than two decades. Australia''s Treasury
predicts the unemployment rate will increase to 6 percent by
July 1, the highest since 2003, from 5.8 percent in December. </p>
<p>The pickup in the pace of consumer-price gains is almost
exclusively due to a decline in the Australian dollar last
year, Bill Evans, chief economist at Westpac, wrote in an e-mailed report yesterday. The acceleration will prove short-lived
and policy rates will be cut once the data confirms this
outlook, he wrote. </p>
<h2>Secondary Impact'' </h2>
<p>Weakness in domestic demand will contain the secondary
impact on inflation from the weaker currency, Evans wrote.
The Reserve Bank is likely to require convincing evidence of
our assessment of inflation risks before it opts for lower
interest rates. </p>
<p>Australia''s cash rate stands at a record-low 2.5 percent.
Westpac now sees it at 2 percent by the end of 2014, after two
0.25 percentage point reductions in the second half. That
compares with a previous call for cuts in the second and third
quarters. </p>
<p>Bank of America said in a Jan. 10 note that the RBA will
trim its benchmark to 2.25 percent by mid-year, from an earlier
prediction for February. RBC pushed its call for a quarter-point
cut to the three months through June, from December 2013
previously, according to an Oct. 14 report. </p>
<p>The median forecast of 29 economists is for the cash rate
to remain unchanged through 2014, according to a Bloomberg News
survey. </p>
<h2>Lower Aussie </h2>
<p>The Australian dollar fell 0.2 percent this week to 87.68
U.S. cents as of 9 a.m. in Sydney and yesterday touched 87.32,
the lowest level since July 2010. </p>
<p>Further declines may be limited by prospects inflation
pressures will keep the central bank from lowering its key rate
further after slashing it 2.25 percentage points over two years. </p>
<p>The RBA has indicated it would prefer a lower exchange rate
to stimulate the economy. Governor Glenn Stevens said last month
in an Australian Financial Review interview that a level of 85
U.S. cents would be closer to the mark. The Aussie won''t
fall to that level until the final quarter of this year,
according to the median of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Policy makers will probably keep trying to verbally drive
the local currency lower, according to JPMorgan''s Walters. </p>
<p>Even so, it''s very difficult, seemingly, for the Aussie
to break meaningfully to the downside, said Walters, who sees
the currency at 87 by Dec. 31. The onus is going to be on the
cash rate to do the work. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs International Chairman
Peter Sutherland said curbs on migration are ridiculous as

<p>It is ridiculous to stop migration when the demographic
profile of so many countries demands it, including the U.K.,
he said after a panel discussion today at the World Economic

<p>Access to sufficient skilled workers is getting worse

<p>Immigration has become a growing issue in British politics

migration from outside the EU cut to below 100,000, and a leaked

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is the right investor for Dong Energy A/S, a top official of Denmark''s ruling Social Democrats said, defending the Wall Street firm against criticism from other parliament members. </p> <p>Goldman''s European merchant banking unit is seeking to buy an 18 percent stake in state-controlled Dong, a utility in need of new equity after losing money on failed natural gas bets. Some Danish lawmakers want to block the 8 billion-krone ($1.5 billion) purchase, saying Goldman Sachs bears responsibility for the global financial crisis and that the government is giving the New York-based company too much control. </p> <p>If we were to not deal with banks until we had bashed all those who deserved to get bashed, we would never get anywhere, and we have to move on, Benny Engelbrecht, the Social Democrats'' business spokesman, said in an interview in Copenhagen. Applying that kind of logic would leave us without any banks to work with. </p> <p>According to the government''s Dec. 3 proposal, Goldman Sachs will be able to veto a possible sale of new shares or hybrid capital, any change in Dong''s senior management or acquisitions before a possible 2018 initial public offering. The state will retain a 57.3 percent stake in Skaerbaek-based Dong, which also operates offshore wind parks and explores for oil and gas. </p> <h2>Fascinated'' </h2> <p>Other minority owners are ATP and PFA, the country''s two largest pension funds, as well as five local energy companies. Neither will get the same veto powers. </p> <p>The Red-Green Alliance, which has 12 of 179 seats in parliament, says the state, not Goldman Sachs, should inject the money that Dong needs. The alliance, which includes former members of Denmark''s communist party, has filed more than 100 questions to the finance ministry regarding the sales process and the privileges given to Goldman Sachs. </p> <p>We would have liked if the government had considered who Goldman are and what they want, Stine Brix, the deputy financial speaker for the party, said in an interview. Goldman has a very doubled-faced story. On one hand, everybody is fascinated with how good they are, but they also act without guilt or remorse. </p> <h2>Abusive'' </h2> <p>Goldman Sachs in July 2010 agreed to pay $550 million and change its business practices to settle the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission''s claims that the firm misled investors in a 2007 product linked to subprime mortgages. The firm didn''t admit or deny wrongdoing. </p> <p>A U.S. Senate subcommittee''s report in 2011 said Goldman Sachs relied on abusive sales practices and was rife with conflicts of interest that encouraged putting profits ahead of clients. While Goldman Sachs said it disagreed with many of the Senate report''s finding, the firm also noted that it undertook a review of its business practices and released a 63-page report on its findings. </p> <p>This is a long-term investment and we support the management team''s current strategy across the company''s activities, including the significant renewable energy investments, Sophie Ramsay, a London-based spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, said in an e-mailed reply to questions. This strategy, supported by the Danish State and other minority shareholders, will create value for all shareholders in the years to come. </p> <h2>Morally Wrong </h2> <p>Selling to Goldman Sachs is morally wrong, jeopardizes Denmark''s green agenda and will prove to be a financial mistake, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, a former Danish prime minister, was quoted as saying in an interview published by newspaper Politiken today. Nyrup Rasmussen, a Social Democrat, has also served as leader of the Europe-wide socialist group in the European Union. </p> <p>Bjarne Corydon, Denmark''s current finance minister and also a Social Democrat, defended the sale in an interview broadcast by TV2 News. </p> <p>I can understand that there''s a debate about banks'' behavior in the wake of the financial crisis, Corydon said in response to Nyrup Rasmussen''s comment. Dong was in a situation where money was needed. We have chosen a proactive answer, the green answer, by going with the investment strategy. </p> <h2>Opposition Growing </h2> <p>The Danish People''s Party, which has 22 seats in Denmark''s assembly, initially backed the government''s plan to find private investors for Dong. Now the party has threatened to withdraw its support. </p> <p>We don''t understand why Goldman should be able to hire and fire the management or why they need to be able to veto the strategy when it''s already in place, said Rene Christensen, financial spokesman for party. The government says there''s no need to worry about the clauses, but that only made us more curious as to why they had to make them in the first place. </p> <p>Even as opposition to the Goldman Sachs deal is growing, the government will probably be able to pass the proposal with the support of the Conservative Party and the Liberals Party, Engelbrecht of the Social Democrats said. The Liberals are Denmark''s biggest opposition party. </p> <p>Engelbrecht last year led lawmakers'' push for rules that require Denmark''s biggest lenders, including Danske Bank A/S to hold additional capital reserves to prevent a future banking crisis. While Goldman played a role in the financial crisis, the bank is no worse than others, Engelbrecht said. </p> <p>Goldman is getting bashed for the same reason Danske Bank got bashed. It''s the icon of capitalism and greed, though at a whole different level than Danske Bank, he said. The critics forget that this investment is being made by the division in Goldman that actually specializes in renewables, and with the level of professionalism displayed by Goldman, that''s not a bad thing. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Sonia Sirletti" date="Jan 23, 2014  2:16 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-23/generali-will-sell-bsi-group-for-sure-ceo-greco-says.html"><headline>Generali Will Sell BSI Group for Sure,'' CEO Greco Says</headline><body><![CDATA[

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) gave Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon a 74 percent raise to $20 million last year, bringing his pay closer to where it stood before he was penalized for faulty oversight of botched derivatives bets. </p> <p>The board''s compensation package for Dimon, 57, who also serves as chairman, included $18.5 million in restricted stock, the New York-based lender said today in a regulatory filing. His salary was unchanged at $1.5 million and he got no cash bonus, according to the filing. </p> <p>Board members decided to keep Dimon''s pay below previous peak levels after criminal and regulatory probes cost JPMorgan more than $23 billion in settlements during 2013. The directors cut his 2012 package in half last January to $11.5 million, saying he bore ultimate responsibility for failures that led to derivatives trading losses in the London Whale episode. </p> <p>In raising Dimon''s pay, the board of directors cited sustained long-term performance; gains in market share and customer satisfaction; and the regulatory issues the company has faced and the steps the company has taken to resolve those issues, according to the filing. </p> <p>The restricted stock vests 50 percent after two years and 50 percent after three years, the bank said. Awarding Dimon''s total bonus in shares ties his pay to the company''s future performance, including continued progress on the company''s regulatory agenda, the firm said. </p> <h2>Performance Priority </h2> <p>The board''s compensation committee is led by Lee Raymond, 75, Exxon Mobil Corp.''s former chairman and CEO. JPMorgan''s stock climbed 33 percent last year, matching the 81-company Standard  Poor''s 500 Financials Index. </p> <p>Obviously they paid more attention to the operational performance and stock-price performance and less to the litigation issues, said Joseph Sorrentino, a managing director at Steven Hall  Partners, a New York-based compensation consulting firm. Maybe there''s an argument that settling those items at those levels and removing the uncertainty there, maybe that''s worth something as well, but hard to know. </p> <p>Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake, 44, received 80,346 shares, worth $4.65 million at the price of $57.875, the level at which Dimon''s shares were valued. Chief Operating Officer Matt Zames, 43, received stock valued at $9.75 million, as did Mike Cavanagh, 48, co-head of the firm''s corporate and investment bank. </p> <h2>Shareholder Support </h2> <p>Daniel Pinto, 51, the other co-head, received the same total pay as Cavanagh, and it was structured differently because of compensation rules in the U.K. where Pinto is based, according to a person briefed on the awards. </p> <p>Any cash awards for named executives will be disclosed in the firm''s proxy statement later this year. </p> <p>Dimon became CEO at the end of 2005 and added the title of chairman a year later. His reputation as a top manager, along with his pay, has fluctuated since then. While JPMorgan emerged from the financial crisis as the only large U.S. bank to avoid quarterly losses, the trading debacle in 2012 prompted some investors to call for splitting his dual roles. Shareholders rejected that proposal at a meeting in May. </p> <p>Dimon was paid $49.9 million for 2007, including special stock awards. During the financial crisis a year later, he took only a $1 million salary. He got $15.2 million for 2009, and $23 million for each of the two years that followed. </p> <h2>Settlement Costs </h2> <p>In last year''s third quarter, the bank posted its first loss on Dimon''s watch after taking a $7.2 billion charge to cover the cost of mounting litigation and regulatory probes. The deficit ended the firm''s streak of three record annual profits. Full-year net income fell 16 percent to $17.9 billion. </p> <p>Dimon pushed last year to resolve government investigations, including at least eight Justice Department probes listed in the firm''s quarterly report in October. </p> <p>Settlements since then have included a record $13 billion deal to resolve inquiries into mortgage-bond sales. The bank paid $2.6 billion and avoided criminal prosecution while settling claims it failed to stop Bernard Madoff''s Ponzi scheme. The firm also paid more than $1 billion last year tied to the botched derivatives bets, which lost more than $6.2 billion in 2012. In that case, U.S. and U.K. regulators faulted its oversight of a trader known as the London Whale because his positions were so large. </p> <p>Dimon told journalists earlier this month that he couldn''t predict whether he might be able to put the legal disputes behind the bank this year. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Beth Jinks and Brian Womack" date="Jan 24, 2014  2:23 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-24/goldman-sachs-said-to-advise-ebay-as-icahn-intensifies-campaign.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Said to Advise EBay as Icahn Intensifies Campaign</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is working
for EBay Inc. (EBAY) as it faces calls from Carl Icahn to split off its
PayPal unit, people with knowledge of the matter said, the
investment bank''s latest assignment with a technology company
facing an activist investor. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is a long-time adviser to EBay on a number of
issues, Amanda Miller, spokeswoman for the online marketplace,
said while declining to discuss the specifics of the bank''s current
role regarding Icahn''s efforts. We did not engage them specifically 
for this matter, she said. </p>
<p>The New York-based bank also has advised Apple (AAPL) Inc. and
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the people said, asking not to be identified
discussing private information. Apple faces calls for a bigger
stock buyback from Icahn, and Microsoft recently said it will
allow ValueAct Capital Management LLC President Mason Morfit to
join its board. </p>
<p>Investment banks are building up practices that advise
companies on how to deter and respond to activists, as the
investors garner more money and institutional backing. Funds
managed by activists have almost tripled over five years, to $93
billion at the end of last year from about $32 billion in 2008,
according to data compiled by Hedge Fund Research. </p>
<p>At Goldman Sachs, the activist defense practice has been
spearheaded by partner Bill Anderson, who joined the bank in
2000. Anderson was previously an MA lawyer at Simpson Thacher 
Bartlett LLP. </p>
<h2>Engaging Activists </h2>
<p>Icahn informed EBay last week he had begun purchasing the
online marketplace''s shares and was nominating two directors to
its board, the company said. Icahn called a separation of PayPal
-- one of EBay''s faster-growing businesses -- from the company a
no-brainer in an interview on Bloomberg TV. </p>
<p>Tony Imperati, a spokesman for Microsoft, declined to
comment, as did Andrew Williams, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>Lately, companies have been more proactively engaging
activists before their efforts become public. Icahn''s demands
for for the PayPal split were disclosed by the San Jose,
California-based company in its quarterly earnings report. </p>
<p>EBay Chief Executive Officer John Donahoe spoke with Icahn
last week and said on a conference call the company should stay
together, citing how the intertwined entity helps fund PayPal''s
expansion into areas such as mobile. The payments unit boosted
sales 19 percent last quarter, outpacing 12 percent sales growth
at EBay''s marketplace unit, which faces stiff competition from
Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) </p>
<h2>Technology Targets </h2>
<p>Icahn''s EBay investment follows a string of actions by
activists taking on Silicon Valley technology firms, especially
as some of the companies'' rapid growth rates slow. Icahn has
this week tweeted that he increased his stake in Apple. </p>
<p>He is proposing that the company commit to buying back at
least $50 billion worth of shares in fiscal 2014, something that
Apple is recomending investors vote against. Goldman Sachs
advised Apple''s board as it weighed an earlier push from
Greenlight Capital Inc.''s David Einhorn to issue more preferred
stock which would pay a higher dividend than common stock. </p>
<p>Microsoft signed a pact to cooperate with ValueAct in
August, four months after the activist fund disclosed a stake of
about $1.9 billion in the software maker and at the deadline for
proxy contests ahead of a November annual meeting. ValueAct, the
San Francisco-based firm headed by Jeffrey Ubben, has since
increased its stake. </p>
<p>As part of the agreement, Microsoft said it would allow
Morfit to join the board and hold regular meetings with Morfit,
directors and select management. </p>
<p>Technology companies Hewlett-Packard Co., Juniper Networks
Inc. and Riverbed Technology Inc. are also facing activist
pressure. </p>

Davos, Switzerland. </p>
<p>The MSCI World Index fell 1.5 percent, the most since
August, as of 11:18 a.m. in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average headed toward its biggest weekly drop since 2012 and the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 2.1 percent today, the most since
June. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index slid 1.5 percent,
extending its loss for the year to 5.3 percent. </p>
<p>The market is working through jitters amid a repricing
of emerging-market assets, Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn
said in a separate interview. While the recent moves are not
extraordinary, investors should expect larger swings than in
the past as banks that serve as market-makers pull back amid new
restrictions and capital rules, Cohn said. </p>
<p>As we continue to regulate markets and continue to
increase capital charges, you''ve seen all of the banks reduce
capital they commit to trading, Cohn said. We need to get used
to seeing more and more moves like this. This is just a natural
evolution of where markets are headed. </p>

<p>AMP Capital Australian Corporate
Bond Fund (AMPACBA), which outperformed its peers over the past decade,
prefers U.S. and European banks to the South Pacific nation''s
lenders on improving economic prospects in those two regions. </p>
<p>Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY), 2013''s best-performing corporate
bond, is the fund''s biggest holding, the AMP website shows. BNP
Paribas SA, JPMorgan Chase  Co. are among the top 10, which
include Westpac Banking Corp. as the only Australia-based
lender. The AMP fund returned 6.2 percent in 2013, beating 21 of
its peers, according to Morningstar Australia Pty. It topped the
ranks of funds that invest mainly in Australian bonds over the
past decade with an average return of 7.4 percent. </p>
<p>Australia''s growth will trail the U.S. for the first time
in four years as a mining boom cools, according to a Bloomberg
survey of economists. The cost premium for protecting debt of
the Big Four Australian banks over U.S. counterparts touched the
most in almost six years this month. </p>
<p>The kind of banks that we''ve identified in places like
the U.S., in parts of Europe and the U.K., and to a lesser
extent in Australia, were all going to benefit from economies
that were improving, said Mark Beardow, 46, who runs the A$2
billion ($1.75 billion) fund in Sydney. Many parts of the
global corporate bond market are continuing to meaningfully
deleverage, particularly financials. </p>
<h2>Six-Year High </h2>
<p>The average cost of credit-default swaps on Commonwealth
Bank of Australia, Westpac and the country''s next two biggest
lenders versus the seven biggest U.S. banks widened to 17.4
basis points on Jan. 3, the most since March 2008. It was 12.4
basis points as of yesterday. </p>
<p>Beardow, who talked by telephone yesterday, manages the
fund in Sydney with Jeff Brunton and David Carruthers. </p>
<p>U.S. economic growth will quicken by 0.9 percentage point
this year to 2.8 percent, based on Bloomberg News surveys of
economists. The euro area''s economy will go to a 1 percent
expansion from a 0.4 percent contraction. In Australia, the pace
will pick up by 0.35 percentage point to 2.75 percent. </p>
<p>The bonds of London-based Lloyds returned about 8 percent
on average last year, the most among the biggest 50 corporate
issuers in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch''s Global Corporate
 High Yield Index. The bank''s debt issued in Australia returned
4.95 percent in 2013, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
indexes. </p>
<h2>Big Four </h2>
<p>The returns beat the bonds of Commonwealth Bank, Westpac,
Australia  New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. and National
Australia Bank Ltd., the nation''s four biggest lenders. The
latter topped the list with a 4.71 percent gain, the data show. </p>
<p>Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens cut the
benchmark interest rate to a record low of 2.5 percent last year
to maintain economic growth as the economy struggles to
diversify amid a drop-off in mining investment. </p>
<p>Beardow said he favors shorter-term securities in case
yields rise. The fund''s duration was 1.39 years in December,
versus 2.76 years for the benchmark it uses to gauge
performance, according to the AMP website. Duration is a measure
of a portfolio''s sensitivity to changes in bond yields, and a
smaller figure offers more protection should borrowing costs
increase. </p>
<p>U.S. 10-year yields will be 3 percent to 3.5 percent by
year-end, he said, from 2.76 percent as of 1:31 p.m. today in
Sydney. </p>
<p>Australian 10-year yields will climb to 4.25-4.75 percent,
according to Beardow, from 4.05 percent today. Yields on U.S.
and Australian government securities due in 10 years and longer
have a correlation of 0.948. A figure of 1 means they move in
lock-step. </p>
<h2>Fair Value'' </h2>
<p>Now we think rates are largely fair value, he said.
We see fair value continuing to edge up. The RBA will keep
its benchmark at 2.5 percent this year, he said. </p>
<p>Bill Evans, the top-ranked chief economist at Westpac, says
Stevens will need to cut the benchmark rate to 2 percent. Evans
is the most accurate forecaster on Australia''s economy,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>I would expect to see yields down in this country,
Evans said in a Jan. 24 interview. That would suggest that you
should be buying bonds. We''re not concerned about any credit
risks associated with the banking sector. Bank bonds would
similarly track the capital appreciation that we''re expecting in
government bonds. </p>
<p>Ten-year yields will fall to 4 percent by year-end, Evans
said in a Bloomberg survey of banks conducted Jan. 16 to Jan.
21. It was the lowest forecast among 15 responses. An investor
who bought today would earn about 4 percent if the forecast is
correct, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The AMP Australian Corporate fund can invest up to 30
percent of its assets in global corporate bonds, Beardow said.
The challenge is to generate income with company notes and
protect returns against higher borrowing costs, he said. </p>
<p>We''re pretty positive about the economy, he said. We
want to be particularly active around the possibility that
yields do rise very sharply, and we''re keeping duration pretty
short. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Femsa SAB, the world''s
biggest franchised bottler of the soft drink, tumbled to  a 21-month low after PepsiCo Inc. announced last week that it will
invest $5 billion in Mexico over five years. </p>
<p>Shares of Femsa dropped 3.7 percent to 137.82 pesos at 2:59
p.m. in Mexico City, the lowest on closing basis since May 2012.
The decline was the biggest among the 35 members of the
benchmark IPC stock index, which fell 0.3 percent. </p>
<p>Mexico City-based Coca-Cola Femsa has dropped 13 percent
since the beginning of the year, when a tax on junk food took
effect. PepsiCo, based in Purchase, New York, said last week
that it will expand its food and beverage business in Mexico,
citing the nation''s growing middle class and opportunities for
long-term growth. The maker of Cheetos and Pepsi Cola controls
more than 65 percent of Mexico''s sales of sweet and savory
snacks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>There is always going to be a strong dominance of Coca-Cola here, but with new taxes the consumer is going to be more
aware of the price environment if Pepsi is able to reduce
prices, increase competition or introduce new products,
Cristina Morales, an analyst at Punto Casa de Bolsa SA de CV in
Mexico City, said in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>Mexico represents a tremendous opportunity for growth,
PepsiCo Mexico President Pedro Padierna said in an e-mailed
statement last week. </p>
<p>Jose Castro, the head of investor relations at Coca-Cola
Femsa, didn''t immediately return a request for comment today. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon, who got a 74 percent raise for his work in
2013, stands to reap a separate and bigger payday within months. </p>
<p>The bank''s board of directors, having delayed a decision
for more than a year, has yet to say whether Dimon, 57, can
collect 2 million stock options originally granted in 2008 and
now worth about $34 million. Last week, the board increased his
annual pay to $20 million from $11.5 million a year ago, when he
was penalized for faulty oversight of botched derivatives bets. </p>
<p>After Dimon''s incentive package was created six years ago,
JPMorgan grew to become the nation''s largest bank with shares
outperforming the industry, and then snapped a three-year run of
record profits as costs from government probes surged. The
board''s decision to boost Dimon''s annual pay despite mounting
legal settlements shows he probably will get the full options
award, said Alan Johnson, founder of compensation-consulting
firm Johnson Associates Inc. </p>
<p>It''s obvious the board wanted to send a signal about what
they think of him, Johnson said. It''d be very inconsistent
to say, You''re our guy, and we want to send an emphatic public
message that we think very highly of you.'' And then, Oh by the
way, you didn''t earn this over the last five years.'' </p>

<p>Japanese leaders are unlikely to
roll out major new economic policies to boost growth this year,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>Officials who fought deflation last year through measures
including quantitative easing, monetary stimulus and increased
government spending will opt for policy stability, said Kathy Matsui, chief Japan strategist at the New York-based bank. </p>
<p>This year, I don''t think you are going to get major
bazooka-type policy announcements, Matsui said in an interview
to Bloomberg Radio today. I think it is more a question of
looking for the fundamental improvement both in the macro
economy and corporate level. </p>
<p>Japan has pledged to forge ahead with structural reforms
designed to open business opportunities in industries from
health care to agriculture as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe leads
efforts to break the legacy of 15 years of deflation. The
administration''s attempts helped propel Japan''s Topix index of
shares up 51 percent last year, its best performance since 1999. </p>
<p>Abe''s stimulus program caused an 18 percent weakening in
the yen against the dollar last year, helping exporters. The
Japanese currency fell 0.1 percent to 102.79 per greenback as of
9:45 p.m. in Tokyo today, while the benchmark 10-year yield was
at 0.63 percent compared with 0.745 percent a year earlier. </p>
<p>Matsui said the depreciation in yen is not completely
beneficial to Japan as it increased the cost of growing fossil-fuel imports in the wake of nuclear-plant shutdowns. Japan
reported a record annual trade deficit for 2013. </p>
<p>The weaker the yen becomes the more expensive that fuel
becomes, so it is not a unanimous positive for everybody, she
said. Therefore, I think the currency at this kind of level
anywhere from 100 or around 100 yen to a dollar is actually not
too bad for most companies be they exporters or importers. </p>

<p>Opposition to Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS)''s planned investment in Dong Energy A/S has opened up a bet
on debt sold by the Danish power and oil producer. </p>
<p>Yields on the bonds climbed amid rising resistance to the 8
billion kroner ($1.5 billion) investment, with a former prime
minister saying that selling to the Wall Street firm is morally
and financially wrong and jeopardizes Denmark''s environmental
agenda. The government is seeking to sell a stake to shore up
the utility''s finances after failed natural gas bets. </p>
<p>I would use these recent small declines to buy the bonds
as the debate is only white noise, Jens H. Thomsen, a credit
analyst at Jyske Bank A/S, said by phone. It''s very likely
that the deal goes through and that would be very positive for
the credit profile. </p>
<p>The yield on Dong''s 6.25 percent bond due 3013 rose to 5.78
percent in Copenhagen at the end of last week, the highest since
Nov. 7. It yielded 5.67 percent on Jan. 9 before the criticism
intensified over New York-based Goldman''s investment. That was
the lowest yield since the note started trading on June 24,
according to Composite Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. Today, the
yield fell to 5.77 percent, the first decline in seven trading
days. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s presence in Dong Energy A/S will boost the value of the Danish utility and make a listing more likely, a minority owner said, defending the Wall Street bank amid a wave of opposition. </p> <p>Denmark''s finance committee decides tomorrow whether Goldman can invest 8 billion kroner ($1.5 billion) in exchange for an 18 percent stake in Dong, which needs fresh equity after losing money on failed natural gas bets. Finance Minister Bjarne Corydon has said Denmark must back the deal to avoid gambling with Dong''s future after some lawmakers questioned the bid and a former prime minister called Goldman a shady partner. </p> <p>We want to buy shares to defend our stake in Dong if the finance committee approves the agreement with Goldman, ATP and PFA, Gert Vinther Joergensen, chief financial officer of Syd Energi A/S, said by phone. The deal makes an initial public offering more likely and increases the value of our shares. </p> <p>The government pulled a planned IPO of Dong in 2008 as the financial crisis dragged down stock markets across the globe. Dong said Oct. 2 that the new buyers and the government have agreed to seek an IPO when conditions are right. </p> <p>Syd Energi, a power company based in Esbjerg, has said it will invest 450 million kroner in connection with Goldman''s injection to maintain its current 3.5 percent stake in Dong.

<p>Pfizer projected an effective tax rate of 27 percent for

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Ford Motor Co. (F) led
U.S. companies that topped analysts'' earnings estimates today,
amid rising consumer confidence and buoyant demand for new
products -- from pickups to cable-TV packages. </p>
<p>The drug manufacturer and carmaker are among the 75 percent
of Standard  Poor''s 500 Index companies that have exceeded
analysts'' projections this season so far, with more than 350
that have yet to report. Profit at SP 500 companies probably
rose 6.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013, and sales
increased 2.3 percent, estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Ford benefited from sales of F-Series pickups in the U.S.
and the Focus compact car in China. Pfizer, the world''s
biggest drugmaker, cut costs to boost earnings. While Apple 
Inc.''s profit also beat estimates, the Cupertino, California-based company posted iPhone sales for the holiday season
that missed analysts'' projections yesterday, a sign it needs
new products to fuel growth. </p>
<p>Confidence among U.S. consumers unexpectedly climbed to a
five-month high in January, according to data released by the
the Conference Board today, as optimism about the economy and
labor market improved. </p>
<p>The labor market has been the key variable for the
consumer for a very long time and people have generally been
feeling a little bit better over the last three to six months
because the unemployment rate has been falling, Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Pierpont Securities LLC in Stamford,
Connecticut, said before the report. </p>
<h2>Health-Care Companies </h2>
<p>All but one of the 14 health-care companies in the SP that
have reported exceeded earnings'' projections, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Almost 56 percent of consumer-discretionary
companies and 87 percent of information-technology businesses
posted higher-than-estimated earnings. </p>
<p>Comcast Corp. (CMCSA), the largest U.S. cable company, also
reported results today. Although earnings missed estimates,
sales were higher than projected as the Philadelphia-based
company added TV subscribers for the first time in more than six
years. </p>
<p>Among the companies that topped estimates in the past week
were Microsoft Corp., helped by sales of game consoles and cloud
software, and Netflix Inc., which surged to a stock-price record
after projecting higher-than-estimated customer growth. </p>
<p>Companies that fell short in terms of sales included
International Business Machines Corp., while Johnson  Johnson,
the world''s biggest maker of health-care products, forecast 2014
earnings that was lower than analysts anticipated. </p>
<p>A majority of SP 500 companies -- 71 percent -- have yet

<p>A rate cut is the European Central
Bank''s best option to respond to rising borrowing costs in euro-area money markets, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a note. </p>
<p>Overnight interbank rates were above the central bank''s
benchmark interest rate this month for the longest stretch since
2011. ECB President Mario Draghi said on Jan. 9 that officials
are ready to act as needed in response to unwarranted
tightening of the short-term money markets. </p>
<p>It is only a matter of time before the ECB will have to
address the issue, Dirk Schumacher, an economist at Goldman
Sachs in Frankfurt, said in the e-mailed note. A cut in the key
rate seems in principle the best option if the ECB wants to
guarantee short-term money market rates close to zero. </p>
<p>Policy makers gathering in Frankfurt on Feb. 6 for their
monthly rate-setting meeting have to assess whether the tighter
financing conditions show a resurgence of tensions that justify
a policy response or simply increased confidence in the region''s
economic recovery. The bank cut its benchmark rate to a record-low 0.25 percent in November. </p>
<p>The overnight unsecured lending rate for banks in euros was
above that level for the four days through Jan. 21 and climbed
as high as 0.359 percent on Jan. 20. It fell for a fifth day
yesterday, declining to 0.188 percent. </p>
<h2>Liquidity Drop </h2>
<p>Excess liquidity in the euro area, the surplus cash in the
financial system that isn''t immediately needed by banks to meet
their obligations, was at 170.3 billion euros ($232.3 billion)
yesterday after dropping last week to 125.5 billion euros, the
least since December 2011. </p>
<p>The ECB failed for a second week to sterilize government
bond purchases conducted under the now-terminated Securities
Markets Program. That may be a signal that banks are reluctant
to part with liquidity. </p>
<p>The central bank''s key rate will fall to 0.1 percent and
the deposit rate, which is currently at zero, to minus 0.1
percent by March, according to Barclays Plc and Commerzbank AG
in reports this month. Royal Bank of Canada said the main rate
will be reduced while the deposit rate stays at zero. Alessandro
Giansanti, a rates strategist at ING Bank NV in Amsterdam, said
the benchmark will be cut within three months. </p>
<p>Schumacher said that while the ECB will probably keep rates
unchanged at the February meeting, an eventual cut in the
benchmark rate to 0.1 percent would be the most effective
measure. He said that one negative side-effect of a
reduction may be that a narrowing of spreads between official
rates could curb the incentive of banks to lend to each other. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley turned more bearish
on sovereign and corporate debt in emerging markets as declines
in their currencies accelerated and funding costs increased. </p>
<p>The U.S. bank cut its recommendation on foreign-currency
bonds to sell from reduce, and on local-currency notes
to reduce from hold, strategists led by New York-based
Rashique Rahman wrote in a report dated yesterday. Argentina''s
peso and Turkey''s lira have led declines in exchange rates of
developing economies this year as the Federal Reserve began
paring stimulus that had fueled demand for their assets. </p>
<p>The premium investors demand to hold emerging-market
sovereign debt over U.S. Treasuries widened 39 basis points this
year to 366 basis points on Jan. 27, after touching 368 on Jan.
24, the highest since September, according to JPMorgan Chase 
Co.''s Emerging Bond Index Global Sovereign Spread. </p>
<p>Valuations in credit markets stand out the most to us as
being rich, and we expect recent spread widening to continue,
the analysts wrote. The recent foreign-exchange weakness and
increased cost of funding are set to generate a negative
feedback loop from the external into the domestic fabric of
emerging-market economies. </p>
<p>China''s yuan is the only one among the 24 major emerging
currencies tracked by Bloomberg to advance against the dollar
this year. </p>
<h2>Currency Weakness </h2>
<p>Developing-nation currencies fell for a ninth day on Jan.
24 to the weakest since March 2009, according to JPMorgan
Emerging Markets Currency Index. The Argentine peso has dropped
almost 19 percent this year versus the greenback, the worst
performance among emerging currencies, Turkey''s lira weakened
5.5 percent, Russia''s ruble declined 5.4 percent and the South
African rand fell 5.1 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Emerging-market bond funds saw outflows of $430 million in
the week through Jan. 22 after withdrawals of $774 million in
the preceding week, according to Australia  New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd., which cited EPFR Global data. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley maintained its underweight
recommendations on foreign-currency debt from Turkey, Brazil and
Ukraine, meaning investors hold less than the benchmark index
recommends. The bank said it expects notes from Mexico, Russia,

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, the highest-paid head of a
U.S. bank for 2012, saw his bonus increase 11 percent to $21
million for his work last year. </p>
<p>Blankfein, who also serves as chairman, received 88,422
restricted shares on Jan. 28 valued at $14.7 million, according
to a regulatory filing. He also got a cash award amounting to
the typical 30 percent of his total bonus, according to a person
with knowledge of the payout. On that basis, the cash portion of
his bonus would be about $6.3 million. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS) boosted stock
awards for their CEOs this month after an improving U.S. economy
drove up bank shares in 2013. Goldman Sachs had an 11 percent
return on equity last year, topping its largest Wall Street
rivals, while cutting pay costs amid revenue that was little
changed. The stock jumped 39 percent in the year, more than the
33 percent climb in the SP 500 Financials Index. </p>
<p>Blankfein''s bonus and $2 million salary amount to $3
million more than what JPMorgan paid CEO Jamie Dimon. It was the
second straight year that Blankfein out-earned his rival.
Blankfein also got a $5 million long-term incentive a year ago
tied to performance targets. Details of any 2014 long-term
incentive will be disclosed later this year. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. and Patria
Investimentos SA are poised to benefit from a telecommunications
building boom in Brazil as mobile-phone providers need companies
to construct towers costing $320 million to $820 million. </p>
<p>Goldman, Patria and at least six other private-equity firms
are backing five local tower builders as phone operators from
Tim Participacoes SA (TIMP3) to Telefonica Brasil SA (VIVT4) shift from
constructing their own towers to contracting the work out.
Operators will seek bids to build about 3,900 towers, more than
half the 6,680 new towers needed in 2014 to improve networks,
according to forecasts from one of the builders, who asked not
to be identified because the estimates aren''t public. </p>
<p>Brazil is trying to boost services and reduce dropped calls
as surging demand for high-speed Internet strains the current
network. The country has about 61,000 towers installed today --
slightly more than in the U.K., which is 1/20th the size and has
a third of the population, said Chahram Zolfaghari, chief
executive officer of builder Brazil Tower Co., the builder
that''s backed by investment firm 1848 Capital Partners LLC. </p>
<p>We''re not talking about 10 percent or 20 percent growth -
- it''s like 100 percent, Zolfaghari said in an interview at
Bloomberg''s Sao Paulo office about the number of towers needed
in Brazil. They need to be doubled to properly attend to
current needs. </p>
<h2>Blackstone, Fishman </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs and Gavea Investimentos Ltda., the Brazilian
hedge-fund firm founded by former central bank president Arminio Fraga, last year unveiled tower-investment fund Cell Site
Solutions, while Patria Investimentos SA, a firm that includes
Blackstone Group LP (BX) among its investors, has allocated 300
million reais ($123 million) of capital to its Highline do
Brasil. </p>
<p>Other companies planning to build towers in Brazil are T4U
Tower Management, which is backed by Israel''s Fishman Group; QMC
Telecom International Holdings, whose investors include Peterson
Partners LP and Housatonic Partners; and Brazil Tower. </p>
<p>An outside spokeswoman for Goldman declined to comment on
behalf of the company, as did an outside spokesman for Patria.
Representatives from Peterson, Fishman and QMC didn''t respond to
requests for comment. </p>
<p>More Brazilians are buying smartphones, while providers
like Telefonica''s Vivo brand and America Movil SAB (AMX)''s Claro unit
are pushing data services to boost revenue, according to the
companies'' financial reports. </p>
<h2>Regulatory Crackdown </h2>
<p>Tim was among the companies forced by regulatory agency
Anatel to stop selling new lines for about 10 days in 2012 to
address complaints about dropped calls. The crackdown, along
with millions of reais in fines in the past several years, is
putting pressure on companies to improve customer satisfaction. </p>
<p>Vivo needs 10,000 new towers in the next two years to meet
traffic growth and government quality mandates, Chief Executive
Officer Antonio Carlos Valente said in an interview. </p>
<p>We are starting to feel difficulties in the availability
of steel and labor, Valente said about challenges in building
new towers. </p>
<p>Anatel doesn''t regulate the tower market and sees demand
increasing significantly in coming years. </p>
<p>This is a good business for tower builders, said Anatel
Superintendent Carlos Baigorri. Third-party tower builders
will allow operators to focus on their core business. </p>
<p>Of the 6,680 new sites needed in Brazil, about 2,780 will
be towers built by the operators themselves or shared towers in
which companies install equipment alongside competitors. </p>
<h2>Profitable Sites </h2>
<p>Brazil Tower builds towers for 200,000 reais to 500,000
reais apiece, its CEO says. That values the 3,900 to be built by
third parties at 780 million to 2 billion reais, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Brazil Tower then expects to sell
the sites in bulk for as much as $300,000 each, he said. </p>
<p>Tower operating companies including SBA Communications
Corp. (SBAC) and American Tower Corp. (AMT) have been expanding in the past
two years as wireless providers prefer to lease towers rather
than maintain them internally to preserve cash and limit
investments. SBA agreed last month to pay 1.53 billion reais for
2,007 Oi towers, or about 760,000 reais per tower -- more than
twice the rate it paid for a previous acquisition of other Oi
towers, according to Wells Fargo  Co. </p>
<p>We have a long-term view of the market, Kurt Bagwell,
SBA''s international president, said in a phone interview. We
basically try to predict the growth of the revenue of these
sites over time and we feel that the price we paid for these
works for our business, no problem. </p>
<p>SBA rose 1.9 percent to $92.29 at the close in New York,
while American Tower rose 2 percent to $81.18. </p>
<h2>Open Door </h2>
<p>Cell Site, Brazil Tower, Highline do Brasil, T4U and QMC --
the five largest builders in Brazil -- have the capacity to
construct only as many as 1,600 towers a year, opening the door
for other companies to step in to help build towers, according
to the investor analysis obtained by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Everybody wants to do business in Brazil -- the problem
is that to do business in Brazil is so difficult, Brazil
Tower''s Zolfaghari said. Just in the state of Florida, you
have 60 companies like us. Why do you think I''m in Brazil? Over
there I would be one guy among hundreds. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world''s
largest oil producer by market value, said fourth-quarter profit
dropped the most in four years as it pumped less natural gas
from wells and energy prices stagnated. </p>
<p>Net income fell 16 percent to $8.35 billion, or $1.91 a
share, from $9.95 billion, or $2.20, a year earlier, the Irving,
Texas-based company said in a statement today. Exxon was
expected to post per-share profit of $1.91, based on the average
of 18 analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Exxon''s global output dropped for the ninth time in 10
quarters, disappointing investors who had been encouraged when
the company snapped its losing streak during the July-to-September period, said Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward
Jones  Co. Exxon hasn''t sustained output growth for two
consecutive quarters since the first half of 2011. </p>
<p>Production fell again so the question becomes,Have they
already lost the momentum they gained in the last quarter,''
Youngberg said in a telephone interview from St. Louis today. </p>
<p>Sales declined 3.3 percent to $110.86 billion. Exxon''s
shares fell 1.2 percent to $93.99 at the close in New York. </p>
<p>Exxon pumped the equivalent of 4.216 million barrels of
crude a day during the final three months of 2013, the lowest
fourth-quarter output since 2010, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Gas Declines </h2>
<p>A 1.5 percent rise in crude production, led by new wells in
the Western Hemisphere, was more than canceled out by a 5.2
percent decline in gas output, the company said. Gas supplies
fell in every region of the world where Exxon does business
except for Canada and South America, according to the statement. </p>
<p>Brent crude, the benchmark for more than half the world''s
oil, declined 0.7 percent to an average of $109.35 a barrel
during the final three months of last year. U.S. natural gas
rose 8.8 percent to $3.85 per million British thermal units.
West Texas Intermediate crude, the bellwether U.S. oil, climbed
11 percent to $97.61 a barrel. </p>
<p>Refining and marketing profit tumbled 48 percent to $916
million. Exxon''s chemical earnings dropped 5 percent to $910
million, according to the statement. </p>
<p>Exxon earns about three-quarters of its global net income
outside the U.S., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson is
seeking to revive production growth and limit costs amid
shrinking access to the world''s remaining untapped petroleum
reservoirs. </p>
<p>Exxon''s majority-owned Canadian subsidiary, Imperial Oil
Ltd. (IMO), said profit declined to C$1.056 billion ($946 million), or
C$1.24 a share, from C$1.076 billion, or C$1.26, a year earlier.
Record earnings from processing crude into fuels were more than
offset by slumping prices received for Imperial''s western
Canadian crude, the Calgary-based company said in a statement
today. </p>
<p>Imperial fell 0.6 percent to C$45.52 in Toronto. </p>

<p>Banks led by Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and Citigroup Inc. say commodities are heading for losses
in 2014 as rising supplies and slowing demand compound slumps
that led to bear markets last year in gold, copper and corn. </p>
<p>Open interest measuring holdings across the 24 commodities
tracked by the Standard  Poor''s GSCI Spot Index (BUSY) fell for three
straight quarters through December, the longest slump since the
global recession in 2008. The super cycle that led commodities
to almost quadruple since 2001 is reversing, with prices set to
drop 3 percent in 12 months, Goldman said. The asset class will
be a wallflower compared with equities, Citigroup said. </p>
<p>Raw materials from copper and corn to sugar and coffee will
be in surplus this year after a decade-long bull market spurred
producers to build new mines, drill more wells and expand
planting of crops. Investors pulled a record $43.3 billion last
year from commodity funds tracked by EPFR Global, and hedge
funds cut bullish bets across 18 U.S. futures by 53 percent from
an all-time high in September 2010. </p>
<p>Supply growth is still formidable across most
commodities, said Rob Haworth, a Seattle-based senior
investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, which
oversees $115 billion. It will take some time for actual
demand trends to start to overwhelm that increasing supply. </p>
<p>The SP GSCI dropped 0.8 percent this month and 2.2 percent
last year, while the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities
slid 3.5 percent, after surging 20 percent in 2013. The
Bloomberg Dollar Index, a gauge against 10 major trading
partners, has climbed 1.1 percent since the end of December. The
Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index advanced 1.6 percent. </p>
<h2>Lagging Equities </h2>
<p>The SP GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index, which measures
investor returns after some rolling positions are taken into
account, will drop 3 percent in the next 12 months, Goldman said
in a Jan. 12 report. Precious metals will lose 15 percent, while
agriculture will decline 11 percent, the bank said. Industrial
metals will decrease 5 percent, livestock 3 percent, and energy
will fall 1 percent, Jeffrey Currie, the bank''s head of
commodities research, said in the report. </p>
<p>We are still at below-trend GDP growth, and typically in
this environment you see weak commodity returns and low
volatility, Currie said by e-mail Jan. 22. The expectations
are the U.S. grows near trend, but Europe won''t, and the
emerging markets won''t. If the growth was above trend
everywhere, we''d be jumping into commodities. </p>
<h2>More Supply </h2>
<p>While the 18 euro-area nations emerged from the longest
recession since they began using the currency 15 years ago,
economic growth this year will be just 1 percent, below the
annual average of 1.5 percent since 1997, according to 56
economists in a Bloomberg survey. China, the top user of
everything from zinc to cotton, will expand 7.5 percent, the
slowest pace since 1990, a Bloomberg survey showed. </p>
<p>The SP GSCI gauge surged 170 percent from the end of 1999
to Dec. 31, 2009, the most of any decade since the data begins
in 1971. Higher commodity prices encouraged investment in new
production technology and expanded development of farms, oil
reserves and mines. </p>
<p>Global refined-copper output this year will jump to 22.2
million metric tons, or 55 percent more than in 1999, according
to New York-based researcher CPM Group. Last year''s record corn
harvest of 13.925 billion bushels in the U.S., the world''s
largest grower and exporter, was 48 percent bigger than the
harvest 15 years earlier, government data show. World crude-oil
output has expanded by 19 percent since 1999, according to the
U.S. Energy Information Administration. </p>
<h2>Back Seat'' </h2>
<p>The SP GSCI lagged behind the MSCI equity index for two
straight years, the first time that''s occurred since 1998.
Commodities will continue to take a back seat to other
assets because raw-material gains from 2009 to 2011 were built
on unsustainable factors, Citigroup analysts including Jon Bergtheil and David Wilson said in a Jan. 6 report. Metals have
little encouragement from the balance of supply and demand
this year, they said. </p>
<p>The super cycle has ended because supply has caught up
with demand, Citigroup said in November 2012. A year later,
analysts led by Ed Morse said the bank remains neutral to
bearish commodities with muted demand expected in 2014. </p>
<p>Producers expanded output, after tight supplies led to a
tripling of the SP GSCI since the end of 1999, with record
prices for commodities including oil, gold and copper. More
supply led to a divergence of commodity and equity markets that
had rallied together since the recession, Goldman''s Currie said. </p>
<h2>Bullish Case </h2>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. says commodity bears are overly
confident on the reliability of supply and underestimate
demand. All but eight of the 65 commodity indices the bank
tracks will gain over the next two years, with five of them
posting double-digit annual returns, analysts led by Colin Fenton wrote in a Dec. 30 report. The super cycle is just
beyond its midpoint, and the markets are still in the bull
phases, JPMorgan said. </p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund raised this year''s global
growth forecast to 3.7 percent, from an October estimate of 3.6
percent. The jobless rate in the U.S. fell to a five-year low
last month, and Euro-area factory output grew faster than
economists forecast in January, according to Markit Economics.
The U.S. is the top consumer of corn and crude oil. Europe
accounts for about 18 percent of copper demand and 14 percent of
global energy use, Barclays and BP Plc data show. </p>
<p>Caterpillar Inc., the largest maker of mining and
construction equipment, sees global growth this year at 3
percent, up from 2 percent in 2013, the Peoria, Illinois-based
company said in a Jan. 27 statement. That will boost demand for
mined commodities and energy, keeping most prices high enough
to make investments attractive, the company said. </p>
<h2>Demand Continues </h2>
<p>Even if we don''t see a sharp rebound in China, emerging
markets in general, they are still growing, and that economic
growth would bode well for continued demand for food, said
Peter Sorrentino, a senior portfolio manager who helps manage
about $4.7 billion at Huntington Asset Advisors in Cincinnati.
As the population becomes more affluent, even in slower
growth, diets continue to improve, and demand for higher volumes
of food and better quality, that should continue. </p>
<p>Gold and silver, after plunging last year by the most since
1981, should see a decent rebound coming as mines cut back
on output, Sorrentino said. It''s just purely based on physical
volumes. </p>
<h2>Bearish Bets </h2>
<p>Hedge funds and other large speculators have reduced their
net-long holdings to 735,217 futures and options across 18 U.S.-
traded commodities as of Jan. 21, compared to the all-time high
of 1.56 million, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data
show. Only eight of the 139 funds, including ETFs, in the Lipper
Global Commodity group made money last year, according to fund
data. </p>
<p>There are shades of bearishness across commodities,
Morgan Stanley analysts said in a Jan. 17 report. The stronger
dollar in 2014 will be a major problem, Julien Garran, a
London-based analyst at UBS AG, said in a Jan. 20 report. Supply
growth also puts prices at risk, Deutsche Bank said in a
Jan. 14 report. </p>
<p>Investors should stay underweight agriculture, gold and
silver this year, Societe Generale SA said in a Jan. 10 report. </p>
<p>West Texas Intermediate crude oil will drop 8.1 percent to
$90 a barrel in 12 months, Goldman forecasts. The U.S. is
extracting the most oil since 1989 as producers tap shale-rock
formations, cutting costs for refiners and driving fuel prices
at the pump down 9.8 percent since March. </p>
<p>Total domestic petroleum consumption averaged 18.8 million
barrels a day in the four weeks ended Jan. 17, the lowest since
Oct. 18., government data show. Global output will rise faster
than demand this year and next, the EIA estimates. </p>
<h2>Precious Metals </h2>
<p>For gold investors, there''s more pain to come after
prices tumbled 28 percent last year, the most since 1981, Morgan
Stanley analysts Peter Richardson and Joel Crane wrote in a
report Jan. 22. The bank cut its 2014 target 12 percent to
$1,160 an ounce. Goldman sees prices at $1,050 in the next 12
months. Investors lost faith in the metal as a store of value
amid a rally in equities and muted inflation. Holdings through
exchange-traded products fell 33 percent in the past year,
erasing $68.8 billion from the value of the funds. </p>
<p>Copper prices will slump 13 percent to $6,200 a metric ton,
Goldman projects. Supplies will top demand by 385,000 tons this
year, up from a surplus of 45,000 tons in 2013, the bank said in
a Jan. 21 report. </p>
<h2>Agriculture Prices </h2>
<p>The SP GSCI Agricultural Index of eight crops fell 22
percent last year, the biggest slump since 1981, as record
harvests from India to the U.S. expanded supplies. Corn futures
have tumbled 50 percent from a record $8.49 a bushel in August
2012. Worldwide wheat output will be at an all-time high for the
fourth time in six years, U.S. government data show. </p>
<p>Global food costs tracked by the United Nations dropped 14
percent from an all-time high in February 2011. J.M. Smucker
Co., the Orrville, Ohio-based maker of Folgers coffee, is
passing along savings from the lower cost of beans via
promotions, Chief Executive Officer Richard Smucker said on a
Nov. 20 earnings conference call. </p>
<p>Cost inflation peaked in the six months through Nov. 24 at
General Mills Inc., the maker of Cheerios cereal, and the rate
will ease in the second half of the fiscal year that ends
May 31, Chief Executive Officer Kendall J. Powell said on an
earnings call Dec. 18. </p>
<p>There''s adequate inventories in grains and in copper,
said Donald Selkin, who helps manage about $3 billion of assets
as chief market strategist at National Securities Corp. in New
York. Crude-oil inventories are going to return to excess once
cold weather is done. Commodities should drift lower in an
overall sense, absolutely. </p>

and other things like it, but there are also a great deal of
complexities, Scharf said today on a conference call to
discuss quarterly results. </p>
<p>Payments networks such as Foster City, California-based
Visa are safer for consumers because of the established
network rules we have, the understanding of how things operate,
understanding who the participants are, the fact that the
business that we do has financial institutions on either side of
the transaction. </p>
<p>While Visa will continue to pay attention to developments
surrounding Bitcoin, we feel very comfortable with the
business that we have here, Scharf said. </p>
<p>Visa is the biggest bank-card network. Scharf is a former
senior executive at JPMorgan Chase  Co., the largest U.S. bank. </p>

<p>The most exciting part of elevating Satya Nadella to chief executive officer of Microsoft Corp. may be that it would end the search to replace Steve Ballmer, investors in the world''s biggest software maker said. </p> <p>The 46-year-old native of Hyderabad, India, is a cloud computing whiz with the potential to reverse Microsoft''s image as a company stranded in the past, said Chad Morganlander, a fund manager at Washington Crossing Advisors. At the same time, he spent two decades working for Ballmer and Bill Gates and shareholders may be disappointed no outside candidate was found, said Donald Selkin of National Securities Corp. </p> <p>Microsoft''s board is preparing to make Nadella, the company''s enterprise and cloud chief, its CEO, and is discussing replacing Gates as chairman, according to people briefed on the process who asked not to be identified because the process is private. Microsoft spokesman Frank Shaw declined to comment. </p> <p>It''s a safe choice, said Kevin Walkush, a business analyst at Jensen Investment Management in Lake Oswego, Oregon. The firm oversees $7.2 billion and has 6.7 million Microsoft shares. There''s a large faction that wants a disruptive tech visionary to take over Microsoft and that group will probably be disappointed. Another group of people think we need a person like Satya who knows the business because it''s so complex and needs someone that has the inside knowledge. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX), the third-largest oil
company by market value, said production this year will rise
less than 1 percent as fourth-quarter profit tumbled 32 percent
amid slumping prices. </p>
<p>Crude and natural gas output will average the equivalent of
2.61 million barrels a day this year, a 0.5 percent increase
from 2013, the San Ramon, California-based company said in a
slide presentation today. For the final three months of last
year, net income dropped to $4.93 billion, or $2.57 a share,
from $7.25 billion, or $3.70, a year earlier, Chevron said in a
separate statement. </p>
<p>Costs have ballooned at Chevron''s flagship $54 billion
Gorgon liquefied natural gas development in Australia, which is
almost 75 percent complete, as the company looks to deep fields
in Kazakhstan and the Gulf of Mexico to add supplies. Chevron is
the latest major international energy producer to disclose
production shortfalls while facing surging costs and unplanned
project delays. </p>
<p>Production growth is going to be modest this year, said
Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James  Associates Inc.
in Houston. In the absence of large project startups,
production growth beyond the very low single digits is just not
realistic. </p>
<h2>Worst Performing </h2>
<p>Chevron slid 4.1 percent, the most since October 2012, to
$111.63 at the close in New York. It was the day''s worst-performing energy producer in the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index. </p>
<p>Both Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, the top
two oil companies by market value, reported lower quarterly
earnings this week compared with 2012. Chevron''s stock
underperformed Exxon and ConocoPhillips last year and lagged the
industry average. </p>
<p>Brent crude, the global benchmark oil price, averaged
$109.35 a barrel in the last three months of 2013, a 78-cent
drop from the prior fourth quarter. </p>
<p>Global crude oil prices and refining margins were
generally lower in 2013 than 2012, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer John Watson said in today''s statement. These
conditions, as well as lower gains on asset sales and higher
expenses, resulted in lower earnings. </p>
<p>Per-share results at Chevron matched the average estimate
of 18 analysts. Sales fell 7.3 percent to $56.2 billion. </p>
<p>Chevron said its fourth-quarter production fell 3.4 percent
to an average of 2.58 million barrels of oil equivalent a day in
the quarter, from 2.67 million barrels a year earlier. Earnings
from oil and gas sales dropped 29 percent to $4.85 billion. </p>
<p>Watson has said he plans to spend $39.8 billion this year
on gas-export facilities, offshore crude platforms and
exploratory drilling as part of a plan to increase global
production 20 percent by the end of 2017. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) is close to a
programming agreement that would settle litigation over Dish
Network Corp. (DISH)''s ad-skipping technology, according to two people
with knowledge of the situation. </p>
<p>Disney, the world''s largest entertainment company, could
receive compensation for technology, known as AutoHop, that lets
Dish subscribers skip commercials in broadcast shows they have
recorded, according to the people, who asked not to be
identified because the discussions are private. </p>
<p>Resolution of the dispute with Dish, the second-largest
U.S. satellite TV service, could make ad-skipping a regular
feature of TV viewing, and ease the tension between Dish and
other programmers. The company is also involved in litigation
with CBS Corp., Comcast Corp.''s NBC and 21st Century Fox Inc.''s
Fox over the feature, which threatens to undermine the
effectiveness of network ads. </p>
<p>Discussions to settle the ad-skipping litigation are part
of wider contract talks between Burbank, California-based Disney
and Dish, based in Englewood, Colorado, for future rights to
programming from ABC, ESPN and the Disney Channel. An existing
accord between the parties expired in September. </p>
<p>By agreeing to let Dish customers skip ads on ABC network
programs they have recorded, Disney could receive higher monthly
subscriber fees, the people said. Broadcast networks have been
asking pay-TV providers for compensation for their over-the-air
programming, similar to what they get for their cable networks. </p>
<h2>Retransmission Fees </h2>
<p>Disney has said such fees could bring in as much as $500
million annually by 2015. </p>
<p>The AutoHop technology, introduced by Dish in May 2012,
lets the company''s satellite-TV customers skip commercials on
recorded broadcast TV shows. The company had 14 million U.S.
subscribers as of the third quarter. </p>
<p>Dish is working with TV networks to deliver more targeted
ads based on consumer information collected by set-top boxes,
Warren Schlichting, the company''s senior vice president of media
sales and analytics, said in an interview in December. </p>
<p>Disney fell 0.2 percent to $73.11 at 2:25 p.m. in New York.
The stock rose 53 percent last year. Dish gained 0.2 percent to
$56.60 and gained 59 percent in 2013. </p>

<p>Twitter Inc. (TWTR), the microblogging
service that went public last year, agreed to buy 900 patents
from International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) to gain access to new
technology and build a defense against infringement suits. </p>
<p>The agreement, signed last month and announced today, also
resolves a dispute that prompted IBM to write to Twitter last
year about possible infringement of at least three patents.
Financial terms weren''t disclosed. </p>
<p>The purchase provides us with greater intellectual
property protection and gives us freedom of action to innovate
on behalf of all those who use our service, Ben Lee, legal
director for Twitter, said in a statement. </p>
<p>Twitter had nine patents and 95 pending applications before
its initial public offering in November, far fewer than other
leading technology companies. It said in a regulatory filing
that the lack of intellectual property could make the company a
target for litigation and limit its ability to fight back by
asserting its own patents. </p>
<p>Patent battles are an increasing distraction for
technology companies, even if Twitter itself wasn''t facing much
of an immediate threat,  said Richard Doherty, research director
of Envisioneering Group, a technology assessment consulting firm
in Seaford, New York. At some point it becomes just a
balancing function to take advantage of warehouses of
intellectual property, like at IBM. </p>
<h2>Video Delivery </h2>
<p>In its letter to Twitter, IBM cited patents relating to a
networking technique based on common contacts, a way to show
advertisements without interfering with an interactive site, and
using interconnected computers to reduce Web traffic. San
Francisco-based Twitter also will probably gain IBM inventions
related to things like video compression, Doherty said. </p>
<p>As Twitter expands and starts delivering video, they need
to increase their intellectual property portfolio, he said.
We believe some know-how is going along with the patent
transfer, not just patent numbers. </p>
<p>The patents include some that directly relate to Twitter''s
business plan. One covers a way to enable compliance with
international shipping requirements. Twitter is seeking to get
more revenue from retailers and is trying to make it easier for
users to shop via its 140-character messages. </p>
<h2>Messaging Technology </h2>
<p>Another of the patents is for improved messaging, according
to information posted on the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
website. Others are less clearly connected, such as a way to
prevent damage to semiconductor chips. </p>
<p>For Twitter, the deal marks its first patent acquisition,
not counting intellectual property it gained by purchasing other
companies. The companies also entered a cross-licensing
agreement. Of the three patents cited by IBM in its initial
letter to Twitter, only one -- for interconnected computers --
has been assigned to Twitter, according to the patent office. </p>
<p>Shares of Twitter gained 1.4 percent to $64.35 at 11:52
a.m. in New York. IBM''s stock was little changed at $176.37. </p>
<p>IBM, which has received the most U.S. patents of any
company for 21 straight years, has made deals with patent-light
technology firms before. The Armonk, New York-based company has
sold patents to Google Inc. (GOOG) to aid the Android software maker''s
battle with rivals over smartphone technology. A sale of 750
patents to Facebook Inc. helped the social-networking site
settle a lawsuit with Yahoo! Inc. </p>
<p>It illustrates the value of patented IBM inventions and
demonstrates our commitment to licensing access to our broad
patent portfolio, Ken King, general manager of intellectual
property for IBM, said in a statement. We look forward to a
productive relationship with Twitter in the future. </p>
<p>The licensing and sales deals mean IBM has agreements with
almost every technology company in business. Its patents
generate approximately $1 billion a year in licensing income,
about 1 percent of its sales last year. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS)''s fixed-income
trading unit offers opportunities on its own merits and isn''t
being propped up by more profitable businesses, Chief Financial
Officer Ruth Porat said. </p>
<p>We are not looking at fixed-income as being subsidized by
the other businesses, we look at it as a strong business on its
own, one that is supportive of the balance of the firm, Porat,
56, said on a conference call with bond investors today. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer James Gorman has set goals for
reducing the amount of capital the fixed-income unit requires
and boosting its return on equity to 10 percent, which the New
York-based firm has said is its cost of equity. Bond-trading
revenue dropped in each of the last four years, raising
questions about whether Gorman, 55, should shrink the business
further. </p>
<p>Many products within fixed-income are already exceeding the
10 percent ROE target, and the overall business can surpass that
level eventually, Porat said. The bank boosted its ROE within
currency trading to around 10 percent last year and plans to do
the same with the interest-rates unit next, she said. Return on
equity is a gauge of profitability that measures how well a
company reinvests earnings. </p>
<p>It''s an ROE opportunity for the firm, Porat said. We
want to take it from where we are today to hit our cost of
capital, but I don''t mean to imply that that''s an endpoint. </p>

<p>The ruble''s plunge in this week''s
emerging-market selloff holds the promise of more competitive
Russian exports and higher budget revenue, JPMorgan Chase 
Co.''s asset-management unit and Capital Economics Ltd. said. </p>
<p>There has been limited official rhetoric about the need
to prevent the ruble from weakening, Liza Ermolenko, an
emerging-markets economist at Capital Economics, said by phone
from London. A weaker ruble improves competitiveness in
international markets and boosts government revenue from oil. </p>
<p>The Finance Ministry canceled a scheduled bond auction amid
the developing-nation rout after selling less than 25 percent of
the securities on offer this month. Russia should abstain from
following Turkey and South Africa in raising interest rates to
bolster the ruble, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said Jan. 29. </p>
<p>The ruble tumbled to the lowest on record against the
central bank''s basket of dollars and euros this week as Chinese
manufacturing contracted and the Federal Reserve pushed ahead
with stimulus cuts. That slide helped drive the yield on
Russia''s February 2027 bond 14 basis points higher on Jan. 29,
the most since June. That compares with a 10 basis-point advance
for similarly dated debt from Mexico, which carries the same
rating at Moody''s Investors Service. </p>
<h2>Commodity Dependence </h2>
<p>Crude oil and natural gas exports account for about 50
percent of Russia''s budget revenue and President Vladimir Putin
has urged officials to diversify the economy and reduce its
dependence on commodities. Brent was steady yesterday at $107.95
a barrel in London, compared with $36.61 in December 2008,
before the currency reached its previous low. </p>
<p>I''m sure the government is happy seeing the currency
weaken a bit, Matias Silvani, who helps manage $35 billion of
emerging-market debt at JPMorgan Asset Management in New York,
said by e-mail yesterday. Russia is facing a weaker economy,
exposure to commodities and is trying to gain
competitiveness, he said. A weaker currency, managed, helps
on all three fronts. </p>
<p>Elvira Nabiullina, the economic aide to Putin who took
charge of Bank Rossii in June, resisted cutting rates last year
to boost economic growth as inflation remained above target. The
economy expanded 1.2 percent in the third quarter from a year
earlier, matching the weakest pace since a 2009 contraction. </p>
<h2>Auction Axed </h2>
<p>The Finance Ministry axed its auction on Jan. 29, citing
market conditions, after issuing 750 million rubles out of 10
billion rubles of 2019 bonds offered at a sale the previous
week. While the ministry plans to sell bonds next week, it''s not
a problem if the first-quarter borrowing plan isn''t met,
Konstantin Vyshkovsky, head of Finance Ministry''s debt
department, told reporters in Moscow yesterday. </p>
<p>When the local currency depreciates, Russia''s budget
receives more rubles from taxes and duties paid by energy
companies whose export revenue is priced in dollars. </p>
<p>Russia''s budget deficit may be equal to 0.6 percent to 0.7
percent of gross domestic product this year, the Interfax news
service said Jan. 23, citing Siluanov. </p>
<p>The yield on Russia''s 2027 OFZ bond has increased 50 basis
points this year to 8.4 percent, the highest since July 2012,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. The yield on Mexico''s debt is
up 26 basis points this year at 7 percent. </p>
<h2>Third Worst </h2>
<p>The ruble climbed for the first day in six yesterday,
adding 1 percent to 40.5092 against the basket after 6 p.m. in
Moscow when the central bank ends its market operations. The
ruble lost 6.5 percent against the dollar this year, the worst
performer among the 24 emerging-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg, behind Argentina''s peso and South Africa''s rand. The
currency retreated 0.3 percent to 40.6059 by 12:18 p.m. in
Moscow today versus the basket. </p>
<p>Many investors are saying that it would be good for the
central bank to raise rates, Evgeny Kochemazov, head of fixed
income at Alfa Capital in Moscow, said by phone yesterday.
That''s probably the only way to stabilize the situation in the
currency market, to prevent the growth of OFZ yields. </p>
<p>Russia is rated Baa1 at Moody''s Investors Service, the
third-lowest investment-grade category. The yield on the
government''s April 2020 dollar bonds was steady at 3.83 percent
today. The extra yield investors demand to hold the nation''s
dollar debt over Treasuries dropped one basis point to 246. </p>
<p>Russian policy makers are scheduled to discuss borrowing
costs on Feb. 14. Bank Rossii will leave the key one-week rate
at 5.5 percent in the first and second quarter, according to the
median estimate of 22 economists in a Bloomberg survey. </p>
<p>The economy stands to gain from the ruble''s drop, according
to Alexei Kudrin, a former Finance Minister. </p>
<p>Overall it''s positive, he said in Moscow yesterday.
It will support industry. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) hired Cathrin Petty from U.K. private-equity firm Vitruvian Partners LLP as
co-head of its health-care investment banking team in Europe,
the Middle East and Africa amid rising activity in the sector. </p>
<p>Petty, who has almost 20 years of experience in health
care, will work alongside the team''s current head, Rakesh Patel,
according a memo obtained by Bloomberg News. She will start next
week and report to Laurence Hollingworth. The contents of the
memo, written by Vis Raghavan, head of EMEA banking, were
confirmed by a spokeswoman. </p>
<p>Before working as a partner at Vitruvian, Petty spent a
decade at buyout firm Apax Partners LLP, eight of those years as
a partner in the global health-care team, in charge of private-equity investments, the memo shows. Petty, who interned at
JPMorgan in 1994, also worked at Schroders doing buyouts and
venture deals for medical technology and pharmaceutical
companies in Europe, India and the U.S., according to the memo. </p>
<p>Acquisitions in the pharmaceuticals industry globally rose
to $80.1 billion last year from $52 billion in 2012, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Total mergers and acquisitions
are set to accelerate this year, led by pharmaceutical deals

<p>Billionaires Alice Walton, George Soros and Marc Benioff are helping to finance a super-political
action committee encouraging former U.S. Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton to run for president, according to a report
filed yesterday with the Federal Election Commission. </p>
<p>Each gave $25,000 to Ready for Hillary PAC, organized a
year ago to provide Clinton outside support if she chooses to
seek the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. </p>
<p>The super-PAC earlier reported raising about $4 million
last year from 30,000 donors, most of them giving small amounts,
such as $20.16. Walton, Soros and Benioff were among 33 people
or companies that gave $25,000 in the second half of 2013, the
FEC report shows. New Yorkers who chipped in to help their
former senator include Roger Altman, the chairman and founder of
New York-based Evercore Partners Inc. </p>
<p>The super-PAC can''t coordinate with Clinton if she becomes
a candidate. It can, however, sell her campaign its data --
almost 2 million supporters have signed up for the group so far
-- or mobilize voters and advertise for her on its own. The
group, based in Arlington, Virginia, is limiting contributions
to $25,000 even though it is permitted to accept donations in
unlimited amounts. </p>
<p>Its early fundraising success, still more than two years
before Election Day, could give Clinton a competitive advantage;
there''s no comparable candidate-specific super-PAC for any of
the prospective Republican candidates, who include Kentucky
Senator Rand Paul, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, and New
Jersey Governor Chris Christie. </p>
<h2>Leading Polls </h2>
<p>Clinton, 66, dominates other Democrats in voter preference
polls and has said she''ll make a decision about a White House
campaign sometime this year. A Jan. 30 Washington Post-ABC News
poll found her with 73 percent of support from Democrats and
Democratic-leaning independents, a 6-to-1 lead over her rivals. </p>
<p>I''ll think about it in the future sometime, Clinton
said Jan. 27 at the National Automobile Dealers Association
convention in New Orleans. </p>
<p>Walton, the daughter of Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc. founder Sam Walton, is the world''s 13th-richest
person with a fortune of $33.9 billion, according to the
Bloomberg Billionaires Index. </p>
<p>Alice Walton''s donation underscores the Clintons''
longstanding ties to business leaders in Arkansas, where Bill Clinton was governor for 12 years prior to becoming president in
1993. The pro-Clinton group also received $25,000 from John Tyson, chairman of Springdale-based Tyson Foods Inc. </p>
<h2>Obama Backers </h2>
<p>Benioff, the chief executive officer of San Francisco-based
Salesforce.com, was a top fundraiser for President Barack Obama''s 2012 re-election campaign and hosted the president for a
Democratic fundraiser at his residence last November. His wife,
Lynne Benioff, also contributed $25,000. </p>
<p>Soros, who''s given millions of dollars to Democratic
causes, funded the super-PAC, as did his son Robert Soros,
managing partner of Soros Fund Management LLC. </p>
<p>Former advisers to Bill Clinton donating to Ready for
Hillary included Altman, a former deputy treasury secretary, who
gave $5,000. William Galston, a Washington-based Brookings
Institution senior fellow and a former White House domestic
policy adviser, gave $1,000. </p>
<h2>New York Donors </h2>
<p>The super-PAC for Clinton, a U.S. senator from New York
from 2001 to 2009, received $25,000 each from developer William Rudin, chief executive officer of Rudin Management Co. in New
York, and Jon Stryker, a New York architect who gave about $2
million to Priorities USA Action, a super-PAC that helped re-elect Obama and is now converting to a pro-Clinton effort. </p>
<p>Silda Wall, a principal at NewWorld Capital Group LLC, who
is divorcing former New York governor Eliot Spitzer, gave
$5,000. </p>
<p>The pro-Clinton super-PAC received $25,000 from the Houston
law firm of Steve and Amber Mostyn, who gave about $5 million to
Democratic groups and candidates in the 2012 election. </p>
<p>Ready for Hillary is led by Adam Parkhomenko, a 28-year-old
college student who has advocated for a Clinton presidential
campaign for more than a decade. The super-PAC''s advisers
include Jeremy Bird, Obama''s former national field director, and
Harold Ickes and James Carville, who have longstanding ties to
the Clintons. </p>
<p>The super-PAC said in an e-mail to supporters that it had
amassed another 7,119 donations last month. </p>
<p>By limiting its donations to $25,000 per individual, Ready
for Hillary is focusing on grassroots support, Parkhomenko said,
while Priorities USA Action can seek bigger donations.
Parkhomenko said Ready for Hillary doesn''t plan to run any
television advertising campaigns, leaving that task to other
groups such as Priorities. </p>
<p>Priorities, which raised more than $79 million in the 2012
election, will have Obama campaign manager Jim Messina as a co-chairman for the 2016 election, its executive director, Buffy Wicks, said in a statement Jan. 23. </p>
