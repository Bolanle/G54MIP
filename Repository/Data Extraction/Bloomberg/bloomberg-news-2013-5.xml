&lt;p&gt;Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC, (ADCB) the
third-biggest lender by assets in the United Arab Emirates, was
raised to overweight at JPMorgan Chase  Co. after it cut
exposure to low quality assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;ADCB management has commendably turned around the
franchise over the last two-three years by cleaning up the asset
book, prudently managing liquidity while conserving spreads
better versus regional peers and strengthening the capital base
by disposal of non-core assets,&#8221; analysts including Naresh Bilandani wrote in a research report. This has made &#8220;the
business model much simpler -&#8211; simplicity receives a plus from
bank investors in the current regulatory scenario.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADCB said last week it settled lawsuits against Morgan
Stanley, Standard  Poor&#8217;s, Moody&#8217;s Investors Service Inc. and
others over its purchase of Cheyne SIV notes. The bank reported
a 4 percent increase in first-quarter profit to 830 million
dirhams ($226 million), beating analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan raised the recommendation from neutral and
increased the price estimate to 5.50 dirhams from 5 dirhams. The
stock closed at 4.61 dirhams last week. It has surged 55 percent
this year, outpacing the 30 percent climb for Abu Dhabi&#8217;s ADX
Banks Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also raised the price estimate of First Gulf Bank, (FGB)
its top pick among banks in the Middle East and North Africa, to
18 dirhams from 13.50 dirhams. The overweight recommendation was
maintained. The stock has risen 25 percent this year to 14.55
dirhams last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Bank of Abu Dhabi, the U.A.E.&#8217;s biggest bank by
assets, was cut to neutral from overweight at JPMorgan, saying
the shares are &#8220;trading close to their June 2014 fair value and
the relative valuation of NBAD looking stretched versus peer
regional names.&#8221; The stock gained 31 percent this year to 12.25
dirhams last week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spot gasoline in Los Angeles
strengthened against futures for a fifth straight day as Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s Torrance refinery began shutting equipment,
including the crude unit and a coker, for maintenance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 150,000-barrel-a-day Torrance plant near Los Angeles
has halted catalytic hydrodesulfurization and sulfur recovery
units for the turnaround, Gesuina Paras, a spokeswoman at the
site, said by e-mail today. Work will also be performed on the
crude unit, the alkylation unit, a hydrogen plant and one of the
cokers, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The overall duration of the maintenance is expected to
last several weeks,&#8221; Paras said. &#8220;Although we anticipate
impact to production, ExxonMobil expects to be able to meet its
contractual commitments.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in Los Angeles jumped
3 cents to a premium of 30 cents a gallon versus futures traded
on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 1:29 p.m., the highest
level since Feb. 19, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The fuel strengthened 16.5 cents a gallon last week, the biggest
gain since the seven days ended Jan. 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stockpiles of California-blend gasoline are at a record low
as scheduled refinery repairs and unplanned unit shutdowns cut
production. Inventories declined 11 percent in the week ended
April 26 to 4.01 million barrels, data compiled by the state
Energy Commission show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Valero Wilmington &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fluid catalytic cracker at Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)&#8217;s
Wilmington plant has returned to planned rates following a pump
upset May 1, Bill Day, a spokesman at company headquarters in
San Antonio, said by e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbob in San Francisco dropped 6 cents versus futures to a
premium of 22 cents a gallon, the first decline in five days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s 240,000-barrel-a-day Richmond refinery, the
largest in Northern California, reported flaring last week
related to the restart of its crude unit, which had been shut
since a fire Aug. 6, Melissa Ritchie, a spokeswoman at the
plant, said by e-mail May 3. The refinery is bringing other
units at the complex back online, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbob in San Francisco tumbled 9 cents to a discount of 8
cents a gallon against the fuel in Los Angeles, the lowest level
in two months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional gasoline in Portland, Oregon, gained against
Nymex futures for the sixth straight day, rising 3 cents to a
premium of 42 cents a gallon, the highest level since October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Diesel Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-sulfur diesel in Portland strengthened 0.5 cent to a
premium of 4.5 cents a gallon against ultra-low-sulfur diesel
futures on the Nymex, a two-week high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend, or CARB, diesel in San Francisco rose 2
cents to a discount of 3.5 cents against ULSD futures. The same
fuel in Los Angeles slipped 0.25 cent to 4.75 cents a gallon
under futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3-2-1 crack spread of Alaska North Slope crude, Carbob
in Los Angeles and CARB diesel in Los Angeles widened a fifth
day, gaining 85 cents to $22.15 a barrel at 2:50 p.m. New York
time. The spread, a rough indicator of refinery margins, is at
the highest level in more than a month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), trying to find growth
markets for its mobile products, is projecting that rising
demand in South Africa will help it pass BlackBerry and Android
and pave the way for further gains on the continent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, working with hardware partners such as Nokia
Oyj (NOK1V) and HTC Corp. (2498), plans to become South Africa&#8217;s No. 1
smartphone provider by 2016, Gustavo Fuchs, who runs its Windows
Phone business in Africa and Middle East, said in an interview.
The company plans models across a range of prices to lure users
in the continent&#8217;s biggest economy, where the average household
income is about $13,500 a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Africa will be the fastest-growing market by wireless
subscribers over the next five years, according to consulting
firm A.T. Kearney. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft is
seeking areas of growth for its mobile business, which lags far
behind Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc.&#8217;s Android that combined
account for about 90 percent of the global smartphone market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With a low-smartphone-penetration market, Windows Phone
has a bigger chance to be the first smartphone for users,&#8221;
Fuchs said in a phone interview from Johannesburg. &#8220;The
smartphone snowball effect has started.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks from JPMorgan Chase  Co. to
Morgan Stanley and Commerzbank AG are weighing the outlook for
Turkey&#8217;s two-year note yield after it fell below 5 percent for
the first time amid fading inflation concern. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-year yields will drop to 4 percent, according to Tatha Ghose at Commerzbank, Germany&#8217;s second-biggest lender. Morgan
Stanley says the current low rate isn&#8217;t justified, while Turk
Ekonomi Bankasi AS (TEBNK) predicts yields won&#8217;t fall further. The yield
sank to as low as 4.96 percent on May 3 before rising to 5.14
percent, trimming the drop in the past year to 419 basis points,
the most among 17 emerging markets tracked by Bloomberg and more
than twice the slide for Polish notes, the next largest decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkish inflation slowed more than economists estimated to
a two-year low in April, giving the central bank room to reduce
interest rates. Even with the drop in yields, Turkey still
offers the fifth-highest rate in emerging markets as policy
makers globally rely on stimulus measures to revive growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We may test towards 4.5 percent,&#8221; Yarkin Cebeci, an
economist at JPMorgan in Istanbul, said in e-mailed comments on
May 3. &#8220;Sounds unbelievable, but this is the reality. Given
ample global liquidity, a strong domestic story, low
inflationary pressures and a dovish central bank, bond yields
could fall further.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Negative Yields &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swiss, Germany and Finnish two-year yields trade near zero
while Australia&#8217;s 2.51 percent rate is the highest among 22
developed countries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg at
the end of last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India cut interest rates for a third straight meeting on
May 3, a day after the European Central Bank lowered its main
rate to a record 0.5 percent. ECB President Mario Draghi said
last week that policy makers had an &#8220;open mind&#8221; on reducing
their so-called deposit rate below the current level of zero for
the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lira weakened for a fourth day, sliding 0.1 percent to
1.7956 per dollar at 11:15 a.m. in Istanbul today. The currency
has depreciated 0.7 percent this year. The two-year note yield
fell three basis points to 5.11 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s Investors Service rekindled expectations of a
rating upgrade on April 11 when it praised Turkey&#8217;s peace talks
with the Kurdistan Workers&#8217; Party in an effort to end a conflict
that began in 1984. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Upgrade Story&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Turkey has a rating upgrade story and funds in the system
are also cheap and abundant,&#8221; said Ali Cakiroglu, a strategist
at HSBC Asset Management in Istanbul. &#8220;If this euphoria
continues, we can see the benchmark bond yields reach 4.8-4.9
percent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fitch Ratings lifted Turkey to investment-grade status in
November, the economy&#8217;s first such ranking in 18 years. Moody&#8217;s
and Standard  Poor&#8217;s rate Turkey one level below investment
grade. Investors who borrowed in U.S. dollars and bought Turkish
lira debt earned 5.4 percent over the past year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkey&#8217;s economy grew 2.2 percent last year, the slowest
pace since a recession in 2009, and down from 8.8 percent in
2011. The economy needs to grow at least 6 percent a year to
meet its goal of becoming one of the world&#8217;s top 10 economies by
the 2023 centennial of the Turkish Republic, Economy Minister
Zafer Caglayan said April 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to hold Turkey&#8217;s dollar
bonds rather than U.S. Treasuries fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 185 today, compared with an average 269
basis points for emerging markets, JPMorgan&#8217;s EMBI Global
Diversified index showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Logic &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think there is a clear logic behind yields
anywhere in emerging markets these days,&#8221; Tevfik Aksoy, chief
economist for emerging Europe, the Middle East and Africa at
Morgan Stanley in London, said in e-mailed comments on May 3.
&#8220;As long as investors get a tiny amount of carry, they will
pile in.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkey&#8217;s central bank reduced all three of its main
interest rates last month, citing an increase of capital
inflows. The Monetary Policy Committee is next scheduled to meet
May 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on Turkey&#8217;s two-year notes may fall to 4 percent and
then stay there through year-end, while rates on longer-maturity
debt rise, according to Ghose, Commerzbank&#8217;s senior emerging-
market economist in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflation and overheating worries are disappearing around
the world and won&#8217;t be back for three years, Ghose wrote in e-
mailed comments. &#8220;I would be much more bullish for two-year
bonds.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the largest U.S.
oil company, said it will invest more than $4 billion in the
development of its Julia oil field in the Gulf of Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil production is expected to start in 2016 from the field,
which was discovered in 2007, Irving, Texas-based Exxon said in
a statement today. The resource in place is estimated to be
almost 6 billion barrels, Exxon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Julia unit was the subject of a 2011 Exxon lawsuit
against the U.S. over the government&#8217;s decision to cancel the
offshore leases because Exxon hadn&#8217;t proceeded quickly enough
with development. The litigation was later settled, allowing the
company &#8220;to develop this very large, but technically
challenging, resource as quickly as possible using a phased
approach,&#8221; Patrick McGinn, an Exxon spokesman, said in January
2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An initial phase of the project is designed for daily
output of 34,000 barrels of oil, the company said in today&#8217;s
statement. It will have tie-backs to a production facility
operated by Chevron Corp. (CVX) Exxon and Statoil ASA (STL) both have a 50
percent stake in the Julia unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Julia is one of the first large oil discoveries in the
ultra-deepwater frontier of the Gulf of Mexico,&#8221; Neil Duffin,
president of Exxon&#8217;s development company, said in the statement.
&#8220;This resource is located more than 30,000 feet below the
ocean&#8217;s surface. Enhanced technologies will be deployed to
ensure the safe and environmentally responsible development of
this important energy resource.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s asset-
management unit agreed to buy the 31-story tower at 425
Lexington Ave. in midtown Manhattan for about $650 million, a
person with knowledge of the plans said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A contract to acquire the 750,000-square-foot (70,000-
square-meter) building is likely to be completed soon, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the talks are
private. It&#8217;s one of two Manhattan towers being marketed by
Houston-based developer Hines, along with 499 Park Ave.,
designed by I.M. Pei. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York commercial-property transactions are forecast to
climb this year as investors globally see Manhattan as a safe
place to buy real estate. Brokerage Cushman  Wakefield last
month projected sales of $14.6 billion for the first half of
2013, up from $10.8 billion a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alyson Leiter, a Hines spokeswoman, said the company had no
comment on the planned sale of 425 Lexington. Douglas Harmon,
senior managing director at Eastdil Secured, who&#8217;s marketing the
building, and Darin Oduyoye, a spokesman for New York-based
JPMorgan, also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Law firm Simpson Thacher  Bartlett LLP, the tower&#8217;s
primary tenant, with 595,000 square feet on 26 floors, renewed
its lease through 2033, Hines said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hines bought the glass tower, completed in 1987, for $346
million in 2003, according to Real Capital Analytics Inc., a New
York-based property-research firm. The building is on the east
side of Lexington between East 43rd and 44th streets, just north
of the Chrysler Building. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan agreement was reported by Crain&#8217;s New York
Business on its website earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) lost a bid to stop Chief
Executive Officer John Watson from being questioned by the
attorney the company is suing over claims he committed fraud to
win a $19 billion verdict in a pollution case in Ecuador. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Magistrate Judge James Francis in Manhattan today
ruled that Watson&#8217;s experience in leading the 2001 Chevron-
Texaco merger is &#8220;likely to have given him personal knowledge
of the environmental issues underlying the Ecuador litigation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Francis also overruled San Ramon, California-based
Chevron&#8217;s objection to a deposition of vice president and
general counsel Edward Scott by defendant Steven Donziger, who
is accused in the racketeering lawsuit of improperly influencing
a court expert whose findings were used by the Ecuador judge in
the environmental damage case in the Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kent Robertson, a spokesman for the company, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to a phone call seeking comment on the
ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donziger has denied wrongdoing and plaintiffs in the
Ecuadorian case have said the oil company is attacking him to
avoid responsibility for the damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The racketeering case is Chevron v. Donziger, 11-00691,
U.S. District Court, District of New York (Manhattan). The case
in Ecuador is Aquinda v. Chevron, 002-2003, Superior Court of
Nueva Loja, Lago Agrio, Ecuador. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is preparing an update for Windows 8 as new licensing figures indicate the new operating system isn&#8217;t fueling enough demand to reverse a slump in personal-computer sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 100 million Windows 8 licenses sold since the software&#8217;s debut in October are in the &#8220;general ballpark&#8221; with the previous version during a similar period, Tami Reller, chief financial officer of the Windows division, said in an interview last week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft completely overhauled its flagship operating system to make it more appealing to users amid a shift to mobile, touch-based computing. Still, Windows 8 has failed to reignite the ailing personal-computer market, where shipments plummeted by their largest margin on record in the latest quarter, according to market-research firm IDC. While Microsoft said it&#8217;s planning to update Windows 8 to address customer feedback, updates won&#8217;t quickly turn the PC industry around. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The changes will help some but there are some serious challenges that the PC industry is facing that I&#8217;m not sure can be easily fixed,&#8221; said Bob O&#8217;Donnell, an analyst at IDC who is based in San Mateo, California. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Donnell also questioned whether the licensing milestone accurately reflects the number of operating systems in use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S. bank, should oust most of its board and split Jamie Dimon&#8217;s dual roles as chairman and chief executive officer, shareholder advisory firm Glass Lewis  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stockholders should replace six of the board&#8217;s 11 directors at the bank&#8217;s annual meeting May 21 and approve a proposal to name an independent chairman, Glass Lewis said today in a report. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Calls for Dimon, 57, to relinquish the chairmanship have mounted since last May, when New York-based JPMorgan disclosed risk-control lapses in its chief investment office on credit-derivative bets that fueled a $6.2 billion trading loss and sparked regulatory probes. Institutional Shareholder Services on May 3 also urged a vote in favor of splitting Dimon&#8217;s roles and removing three directors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investigations by the company and lawmakers &#8220;have revealed questionable risk-management practices at both the senior management and board levels,&#8221; Glass Lewis wrote in the report. &#8220;Shareholders should be concerned that company management was allowed to build a massive exposure to credit derivatives,&#8221; switch risk models and undervalue its losses without triggering a review by the board. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Glass Lewis said shareholders should vote against James A. Bell, former chief financial officer at Boeing Co.; Crandall C. Bowles, chairman of Springs Industries Inc.; David M. Cote, CEO of Honeywell International Inc. (HON); James S. Crown, president of Henry Crown  Co.; Ellen V. Futter, president of the American Museum of Natural History; and Laban P. Jackson, CEO of Clear Creek Properties Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

Calls for JPMorgan Chase  Co. Chairman Jamie Dimon to relinquish the chairmanship have mounted since last May, when New York-based JPMorgan disclosed risk-control lapses in its chief investment office on credit-derivative bets that fueled a $6.2 billion trading loss and sparked regulatory probes.

&lt;p&gt;American International Group Inc. (AIG) fell
the most among large financial firms after Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. said U.S. oversight may limit the insurer&#8217;s ability to buy
back shares in the next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG dropped 2.6 percent to $44.29 at 12:33 p.m. in New
York, the biggest decline in the 81-company Standard  Poor&#8217;s
500 Financials Index. Goldman Sachs analysts led by Michael Nannizzi cut AIG to neutral from buy in a note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Benmosche, chief executive officer of New York-based
AIG since 2009, redeemed debt and struck a deal to sell a plane-
leasing unit as he seeks to bolster the company&#8217;s credit rating
and win confidence of regulators. The insurer halted dividends
in 2008, the year of a U.S. rescue, and is overseen by the
Federal Reserve after repaying the bailout funds in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are not confident that AIG&#8217;s priority for the next 12
months will shift toward buybacks until it has satisfied both
rating agencies and regulators, the latter of which will reflect
a yet undefined framework and timeline,&#8221; the Goldman Sachs
analysts wrote. The insurer also faces the risks of &#8220;credit and
interest-rate volatility, and an inability to adequately
monetize non-core assets along the anticipated timeline.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insurer last year became the first non-bank to disclose
it&#8217;s under consideration to be labeled a potential risk to the
financial system because of its size. Benmosche said in a letter
to the Fed in November that he welcomes supervision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG surged 39 percent in 12 months through yesterday as
Benmosche repaid the bailout, and results improved at the global
property-casualty and U.S. life businesses that are the main
units of a scaled-back company. The insurer last week posted
first-quarter operating profit of $1.34 a share, beating by 46
cents the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see limited upside to our $46, 12 month-price
target,&#8221; the analysts said. &#8220;Current shares now well reflect
the fundamental story.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Diat, a spokesman for AIG, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S.
bank, told about 10 traders in its commodity business that their
jobs may be eliminated, according to two people with knowledge
of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank may dismiss or relocate seven in London and one in
Dubai, said the people, asking not to be identified because the
matter is private. A second Dubai-based trader will be relocated
to London, the people said. Patrick Burton, a spokesman for the
bank in the U.K. capital, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had the second-biggest revenue from commodities
after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. last year, analytics company
Coalition said in March. New York-based JPMorgan has commodity
bankers based in 12 countries, according to its website, though
it doesn&#8217;t disclose how many commodity traders it has globally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities revenue at the 10 largest banks slumped 24
percent last year to $6 billion amid low volatility and reduced
client activity, according to a Feb. 15 Coalition report.
Increasing concerns about regulation and capital sensitivity
also led banks to re-examine commodity strategies, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Low Volatility &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI Spot Index of raw materials
climbed less than 0.3 percent in 2012, the worst performance in
four years. The gauge&#8217;s 100-day historic volatility fell to as
low as 14.1 percent in May, from as much as 23.8 percent in
January 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan said in February it will eliminate as many as
19,000 jobs in mortgages and community banking through 2014 as
it trims expenses. This year, the bank&#8217;s headcount will shrink
by about 4,000 people, mainly through attrition, while some
employees are redeployed to other areas, said Kristin Lemkau, a
spokeswoman, said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s first-quarter profit rose 33 percent to a record
last month as the bank shrank expenses by 16 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S.
bank, was warned by federal energy-market regulators that its
personnel and two subsidiaries may face claims stemming from a
probe into bidding practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Energy Regulatory Commission staff told JPMorgan in
March they may recommend the agency bring an enforcement case,
the New York-based company said yesterday in a regulatory
filing. Claims may include &#8220;alleged violations of FERC rules
and the rules of certain independent system operators,&#8221; the
lender said, without elaborating on the allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FERC has stepped up scrutiny of corporations as it
wields policing powers that were expanded in the wake of Enron
Corp.&#8217;s 2001 collapse. Agency investigators may seek to hold
JPMorgan traders and commodities-unit chief Blythe Masters
&#8220;individually liable,&#8221; the New York Times reported last week,
citing a 70-page document the watchdog sent the bank in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case focuses on eight &#8220;schemes&#8221; adopted by traders in
Houston between September 2010 and June 2011, according to the
newspaper. Traders offered energy at prices &#8220;calculated to
falsely appear attractive,&#8221; prompting state authorities in
California and Michigan to make about $83 million in
&#8220;excessive&#8221; payments to JPMorgan, the Times cited
investigators as saying. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) was among
borrowers including State Street Corp. and Statoil ASA (STL) selling
at least $15.6 billion of bonds in the U.S. today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. bank issued $2 billion of 1.625 percent,
five-year notes at narrower relative yields than those on
similar-maturity debt sold four months ago, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. A spread of 92 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries compares with an extra yield of 103
basis points for $1.25 billion of 1.8 percent, five-year
debentures that New York-based JPMorgan sold Jan. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statoil, the largest Norwegian energy company, sold $3
billion of debt in a four-part offering that included $900
million of 2.65 percent bonds due 2024 that pay 90 basis points
more than Treasuries, $850 million of 30-year, 3.95 percent debt
with an extra yield of 95 basis points, $750 million of 1.15
percent notes maturing 2018 that pay 45 more than benchmarks and
$500 million of similar-maturity, floating-rate bonds that yield
29 basis points more than the London interbank offered rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State Street, the third-largest custody bank, sold $1
billion of 3.1 percent, 10-year bonds that yield 135 basis
points more than Treasuries and $500 million of 1.35 percent
debt due 2018 with a spread of 62.5, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other issuers today included Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A), HSBC Holdings Plc and Brinker International Inc. (EAT),
the owner of the Chili&#8217;s and Maggiano&#8217;s dining chains. Libor (US0003M),
the rate at which banks say they can borrow in dollars from each
other, was set at 0.275 percent today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) prepares to anoint the fifth chief executive in its history, the world&#8217;s largest retailer is grappling with challenges founder Sam Walton never faced. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart&#8217;s board has identified international chief Doug McMillon, 46, and Bill Simon, 53, who runs the U.S. operations, as leading candidates to succeed Chief Executive Officer Mike Duke, according to a person familiar with the situation. While Duke, 63, isn&#8217;t expected to step down immediately, Wal-Mart may name his successor in the coming months, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart is trying to goose slowing sales gains in the U.S. as such rivals as Amazon.com Inc. and the dollar stores lure its customers. Overseas, the company is struggling to ignite growth in China and other emerging markets even as it probes allegations of bribery in Mexico and possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next CEO will face &#8220;tough decisions globally,&#8221; said David Strasser, a New York-based analyst for Janney Montgomery Scott LLC. &#8220;They have to pick and choose. China has been a big struggle. What do you do? Double down? Back out?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the U.S. &#8220;they&#8217;re dealing with a more competitive landscape and a consumer who is struggling,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) has named Erik Bisso to run the bank&#8217;s chief investment office for North
America, according to an internal memo sent today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bisso ran agency mortgage-backed securities pass-through
trading for the New York-based bank, according to the memo, a
copy of which was obtained by Bloomberg News. Bill Anast will
join JPMorgan in August to replace Bisso in that role, a person
familiar with the matter said. Anast previously ran the agency
collateralized-mortgage obligation business at Barclays Plc. (BARC) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bisso&#8217;s move &#8220;demonstrates our ongoing commitment to
developing senior talent and encouraging mobility across the

The pact, which expires in 2020, was reached in 2009 by Ballmer and former Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a consolation for the poor performance of its search ads, Microsoft agreed to pay revenue guarantees to Yahoo through March 2014. That extends an arrangement between the companies that expired last month, Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo said in a regulatory filing yesterday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mayer also has met with representatives of Google, her former employer, who have agreed verbally upon an alternate search-ad partnership should the arrangement with Microsoft end, one of the people said.

&lt;p&gt;Netflix Inc. (NFLX), the world&#8217;s largest
subscription video service, added five shows from Walt Disney
Co.&#8217;s cable channels, strengthening its programming for families
with children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multiyear agreement gives Los Gatos, California-based
Netflix exclusive U.S. subscription streaming rights to Disney
Junior&#8217;s &#8220;Jake and the Never Land Pirates&#8221; and &#8220;Tron:
Uprising,&#8221; which airs on Disney XD, the companies said today in
a statement. Terms for the shows, which began streaming today,
weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal bolsters Netflix&#8217;s lineup of kids&#8217; shows as it
focuses on exclusives and children&#8217;s programming to stand out
from competitors such as Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), the largest Web
retailer, and Hulu LLC. The new rights build on an agreement in
December giving Netflix access to films from Disney&#8217;s Pixar,
Marvel and Lucasfilm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix, the leading online subscription service, has also
funded original programs such as the political thriller &#8220;House
of Cards,&#8221; and obtained rights to the revived Fox show
&#8220;Arrested Development,&#8221; which begins streaming new episodes
May 26. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the new Disney agreement, Netflix will begin
streaming &#8220;Handy Manny,&#8221; &#8220;Special Agent Oso&#8221; and &#8220;JoJo&#8217;s
Circus&#8221; on a non-exclusive basis this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix signed a multi-year accord with Disney in December,
covering films that become available starting in 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix rose 3.7 percent to $216.41 at the close in New
York. The shares have more than doubled this year, the biggest

&lt;p&gt;Barnes  Noble Inc. (BKS) jumped the most in a year following a report that Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) (MSFT) is planning to offer $1 billion to buy the Nook Media unit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The shares surged 24 percent to $22.08 at the close in New York for the largest one-day gain since April 30, 2012. It&#8217;s also the bookseller&#8217;s highest closing price since May 3, 2010. Microsoft fell 1 percent to $32.66. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The plan sees Microsoft gaining preferred units in Nook Media, which also includes a college book business, Techcrunch reported yesterday, citing internal documents. Nook Media also intends to discontinue its Android-based tablet business by the end of its 2014 fiscal year to begin using applications on unnamed &#8220;third-party&#8221; devices, Techcrunch said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mary Ellen Keating, a spokeswoman for New York-based Barnes  Noble, declined to comment on the report in an e-mail. A spokeswoman for Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In April 2012, Microsoft announced a $300 million investment in the newly formed Nook Media subsidiary, and the shares surged 52 percent. Microsoft&#8217;s 18 percent stake valued Nook Media at $1.7 billion. Publisher Pearson Plc (PSON) then announced an investment of $89.5 million in December in the unit, which gave Nook Media a valuation of $1.79 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Barnes  Noble created Nook Media with an eye to separating it from the retail stores and website to boost its value. Investors have undervalued the company and dividing it up could alleviate that, Barnes  Noble has said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Riggio Offer &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Feb. 25, Barnes  Noble Chairman Leonard Riggio said he would offer to buy the company&#8217;s 677 retail stores and website. Three days later, Barnes  Noble reported that Nook sales in the fourth quarter sank 26 percent. Excess Nook devices forced the company to discount the tablets and writedown other inventory it couldn&#8217;t sell. That led to a net loss in what is typically its most profitable period. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nook Media had an operating loss of $190.9 million and sales of $2.18 billion in the three quarters through Jan. 26. The division has been losing money as it spends on marketing and developing devices to compete in the tablet market with Apple Inc. (APPL), Amazon.com Inc. and Google Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Barnes  Noble announced a partnership with Google on May 3 that will put Google Play, its online application and content store, and other applications such as Gmail on Nook tablets. Google&#8217;s Nexus and Microsoft&#8217;s Surface compete with each other as well against Nook. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft didn&#8217;t have to sign off on the deal with Google, despite it owning 18 percent of Nook Media, Barnes  Noble Chief Executive Officer William Lynch said in an interview on May 3. He said he didn&#8217;t know what Microsoft thought about Barnes  Noble partnering with one of the software maker&#8217;s largest rivals. The bookseller is also using Google&#8217;s brand in its marketing for Nook, including signs in its stores. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Christopher Palmeri and Andy Fixmer" date="May 09, 2013  4:26 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-09/disney-said-to-tell-advertisers-of-live-abc-app-in-mobile-push.html"><headline>Disney Telling Advertisers of Live ABC App in Mobile Push</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s ABC network, staking
a claim to growth in online video ads, will brief advertisers
next week on a service providing live shows on mobile phones and
tablets, people with knowledge of the plan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch ABC, a first-of-its-kind application from a
broadcaster, will stream live and archived shows to pay-TV
subscribers, said the people, who sought anonymity because the
plans aren&#8217;t public. It could be released near the new TV season
in September, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With online video ad sales growing faster than network TV
revenue, Disney and other programmers such as News Corp.&#8217;s Fox
are developing ways to let audiences watch away from home on
smartphones and products such as Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPad. The move
pits entertainment companies against Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s YouTube and
Facebook Inc. (FB) for an ad market that Morgan Stanley (MS) predicts will
grow 18 percent to $2.73 billion this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While the audience online is still small, it&#8217;s growing
fast and represents one of the biggest opportunities for the
media companies,&#8221; Ben Swinburne, a Morgan Stanley analyst in
New York, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with Watch ESPN, the mobile TV service offered by
Burbank, California-based Disney&#8217;s sports channel, Watch ABC
represents a potential new revenue source. The network will
outline the product to advertisers in New York next week during
upfront sales presentations for the September 2013 TV season. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the largest energy
company by market value, signed an agreement with Qatar
Petroleum International to move forward with construction of a
$10 billion natural gas export terminal in Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project will involve installing liquefaction equipment
at an existing import facility in Sabine Pass, Texas, according
to an e-mailed statement today from Golden Pass Products LLC, a
subsidiary formed by the two companies. It won permission last
year to export the fuel to nations with free-trade agreements
with the U.S. and is awaiting approval to send the fuel to all
other countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, and state-owned Qatar
Petroleum plan to ship as much as 15.6 million metric tons of
gas annually from the Golden Pass facility, according to the
statement. A boom in U.S. production has spurred several
proposals to export the fuel, which is cooled to liquid form at
-260 degrees Fahrenheit (-162 Celsius) to reduce volume and
allow for transportation by ship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This agreement sets out a highly competitive commercial
blueprint for Golden Pass Products, with a commitment that
builds on the unique combined strengths of QPI and Exxon Mobil
through the the global downstream LNG value chain,&#8221; Bill
Collins, president of Golden Pass, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon has been expanding its worldwide gas portfolio with
acquisitions such as the 2010 purchase of XTO Energy in the U.S.
and investments in projects that include the A$52 billion ($52
billion) Gorgon LNG complex in Australia. Gas accounted for half
of Exxon&#8217;s global production during the first three months of
this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. liquefied natural gas import facilities have been
operating below capacity as a glut of domestic gas from shale
formations erased demand for foreign supplies. The import
terminal at Golden Pass began operations in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron &#8220;is entitled to be compensated for damages, in an
amount to be determined, including sanctions for DOE and the
government&#8217;s &#8216;bad faith&#8217; conduct and abusive discovery
tactics,&#8221; Braden wrote in the ruling made public yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron filed the suit in 2004 after failing to agree on
the exact split of its joint holdings in the Elk Hills facility
with the Energy Department. The company and the government
operated the field together for more than 50 years, and had
agreed to proceed with the sale of the government&#8217;s stake to
Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) while they worked out the holdings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Thai, an Energy Department spokesman, referred calls
for comment to the Justice Department. Allison Price, a Justice
Department spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mail
message seeking comment. Donald Campbell, a spokesman for San
Ramon, California-based Chevron, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to
an e-mail message seeking comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Elk Hills &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Elk Hills Field, located near Bakersfield, California,
encompasses more than 47,000 acres and includes more than 1,000
wells, a 47-megawatt power plant and two units that process gas.
The government&#8217;s share in the field of about 78 percent, which
is still being disputed by Chevron, is estimated to hold
reserves equal to about 1 billion barrels of oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occidental Petroleum bought the government&#8217;s stake in Elk
Hills, one of the largest remaining oil fields outside Alaska,
for $3.65 billion in 1997. That&#8217;s about $3.65 for each barrel of
oil-equivalent it contains. Chevron and Occidental are not
operating the oil and gas field together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale of the interest in Elk Hills reserve, set aside in
the early 1900s for emergency military use by the U.S. Navy, was
the largest government asset sale ever at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her ruling, Braden ordered the government to reimburse
Chevron for 42 percent of its legal fees for two years,
beginning in February 2007, as a sanction for &#8220;bad faith&#8221;
litigation tactics involving the production of documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Chevron USA Inc. v. U.S., 04-1365, U.S. Court
of Federal Claims (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bill Rubin, a senior investment analyst at BlackRock Inc. (BLK) who picks financial-company stocks, didn&#8217;t mince words a year ago when he e-mailed JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) right after the bank disclosed a trading loss that ultimately cost more than $6.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are very disappointed by this turn in events, not so much by the size of the loss, but more by the bad stumble in risk management/controls,&#8221; Rubin wrote, according to notes relayed to JPMorgan&#8217;s management by Sarah Youngwood in the bank&#8217;s investor-relations department. &#8220;Major reputation and sentiment hit, damaging.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;BlackRock, JPMorgan&#8217;s biggest shareholder with a 6.5 percent stake, will cast a key vote this month on whether Jamie Dimon should be allowed to retain both his roles as chairman and chief executive officer even after last year&#8217;s stumble. The vote pits Dimon, who runs the world&#8217;s largest trading business, against BlackRock Chairman and CEO Larry Fink, who runs the world&#8217;s biggest asset-management company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The vote could represent &#8220;a clash of Too Big to Fails,&#8221; said Charles Geisst, a finance professor at Manhattan College in Riverdale, New York, invoking the phrase used to describe companies whose collapse is deemed too damaging to the economy to be allowed. &#8220;They&#8217;re both strong personalities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) sued Roche
Holding AG (ROG)&#8217;s Genentech unit seeking a court order that it
doesn&#8217;t infringe patents used to make treatments for cancer and
autoimmune diseases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patents, known as &#8220;Cabilly&#8221; after one of the
inventors, are invalid and aren&#8217;t infringed by colon cancer and
melanoma treatments New York-based Bristol-Myers sells in the
U.S., the company&#8217;s attorneys claimed in a complaint filed May 3
in federal court in Oakland, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cabilly patents, which have been the subject of high-profile legal disputes, were characterized as &#8220;a bottleneck&#8221;
with respect to antibody-expression technologies by Ulrich
Storz, a patent counsel with Dusseldorf, Germany&#8217;s Michalski
H&#252;ttermann  Partner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing in the Landes Bioscience Journal mABS, Storz said
that U.S. companies using these technologies must either &#8220;go
through this bottleneck or face legal action, either as a
claimant (e.g., in an invalidity action or a non-infringement
action) or as a defendant (e.g., in an infringement action).&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bristol-Myers Squibb said it filed the suit &#8220;to lift the
cloud created by the imminent threat of defendant&#8217;s enforcement
of the Cabilly patents against the plaintiffs,&#8221; according to
the complaint. &#8220;Without declaratory relief the threat of
enforcement of the Cabilly patents poses a substantial risk to
the plaintiffs as well as to patients, nurses and doctors now
using Erbitux and Yervoy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erbitux, made by Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY)&#8217;s
ImClone unit, is approved in the U.S. to treat colon cancer and
head and neck tumors and sold by Bristol-Myers in the U.S.
Yervoy, a melanoma treatment, is manufactured and sold by
Bristol-Myers in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We remain confident in the validity and enforceability of
the Cabilly patents and we believe that the lawsuit is without
merit,&#8221; Nadine Pinell, a Genentech spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eli Lilly filed a similar lawsuit over the Cabilly patents
in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bristol-Myers Squibb v. Genentech, 13-cv-02045,
U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (Oakland). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disney Withdraws &#8216;Dia de los Muertos&#8217; Trademark Application &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Walt Disney Co. (DIS) withdrew the applications it filed with
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to register &#8220;Dia de los
Muertos&#8221; as a trademark, the Los Angeles Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Burbank, California-based company said the filings were
aimed at protecting a forthcoming film about the Mexican
religious holiday known as Day of the Dead, the newspaper
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The studio told the Times it was changing the name of the
film and therefore didn&#8217;t need the trademark protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A petition opposing the registration was put on the
Change.org website May 7 and by yesterday morning, it had more
than 19,000 signatures, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Google Asks Appeals Court to Reject Class-Action Authors Suit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) asked an appeals court to reject class-action
status for a $3 billion lawsuit by authors claiming that its
project to digitize millions of books from libraries violates
their copyrights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Google and three writers who sued, including
Jim Bouton, the author of &#8220;Ball Four,&#8221; argued their case
yesterday before a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of
Appeals in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google seeks reversal of a lower-court order granting
class-action certification. The judges said they would make
their ruling later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Plaintiffs cannot claim to represent the many class
members who benefit from and approve of Google Books,&#8221; Seth
Waxman, a lawyer for Mountain View, California-based Google,
told the judges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Authors Guild, which represents writers, and individual
authors sued Google in 2005, charging that the Internet search
engine operator was digitizing books from libraries without
seeking permission from copyright owners or paying fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Denny Chin rejected a negotiated settlement by the
parties in 2011. Attempts to renegotiate the deal failed, and
the litigation resumed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chin granted class certification last year to all authors
residing in the U.S. who have at least one book in Google&#8217;s
project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A class-action suit makes it possible for all those who
meet the criteria to sue together rather than separately,
increasing the chances of a settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Let&#8217;s get it adjudicated on a class basis, not piecemeal,
book by book,&#8221; Robert LaRocca, a lawyer for the authors, told
the judges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google said in court papers it has digitally scanned more
than 20 million books worldwide and that Internet searchers
would be able to view &#8220;snippets&#8221; of each book online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Authors Guild v. Google, 12-3200, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Defcad Offers Rights-Free Plans for 3-D Printed Plastic Weapons &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defcad, the website operated in conjunction with the
&#8220;Liberator&#8221; gun made using 3-D printing technology, now offers
downloadable plans for a wide range of weapons to be made the
same way. The Liberator, which is made solely from 3-D printed
plastic and a household nail, has been successfully fired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cody R. Wilson, a law student at the University of Texas,
is behind Defcad. Wilson&#8217;s Austin, Texas-based Defense
Distribution says it is the home of a project &#8220;to create freely
available plans for 3-D printable guns.&#8221;  The website includes
poet John Milton&#8217;s &#8220;Areopagita,&#8221; published in 1644 in
opposition to the licensing of books and censorship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the website, Defcad is aimed at being a search
engine for 3D printing. Among the downloadable plans it offers
are silencers, ammunition, basic and Russian grenades, and high-capacity ammunition magazines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site hosts firearms-related files and makes them
available because &#8220;when we say freedom of information, we mean
it.&#8221; No uploaded files will be censored unless they contain
&#8220;malicious software&#8221; according to the Defcad site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Judge Accused Porno-Infringement Lawyers of &#8216;Moral Turpitude&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal judge hearing a copyright case involving alleged
unauthorized downloading of adult films said four of the lawyers
involved in a series of related cases &#8220;suffer from moral
turpitude unbecoming an officer of the court.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a May 6 order, U.S. District Judge Otis D. Wright II
said that John Steele and Paul Hansmeier of Chicago&#8217;s Steele
Hansmeier PLLC; and Paul Duffy and Brent Gibbs of Mill Valley,
California&#8217;s Prenda Law Inc. committed &#8220;brazen misconduct&#8221; and
&#8220;relentless fraud&#8221; in their pursuit of alleged infringers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright outlined what he said was the four lawyers&#8217; strategy
of accusing individuals of illegally downloading a single
pornographic video, then settling for a cost &#8220;calculated to be
just below the cost of a bare-bones defense.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the individuals accused of infringement, Wright said
&#8220;resistance is futile. Most reluctantly pay rather than have
their names associated with illegally downloading porn.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, &#8220;copyright laws originally designed to
compensate starving artists allow starving attorneys, in this
electronic media era, to plunder the citizenry.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge said the copyright owners showed little desire to
proceed in these lawsuits when faced with a &#8220;determined&#8221;
defendant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to referring the four lawyers to the discipline
committees of their various state and federal bar associations,
the judge said he would refer their actions to the U.S. Attorney
for the Central District of California and to the criminal
investigation division of the Internal Revenue Service, and will
inform all judges before whom they have pending cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawyers and the copyright owners also must pay attorney
fees of more than $81,000 to one unnamed defendant in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview with AVN Media Network, which covers the
adult-film industry, Steele said he would appeal the ruling. He
said that he wasn&#8217;t an attorney in the case at issue and &#8220;have
never practiced law in California.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of judges around the country have
ruled on similar cases and have thrown out &#8220;crazy conspiracy
theories&#8221; brought by defense counsel, which includes the San
Francisco-based Electronic Frontier Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said with respect to the discipline-committee referrals,
&#8220;the Illinois Bar is well aware of this type of litigation. I
have had inquiries from the office of the Illinois State Bar and
have satisfied their requests in the past.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier, Steele filed a defamation suit, first in Florida
state court and then in federal court, against defendants who
criticized his handling of a copyright-infringement suit against
them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said in that suit that if the allegations made against
him were seen in the light of day, they would prompt those who
knew the plaintiffs &#8220;to suggest (or intervene and force)
intensive psychological therapy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He filed a dismissal of that case March 6 without giving
any reason. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That case was John L. Steele v. Paul Godfread, 1:13-cv-20744-JAL, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida
(Miami). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case in which he and the other lawyers were sanctioned
is Ingenuity 13 LLC v. John Doe, 2:12-cv-08333-OLDW, U.S.
District Court, Central District of California (Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Advanced Cyber Attack Tools Seen as Readily Available to Hackers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanced cyber attack tools have become readily available
for use by foreign governments and terrorists to infiltrate or
cripple U.S. computer networks, two federal law enforcement
officials told a congressional panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dozens of countries now have sophisticated cyber espionage
capabilities and terrorists want to &#8216;Joseph Demarest, &#8216;digitally
sabotage&#8221; U.S. power grids or water supply networks, assistant
director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation&#8217;s cyber
division, said in prepared testimony for a Senate hearing
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama and intelligence officials have said
one of their top policy priorities is preventing cyber attacks
that could disrupt banks, telecommunications networks, utilities
or other vital services. Lawmakers have renewed their efforts to
advance cybersecurity legislation after Congress failed last
year to pass a bill. The Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime
and Terrorism held a hearing yesterday on how the government and
private sector are responding to cyber threats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advanced cyber tools that Symantec Inc. has found
recently being used for attacks include large scale data
breaches that last year exposed about 93 million identities,
&#8220;watering hole attacks&#8221; that target visitors to legitimate
websites and the use of an estimated 3.4 million bot zombies
around the world last year, according to the testimony of Cheri
McGuire, Symantec&#8217;s vice president for global affairs and cyber-security policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity threats posed by foreign governments and
terrorist groups against U.S. networks are growing, Jenny
Durkan, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Washington,
said in prepared testimony for the hearing.     &#8220; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help prevent attacks, the Justice Department is
establishing cells of cybersecurity specialists &#8220;to focus on
particular high-priority cyber targets,&#8221; Durkan said. She said
one cell is operational, without providing details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#8217;s been &#8220;an uptick&#8221; in cyber attacks against U.S.
electric companies this year, Carl Herberger, a vice president
for the network security firm Radware Ltd. (RDWR), said in a phone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information-technology systems at three different electric
companies were temporarily knocked off-line by cyber-attacks
this year, said Herberger, whose company is based in Tel-Aviv
with offices in New Jersey. He declined to discuss specifics or
name the companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that groups in
China and Russia are responsible for electronic intrusions into
U.S. computer networks and the theft of intellectual property,
Durkan said. &lt;/p&gt;

Moore and Liam Vaughan" date="May 09, 2013  6:10 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-09/goldman-sachs-traders-lost-money-on-two-days-in-first-quarter.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Traders Lost Money on Two Days in First Quarter</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
generated about half its revenue from trading last quarter,
posted losses from that business on two days in the first three
months of 2013, compared with one day a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s traders made more than $100 million on 17 days
in the quarter ended March 31, compared with 24 days in the
year-earlier period, the New York-based company said in a
regulatory filing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank generated $5.22 billion from its trading division
in the first quarter of 2013, excluding accounting charges, a 12
percent declined from the year-earlier period. About $230
million of that revenue came from a reinsurance business the
firm sold a majority stake in this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clients were &#8220;more active really in the first month of the
quarter and then it slowed down a bit in March,&#8221; Chief
Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said last month. &#8220;As issues
started to come back more on to front screens as it relates to
issues in Europe, clients obviously pulled back toward the end
of the quarter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) had perfect
trading records in the first quarter, making money on every day
of the period, while Morgan Stanley posted losses in eight
sessions. Citigroup Inc. doesn&#8217;t disclose money-losing days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) unit suspended
from market-based power trading in California may be evading the
ban through swap agreements with EDF Group and Cargill Inc.
subsidiaries, the state&#8217;s grid operator said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EDF Trading North America LLC signed a swap agreement with
J.P. Morgan Ventures Energy Corp.&#8217;s BE CA LLC unit for energy
from units at three power plants in California for the six
months that the JPMorgan subsidiary is banned from trading, the
California Independent System Operator Corp. said in a filing to
federal regulators yesterday. Cargill Power Markets LLC has also
acquired control of units at two plants through a swap contract,
the filing shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The units covered by the EDF and Cargill contracts
together comprise the total capacity previously controlled by
JPMVEC and BE CA LLC in California,&#8221; Cal ISO said in the filing
with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. &#8220;There is
precedent for firms using swap contracts to secure a portion of
the profit stream from a unit, while masking the identity of a
party that has some level of control over the bidding.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, was warned by FERC in
March that its personnel and two subsidiaries may face claims
stemming from a probe into bidding practices. FERC revoked J.P.
Morgan Ventures&#8217; right to trade power at market-based rates in
California for six months starting in April, saying the firm
provided misleading information to the ISO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Internal E-Mails &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FERC said in September it had initiated a proceeding
against the energy trading unit focused on whether JPMorgan&#8217;s
energy division met its obligations to give documents to the
ISO. J.P. Morgan Ventures Energy allegedly made bids that
resulted in at least $73 million in improper payments to the
generators, according to FERC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation came to light when the commission went to
court seeking internal e-mails from JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FERC has stepped up scrutiny of corporations as it wields
policing powers that were expanded in the wake of Enron Corp.&#8217;s
2001 collapse. The agency has announced since January 2011 at
least 13 separate investigations of possible market
manipulation, including probes of energy-trading units at
Barclays Plc (BARC) and JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through contracts with EDF and Cargill, JPMorgan could be
bringing in profits during its suspension &#8220;beyond those
contemplated&#8221; by FERC in its order, Cal ISO said. The operator
recommended broad changes that would capture any situation in
which &#8220;a market participant structured transactions to evade
its suspension of market-based rate authority.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan spokeswoman in New York,
declined to comment on the California ISO filing, saying the
company is still reviewing it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deal Approved &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California utility regulators approved a deal yesterday
under which BE CA LLC would give Edison International (EIX)&#8217;s Southern
California Edison unit all of its rights to energy from power-plant units in California beginning Oct. 1, when JPMorgan&#8217;s
trading suspension ends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tolling arrangement, which runs through May 2018,
covers power from 12 natural gas-fired units at the Alamitos,
Huntington Beach and Redondo Beach power plants in the Los
Angeles Basin area with a total capacity of 3,690 megawatts, the
resolution approved by the California Public Utilities
Commission yesterday shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BE CA previously resold some tolling and resource adequacy
rights from the units to Edison, the filing shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate proceeding today, FERC granted an April 10
request from J.P. Morgan Ventures for rehearing on how it&#8217;ll
manage electricity sales in power markets outside California
during its six-month suspension and gave the company 15 days to
file more information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s leading
directors urged shareholders to reject calls for Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon to relinquish his dual role as chairman and
chief executive officer, saying it &#8220;could be disruptive&#8221; and
against the best interests of investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;An inflexible approach to the question of whether one
person can serve as both chairman and CEO is not the right
answer,&#8221; according to a letter today sent to shareholders of
the New York-based company. It was signed by former Exxon Mobil
Corp. Chairman and CEO Lee R. Raymond, who serves as the board&#8217;s
presiding director, and former Johnson  Johnson Chairman and
CEO William C. Weldon, who heads the panel&#8217;s corporate
governance and nominating committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proxy advisers at Glass Lewis  Co. and Institutional
Shareholder Services have told investors to vote for a separate
chairman and oust some directors. Calls for Dimon, 57, to
relinquish the chairmanship have mounted since last May, when
JPMorgan disclosed lapses in risk controls at its chief
investment office in the so-called London Whale episode that led

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest
U.S. lender, opposed splitting Jamie Dimon&#8217;s roles of chairman
and chief executive officer because the change &#8220;could be
disruptive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board is made up of directors who are all independent
other than Dimon and is led by a &#8220;strong&#8221; presiding director,
according to a letter sent today by two directors to
stockholders of the New York-based company. The structure
provides &#8220;appropriate accountability to our shareholders and
counterbalance to the combined CEO/Chair role,&#8221; according to
the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter was written by former Exxon Mobil Corp. Chairman
and CEO Lee R. Raymond, the board&#8217;s presiding director, and
former Johnson  Johnson Chairman and CEO William C. Weldon, the
chairman of JPMorgan&#8217;s corporate governance and nominating
committee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stemcor Holdings Ltd., a London-based
steel trader, hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to advise it on a
debt refinancing and potential asset sales as the company seeks
to repay a $850 million facility that matured this week,
according to three people with knowledge of matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank is advising Stemcor as it discusses with lenders a
so-called standstill agreement, said the people, who asked not
to be identified because the negotiations are private. The steel
trader is seeking an agreement to extend and reduce the size of
the debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company reported a loss last year as turnover fell to
about 5 billion pounds ($7.7 billion) from about 6 billion
pounds a year earlier, according to a statement on its website.
Reduced demand for steel in recession-hit Europe drove down the
prices of hot-rolled coil, a benchmark steel product, 15 percent
in the past year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Armitstead, a London-based Stemcor spokesman who
works for Pendomer Communications LLP, and Goldman Sachs
spokeswoman Joanna Carss declined to comment on the financing or
the bank&#8217;s advisory role. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standstill, under which banks agree not to demand
repayment of the loan for a specified period of time, would also
apply to a one-year $225 million loan raised by Stemcor&#8217;s Asian
unit Stemcor SEA Pte Ltd., one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stemcor was founded in 1951 and the majority of its shares
are held by the Oppenheimer family, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce,

&lt;p&gt;Freeborn will oversee that business from Calgary, the

&lt;p&gt;Freeborn previously led Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Canadian energy

&lt;p&gt;Pain Therapeutics Inc. (PTIE) plunged as
much as 50 percent in its biggest drop ever after Pfizer Inc. (PFE)
said it was reassessing their partnership on the experimental
painkiller Remoxy. A third partner, Durect Corp. (DRRX), also fell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pain Therapeutics tumbled 48 percent to $2.78 at 10:11 a.m.
New York time, after earlier touching $2.67 in its steepest
intraday fall since the shares were first sold in July 2000.
Durect declined 42 percent to 93 cents. The companies said in
regulatory filings today that New York-based Pfizer, the world&#8217;s
biggest drugmaker, was evaluating its plans for Remoxy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medicine is an extended-release oxycodone capsule
formulated to limit abuse. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
postponed approval in June 2011, after a delay in 2008 when the
regulators asked for more laboratory data. In a letter disclosed
by Austin, Texas-based Pain Therapeutics, Pfizer said it doesn&#8217;t
anticipate submitting a response to the FDA before mid-2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given the years of delay, additional cost incurred to
bring the program to this point and development work left in the
program, there will be much to consider,&#8221; Pfizer said in the
letter dated May 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, &#8220;there is a regulatory pathway forward&#8221; for
Remoxy, Pfizer said, citing the FDA&#8217;s comments after a March 28
hearing. Pfizer&#8217;s Remoxy team will recommend to management that
it endorse the program, Alan Litwack, Pfizer&#8217;s vice president
for global commercial development, said in the letter. There
isn&#8217;t &#8220;an exact time frame&#8221; on when a decision will be made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Additional Studies &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer will be &#8220;reaching out to you shortly&#8221; for &#8220;a
confidential discussion relating to contractual terms&#8221; between
the two companies, Litwack wrote to Pain Therapeutics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer believes additional clinical studies will be needed
to win approval, Durect said in its filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew Hogan, chief financial officer for Cupertino,
California-based Durect, and Pain Therapeutics CFO Peter Roddy
didn&#8217;t immediately return messages seeking comment left before
regular business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares rose less than 1 percent to $28.77. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adcock Ingram Holdings Ltd. (AIP), South
Africa&#8217;s largest supplier of hospital products, may gain a
further 12 percent from yesterday&#8217;s 30-month high after it got
takeover offers, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adcock&#8217;s board has received non-binding proposals that
could lead to an offer for the whole company or a controlling
stake, the Johannesburg-based maker of Panado painkillers and
Corenza cold medicine said yesterday. The stock rose 8.9 percent
to 67.50 rand by the close in Johannesburg, its highest level
since November 2010, valuing the company at $1.3 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wording suggests there may be &#8220;multiple bids for the
company,&#8221; JPMorgan analysts Alex Comer and Avinash Kalkapersad
wrote in a note dated yesterday. &#8220;Under this scenario, we
believe the stock could be worth 75.80 rand a share based on
historic transaction multiples and a bid premium.&#8221; That would
value Adcock at about $1.46 billion, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The shares were down 0.4 percent at 67.24 rand by
2:27 p.m. in Johannesburg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approaches probably came from foreign companies as
there are no obvious South African bidders other than Bidvest
Group Ltd. (BVT), which had an offer for a controlling stake in Adcock
rejected in March, Mathew Menezes, an analyst at Avior Research,
said by phone from Johannesburg. The latest proposals aren&#8217;t
from Bidvest, Adcock said in yesterday&#8217;s statement.
Bidvest is still interested in a bid for Adcock and must get the
same information as other bidders, Chief Executive Officer Brian
Joffe said in an e-mailed response to questions today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bid Values &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adcock has had a marketing and distribution agreement with
U.S.-based Merck  Co. (MRK) to sell non-prescription medicines as
well as treatments for high blood pressure since 2010. &#8220;Adcock
would also offer an acquirer a potential launch pad into the
rest of Africa,&#8221; JPMorgan&#8217;s Comer and Kalkapersad said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weakness in the South African rand has also made &#8220;Adcock
more attractive to potential international buyers,&#8221; the
JPMorgan analysts wrote. The rand has declined 6.8 percent
against the dollar this year, the worst performer of 24 emerging
market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adcock shares have gained 6 percent in the past 12 months,
compared with a 72 percent increase at larger competitor Aspen
Pharmacare Holdings Ltd. (APN), 18.2 percent owned by Brentford,
England-based GlaxoSmithKline Plc. (GSK) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Weak Performance &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adcock has fallen behind Aspen because of &#8220;product losses,
a previously weak tender performance, insipid over the counter
markets and a weak rand,&#8221; JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bidvest offered to buy 60 percent of Adcock for about 6.2
billion rand ($685 million) on March 22. The offer was half in
cash, at 65 rand a share, and half in stock at a ratio of one
Bidvest share for every four Adcock shares. The bid values
Adcock at 64.94 a share at current prices, 3.4 percent below the
stock&#8217;s cost today. Bidvest said last month it would take the
offer directly to shareholders in the absence of support from
the board. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ocado Group Plc, (OCDO) the U.K.&#8217;s largest
online-only grocer, jumped to the highest in more than two years
in London trading after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised the
stock to buy, saying sales growth is set to accelerate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares rose as much as 20 percent to 250.3 pence, the
highest price since Feb. 21, 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman analyst Franklin Walding said today that he expects
Ocado to generate 20 percent sales growth in 2017 as the opening
of a second distribution center in central England eases
capacity constraints. He estimates that the company will have an
8 percent share of the U.K. online grocery market by 2030. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ocado&#8217;s online food retail business model has an inherent
advantage relative to traditional peers,&#8221; Walding wrote in a
report. &#8220;Its lower capital intensity means the group can
successfully operate at a lower margin than store-based peers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ocado shares have almost tripled this year on optimism that
the new warehouse will help accelerate sales growth and after
the company said in March it&#8217;s in talks with William Morrison
Supermarkets Plc (MRW) to license some of its Web-shopping technology.
Those discussions are continuing, the company said today in a
statement, adding that its supply agreement with the Waitrose
grocery chain won&#8217;t be affected by the potential tie-up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any agreement with Morrison would be &#8220;complementary to
Ocado&#8217;s existing partnership with Waitrose, which would be
unaffected,&#8221; said the Hatfield, England-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ocado traded at 233.4 pence as of 10:20 a.m., up 12 percent
and valuing the company at 1.4 billion pounds ($2.2 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Morrison Talks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The bounce today is down to Goldman&#8217;s upgrade and the
fact that Ocado is a highly shorted, low liquidity stock, so
even a tiny bit of news has a big impact on the share price,&#8221;
said Andrew Gwynn, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas in London who
has a buy recommendation on the stock. &#8220;That also explains why
the share price has moved so much in recent days.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ocado said March 14 it had started talks with Bradford,
England-based Morrison to support the start of the supermarket
chain&#8217;s online business next year. Any partnership won&#8217;t involve
a takeover or Morrison acquiring a stake, it repeated today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all analysts have a positive opinion on Ocado. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The shares have been squeezed up by the hope that
strategic value could be about to be unlocked by corporate
activity, but the reality is that the strategic value in Ocado
is substantially lower than these unrealistic expectations
anticipate, because it remains a fundamentally flawed model,&#8221;
Philip Dorgan, an analyst at Panmure Gordon, said in a
note today. He maintained a sell recommendation on the shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ocado also said today that sales have continued to rise and
that &#8220;the board is encouraged by the progress of the business
so far this year, and believes the company is well placed to
exploit the fast growth in online grocery retailing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) was sued by
California over claims that the biggest U.S. credit-card lender
pursued lawsuits against defaulted borrowers based on
insufficient evidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From January 2008 to April 2011, JPMorgan filed more than
100,000 debt-collection lawsuits in California, taking illegal
shortcuts to obtain judgments against consumers, Harris claims
in the lawsuit filed yesterday in state court in Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank couldn&#8217;t have won the judgments so quickly if it
had complied with minimum consumer protections under state law,
according to the complaint. Harris said in a statement yesterday
that the suit was filed to end &#8220;widespread, illegal robo-signing&#8221; of court filings without the review of relevant files
or bank records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chase abused the judicial process and engaged in serious
misconduct against California credit-card borrowers,&#8221; Harris
said in the statement. The lawsuit &#8220;seeks to hold Chase
accountable for systematically using illegal tactics to flood
California&#8217;s courts with specious lawsuits against consumers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristin Lemkau, a spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan,
didn&#8217;t immediately  yesterday to phone and e-mail messages
seeking comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint, based on alleged violations of
California&#8217;s unfair competition law, JPMorgan sent letters to
consumers demanding payment of a balance due, claiming they may
be liable for attorney&#8217;s fees, and threatening to garnish income
and place liens on property. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The correspondence is signed by a lawyer, though no lawyer
reviewed the consumer&#8217;s file to determine whether the claims and
amounts due are correct, according to the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is California v. JPMorgan Chase, BC508466,
California Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS). shareholders should vote against the bank&#8217;s executive-pay plan, proxy-advisory firm Glass Lewis  Co. said, while ISS Proxy Advisory Services USA supported the program. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has been &#8220;deficient&#8221; in linking compensation to company performance, Glass Lewis said yesterday in a report, which also opposed the re-election of compensation committee Chairman James A. Johnson. ISS said in a May 8 report that shareholders should vote for Johnson at the New York-based bank&#8217;s May 23 annual meeting. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 58, received $21 million for last year, his highest annual compensation package since 2007. Goldman Sachs shares climbed 41 percent in 2012, leaving them 24 percent below the level at which they ended 2010. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs doesn&#8217;t have specific measures to help set annual pay for top executives, Glass Lewis said in the report, which gave the firm a &#8220;D&#8221; grade in linking pay to performance. ISS said the increase in executive pay for 2012 reflected stronger company performance. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the bank has topped peers in earnings-per-share growth and return on equity, it has trailed in total shareholder return, according to Glass Lewis&#8217;s analysis. Glass Lewis recommended last year that shareholders back the pay plan in an advisory vote, and the measure was approved with 94 percent support. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM),  the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, said it will face enforcement action from
federal regulators over its collection practices and add-on
products commonly appended to credit cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said in a May 8 regulatory filing that it
&#8220;expects that its banking supervisors will in the future continue
to take more formal enforcement actions against the firm,&#8221;
instead of &#8220;issuing informal supervisory actions or criticisms.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is conducting
an industrywide review of credit card add-on products, which can
include debt cancellation and identity theft services. New York-based JPMorgan cited an identity theft product in its filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks including JPMorgan and Bank of America Corp. stopped
offering such add-on products entirely in the face of regulatory
scrutiny. The bureau&#8217;s first enforcement action was against
Capital One Financial Corp. (COF), which paid about $210 million in
restitution and penalties over the products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Hartwick, a JPMorgan spokesman, said the bank had no
comment on the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets and deposits, is
facing regulatory inquiries on its trading practices and conduct
in the energy business. Shareholders are also considering at
their May 21 meeting whether to separate the chairman and chief
executive officer role, both currently held by Jamie Dimon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arcapita Bank BSC, an Islamic-compliant fund manager, will consider a revised offer for a
bankruptcy-exit loan from Fortress Credit Corp. to compete with
a proposal from Goldman Sachs International. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both loan offers of $350 million would fund Arcapita&#8217;s exit
from Chapter 11 protection, Fortress said in papers filed today
in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. Fortress said it had been
in talks since last year to provide an exit loan to Arcapita and
was disappointed that the company and its creditors&#8217; committee
chose the Goldman Sachs offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is unclear to Fortress why both the debtors and the
committee have lent their support to the GSI proposal,&#8221;
Fortress said in its filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortress, which is also an agent to Arcapita&#8217;s bankruptcy
operating loan, said that the Goldman Sachs proposal may have
been influenced by a conflict of interest and might allow some
unsecured creditors, including members of the creditors&#8217;
committee, to improve their positions in Arcapita&#8217;s capital
structure relative to other unsecured creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arcapita and its creditors will &#8220;seek approval of the best
exit facility proposal, whether that proposal comes from
Fortress or GSI,&#8221; Fortress said. A hearing is set for May 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Fees &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortress said its revised offer would fund Arcapita&#8217;s exit
at a better price, doesn&#8217;t include administrative fees, and
won&#8217;t make Arcapita pay if it enters into an alternative
transaction. Fortress also would allow Arcapita keep as much as
$30 million in sale proceeds, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arcapita, based in Manama, Bahrain, filed for Chapter 11
protection in March 2012 after being unable to complete an out-of-court restructuring of $1.1 billion in unsecured debt. It
listed assets of $3.06 billion and debt of $2.55 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When its bankruptcy began, Arcapita had interests in 39
companies, and $7 billion in assets under management. Arcapita
has minority interests in 80 percent of its investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Arcapita Bank BSC, 12-bk-11076, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The head of the Cayman Islands
financial services industry trade group rejected charges from
economist Jeffrey Sachs that the Caribbean nation&#8217;s oversight of
hedge funds and banks is a &#8220;mortal threat&#8221; to the global
economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sachs, in separate letters to the Financial Times the past
two weeks, said some residents of the island nation sit on
hundreds of fund boards, limiting their ability to provide
oversight. He also said the Cayman banking system has $1.4
trillion in liabilities and assets, citing data from the Bank
for International Settlements. The system is a &#8220;house of
cards&#8221; for the global financial system, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Professor Sachs needs to understand that a significant
part of the banking assets registered in Cayman are U.S. banks
placing overnight deposits in their own Cayman-registered
branch,&#8221; Cayman Finance Chief Executive Officer Gonzalo Jalles
said in an e-mailed statement May 8. &#8220;The money is effectively
being transferred between accounts in New York and not being
exposed to how a local banker in Cayman decides to invest it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cayman Islands, a British Overseas Territory located
south of Cuba, has the highest number of hedge funds in the
Caribbean. About 10,900 funds were registered there in the first
quarter, up from about 9,990 in 2011, according to the Cayman
Islands Monetary Authority. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lender&#8217;s market value would likely drop by about $20
billion if shareholders vote on May 21 to strip Dimon of his
chairman role and he leaves as some analysts predict, Mayo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock would suffer because the New York-based bank has
no obvious successor to Dimon, 57, who is top-ranked among large
bank CEOs, Mayo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan declined 0.2 percent to $48.85 at 10:42 a.m. in
New York. The shares have gained 11 percent this year, compared
with the 14 percent advance of the 24-company KBW Bank Index. (BKX) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parsvnath Developers Ltd. (PARSV), an Indian
builder that counts JPMorgan Chase  Co. among project
investors, says sales growth is rebounding after four quarters
of declines, as rate cuts this year help revive the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real-estate company, which has 190 million square feet
of land, is introducing new plans for buyers to sweeten offers
and &#8220;aggressively&#8221; selling units to double sales this quarter
as demand picks up in the world&#8217;s second-most populous country,
Chairman Pradeep Jain said in an interview. Quarterly group
revenue of Parsvnath slid an average 26 percent in 2012,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The overall economic situation isn&#8217;t very great but is
recovering,&#8221; Jain said in New Delhi, where Parsvnath is based.
&#8220;End-user demand is good, particularly in Delhi and surrounding
areas. You can see growth in sales from the current quarter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s central bank has lowered borrowing costs three
times in 2013, kindling optimism the property market will snap
out of a slowdown that propelled unsold homes to a record in the
final quarter of last year. Growth in the $1.8 trillion economy,
Asia&#8217;s third biggest, is set to accelerate from an estimated 5
percent in the 12 months ended March 31, the least in a decade,
according to government estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Share Slump &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Parsvnath have dropped 37 percent in the past
year, making it the worst performing stock in the SP BSE India
Realty Index. DLF Ltd. (DLFU), India&#8217;s biggest developer whose market
value of 403 billion rupees ($7.4 billion) is 26 times that of
Jain&#8217;s company, has gained 24 percent in the period. The
benchmark SP BSE Sensex index has climbed 21 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s private-equity unit had paid 2.6 billion rupees
in December, 2010 for a 22 percent stake at Parsvnath&#8217;s La
Tropicana residential project in the nation&#8217;s capital, according
to Jain, while Sun-Apollo Ventures LLC and Red Fort Capital are
other funds that have invested in its other projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parsvnath has introduced a plan that allows buyers to pay
25 percent of the property&#8217;s cost on booking, and the rest while
taking possession with no extra cost built in and no loans
involved. The offer, which Jain said will lure buyers and boost
profit, is for four commercial and 16 residential projects
across India. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a very risky move for a developer, especially if it
is a falling property market,&#8221; said Parikshit Kandpal, a
Mumbai-based analyst at Karvy Stock Broking Ltd. &#8220;The risk is
entirely on the developer as there&#8217;s no customer&#8217;s bank loan to
back up the sale.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Most Expensive &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home prices in Mumbai, India&#8217;s most expensive real estate
market, rose to a record high of 11,626 rupees a square foot in
the quarter ended March 31, according to data from Liases Foras
Real Estate Rating  Research Pvt., driven by speculation demand
will pick up. In the capital region, where Parsvnath operates,
prices have risen 21 percent since June 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the previous quarter, the stock of unsold homes at new
residential projects climbed to a record, as rising prices
crimped affordability in the nation&#8217;s biggest cities, according
to Pankaj Kapoor, founder of property research company Liases.
Total unsold inventory of residential stock in the six major
cities tracked by Liases Foras climbed to 100 million square
feet (9.3 million square meters), the highest since 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest rates, which are still near a two-year high, and a
cultural aversion to debt account for India&#8217;s relatively low
home-loan penetration rates. Home loan debt of $104 billion is
equal to 8 percent of gross domestic product compared with 20
percent in China and 77 percent in the U.S., according to data
compiled by Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Worst Is Over &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian mortgage rates, at 10 percent on average, are among
the highest in Asia. That compares with about 2 percent in Hong
Kong, 6.5 percent in China, and 6 percent in South Korea,
according to Credit Suisse Group AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst for the industry is over, Jain said separately on
May 9, adding the environment is &#8220;changing for the better.&#8221;
Prices may increase as much as 18 percent annually, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real-estate stocks in India are looking more attractive as
borrowing costs decline and demand for homes support property
prices, according to CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets. The 11-member
SP BSE India Realty Index has rebounded 9 percent from a five-month low reached on April 9. It is still 18 percent lower than
its 21-month high reached on Jan. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Residential volumes continued to hold up in the first
quarter of 2013,&#8221; Mahesh Nandurkar and Abhinav Sinha, Mumbai-based analysts at CLSA, wrote in a note to clients on April 17.
&#8220;With residential volumes holding well and chances of interest-rate cuts increasing, property stocks are offering attractive
entry points.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rate Cuts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Merrill Lynch predicts the Reserve Bank of
India will extend its rate reductions with four more for a total
of 1 percentage point through the end of March. Governor Duvvuri Subbarao lowered the benchmark repurchase rate in March and May,
both times signaling there&#8217;s little space for further cuts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales volumes have picked up in some markets with signs of
an economic revival and a rebound in stocks, according to
Karvy&#8217;s Kandpal. Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram last
month predicted growth of as much as 6.7 percent in the year
that started April 1, from an estimated 5 percent in the
previous 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the earlier part of the past 12 months, many issues
with the sector caused &#8220;a massive underperformance of listed
realty stock,&#8221; Kandpal wrote in a research note last month.
&#8220;There&#8217;s been a marked shift during the latter part of the last
six months.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barbara Walters, the first woman to
co-anchor a network evening newscast, will retire in 2014 after
one more year on ABC News and her talk show, &#8220;The View.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walters will make the announcement today on &#8220;The View,&#8221;
the daytime program she created in 1997, Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s ABC
said on its website. She will report and anchor for the news
division and appear on &#8220;The View&#8221; until next summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABC plans to honor the groundbreaking newscaster with a
career retrospective next May. Walters started at NBC&#8217;s &#8220;Today
Show&#8221; in 1961 and rose to become co-anchor, with Harry Reasoner, of &#8220;ABC Evening News&#8221; in 1976. Walters has
interviewed every U.S. president and first lady since Richard Nixon, ABC News said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walters, 81, is a co-host of &#8220;The View,&#8221; where she will
continue as executive producer. She will anchor ABC News
specials over the next 12 months including a &#8220;20 Years of 10
Most Fascinating People&#8221; special in December and an Oscars
special. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Walters announcement comes as ABC and other networks
present their fall prime-time lineups to advertisers this week
in New York. ABC releases its schedule this week. NBC said
yesterday it will bring back Michael J. Fox in a comedy on
Thursday nights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walters became nationally known as a television personality
on the &#8220;Today&#8221; show in the 1960s, eventually becoming co-host
of the program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Begin, Sadat &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years she interviewed Russia&#8217;s Boris Yeltsin,
China&#8217;s Jiang Zemin, former U.K. prime minister Margaret Thatcher, Libya&#8217;s Muammar Qaddafi and Iraq&#8217;s Saddam Hussein,
according to her biography. She crossed the Bay of Pigs with
Cuba&#8217;s Fidel Castro, ABC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1977, Walters was the first journalist to arrange a
joint interview with Egypt President Anwar Sadat and Israeli
Prime Minister Menachem Begin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter&#8217;s 1999 interview with Monica Lewinsky, the first one
granted to TV by the former Clinton White House intern, remains
the highest-rated news program aired by a single network,
according to the biography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was also the first American journalist to interview
Russia&#8217;s President Vladimir Putin and scored the first interview
with President George W. Bush and first lady Laura Bush after
the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 2004, after 25 years as co-host and chief
correspondent for ABC News&#8217; &#8220;20/20,&#8221; Walters left the show to
focus on &#8220;Barbara Walters Specials.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, gained 0.8 percent to
$67.20 on May 10 in New York, an all-time high. The stock has
advanced 35 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Juan Pablo Spinetto, Rodrigo Orihuela and David Biller" date="May 14, 2013 11:00 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-14/batista-s-ogx-joins-exxon-to-win-brazil-oil-blocks-shares-rally.html"><headline>Batista&#8217;s OGX Joins Exxon to Win Brazil Offshore Blocks</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s most
valuable oil producer, teamed up with billionaire Eike Batista
to search in Brazilian waters as the country raised a record
amount in its first oil bidding round in five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A partnership between the Irving, Texas-based company,
which failed to make major discoveries in previous exploration
efforts in Brazil, and Batista&#8217;s OGX Petroleo  Gas
Participacoes SA won rights for one offshore block in the
Potiguar basin and another in Ceara. The so-called Round 11
auction staged by regulator ANP yesterday also saw BP Plc (BP/) and
Total SA, Europe&#8217;s biggest producers after Royal Dutch Shell
Plc (RDSA), win licenses off Amapa state in the largest single bid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil, home to the biggest crude discovery in the Americas
in more than 30 years, raised a record 2.8 billion reais ($1.4
billion) by selling licenses at 142 of the 289 blocks for sale.
Exxon returns to the country while Total expands into the Foz do
Amazonas basin bordering French Guiana and BG Group Plc becomes
an operator for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The competition was stronger than I expected,&#8221; Joao Carlos de Luca, the head of the Brazilian Oil Institute, told
reporters in Rio de Janeiro. &#8220;We have great new operators in
the country. The return of Exxon is an important factor.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s first sale of oil permits since 2008 will give
Exxon a chance to resume exploration in the country after it
drilled dry holes and returned a license last year in the so-called pre-salt region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, which also explored Foz de Amazonas in 2001 and
2002, will have a 50 percent interest in the two new blocks it
won with OGX and will operate both, spokesman Patrick McGinn
said by telephone, declining to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Investment Plan &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 30 winning companies will invest a minimum of 6.9
billion reais to develop the areas that span 11 sedimentary
basins on land and off the coast of north and northeastern
Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A partnership between Total, BP and state-run Petroleo
Brasileiro SA made the largest single bid of 346 million reais
for the FZA-M-57 block in deep waters of Foz do Amazonas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The super consortium that took shape for the equatorial
margin is Total, BP and Petrobras,&#8221; de Luca said, noting that
Total will operate the block. &#8220;Petrobras teaming up with other
companies is very good for the sector.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Acted Aggressively&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batista&#8217;s OGX, the Rio de Janeiro-based company that lost
87 percent of its market value in the past year, also won
licenses for 10 blocks in five basins bidding without partners
and an additional 30 percent stake in a block together with
Total and QGEP Participacoes SA. (QGEP3) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OGX is taking on new exploration projects even as the
company sells stakes in fields, reduces staff and cuts costs
after losing investor confidence amid missed production targets.
Brazil&#8217;s worst-performing stock last year has plunged an
additional 60 percent this year after lower-than-expected output
rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OGX agreed to pay 377 million reais for the exploration
licenses, including its share in blocks won with partners,
according to ANP data. The company missed out on rights in four
other blocks where offers were presented in conjunction with
Exxon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Once again the company acted aggressively, which is a
characteristic of OGX and of Eike Batista,&#8221; Adriano Pires, the
head of the Brazilian Center for Infrastructure, a consulting
firm in Rio de Janeiro, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;Nobody
expected that given the complicated situation the company is
having lately. They took onshore and offshore blocks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;China Absence &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OGX Chief Executive Officer Luiz Carneiro, present at the
auction event, declined to comment. OGX shares rose 5.4 percent
to 1.76 reais at the close in Sao Paulo yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winners of the auction, held at a Rio hotel, also included
Brazilian startup Ouro Preto Oleo  Gas SA and Colombia&#8217;s
Ecopetrol SA. (ECOPETL) Chief oil regulator Magda Chambriard told
reporters she was surprised by a lack of bids from Chinese
companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP and Total agreed to pay 621.5 million reais for the
offshore Amazon basin concessions. BHP Billiton Ltd. won bidding
for two blocks in the same basin, the Melbourne-based mining
company&#8217;s first oil assets in Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the areas auctioned yesterday are in virgin waters
off the coast of northeastern Brazil where discoveries in
similar geology across the Atlantic in Ghana and Ivory Coast
yielded major discoveries. Tullow Oil Plc in 2011 sparked
interest in the region with the Zaedyus find off the coast of
French Guiana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The bidding has been aggressive,&#8221; Thore Kristiansen,
head of Statoil ASA in Brazil, told reporters after the
Stavanger-based company won blocks in ventures with Petrobras
and Total. &#8220;The bidding has shown it&#8217;s been five years since
the last auction. There&#8217;s an industry willing to take risks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) will become the first
major oil company to partner with YPF SA to develop shale oil
and a final deal is expected in July, YPF said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miguel Galuccio, chief executive officer of YPF, and Ali Moshiri, Chevron&#8217;s head of Latin America, Middle East and
Africa, visited the Patagonia shale formation today and met with
Neuquen&#8217;s governor Jorge Sapag, according to an e-mailed
statement today from the Buenos Aires-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim Craig, a spokesman for San Ramon, California-based
Chevron, didn&#8217;t immediately replied to a call and an e-mail
seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moshiri, who in December signed with Galuccio an exclusive
right to negotiate final terms for YPF to transfer a 50 percent
interest in Loma de la Lata Norte and Loma Campana, was
&#8220;surprised&#8221; with the advanced state of YPF exploration
projects, according to the statement. The fields for the $1.5
billion joint venture comprise an area of 290 square kilometers
(180 miles) in southwestern Argentina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Along with Chevron, we will constitute the first joint
venture to develop shale,&#8221; Galuccio said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YPF is pumping 7,000 barrels a day, according to the e-mailed press release. Vaca Muerta, which means &#8220;dead cow&#8221; in
Spanish, holds at least 23 billion barrels of oil equivalent,
according to a report by independent auditor Ryder Scott
released in February 2012 by YPF. Argentina holds the world&#8217;s
third-largest shale gas reserves, according to US Energy
Administration data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lone Pine Capital LLC bought Virgin
Media Inc. (VMED) and HR Block Inc. in the first quarter, while
cutting its holdings in Walt Disney Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lone Pine, run by Stephen Mandel Jr., purchased 5.66
million shares of New York-based Virgin Media and 6.75 million
shares of Kansas City, Missouri-based tax preparer HR Block,
the firm said today in a filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lone Pine, based in Greenwich, Connecticut, sold its entire

to the Form 13F filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money managers who oversee more than $100 million in

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s ABC network, ranked
last among the TV viewers that advertisers target, will add five
comedies and seven dramas to its schedule, including a show
based on the secret agency from Marvel&#8217;s &#8220;Avengers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Marvel&#8217;s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,&#8221; from producer Joss Whedon, will air on Tuesdays at 8 p.m., ABC said today in an e-mailed statement. The network and other broadcasters are showing
their new lineups to advertisers this week in an annual event
known as the &#8220;upfronts.&#8221; (See schedule below) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The action series marks an effort by the network to draw
more young male viewers, an elusive group on broadcast TV, to a
schedule that skews more toward women with &#8220;Grey&#8217;s Anatomy&#8221;
and &#8220;Nashville.&#8221; It&#8217;s also leveraging the highly successful
films based on Marvel superheroes, such as Iron Man. Including a
reality series, ABC unveiled 13 new programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That should work better at getting younger male
viewers,&#8221; said Brad Adgate, director of research at New York
advertising company Horizon Media Inc. &#8220;The network has very
little live sports, which has hindered its ability to become a
destination for male viewers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 65 percent of ABC&#8217;s viewers are female, Adgate said,
citing Nielsen data. The average age of ABC&#8217;s viewers is about
53, second oldest to CBS, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, also owner of ESPN, gained 0.2 percent to $67.47 at
the close in New York. Shares of the Burbank, California-based
company have climbed 36 percent this year, compared with 16
percent for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Upscale Women &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &#8220;S.H.I.E.L.D,&#8221; Clark Gregg reprises the role of Agent
Phil Coulson from the Marvel films. He assembles a group of
agents who protect the public from strange occurrences around
the world. The timeslot would pit the show against CBS (CBS)&#8217;s
&#8220;NCIS,&#8221; the most-watched drama on television. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our job is to be inclusive,&#8221; Paul Lee, president of the
ABC Entertainment Group, told reporters on a conference call.
&#8220;We are a big, broad network that does over deliver on upscale
audience and does over deliver on upscale women.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the new season, &#8220;Dancing with the Stars&#8221; will air
its performance and results shows in a single two-hour block on
Mondays. On Tuesdays, starting with &#8220;S.H.I.E.L.D.,&#8221; ABC plans
all new programs. Networks regularly schedule new shows after a
well-established program to draw viewers. That practice is
changing due to DVRs, Lee said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Lead-in does matter and it is important,&#8221; Lee said. &#8220;It
is at times compromised by huge DVR viewing from the previous
show. We put on shows and started off with shows we knew we
loved and that we would get behind and market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Women&#8217;s Empowerment &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &#8220;Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,&#8221; a spinoff of
&#8220;Once Upon a Time,&#8221; ABC creates an all-drama Thursday night
that includes &#8220;Grey&#8217;s Anatomy&#8221; and &#8220;Scandal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &#8220;Wonderland,&#8221; set in Victorian England, Sophie Lowe
plays Alice telling stories of a strange new land on the other
side of a rabbit hole. The network &#8220;built a night of women&#8217;s
empowerment,&#8221; Lee said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other dramas to be added this year will include &#8220;Lucky 7&#8221;
on Tuesdays and &#8220;Betrayal&#8221; on Sundays. ABC&#8217;s four September
comedies include &#8220;The Goldbergs,&#8221; &#8220;Trophy Wife,&#8221; &#8220;Back in
the Game,&#8221; and &#8220;Super Fun Night,&#8221; the network said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABC ordered a reality series called &#8220;The Quest,&#8221; from the
producers of &#8220;The Lord of the Rings&#8221; movies and &#8220;The Amazing
Race&#8221; TV show, according to the statement. In the show, 12
contestants face challenges in a fantasy world with mythical
creatures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network also ordered &#8220;Toy Story of Terror,&#8221; a
Halloween special from Disney&#8217;s Pixar animation studio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Lineups &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABC ranks last in the 18-to-49-year-old demographic group

the season through May 12, Nielsen data show. The network is
second in total viewers behind CBS, averaging 7.8 million
viewers a night, down 6.5 percent from a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. TV networks are introducing new shows ahead of
meetings with their biggest advertisers to obtain commitments
and set ad rates for the TV season that begins in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NBC, which announced its schedule on May 12, picked up
three dramas and three comedies, including &#8220;The Michael J. Fox
Show.&#8221; News Corp. (NWSA)&#8217;s Fox said yesterday it will add nine
programs, including the comedy &#8220;Dads&#8221; from Seth MacFarlane and
the drama &#8220;Almost Human&#8221; from &#8220;Star Trek&#8221; producer J.J. Abrams. CBS plans to announce its new shows tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ad spending on network television is projected to decline 2
percent this year to $16.9 billion, and total TV advertising,
including cable networks, will increase 2.8 percent to $63.9
billion, slowing from 7.1 percent in 2012, according to
ZenithOptimedia, Publicis Groupe SA (PUB)&#8217;s research division. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) sold $31
million of 15-year callable step-up notes, the second-largest
such offering in the U.S. this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The securities, issued May 8, yield 3.25 percent for the
first eight years, then increase five more times to 7.5 percent
for the last year, according to a prospectus filed with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. The New York bank and
Incapital LLC distributed the notes for a 3.24 percent fee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank has the option to call the notes quarterly
starting Nov. 13, according to the prospectus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs sold $42 million of 15-year callable step-up
notes in two related offerings on Feb. 19 and 25, the biggest
such deal this year. The securities yield 3.5 percent annually
for the first eight years, then increase four times to 7.5
percent during the last six months, according to a prospectus
filed with the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has issued the most rate-tied notes in the
U.S. this year, $418.9 million, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The bank was also No. 1 for all of 2012, selling
$1.14 billion of the securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiffany Galvin, a company spokeswoman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) won
dismissal of bond insurer ACA Financial Guaranty Corp.&#8217;s fraud
lawsuit over a collateralized debt obligation known as Abacus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A New York state appeals court in Manhattan today ordered
the complaint against Goldman Sachs dismissed, overturning a
lower-court ruling that had allowed the case to proceed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACA claimed that New York-based Goldman Sachs and hedge-fund firm Paulson  Co. conspired to induce ACA to provide
financial guaranty insurance for the Abacus transaction and
deceived the insurer into believing Paulson was a long investor
when in fact it was taking a short position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court said ACA could have uncovered Paulson&#8217;s
actual position, &#8220;but apparently chose not to.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Plaintiff should have questioned defendant or the non-party hedge fund,&#8221; the court said. &#8220;Such an inquiry would have
likely informed plaintiff that the nonparty hedge fund was
taking a short rather than a long equity position.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACA added New York-based Paulson as a defendant in the
lawsuit this year. A court has yet to rule on the hedge fund&#8217;s
motion to dismiss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc Kasowitz, an attorney for New York-based ACA, said his
client may ask the divided appellate panel to reconsider the
decision and would pursue an appeal to the state&#8217;s highest court
in Albany. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Two-Judge Dissent&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As the two-judge dissent makes clear, the three-judge
majority&#8217;s line of reasoning neither comports with the factual
record nor the law on this issue,&#8221; Kasowitz said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs in July 2010 won court approval of a
$550 million settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission over claims that it misled investors in the Abacus
CDO. Goldman Sachs failed to disclose Paulson&#8217;s role in
selecting underlying securities or that Paulson had taken a
short position against the CDO, according to the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank didn&#8217;t admit or deny wrongdoing in the SEC
settlement. It acknowledged that it made a &#8220;mistake&#8221; and that
marketing materials for the instruments had &#8220;incomplete
information,&#8221; the agency said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is ACA Financial Guaranty Corp. v. Goldman Sachs 
Co., 650027-2011, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vector Commodity Management LLP&#8217;s
assets under management slumped 86 percent this year after
losing money since 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The energy hedge fund run by former Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. trader Gilbert Saiz managed $43 million by the end of
April, according to a letter to investors obtained by Bloomberg
News. Its December statement showed assets of $318 million.
Vector&#8217;s trading of mainly crude and oil products resulted in a
4.9 percent loss from January through April, the letter showed.
A Vector executive in London, who asked not to be named in line
with company policy, declined to comment by phone today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodity hedge funds have struggled to turn a profit in
recent years as global economic and political developments
whipsawed markets. Hedge funds tracked by the Newedge Commodity
Trading Index lost an average 0.5 percent in the first four
months and 1.1 percent in April alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It has been an extremely difficult year for oil
traders,&#8221; Stephen Schork, president of the Schork Group, said
by phone from Villanova, Pennsylvania. &#8220;A lot of investment has
been finding its way into commodity funds on the long side, and
the economic realities of not enough demand and too much supply
have caught a lot of these funds off guard.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s revenue from
its markets businesses, which include trading of bonds and
equities, is about 10 percent to 15 percent greater so far this
quarter than the year-earlier period, a senior executive said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Cavanagh, co-head of JPMorgan&#8217;s corporate and
investment bank, made the remark at a conference in New York
hosted by UBS AG (UBSN), according to a transcript. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from markets businesses are &#8220;running about 10
percent to 15 percent higher than the second quarter of 2012,&#8221;
he said. The revenue is &#8220;still down a bit from the typically
strong first quarter that we just had.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street banks&#8217; trading units usually generate their
greatest profits in the first quarter, in part because
corporations raise more debt at the beginning of the year,
stoking fixed-income operations. A jump in second-quarter
trading earnings from a year earlier would mark a turnaround for
JPMorgan after revenue from that business slipped 5.4 percent in
2013&#8217;s first three months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, rose 1.4 percent
to $50.38 at 11:08 a.m. in New York. The stock has climbed 15
percent so far this year, compared with a 16 percent advance in
the 24-company KBW Bank Index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe Ltd. plans to
&#8220;significantly&#8221; reduce the fees it sets for processing cross-border credit-card payments in a bid to allay European Union
competition concerns, the bloc&#8217;s antitrust watchdog said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe&#8217;s offer would bring its fees in line with those
of its main competitor MasterCard Inc. (MA), the European Commission
said today. The operator of the EU&#8217;s largest payment-card
network also committed to overhaul its rules so that banks will
be able to apply a reduced cross-border interbank fee when they
compete for clients cross-border. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It will put at the same level the fees that are used by
MasterCard and by Visa and this will allow cheaper use of cards
that are a payment system used in almost half of our total
payments in the EU,&#8221; Joaquin Almunia, the EU&#8217;s antitrust
commissioner, said in a video statement. Visa Europe&#8217;s offer
will mean &#8220;the two big credit and debit card companies&#8221; can&#8217;t
use &#8220;their market position to have extra profits.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe proposed to reduce by 40 percent to 60 percent
its so-called interbank fees for credit-card payments to a level
of 0.3 percent of the value of the transaction for cross-border
and domestic transactions, the commission said. The remedies
would last for four years. Visa Europe was sent a formal
complaint over the levies last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Market Test &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almunia said antitrust officials will carry out a so-called
market test with industry groups before deciding to make the
commitments legally binding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Merchants will now be able to benefit from centralizing
their acquiring in one place, which will bring benefits to the
European economy as a whole,&#8221; said Ruth Milligan, senior
adviser on payments at EuroCommerce, a group representing EU
retailers including Carrefour SA (CA) and Ikea Group. Acquiring banks
are those that process card payments on behalf of shops and
traders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have long argued that the card scheme&#8217;s rule on cross-border acquiring were wholly contrary to single market
principles and are delighted to see them go,&#8221; said Milligan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MasterCard in 2009 in a settlement with the Brussels-based EU regulator agreed to similar fee changes to avoid a
daily penalty of as much as 3.5 percent of sales. MasterCard is
appealing that decision at the EU courts in Luxembourg. Last
month, the EU said it is probing MasterCard&#8217;s bank fees on
foreign card payments such as when tourists go shopping in the
27-nation bloc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inflate Costs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe&#8217;s so-called multilateral interchange fees
&#8220;harm competition between acquiring banks, inflate the cost of
payment card acceptance for merchants and ultimately increase
consumer prices,&#8221; the commission said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An earlier probe into Visa Europe&#8217;s fees for debit-card
payments made outside a user&#8217;s home country was settled in 2011.
The company split from Visa Inc. (V) before the U.S. card company&#8217;s
initial public offering in early 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Today&#8217;s outcome is the result of constructive dialogue
between Visa Europe and the European Commission and is in line
with the level of 0.3 percent established in the industry,&#8221;
Peter Ayliffe, Visa Europe&#8217;s chief executive officer, said in an
e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restrictions on Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s
Pegasus crude oil pipeline, shut since March 29 after a spill,
remain in place after the company requested changes in a hearing
held on May 2, according to a filing from federal regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon told the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety
Administration that a 211-mile (340-kilometer) southern section
of the pipeline presented less risk because it was constructed
more recently than the northern leg that spilled about 5,000
barrels of oil near Mayflower, Arkansas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulators pointed out at the hearing that the newer
section, built in 1954, and had a seam failure during a prior
hydrostatic test, according to a decision from Jeffrey Wiese,
associate administrator for pipeline safety. The corrective
action order preventing the line&#8217;s restart was kept in place,
with modifications to future limitations on pressure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 30, Exxon found a second leak on Pegasus in
Doniphan, Missouri. The shutdown of the line, which delivers
about 96,000 barrels a day to Gulf Coast refineries from Patoka,
Illinois, helped back up oil supplies in the central U.S. Exxon
hasn&#8217;t provided a timeline for restarting Pegasus or filed a
plan with federal regulators to return it to service. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elliott Management Corp. built a
$44.2 million position in JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) during the first
quarter even as the hedge-fund company&#8217;s founder said it was
impossible to determine how risky financial institutions are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stake was part of an option-related volatility trading
position that Elliott no longer owns and wasn&#8217;t a bet on the
bank itself, according to a person familiar with the strategy
who asked for anonymity because he wasn&#8217;t authorized to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, was Elliott
Management&#8217;s second-biggest new purchase by market value during
the three months ended March 31, according to a regulatory
filing today. The hedge-fund company bought 931,069 shares of
New York-based JPMorgan, according to the filing. The biggest
new buy was 2.88 million shares of Virgin Media Inc. (VMED) valued at
$141.2 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Singer, Elliott&#8217;s billionaire president, provoked a
testy response from Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan&#8217;s chairman and chief
executive officer, when he criticized the opacity and leverage
in the global financial system as the two participated in a
panel discussion about banking regulation at the World Economic
Forum in Davos, Switzerland, during late January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;One doesn&#8217;t know from disclosures, and one can&#8217;t find out
from disclosures, whether each of the very large global
financial institutions are actually risky or sound,&#8221; Singer
said at the panel, which was broadcast on CNBC. Dimon, 57,
responded by describing some of the bank&#8217;s disclosures and
telling Singer that &#8220;hedge funds are pretty opaque, too.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stock Advances &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has gained 16 percent so far this year, in line
with the performance of the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index and the
Dow Jones Industrial Average, of which JPMorgan is one of 30
components. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singer also advocated separating trading businesses from
banks funded with federally guaranteed deposits as &#8220;extremely
useful in normalizing the financial system.&#8221; Dimon, whose bank
had $1.2 trillion of deposits at the end of March as well as
Wall Street&#8217;s biggest trading business by revenue, has said that
big, diverse banks like JPMorgan help the economy grow and can
be sources of financial stability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At an investor conference in New York last week, Singer
made it clear that his views on banks haven&#8217;t changed since he
spoke in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Four and a half years after the crisis, banks are
opaque,&#8221; Singer said on May 8 at the Sohn Investment
Conference. &#8220;The financial system is highly leveraged and
opaque.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;George Soros&#8217;s Soros Fund Management
LLC added to its stake in Google Inc. (GOOG) in the first quarter while
cutting its holding of Apple Inc. (AAPL) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund added 148,531 shares of Google in the quarter,
bringing its total to 337,271 shares, according to a filing
today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The
firm&#8217;s stake in the Mountain View, California-based company was
valued at $267.9 million at the end of March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm, a family office for the billionaire, sold its
position in JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), valued at $113 million at the
end of last year, according to the filing with the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soros Fund Management reduced its stake in Apple by 157,176
shares to 26,800 shares valued at $11.9 million, according to
the filing. Apple declined 17 percent in the first three months
of the year, even as U.S. stocks added 10 percent, on signs that
sales growth for the iPhone is slowing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soros also cut its holding in American International Group
Inc. by two-thirds in the quarter amid a share rally. The firm
still owns 2.89 million shares of the company, worth $112
million at the end of March. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s most
valuable oil producer, teamed up with billionaire Eike Batista
to search in Brazilian waters as the country raised a record
amount in its first oil bidding round in five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A partnership between the Irving, Texas-based company,
which failed to make major discoveries in previous exploration
efforts in Brazil, and Batista&#8217;s OGX Petroleo  Gas
Participacoes SA won rights for one offshore block in the
Potiguar basin and another in Ceara. The so-called Round 11
auction staged by regulator ANP yesterday also saw BP Plc (BP/) and
Total SA, Europe&#8217;s biggest producers after Royal Dutch Shell
Plc (RDSA), win licenses off Amapa state in the largest single bid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil, home to the biggest crude discovery in the Americas
in more than 30 years, raised a record 2.8 billion reais ($1.4
billion) by selling licenses at 142 of the 289 blocks for sale.
Exxon returns to the country while Total expands into the Foz do
Amazonas basin bordering French Guiana and BG Group Plc becomes
an operator for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The competition was stronger than I expected,&#8221; Joao Carlos de Luca, the head of the Brazilian Oil Institute, told
reporters in Rio de Janeiro. &#8220;We have great new operators in
the country. The return of Exxon is an important factor.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s first sale of oil permits since 2008 will give
Exxon a chance to resume exploration in the country after it
drilled dry holes and returned a license last year in the so-called pre-salt region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Investment Plan &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, which also explored Foz de Amazonas in 2001 and
2002, will have a 50 percent interest in the two new blocks it
won with OGX and will operate both, spokesman Patrick McGinn
said by telephone, declining to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 30 winning companies will invest a minimum of 6.9
billion reais to develop the areas that span 11 sedimentary
basins on land and off the coast of north and northeastern
Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A partnership between Total, BP and state-run Petroleo
Brasileiro SA made the largest single bid of 346 million reais
for the FZA-M-57 block in deep waters of Foz do Amazonas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The super consortium that took shape for the equatorial
margin is Total, BP and Petrobras,&#8221; de Luca said, noting that
Total will operate the block. &#8220;Petrobras teaming up with other
companies is very good for the sector.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Acted Aggressively&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batista&#8217;s OGX, the Rio de Janeiro-based company that has
lost 84 percent of its market value in the past year, also won
licenses for 10 blocks in five basins bidding without partners
and an additional 30 percent stake in a block together with
Total and QGEP Participacoes SA. (QGEP3) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OGX is taking on new exploration projects even as the
company sells stakes in fields, reduces staff and cuts costs
after losing investor confidence amid missed production targets.
Brazil&#8217;s worst-performing stock last year has plunged an
additional 57 percent this year after lower-than-expected output
rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OGX agreed to pay 377 million reais for the exploration
licenses, including its share in blocks won with partners,
according to ANP data. The company missed out on rights in four
other blocks where offers were presented in conjunction with
Exxon. OGX committed 16 percent of its cash to the new licenses,
according to Banco Santander SA analysts Christian Audi and
Vicente Falanga Neto. The Rio-based company would be better
served focusing on development of its existing assets, they
wrote in a note to clients dated today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;China Absence &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Once again the company acted aggressively, which is a
characteristic of OGX and of Eike Batista,&#8221; Adriano Pires, the
head of the Brazilian Center for Infrastructure, a consulting
firm in Rio de Janeiro, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;Nobody
expected that given the complicated situation the company is
having lately. They took onshore and offshore blocks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OGX Chief Executive Officer Luiz Carneiro said in an e-mailed statement today the acquired offshore blocks are located
in a &#8220;highly promising area.&#8221; &#8220;This is clearly an exciting
time for Brazil&#8217;s oil and gas industry,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OGX rose 6.8 percent to 1.88 reais in Sao Paulo today, the
highest close since May 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winners of the auction, held at a Rio hotel, also included
Brazilian startup Ouro Preto Oleo  Gas SA and Colombia&#8217;s
Ecopetrol SA. (ECOPETL) Chief oil regulator Magda Chambriard told
reporters she was surprised by a lack of bids from Chinese
companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Amazon Basin &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP and Total agreed to pay 621.5 million reais for the
offshore Amazon basin concessions. BHP Billiton Ltd. won bidding
for two blocks in the same basin, the Melbourne-based mining
company&#8217;s first oil assets in Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the areas auctioned yesterday are in virgin waters
off the coast of northeastern Brazil where discoveries in
similar geology across the Atlantic in Ghana and Ivory Coast
yielded major discoveries. Tullow Oil Plc in 2011 sparked
interest in the region with the Zaedyus find off the coast of
French Guiana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The bidding has been aggressive,&#8221; Thore Kristiansen,
head of Statoil ASA in Brazil, told reporters after the
Stavanger-based company won blocks in ventures with Petrobras
and Total. &#8220;The bidding has shown it&#8217;s been five years since
the last auction. There&#8217;s an industry willing to take risks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little Rock, Arkansas, objected to a
multibillion-dollar settlement of a price-fixing case against
Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) over the fees charged to merchants
to process credit-card transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement doesn&#8217;t address potential future fixing of
the so-called interchange or swipe fees and contains
&#8220;unacceptable obligations,&#8221; City Manager Bruce T. Moore said
in a filing today in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, where
the agreement is under review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed $7.25 billion settlement, estimated to be the
largest-ever U.S. antitrust accord, has drawn criticism from
trade associations and retailers, which contend that it grants
the card companies too much leeway to raise rates in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), the
world&#8217;s largest retailer, said in a statement in July that it
was &#8220;disappointed&#8221; in the settlement and would encourage
merchants to reject the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little Rock, the state capital and home to department-store
chain Dillard&#8217;s Inc. (DDS), said it was protesting the settlement in
its capacity as a potential member of a class that has accepted
Visa and MasterCard credit-card payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, the city of Oakland, California, also filed an
objection to the settlement today. The city, which also accepts
credit-card payments, said the accord &#8220;explicitly permits Visa
and MasterCard to continue to fix interchange fees for their
banks,&#8221; forcing consumers to pay higher prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Higher Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Interchange fees on credit card transactions result in
higher prices for Oakland&#8217;s residents, and amount to a hidden
and regressive tax on goods and services,&#8221; the city said in its
objection, filed by attorney Jeffrey Shinder, who is also
representing several trade associations that oppose the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of objections have been filed since U.S. District
Judge John Gleeson gave a preliminary sign-off to the deal in
November, including many from smaller retailers and merchants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large retailers including Target Corp. (TGT) and Home Depot Inc. (HD)
have also spoken out against the accord. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Gleeson ordered that corrections be made to
websites established by groups opposing the settlement,
including Merchantsobject.com, which directed business owners to
pages where they could submit objections electronically. The
judge said that the sites were misleading and failed to
prominently display a link to a court-approved website,
paymentcardsettlement.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Consider Remedies &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a follow-up hearing earlier this month, Gleeson said he
would consider remedies for merchants that dropped out of the
settlement, leaving them unable to receive payments for damages,
based on what he described as misleading information on the
sites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement was unveiled in July after about seven years
of litigation. A hearing on final approval of the deal, which
would cover merchants throughout the U.S., is scheduled for
Sept. 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant
Discount Antitrust Litigation, 05-md-01720, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YPF SA, Argentina&#8217;s biggest energy
company, rose the most in almost five months after it said
Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-biggest U.S. oil company, will be the
first major crude producer to partner with it to develop shale
oil and natural gas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YPF gained 8.3 percent to 114.80 pesos at 3:15 p.m. in
Buenos Aires. The stock earlier rose as much as 10 percent to
116.50, the biggest intraday increase since Nov. 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miguel Galuccio, chief executive officer of YPF, and Ali Moshiri, Chevron&#8217;s head of Latin America, Middle East and
Africa, visited the Patagonia shale formation yesterday, the
Buenos Aires-based company said late yesterday in a statement.
Moshiri was &#8220;surprised&#8221; with the advanced state of YPF&#8217;s
exploration project, the Argentine company said in the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The news saying Chevron will finally seal its $1.5
billion deal with YPF has indeed triggered this rally because it
isn&#8217;t any company, it is Chevron,&#8221; Carlos Aszpis, an analyst at
Schweber  Cia. Sociedad de Bolsa, said by telephone from Buenos
Aires. &#8220;Argentina just needs more companies like Chevron
trusting in the country.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moshiri and Galuccio in December signed an agreement to
negotiate final terms for YPF to transfer a 50 percent interest
in the fields Loma de la Lata Norte and Loma Campana. The fields
for the $1.5 billion joint venture comprise an area of 290
square kilometers (180 miles) in southwestern Argentina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alejandro Di Lazzaro, a YPF spokesman, declined to comment
in a phone interview from Neuquen on reasons for YPF&#8217;s rally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YPF said it is pumping 7,000 barrels of oil a day, up from
4,000 in January. Vaca Muerta, which means &#8220;dead cow&#8221; in
Spanish, holds at least 23 billion barrels of oil equivalent,
according to a report by independent auditor Ryder Scott
released in February 2012 by YPF. Argentina holds the world&#8217;s
third-largest shale gas reserves, according to U.S. Energy
Information Administration data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Heebner, who once ranked as
America&#8217;s No. 1 stock picker, took new positions in Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (HTZ), while selling
out of Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Herbalife Ltd. (HLF) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heebner&#8217;s Capital Growth Management LP purchased 843,000
shares of Goldman Sachs during the first quarter, based on a
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The money
manager bought 4.9 million shares of auto-rental chain Hertz
Global. Capital Growth sold $152.1 million of Bank of America
shares and $110.2 million of Herbalife, a marketer of
nutritional supplements, in the three months ended March 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heebner&#8217;s CGM Focus Fund (CGMFX) topped all diversified U.S. stock
mutual funds in the decade through 2007 and has returned 22
percent this year, beating 99 percent of its peers, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The Boston-based fund&#8217;s assets
plunged to $1.5 billion at the end of October from the June 2008
peak of $10.3 billion, as it lost an annual 8.9 percent in the
past five years, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has surged 22 percent this year compared with
the 16 percent gain in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. The Wall
Street bank, which generates the highest percentage of sales
from trading, reported last month that revenue from that
business fell more than its rivals during the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. lender by revenue,
has climbed 16 percent in 2013. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based company said in April mortgage banking and trading marred
first-quarter results and slowed the company&#8217;s turnaround. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hertz, the largest publicly traded U.S. rental-car
operator, is awaiting U.S. antitrust approval for its
acquisition of Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group. Shares have
surged 54 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heebner&#8217;s firm added to its stake in Herbalife in the
fourth quarter when shares plunged 31 percent after hedge-fund
manager Bill Ackman accused the company of operating a pyramid
scheme. Herbalife has surged 37 percent in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital Growth also exited positions in Ford Motor Co. and
Foot Locker Inc. during the first quarter. The firm also bought
homebuilder NVR Inc. and BlackRock Inc., the world&#8217;s largest
asset manager. While Heebner&#8217;s firm remained bullish on housing
stocks, with Lennar Corp. and DR Horton Inc. among the five
biggest holdings, the biggest decreases in market value was to
PulteGroup Inc., the largest U.S. homebuilder by revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The money manager&#8217;s stake in financial companies remained
the biggest allocation out of 10 industries. Citigroup Inc. and
Morgan Stanley remained the firm&#8217;s two largest holdings,
accounting for 6 percent and 5.8 percent of its investments,
respectively. The firm also boosted its ownership of industrial
and energy shares, while trimming holdings of consumer
discretionary and staples stocks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sallie Krawcheck, the former senior
executive at Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. (C), agreed to
buy 85 Broads, the global network with 30,000 members that
promotes women as business leaders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krawcheck is buying the firm from founder Janet Hanson, a
former executive of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., according to a
statement on the 85 Broads website. Hanson will keep a stake and
become chairman emeritus, according to the statement, which
didn&#8217;t disclose terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal puts Krawcheck at the head of her own company
after stints in the top ranks of the nation&#8217;s biggest lenders.
Since then, Krawcheck has turned the spotlight on research that
shows increased participation by women improves shareholder
returns and helps the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For most of my career, I tried to avoid the topic of
being a woman in business, vaguely concerned that talking too
much about it would hold me back in some way,&#8221; Krawcheck wrote
on her LinkedIn page. &#8220;But I&#8217;ve been thinking about it over the
past year ... a lot.&#8221; Krawcheck said &#8220;the research and
business case for the economic advancement of women is so
compelling, in a world deeply in need of greater economic
prosperity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bigger Role &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;85 Broads, which began on Wall Street and expanded to
colleges and universities, arranges networking events for
professionals and students, often featuring women with leading
roles in their fields. It operates more than 40 regional
chapters and campus clubs in at least 130 countries, according
to its website. The name is derived from the address of Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s former New York City headquarters. &lt;/p&gt;

The Winner Will Be Denmark</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;To win Eurovision, the annual pan-European song contest that launched the careers of Abba and Celine Dion, you''ve got to have style, a killer song and enough charm to convince judges from rival countries to vote for you. For the 2013 finals, aired across the region this weekend, the odds are on Denmark, according to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does a big tech company -- that''s a big tech company that didn''t invent iTunes, by the way (remember the Zune? Didn''t think so) -- know about a kitschy European songfest? Microsoft Research economist David Rothschild has a project called PredictWise that sifts through zillions of data points scooped up from the Internet to predict outcomes of various public events like Eurovision, the Academy Awards, and elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PredictWise used its "big data" aggregation to correctly predict the U.S. Presidential election results for every state except Florida. And it got 19 out of 24 categories correct in the 2013 Oscars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its Eurovision predictions take odds from gambling sites such as PaddyPower and Betfair, as well as Youtube views and mentions in social media, Rothschild says. Those, he said on his blog, are predictors of the votes of judges drawn from the dozens of countries competing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This method works "particularly well for Eurovision, firstly, because the markets are extremely robust, and secondly, because the collective wisdom of the users includes the unique politics of the Eurovision voting blocs," Rothschild wrote on his blog. "This means that an American like me -- with detailed knowledge of markets, but little &#8230; knowledge of Eurovision -- can make meaningful predictions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His prediction, as of the time this blog was published: Denmark''s Emmelie de Forest, singing "Only Teardrops," has a 50 percent chance of winning. Norway and Ukraine are next with 9.8 percent and 8.4 percent odds respectively. The odds are sure to keep changing until Saturday, when some 125 million viewers will tune in for the Eurovision finals in Malmo, Sweden. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Sweden won in Baku, Azerbaijan, with "Euphoria" by Loreen, followed by a gang of Russian grandmothers called Buranovskiye Babushki, who got a standing ovation for the dance song, "Party for Everybody."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great Britain has just a 0.9 percent chance of finishing first, according to Rothschild''s data. That won''t sit well with Britons, who grumble that without a win since 1997 ("Love Shine a Light," by Katrina and the Waves), the contest must be rigged against them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To end the drought, the country is putting forward Bonnie Tyler, a veteran Welsh hitmaker who topped the charts with "It''s a Heartache," "Total Eclipse of the Heart" and "Holding Out for a Hero" in the ''70s and ''80s. She''ll ask viewers -- and more important, judges -- to "believe in things that your eyes can''t see" with her song "Believe in Me." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they don''t? Well, let''s just say the Brits will always have the Beatles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset Management, the money
management unit of the biggest U.S. bank by assets, said it&#8217;s
starting the U.K.&#8217;s first investment trust dedicated to global
convertible bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan Global Convertibles Income Fund will be set up
as a closed-end fund, which has a fixed number of shares,
targeting a 4.5 percent yield through dividend income and
capital growth, according to Antony Vallee, the unit&#8217;s London-based head of convertible bonds. The closed-end structure will
add flexibility to the investment strategy by avoiding the need
to hold cash and the most liquid securities to meet potential
withdrawals, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convertible debt combines a bond with an option to buy a
preset amount of stock, allowing lenders to share in gains from
the growth or revival of borrowers while offering the same
protection of capital as a traditional bond. New issuance, which
soared to more than $10 billion in the first quarter, a record
for the period in Europe, stalled in recent weeks as improving
economic indicators in some regions encourage chief financial
officers and other managers to view their stock as undervalued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Few CFOs in the world are happy to issue convertibles
because of the dilution,&#8221; Vallee said at a  presentation
today. &#8220;Right now they&#8217;re looking at the U.S. and Japan and
expecting that equities will go up. When companies need some
money they will come back.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new fund plans to raise at least 100 million pounds
($152 million) and its size is capped at 300 million pounds. The
directors plan to prevent its value falling to a discount of
more than 5 percent to net asset value by buying back stock
where necessary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares of the investment trust are expected to start
trading by the middle of next month, according to the term
sheet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) sued state-owned
Portuguese companies running the Lisbon and Oporto metro rail
services, as well as the country&#8217;s strategic oil reserves, to
enforce derivative contracts worth at least 455 million euros
($587 million). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan filed the lawsuits in London on April 26, the same
day Portugal made a deal with other banks to reduce its 3
billion-euro exposure to derivatives entered into by state-owned
firms. The government failed to reach an agreement with JPMorgan
and Banco Santander SA&#8217;s Portuguese unit, and said it would sue
to defend its interests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We were forced to take protective measures in the English
courts&#8221; following the April announcement by Portugal, JPMorgan
spokesman Brian Marchiony said in an e-mail. The New York-based
bank remains open to negotiations and the contracts aren&#8217;t in
default, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are turning to U.K. courts to resolve swaps disputes
with local governments and state-owned companies that say they
lost money on complex derivatives. More than half a dozen
Italian municipalities are embroiled in legal disputes with
investment banks in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maria Luis Albuquerque, Portugal&#8217;s secretary of state for
treasury and finance, described the country&#8217;s hedging contracts
as &#8220;toxic&#8221; with &#8220;elevated risks,&#8221; when she announced the
April deal. An official at Portugal&#8217;s finance ministry declined
to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Santander Suits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santander&#8217;s Portugal-based unit also sued the Oporto and
Lisbon metro and bus companies in London on May 10. Peter
Greiff, a Santander spokesman in Madrid, didn&#8217;t immediately
return a phone call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metropolitano de Lisboa had at least 455 million euros of
swap contracts with the JPMorgan at the end of 2011, as measured
by notional value, according to the company&#8217;s annual report. The
disclosed JPMorgan contracts had a negative value of 221 million
euros, Metropolitano de Lisboa said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s Marchiony said in an e-mailed statement the
figures weren&#8217;t accurate and declined to comment further. A
Metro de Lisboa spokesman declined to comment beyond the
company&#8217;s filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metro Porto had 120 million euros of outstanding loans with
JPMorgan at the end of 2011 according to its annual report,
which didn&#8217;t disclose details of derivatives held with the bank.
The Strategic Oil Reserve Fund didn&#8217;t disclose details of its
derivative counterparties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are: JP Morgan Securities PLC v. Metropolitano de
Lisboa EP, High Court of Justice, Queen&#8217;s Bench Division,
Commercial Court, 13-607; JP Morgan Chase Bank NA v. Entidade
Gestora De Reservas Estrategicas De Produtos, High Court of

&lt;p&gt;Sugar fell to the lowest level since

the second half of last month. Cocoa retreated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raw sugar will be 17.5 cents a pound on the ICE Futures

cents. Sugar may fall to 15 cents to 16.5 cents, Omar al-Dahhan,
a senior trader at Louis Dreyfus Commodities, said at a
conference in Geneva on April 18. Kona Haque, an analyst at
Macquarie Group Ltd., said at the same event it could decline to
as low as 16.5 cents by the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sugar production in Brazil&#8217;s center south, the main growing
region, surged to 1.45 million metric tons in the second half of
April from 393,200 tons a year earlier, according to data from
industry group Unica. Dry weather allowed harvesting to advance
after rains delayed the start of the season. Production for the
whole season will be a record 35.5 million tons, Unica said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While wet weather in April delayed the beginning of the
Brazilian center south harvest, the sugar cane crush is
expected&#8221; to be a record, Goldman Sachs analyst Damien Courvalin wrote in the report. &#8220;With weather improving in the
second half of April, we are lowering our three- and six-months
price forecast.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raw sugar for delivery in July fell as much as 0.5 percent
to 16.94 cents a pound on ICE, the lowest for a most-active
contract since July 2010. The price was down 0.1 percent at
17.01 cents a pound at 6:21 a.m. Futures trading volumes were 10
percent higher than the average for the past 100 days for this
time of day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. White, or
refined, sugar for delivery in August was down 0.3 percent to
$476.60 a ton on NYSE Liffe in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Brazil Production &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sugar prices fell 13 percent in New York this year as
supplies are set to outpace demand. Record production in Brazil
will probably mean a third year of surplus in the 2013-14
season, Goldman Sachs said. The International Sugar Organization
estimates a surplus of 8.5 million tons in 2012-13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thailand, the second-biggest sugar shipper, rejected 20
bids to sell 72,000 tons of sugar at an auction today. All bids
were rejected as the premium buyers were willing to pay were
below expectations, Surat Thadachawasakul, general manager of
state-owned Thai Cane  Sugar Corp., said by phone today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cocoa for July delivery slid 0.6 percent to $2,339 a ton in
New York. Cocoa for delivery in July fell 0.6 percent to 1,558
pounds ($2,370) a ton in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arabica coffee futures for July delivery were little
changed at $1.4405 a pound on ICE. Robusta coffee futures for
July delivery gained 0.2 percent to $2,054 a ton in London. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. said China may
widen the yuan&#8217;s trading band in the next three months after the
foreign-exchange regulator announced rules to deter speculative
funds from betting on appreciation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The State Administration of Foreign Exchange said May 5 it
would put in measures to increase monitoring of cross-border
trade flows and ordered banks to adjust currency positions so
that dollar loans are kept at a certain proportion to deposits.
Patrick Wu, head of yuan trading at JPMorgan, the largest U.S.
bank by assets, said the move may be part of preparations to
broaden the band. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If SAFE widened the band without the new measure, it
would trigger more speculation,&#8221; Wu said in an interview
yesterday in Shanghai. &#8220;However, if they introduce the measure,
it would be more helpful to push down the yuan&#8217;s spot level and
give SAFE more room to widen the band because corporates and
banks will have to reduce short-dollar positions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government has pledged to allow more flexibility in the
exchange rate and promote freer movement of capital in and out
of the country for investment purposes. China&#8217;s State Council,
or cabinet, signaled May 6 it will propose plans this year for
yuan capital-account convertibility. The central bank last
widened the band in April 2012, to 1 percent from 0.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yuan Outlook &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The People&#8217;s Bank of China sets a daily reference rate
against the dollar around 9:15 a.m. in Shanghai. The yuan has
been within 0.1 percent of the upper limit on most days since
October. The fixing was weakened 0.06 percent to 6.2070 today.
Wu said the reference rate may strengthen to 6.10 by year-end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There will be fewer speculative foreign-exchange trades
in the onshore market because banks have limitations in making
loans for corporates to go long on the yuan and short on
dollars,&#8221; said Wu. &#8220;The whole outlook for the yuan still
remains unchanged.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yuan weakened 0.06 percent to 6.1462 per dollar as of
2:22 p.m. in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. It touched 6.1307 on May 9, the strongest level
since the government unified official and market exchange rates
at the end of 1993. A long position is a bet that a currency
will appreciate while a short position anticipates a decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s currency has appreciated 1.5 percent in the last
three months, the third-best performance among 24 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg after the Mexican peso
and Malaysia&#8217;s ringgit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Around June &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Widening of the band is likely in June or shortly after,
Credit Agricole CIB strategist Dariusz Kowalczyk wrote in a
research note on May 7. With the new foreign-exchange position
limits for banks, policy makers were likely trying to reduce
speculative capital and prepare ground for foreign-exchange
regime relaxation, Hong Kong-based Kowalczyk said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The band may be expanded around June, before the U.S.-China
Strategic Economic Dialogue in Washington during the week of
July 8-12, Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategist Christy Tan
in Singapore wrote in a report on April 24. The PBOC may widen
the band against the dollar to 1.5 percent or 2 percent, while
1.5 percent is more likely, Tan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China is testing the yuan&#8217;s exchange-rate equilibrium and
may soon double its trading band, Shanghai Securities News
reported May 13, citing people it didn&#8217;t identify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A widening is likely &#8220;in the near future,&#8221; People&#8217;s Bank
of China Deputy Governor Yi Gang said in April. China will push
ahead with opening its capital account because current economic
conditions are favorable, Yi said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One-year implied volatility in the onshore yuan, a measure
of exchange-rate swings used to price options, rose nine basis
points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 2.43 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. That&#8217;s the highest since Jan. 15. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has
questioned three more federal agencies&#8217; enforcement practices by
asking if they&#8217;ve studied the costs of favoring settlements with
big financial firms over taking them to trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat on the Senate Banking
Committee, had earlier questioned Comptroller of the Currency
Thomas Curry about why his agency doesn&#8217;t take wrongdoing
financial firms to trial, such as in the money-laundering case
of London-based HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA) She sent a similar query in a
letter yesterday to Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke,
Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Jo White and
Attorney General Eric Holder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If large financial institutions can break the law and
accumulate millions in profits and, if they get caught, settle
by paying out of those profits, they do not have much incentive
to follow the law,&#8221; Warren said in the letter. She argued
regulators have &#8220;a lot less leverage&#8221; if they show a
continuing unwillingness to go to trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curry said in a response to Warren last week that the OCC
hasn&#8217;t conducted research on the benefits of settling without
forcing admissions of guilt, according to the letter. Warren is
putting the same question to Bernanke, White and Holder about
whether they&#8217;ve conducted research on the trade-offs between
settling and litigating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White said in testimony before a House Appropriations
subcommittee May 7 that the SEC is reviewing its practice of
settling cases without requiring defendants to admit guilt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policy has benefited investors while saving SEC
resources, White testified. The settlements leave no question
&#8220;about what the conduct was,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Visa Europe Offers to Cap Credit-Card Fees to End EU Probe &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe Ltd. plans to &#8220;significantly&#8221; reduce the fees
it sets for processing cross-border credit-card payments in a
bid to allay European Union competition concerns, the bloc&#8217;s
antitrust watchdog said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe&#8217;s offer would bring its fees in line with those
of its main competitor MasterCard Inc. (MA), the European Commission
said yesterday. The operator of the EU&#8217;s largest payment-card
network also committed to overhaul its rules so that banks will
be able to apply a reduced cross-border interbank fee when they
compete for clients cross-border. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe proposed to reduce by 40 percent to 60 percent
its so-called interbank fees for credit-card payments to a level
of 0.3 percent of the value of the transaction for cross-border
and domestic transactions, the commission said. The remedies
would last for four years. Visa Europe was sent a formal
complaint over the levies last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joaquin Almunia, the EU&#8217;s antitrust commissioner, said in a
video statement that antitrust officials will carry out a so-called market test with industry groups before deciding to make
the commitments legally binding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe&#8217;s so-called multilateral interchange fees
&#8220;harm competition between acquiring banks, inflate the cost of
payment card acceptance for merchants and ultimately increase
consumer prices,&#8221; the commission said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Today&#8217;s outcome is the result of constructive dialogue
between Visa Europe and the European Commission and is in line
with the level of 0.3 percent established in the industry,&#8221;
Peter Ayliffe, Visa Europe&#8217;s chief executive officer, said in an
e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cheung Kong Cancels Hotel-Room Sales After Regulator Probe &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheung Kong Holdings Ltd. (1), the developer controlled by
Asia&#8217;s richest man, is canceling the sale of HK$1.4 billion
($180 million) of hotel rooms after Hong Kong&#8217;s securities
regulator began a probe into the transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheung Kong, controlled by billionaire Li Ka-Shing, will
return all deposits and part payments plus interest to all the
buyers of the individual rooms at the Apex Horizon project in
the city&#8217;s west, after being notified by the Securities and
Futures Commission that the sales constitute a unauthorized
&#8220;collective investment scheme,&#8221; the developer said in a
statement to Hong Kong&#8217;s stock exchange May 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale of the 360 hotel rooms in February drew the
government&#8217;s ire as it was seen as a means of skirting an
increase in taxes on apartments that was aimed at cooling
prices. Within days of the sale, the government extended the
taxes to include hotels and other commercial property, and sent
inspectors to check that Apex Horizon units weren&#8217;t being used
as residences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We do not agree&#8221; with the SFC, Cheung Kong said in a
separate e-mailed statement. The decision was made &#8220;as the
difference in legal opinion may lead to legal uncertainty in
respect of the sale and purchase of the hotel room units, which
may affect the buyers&#8217; ownership, mortgage arrangement or
subsequent sale of the hotel room units,&#8221; the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong&#8217;s securities law requires the regulator&#8217;s
authorization before a collective investment scheme can be
marketed to the public, according to a statement on the SFC&#8217;s
website yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SFC intended to start legal proceedings seeking orders
to unwind the sale, according to the statement. The agreement
with Cheung Kong avoids court action at this stage, it said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;EU Confirms Raids on Companies in Oil and Biofuels Sector &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission said antitrust officials raided the
premises of &#8220;several companies active in and providing services
to the crude oil, refined oil products and biofuels sectors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These inspections took place in two European Union member
states, the commission said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The raids took place over concerns the companies &#8220;may have
colluded in reporting distorted prices to a price reporting
agency to manipulate the published prices for a number of oil
and biofuel products,&#8221; the commission said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspections were also carried out on its behalf by the
European Free Trade Association&#8217;s Surveillance Authority in one
European Economic Area member state, the Brussels-based
commission said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia
said officials carried out surprise inspections at &#8220;a number of
producers of white sugar in several member states,&#8221; last month,
without providing further details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ranbaxy to Pay $500 Million to Settle Criminal, Civil Cases &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. (RBXY) agreed to pay $500 million to
resolve fraud allegations made in a whistle-blower&#8217;s lawsuit and
federal criminal charges that the company sold adulterated drugs
while lying about it to U.S. regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranbaxy, in papers filed in federal court in Baltimore May
13, admitted it sold batches of drugs that were improperly
manufactured, stored and tested. The company, India&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, also pleaded guilty to making fraudulent statements
to the Food and Drug Administration about how it tested drugs at
two of its Indian plants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resolution of the lawsuits and the criminal charges
filed yesterday caps allegations about Ranbaxy&#8217;s practices
dating to 2003 when the company distributed a batch of acne
medication it knew had failed a quality test, according to the
criminal charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2012, Ranbaxy settled an FDA lawsuit by agreeing
to stop production of drugs for the U.S. market at the two
plants until they met American standards. In 2007, the whistle-blower&#8217;s lawsuit, unsealed May 13, alleged the company defrauded
public health-care programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The felony criminal charges included provision for the
payment of a fine and forfeiture of funds. The false claims
portion of the settlement directs the company to pay the U.S.
and states, as well as the whistle-blower in the civil case,
Dinesh Thakur, of Belle Mead, New Jersey, a former Ranbaxy
executive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While we are disappointed by the conduct of the past that
led to this investigation, we strongly believe that settling
this matter now is in the best interest of all of Ranbaxy&#8217;s
stakeholders,&#8221; Arun Sawhney, chief executive officer and
managing director of Gurgaon, India-based Ranbaxy, said in a
statement. &#8220;The conclusion of the DOJ investigation does not
materially impact our current financial situation or
performance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said in the settlement agreement to the lawsuit
that it denies wrongdoing in the civil case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. Ranbaxy U.S.A., 13-cr-00238,
U.S. District Court, Maryland (Baltimore). The civil case is
Thakur v. Ranbaxy U.S.A. Inc., 07-cv-00962, U.S. District Court,
Maryland (Baltimore). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Credit-Ratings Industry Is Oligarchy to Be Broken, Franken Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Al Franken, a Democrat from Minnesota, said
financial regulators must intervene in the credit ratings
industry or risk another U.S. financial &#8220;catastrophe.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My plea today is that you take action,&#8221; Franken said at
Securities and Exchange Commission credit ratings roundtable in
Washington yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ratings companies SP (MHP) and Moody&#8217;s (MCO) didn&#8217;t give financial
products &#8220;accurate, objective ratings,&#8221; Franken said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Roger Wicker, a Republican from Mississippi, urged
the SEC to take the &#8220;next steps&#8221; to revamp industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Franken said his joint bill with Wicker would require the
agency to name an independent board that would appoint different
credit rating agencies to assign ratings based on an agency&#8217;s
expertise and eventually its track record. Such a set-up would
restore trust in the market and allow smaller agencies to break
up the current &#8220;oligarchy,&#8221; Franken said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC Commissioner Luis Aguilar, who also spoke at the
roundtable, said &#8220;the past can&#8217;t be repeated.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, the SEC said credit-ratings companies failed
to follow their own standards, were late in downgrading deals,
and delayed disclosure of methodology changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dodd-Frank requires regulators to stop relying on ratings
and increase oversight of companies that issue them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walter J. O&#8217;Brien III, head of equity sales and trading at BBT Corp. (BBT) and a mentor to finance-minded graduates of his alma mater, the University of Richmond in Virginia, has died. He was 46. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He died on May 10 at his home in Richmond, his wife, Debra, said yesterday in an interview. The cause was colon cancer, which was diagnosed in February 2012. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Known as Joe, O&#8217;Brien held jobs on Wall Street at Smith Barney and Citicorp Inc. before joining Scott  Stringfellow Inc., a regional brokerage, investment banking and financial services firm in Richmond that billed itself as the U.S. South&#8217;s oldest continuous member of the New York Stock Exchange. BBT, North Carolina&#8217;s second-biggest bank after Bank of America Corp., bought Scott  Stringfellow in 1999. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;BBT, based in Winston-Salem, promoted O&#8217;Brien to senior vice president of capital markets in 2002. He rose to managing director. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A member of the Executive Advisory Council of the University of Richmond&#8217;s Robins School of Business, O&#8217;Brien took many students &#8220;under his wing,&#8221; according to an article in the university&#8217;s alumni magazine. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It told of an MBA candidate, Grant Garcia, who drove to BBT&#8217;s offices in downtown Richmond, &#8220;sometimes before dawn, to sit at O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s desk learning the markets, a relationship they continued for almost two years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Leg Up&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Garcia, 29, now works in securitized product sales at Credit Suisse Securities in New York. He said yesterday in an interview that his unpaid experience with O&#8217;Brien was valuable and gave him a leg up in a tough job market. When Garcia graduated from Robins in 2009, he landed a job at Bank of America&#8217;s Merrill Lynch brokerage unit, then moved to the U.S. unit of Zurich-based Credit Suisse Group AG. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;He really changed my life,&#8221; Garcia said. &#8220;He gave me the foundation during a really hard period of time in the economy. His door was always open. Every time he came to New York we&#8217;d go out for a drink or for dinner.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an e-mail to the Robins community, Dean Nancy A. Bagranoff wrote, &#8220;Joe showed great courage as he dealt with his illness. He will be much missed by us all.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Walter Joseph O&#8217;Brien III was born on Nov. 26, 1966, in London to Nancy Malmuth and Walter J. O&#8217;Brien Jr. He was raised in Chicago and New York. His father was president of J. Walter Thompson, then the world&#8217;s largest advertising agency, and later ran two other firms, according to a biography for a Richmond non-profit group where he serves on the board. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1985, the son graduated from the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Connecticut, and in 1989 earned an economics degree from Richmond. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Brien was a senior vice president at Citicorp when he left New York for Scott  Stringfellow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Survivors include his wife, Debra, a graduate of New York University&#8217;s Stern School of Business and adjunct associate professor of information systems at Richmond; a son, Connor, 13; a daughter, Caitlin, 10; his parents and stepmother, Margaret O&#8217;Brien. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Cliff Edwards" date="May 16, 2013  6:38 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-16/microsoft-tops-u-s-retail-game-console-sales-with-xbox.html"><headline>Microsoft Tops U.S. Retail Game Console Sales With Xbox</headline><body>

&lt;p&gt; SolarCity Corp. (SCTY), a solar-energy
developer chaired by billionaire Elon Musk, won financing from
Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. for more than $500 million in rooftop
solar systems that the company will complete this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lease-financing agreement will help SolarCity build
about 110 megawatts of solar power systems with little or no up-front cost for homeowners and businesses, San Mateo, California-based SolarCity said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal is the largest single financing agreement for
rooftop systems in the U.S. and will raise awareness of the
quality of the solar-lease asset class, SolarCity Chief
Executive Officer Lyndon Rive said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We hope it sends a signal that solar is a stable and
reliable asset to invest in,&#8221; Rive said in an interview.
&#8220;These aren&#8217;t luxury yachts we&#8217;re talking about, it&#8217;s your
energy, and the default rates are lower than mortgages.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the first quarter, SolarCity said it invested $138.2
million in solar systems as demand for rooftop panels from
homeowners and businesses surged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For New York-based Goldman Sachs, the SolarCity agreement
will help reach the Wall Street bank&#8217;s goal of financing $40
billion in renewable energy during the next decade, said Stuart Bernstein, global head of clean technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;SolarCity&#8217;s range of distributed solar solutions
targeting a wider customer base will help us move toward a low
carbon energy future,&#8221; Bernstein said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The financing agreement also allows SolarCity to extend
credit to homeowners with lower credit scores, Rive said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When we started you needed a FICO score of 720 or
higher,&#8221; Rive said. &#8220;Now it&#8217;s more like 680 and I suspect in
the near term we&#8217;ll be at 650.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SolarCity climbed 11 percent to $35.69 at the close in New
York. The shares have quadrupled since the initial offering in
December. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-biggest
U.S. oil company, said it&#8217;s preparing an investment that will
help make the country energy independent by developing what
could be the world&#8217;s second-largest shale oil reservoir. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some people think China is the second-largest shale
oil,&#8221; Ali Moshiri, Chevron&#8217;s head of Latin America, Middle East
and Africa, told reporters yesterday in Buenos Aires. &#8220;I
believe after the U.S., Vaca Muerta holds the largest shale oil
in terms of reserves,&#8221; he said, referring to a formation in
southwestern Argentina that translates to Dead Cow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moshiri spoke along with Miguel Galuccio, chief executive
of state-owned YPF SA, after signing a contract establishing
terms for a definitive agreement that will start with a $1.5
billion investment and may reach as much as $15 billion. The San
Ramon, California-based company first agreed to the partnership
in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Now it is the time for finalizing details as there are no
significant commercial issues between the two companies,&#8221;
Moshiri said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both executives declined to provide details of production
targets and capital expenditures. The final accord may be
completed as early as July as two teams of six members each are
writing the fiscal terms and other covenants, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YPF gained 1.7 percent to 121 pesos at 2:45 p.m. in Buenos
Aires. The stock earlier rose as much as 8.3 percent to 128.90.
Chevron added 0.07 percent to $123.09 in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Frozen Assets &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Once we sign the deal, we will immediately allocate a
large sum of money to take the investment to the next level,&#8221;
Moshiri said. &#8220;We are going to provide whatever YPF asks to
reach the target.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moshiri said Chevron is spending $150 million a year even
while an embargo linked to an Ecuadorean lawsuit froze 40
percent of its accounts in Argentina. The lawsuit against
Chevron stems from a $19 billion award for pollution in Ecuador. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron will continue reinvesting all the money it makes
in Argentina,&#8221; Moshiri said, declining to elaborate how the
company will avoid having its funds seized. &#8220;At the end of the
day the right decision will be made by the people in Argentina,
the government and the judiciary system.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner&#8217;s
government seized a 51 percent YPF stake from Spain&#8217;s Repsol SA (REP)
in April 2012 to stem fuel imports that doubled to $9.4 billion
in 2011 and are expected to rise to as much as $15 billion this
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Repsol Lawsuit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another legal dispute threatening the agreement is a suit
filed in November in Madrid by Repsol against the U.S. company.
The Repsol lawsuit is an issue between shareholders, Galuccio
said. &#8220;There is a lot of goodwill from both sides to reach an
agreement, nevertheless, as YPF CEO I couldn&#8217;t comment
further,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Repsol is open to a negotiation that includes liquid
assets as compensation,&#8221; Kristian Rix, a spokesman for the
Madrid-based company, said today by telephone from Madrid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galuccio and Moshiri said they would only discuss the
future of Vaca Muerta now that YPF has cut well costs in half to
$7.5 million apiece. On May 14, the two executives visited YPF&#8217;s
shale operations, which has 35 operating rigs and is expecting
to receive four more this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YPF said it&#8217;s pumping 7,000 barrels of oil a day, up from
4,000 in January. Vaca Muerta may hold at least 23 billion
barrels of oil equivalent, according to a report by independent
auditor Ryder Scott released in February 2012 by YPF. Argentina
holds the world&#8217;s third-largest shale gas reserves, according to
U.S. Energy Information Administration data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you look at Vaca Muerta in the future, in 30, 40
years, you will be looking at a factory drilling operation,&#8221;
Galuccio said. &#8220;We are working on industrializing the process
as that will be the key for Argentina to develop those resources
we have on the ground.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the largest
U.S. bank by assets, named Chris Ventresca and Hernan Cristerna
as co-heads of global mergers and acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ventresca, 46, previously was JPMorgan&#8217;s head of North
American MA, while Cristerna, 48, oversaw MA for Europe,
Middle East and Africa, according to a memo obtained today by
Bloomberg News. They will report to Jeff Urwin, global head of
investment banking. Tasha Pelio, a spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan, confirmed the memo&#8217;s contents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, is
overhauling top management on its MA team. Ventresca and
Cristerna will have global responsibilities, with each
overseeing their former regions, Pelio said. They will share
responsibility for deals in Asia, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining global MA under two leaders streamlines the
bank&#8217;s decision-making, Ventresca said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We can move more quickly with common leadership,&#8221;
Ventresca said. &#8220;When an opportunity arises, we can put the
right advisory resources in place.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until February, Ventresca shared oversight of North
American MA with Jim Woolery, 44, who left the company that
month to become deputy chairman at corporate law firm Cadwalader
Wickersham  Taft LLP. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Senator John Breaux said
tennis taught him &#8220;how to handle winning and losing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night, Breaux, now senior counsel at Patton Boggs LLP,
was honored for his contributions to the sport, along with
former tennis ace Chris Evert, during the Geico Champions
Celebration dinner at the residence of Swedish Ambassador Jonas Hafstrom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hafstrom&#8217;s wife, Eva, filled in as host as he was in his
home country with Secretary of State John Kerry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaux, who has been involved with a number of charity
tournaments through the years, started playing the sport as a
boy in Louisiana. He said his first court was asphalt with
&#8220;cracks so big you could break your ankle.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His game has progressed but remains modest compared to
Evert&#8217;s: &#8220;She&#8217;s won 18 Grand Slam Championships. I&#8217;ve won
none.&#8221; Evert joked that his &#8220;grip was a little dodgy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dinner raised about $170,000 for the Junior Tennis
Champions Center and its Game On program, which sends the
center&#8217;s players and coaches into inner-city schools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other guests included Mark Ein, owner of the Washington
Kastles tennis team and chief executive of Venturehouse Group
LLC; Rynthia Rost, vice president of public affairs at Geico
Corp.; and Swedish tennis champion Mats Wilander. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Home Runs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt Gelman, senior director of congressional affairs at
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), practiced his swing at last night&#8217;s Home Runs
for Horton&#8217;s Kids at Nationals Park. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was joined in the batting cage by congressional staff
members, other lobbyists and their children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This really is Washington at its best. Everybody
leverages their contacts and pitches in,&#8221; said Ivan Zapien,
vice president for federal relations at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) The
event, now in its fifth year, helps the needy children of
Washington&#8217;s Ward 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Wal-Mart were among the grand slam sponsors,
helping bring in more than $350,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeanne Wolak, senior director for legislative and
regulatory strategy for Southern Co., wasn&#8217;t too confident about
her batting ability, but &#8220;it&#8217;s fun,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congresswoman Cynthia Lummis, Wyoming Republican, was
raring to get behind the plate, even in her red suit, after a

&lt;h2&gt;Dean&#8217;s Book &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutor Paul Nitze introduced author Vali Nasr
at a book party at the Georgetown home of his parents, art
collectors William and Ann Nitze, Monday night. William Nitze is
chairman of Oceana Energy Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seemed the appropriate thing to do as Nasr is the dean
of the Paul Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at
Johns Hopkins University. The younger Nitze and the school share
the name of the late secretary of the Navy and acclaimed Cold
War policy strategist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guests including French Ambassador Francois Delattre,
Italian Ambassador Claudio Bisogniero and Japanese Ambassador
Kenichiro Sasae gathered in the Nitze family&#8217;s parlor for
deviled eggs, artichoke fritters and smoked bacon bites, and
some current-affairs chat spurred by Nasr&#8217;s new book, &#8220;The

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s deal with
the U.K. government that may have saved the investment bank as
much as 20 million pounds ($30.6 million) on its taxes didn&#8217;t
break any laws, a judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue  Customs&#8217;s decision to reduce the
New York-based bank&#8217;s tax bill was properly conducted, a judge
in London ruled today. Still, Judge Andrew Nicol criticized tax
officials who considered the potential embarrassment to
Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne if a deal with
Goldman Sachs wasn&#8217;t completed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The settlement with Goldman Sachs was not a glorious
episode in the history of the Revenue,&#8221; Nicol said in his
written ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. government has pledged to clamp down on tax-avoidance schemes following widespread media and public anger
caused by the amount of corporation tax the likes of Google
Inc., Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) and Amazon.com Inc. pay in the country.
Lawmakers said in a report last month that increased
transparency about companies&#8217; tax affairs would build pressure
on multinational businesses to &#8220;pay a fair share.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UK Uncut Legal Action, an advocacy group that lobbies for
alternatives to government spending cuts, said HMRC reached the
agreement with Goldman Sachs on the day Osborne announced a
bankers&#8217; code to counter tax avoidance. An HMRC executive said
in an e-mail cited by UK Uncut that he was concerned the bank
might drop out of the code if the deal was scuttled. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Issuance of structured notes tied to
Indonesia&#8217;s sovereign debt surged to the most in three years,
led by JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), as investors seek to capitalize on
the second-highest yields among major Asian economies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of notes linked to Indonesian government bonds jumped
to the equivalent of $519.7 million this year through May 14, 89
percent higher than the same period of 2012, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The volume is the highest since 2010 and
90 percent of the products were issued by JPMorgan, which rose
to No. 1 after being ranked eighth last year, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overseas investors pumped a net 18 trillion rupiah ($1.8
billion) into local-currency sovereign notes in April, pushing
holdings to a record 299 trillion rupiah, according to the
finance ministry data. The country&#8217;s 10-year bonds yielded 5.55
percent yesterday, the highest behind Indian debt among 14 Asia-Pacific countries tracked by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For foreign investors, Indonesia &#8220;offers high yield, but
the risk is controllable,&#8221; said Nurul Eti Nurbaeti, head of
treasury research at PT Bank Negara Indonesia in Jakarta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan on May 6 issued the largest notes tied to
Indonesia this year in a 1.93 trillion rupiah offering. The 20-year securities, issued at a 4.4 percent premium, both pay a
6.625 percent annual coupon and are redeemed in U.S. dollars.
The U.S. currency gained against the rupiah for two consecutive
years through 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Long-Term Investments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polly Leung, a spokeswoman at JPMorgan in Hong Kong,
declined to comment on the notes. Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) and
Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) have also issued the securities this year,
according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than two-thirds of the products sold this year have
maturities of 10 years or longer, Bloomberg data show. Such
tenors are popular among pension funds and other foreign
institutional buyers, as they tend to seek long-term
investments, Nurbaeti said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia on May 14 kept interest rates unchanged for a
15th consecutive time as predicted. The central bank won&#8217;t
resist raising rates if needed, Assistant Governor Hendar said
May 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard  Poor&#8217;s cut its rating outlook on Indonesia&#8217;s
debt to stable from positive this month, citing slow progress in
improving infrastructure, regulatory uncertainty and
bureaucratic obstacles. The agency ranks the country at its
highest junk level, while Fitch Ratings Ltd. and Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service restored Indonesia to investment grades in
December 2011 and January 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dexia SA (DEXB)&#8217;s lawsuit against JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) over about $1.6 billion in mortgage-backed
securities was revived by a federal judge who found that he had
lacked the jurisdiction to dismiss it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan issued an order
today vacating his April decision and sending the case to New
York state court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Those who don&#8217;t believe in ghosts have never been in
court, where legal claims are regularly seen rising from the
grave,&#8221; Rakoff wrote in his order. &#8220;This is a case in point.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rakoff last month dismissed most of the suit, in which
Dexia accused JPMorgan, Bear Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual
Inc. of &#8220;egregious fraud&#8221; in the sale of mortgage bonds.
Dexia, based in Brussels, sued the lenders in 2012, claiming
that loans backing securities purchased between 2005 and 2007
were riskier than promised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan purchased assets of Washington Mutual and Bear
Stearns after they collapsed in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Rakoff&#8217;s April ruling, a federal appeals court in
Manhattan found that the Edge Act, a law that regulates
international banking, didn&#8217;t give a federal court jurisdiction
over a similar lawsuit filed by American International Group
Inc. against Bank of America Corp. (BAC) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In light of that decision, Rakoff concluded that he didn&#8217;t
have jurisdiction over Dexia&#8217;s case and that it belonged in
state court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment on Rakoff&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Dexia SA v. Bear Stearns  Co., 12-cv-04761.

&lt;p&gt;Toronto Police say they are reviewing
allegations that Mayor Rob Ford was caught on video using
cocaine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are closely monitoring the situation,&#8221; Constable Tony
Vella, spokesman for the Toronto Police Service, said in a
statement over the phone when asked if they would investigate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford, who has come under fire at city council in the past
over allegations of conflict of interest, said the video reports
are &#8220;ridiculous.&#8221; He said the story in the Toronto Star is
another example of the newspaper &#8220;going after me.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford spoke to reporters at city hall after the Star
reported that two of its reporters watched a video allegedly
showing Ford inhaling from a crack cocaine pipe. Bloomberg News
has not seen the video and can&#8217;t verify its authenticity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video allegedly shows Ford, 43, sitting in a chair in a
room, wearing a white shirt with the top buttons open, and
inhaling from what appears to be a glass crack pipe, the Star
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mayor of Canada&#8217;s largest city, who campaigned for
mayor with the slogan &#8220;Stop the Gravy Train&#8221;, has faced
mounting criticism since he was first elected in October 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford, elected with 47 percent of the vote on a vow to
expand the city&#8217;s subway system, came up against a council that
endorsed a surface rail plan. He faced opposition on council in
his drive to cut costs by contracting out services such as
garbage collection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Court Ruling &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most recently, Ford faced ouster when a Superior Court
judge found he broke the city&#8217;s conflict of interest rules over
donations he collected for his high school football charity. A
divisional court overturned the decision in January, finding him
not guilty and he kept his job. Clayton Ruby, the lawyer who
represents Toronto citizen Paul Magder in the case against Ford,
said he&#8217;s submitted the case to the Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah Thomson, who sought the mayoralty in 2010, said via
social media and on television interviews that Ford grabbed her
while taking a photo at an event and made inappropriate
comments. Ford said in a statement at the time that the
allegations were &#8220;absolutely, completely false.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mayor, who vowed to stop the &#8220;war on the car,&#8221; was
once photographed reading a newspaper while driving on a city
expressway and ditched the city&#8217;s annual gay pride parade,
breaking with mayoral tradition of supporting the largest pride
parade in North America, to go to his family cottage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney&#8217;s Co.&#8217;s super-hero movie
&#8220;Iron Man 3&#8221; passed $1 billion in worldwide ticket sales, the
company said today in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film from Disney&#8217;s Marvel unit had grossed $302 million
domestically through yesterday, its 14th day of release, and
$699 million overseas in 23 days of showings, the company said.
The biggest international market was China with $104 million
in sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s largest entertainment company, has cut
back on the number of films it releases to focus on ones with
global appeal and the potential to be parlayed into other
businesses. This week the Burbank, California-based firm
announced that a &#8220;Marvel&#8217;s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&#8221; television
show, based on its comic book characters, would debut on the
company&#8217;s ABC network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney shares fell less than 1 percent to $65.96 at 12:14
p.m. in New York. The stock is up 34 percent this year through
yesterday, while the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index has added 16
percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traders are standing by Platts, the
company that provides benchmark prices for much of the world&#8217;s
energy products, amid a European probe into market manipulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 34 out of 55 traders, brokers and analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News May 15, or 62 percent, said the
pricing system run by Platts, the energy news and data unit of
McGraw Hill Financial Inc., is still the best way to determine
prices in the $3.4 trillion-a-year market for crude and refined
products. Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), BP Plc (BP/) and Statoil ASA (STL) said
they&#8217;re also being investigated by the European Commission
following raids in three countries May 14 while Neste Oil Oyj (NES1V)
said yesterday it was asked to provide information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as 80 percent of all crude and oil-product deals
are linked to reference prices including those published by
Platts, according to estimates by Total SA (FP), Europe&#8217;s third-biggest producer. The European investigation marks the third
time global pricing benchmarks have drawn regulators&#8217; scrutiny
in the past year following inquiries into bank manipulation of
the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, and ISDAFix, the
benchmark for the $379 trillion swaps market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European regulators didn&#8217;t name the subjects of their probe
and haven&#8217;t specified the markets they are investigating or the
methods in question. &#8220;Companies may have colluded in reporting
distorted prices to a Price Reporting Agency to manipulate the
published prices for a number of oil and biofuel products,&#8221;
according to a May 14 statement by the EC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kathleen Tanzy, a Houston-based spokeswoman for Platts,
said on May 13 that the EC had undertaken a review at its office
in London in relation to its price assessment process. In a
submission to a 2012 report by the International Organization of
Security Commissions on oil pricing regulation, the company said
external controls over its activities would be an &#8220;unacceptable
intrusion&#8221; on its rights as a publisher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platts&#8217;s North Sea Dated Brent benchmark sets the price of
half the world&#8217;s crude, from Canada to Australia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;SEC&#8217;s White Rebuffs Call to Forswear Political Spending Rule &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Jo White
rebuffed calls by House Republicans to forswear a rule that
would force public companies to disclose political spending,
saying she won&#8217;t &#8220;prejudge the issue.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to lawmakers who pressed her on the matter at a
Financial Services subcommittee oversight hearing yesterday,
White said the SEC&#8217;s staff is reviewing a 2011 petition for such
a rule signed by a group of prominent law professors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said no one is currently working on a proposal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency&#8217;s rulemaking agenda indicates it is studying
whether to propose a rule. Republicans urged White to swear off
any action on the issue, calling it a partisan undertaking that
would hurt the SEC&#8217;s credibility as a regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debate over corporate political spending gained attention
after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a 2010 case known as
Citizens United that companies and unions could spend unlimited
money on election ads. More than 500,000 comments have been
filed in response to the petition, which is supported by the
Council of Institutional Investors and the American Federation
of State, County and Municipal Employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other large business
groups oppose the call for a rule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rulemaking on the issue has been criticized as tied to
partisan political agendas and a distraction from SEC mandates
of protecting investors, maintaining efficient markets, and
facilitating capital formation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, White told the panel that any proposed changes
relating to money market mutual funds would &#8220;seek to preserve
the many benefits of money market funds for investors and the
short-term funding markets,&#8221; according to remarks prepared for
the hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule simultaneously would seek to reduce money-market
funds&#8217; &#8220;susceptibility to runs, improving their ability to
manage and mitigate potential contagion from high levels of
redemptions, and increasing the transparency of their risks,&#8221;
she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, White said the SEC is the best regulatory
agency to handle the money market rule changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BlackRock Develops Alternatives to Money Funds as Rules Loom &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock Inc. (BLK) and Western Asset Management Co. are
offering a new twist on traditional money-market funds as
regulators are set to impose sweeping changes on the $2.58
trillion industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock, the world&#8217;s biggest money manager, and Legg
Mason Inc. (LM)&#8217;s Western Asset unit have started bond funds designed
to work much like money funds, with a difference. The new
&#8220;ultra-short&#8221; funds have share prices that fluctuate along
with the value of their holdings, rather than a fixed net asset
value, or NAV, a distinguishing feature of money funds. They
also have shorter maturities than similar ultra-short bond funds
that ran into trouble when credit markets froze in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firms are preparing for what could be a seismic
reallocation of assets by institutional investors and corporate
treasurers if regulators overhaul money funds for a second time
in three years in a bid to make them safer after the 2008
collapse of the Reserve Primary Fund. The U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission plans to order a floating NAV on
institutional prime money-market funds, or those that invest in
corporate debt, overriding opposition from the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary Athridge, a spokeswoman for Baltimore-based Legg
Mason, declined to comment on the Western Asset Ultra Short
Obligations Fund, which the firm filed to register on May 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new ultra-short fund is &#8220;clearly&#8221; not a money-market
fund, though at first glance it may &#8220;look similar&#8221; to one,
said Richard Hoerner, head of New York-based BlackRock&#8217;s global
cash-management business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock opened the BlackRock Ultra-Short Obligations Fund (BBUSX)
in November and it has about $25 million of assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal regulators have been searching for ways to prevent
a replay of September 2008. In 2010, the SEC tightened rules on
credit quality, shortened the maximum average maturity for funds
and introduced minimum liquidity levels. The agency considered
it an initial step toward making money funds more stable. The
industry fought back against proposals and sought to limit the
scope of changes. The SEC is now planning a narrower proposal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ex-AMD Workers at Nvidia Barred From Revealing Trade Secrets &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) won a court order barring ex-employees who went to competing chipmaker Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) from
disclosing trade secrets or soliciting former colleagues to join
them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Timothy Hillman said in his order that
AMD may win its lawsuit claiming misappropriation of
confidential information, according to a filing May 15 in
Boston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD, based in Sunnyvale, California, accused ex-employees
of taking sensitive company documents when they went to work for
Nvidia. The former employees transferred more than 100,000
electronic files pertaining to AMD&#8217;s graphics-processor business
in the days before their departure, AMD said in its complaint
filed in January. The employees also allegedly recruited other
AMD workers to leave the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The order, called a preliminary injunction, replaces a
temporary restraining order granted after the suit was filed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nvidia, based in Santa Clara, California, isn&#8217;t a defendant
in the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Advanced Micro Devices v. Feldstein, 13-cv-40007, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts
(Boston). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goldman Sachs Tax Deal Didn&#8217;t Break U.K. Law, Judge Rules &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s deal with the U.K. government
that may have saved the investment bank as much as 20 million
pounds ($30.6 million) on its taxes didn&#8217;t break any laws, a
judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue  Customs&#8217;s decision to reduce the
New York-based bank&#8217;s tax bill was properly conducted, a judge
in London ruled yesterday. Still, Judge Andrew Nicol criticized
tax officials who considered the potential embarrassment to
Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne if a deal with
Goldman Sachs wasn&#8217;t completed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. government has pledged to clamp down on tax-avoidance schemes following widespread media and public anger
caused by corporation tax structures in the country. Lawmakers
said in a report last month that increased transparency about
companies&#8217; tax affairs would build pressure on multinational
businesses to &#8220;pay a fair share.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UK Uncut Legal Action, an advocacy group that lobbies for
alternatives to government spending cuts, said HMRC reached the
agreement with Goldman Sachs on the day Osborne announced a
bankers&#8217; code to counter tax avoidance. An HMRC executive said
in an e-mail cited by UK Uncut that he was concerned the bank
might drop out of the code if the deal was scuttled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Obviously while we are deeply disappointed that this deal
has not been declared unlawful, the judge&#8217;s ruling that top HMRC
officials played politics with major tax deals to protect
Osborne&#8217;s reputation is a major victory in exposing the truth
behind these secret deals,&#8221; Anna Walker, campaigns director of
UK Uncut Legal Action, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs wasn&#8217;t involved in the litigation. Fiona
Laffan, a London-based spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, declined
to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is a judicial review, a legal mechanism that
examines the decision-making process of public bodies. While an
authority may be ordered to reconsider an action, it may be
allowed to draw the same conclusion provided all procedures are
correctly followed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp (MSFT) (MSFT). is revamping the Xbox to fend off a breed of competitors ranging from Apple Inc (AAPL) (AAPL). to Facebook Inc. (FB) Those companies were nowhere in gaming when the software maker debuted its last version five years ago. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now these newcomers -- along with the likes of Google Inc. (GOOG) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) -- are posing a threat by introducing their own software and devices that let consumers access an array of games and entertainment on smartphones, computers and home electronics. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Where once Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox had only to contend with Sony Corp. (SNE)&#8217;s PlayStation and Nintendo Co.&#8217;s Wii, there&#8217;s now a plethora of devices boasting robust graphics and computing power, capable of downloading games from the Internet and connecting TVs in the living room to gadgets throughout the house. That&#8217;s putting pressure on Microsoft to make the new Xbox -- to be unveiled tomorrow at an event in Redmond, Washington -- capable of delivering more programming, entertainment and services, moving it further beyond the gaming realm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This has to last them in the living room for four to 10 years,&#8221; said Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner Inc. in San Francisco. &#8220;They have to think about what&#8217;s coming in five years and compete against the two generations of tablets which will come out during that time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The yen may decline to its weakest
level against the dollar in more than four and a half years
after breaking a key level of support, according to JPMorgan
Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Japanese currency will face a test at 103.50 per dollar
after breaching the 103-to-103.10 area on May 17, according to
Niall O&#8217;Connor, a technical analyst at JPMorgan in New York. If
the yen declines past that support level, it may target 105.50,
the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the currency&#8217;s 2007
high, O&#8217;Connor said. That would be its weakest level since
October 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It could pause a little bit near-term, but the bottom
line is that the dollar-yen breakout is still holding,&#8221;
O&#8217;Connor said in a telephone interview. &#8220;The jury is still out
on the 103 level, but the overall upside bias is still intact.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yen increased 0.9 percent to 102.28 per dollar at 2:23
p.m. in New York after reaching 101.97. The currency gained 0.5
percent to 131.85 per euro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index. Resistance refers to an
area on a chart where sell orders may be clustered, and support
is an area where there may be buy orders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fibonacci analysis, based on the work of 13th century
mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, known as Fibonacci, is founded
on the theory that prices rise or fall by certain percentages
after reaching a new high or low. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Barclays Plc
are lifting their forecasts for U.S. junk-bond returns as this
year&#8217;s rally exceeds the expectations of top-rated credit
strategists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays analysts predict high-yield bonds may gain 8
percent in 2013, as much as four percentage points more than
their original expectation, wrote strategists led by Jeffrey Meli and Bradley Rogoff in a May 17 report. JPMorgan sees
&#8220;modest upside risk to our original full-year return forecast
of 7 to 8 percent for U.S. high yield&#8221; and now expects gains of
as much as 10 percent, according to strategists led by Jan
Loeys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculative-grade bonds have posted average annual returns
of 21 percent since 2008 as the Federal Reserve pumped more than
$2.5 trillion into the financial system to galvanize economic
growth. Junk notes have gained 5.3 percent this year, almost the
same as in the similar period of 2012, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data, and exceeding the 3.1 percent
full-year 2013 prediction in December by Morgan Stanley (MS)
strategists led by Adam Richmond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junk debt&#8217;s &#8220;value is still higher than fixed-income
alternatives given low defaults and volatility,&#8221; wrote JPMorgan
strategists in a May 17 global asset allocation report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calpers, which cast votes for 12.9 million of the New York-based bank&#8217;s shares, also withheld support for three members of
the board&#8217;s risk committee: Ellen Futter, president of the

&lt;p&gt;The falling cost of financing U.K.
water assets may boost merger activity in the industry even amid
a regulatory price review, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The MA interest in the U.K. water sector reflects the
low cost of finance for regulated assets despite a regulatory
tariff reset next year&#8221; by Ofwat, Goldman Sachs analysts Andrew Mead and Fred Barasi wrote in a May 17 note to clients, citing
declines in yields of U.K. government bonds this year that are
index-linked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the attraction in U.K. utilities stems from a
decline in real interest rates, with index-linked gilt yields
from the U.K. government bonds now in negative levels, Goldman
Sachs wrote, adding that real interest rates are expected to be
negative for 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman note came after Severn Trent Plc (SVT), the U.K.&#8217;s
second-largest publicly traded water utility, rejected a
possible takeover approach last week from Kuwait Investment
Office, Borealis Infrastructure Management Inc. and Britain&#8217;s
Universities Superannuation Scheme, saying it undervalued the
company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severn Trent shares have risen 12 percent in the past week
compared with 5.3 percent by the U.K.&#8217;s biggest publicly traded
water company, United Utilities Group Plc (UU/), and 7.5 percent by
Pennon Group Plc (PNN), the U.K.&#8217;s third-largest water utility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Severn approach occurred at a time when Ofwat is
consulting on prices that water and sewerage companies must
deliver for the years 2015 to 2020, with final prices to be
published next year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerging-market stocks face
fundamental headwinds as 2013 earnings revisions for most major
&#8220;country sectors&#8221; are negative and growth in the four biggest
economies is disappointing, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We remain concerned that earnings-per-share forecasts
will continue to fall,&#8221; Adrian Mowat, Hong Kong-based chief
Asia and emerging-market strategist at JPMorgan, wrote in a
report dated May 18. While growth in gross domestic product is
&#8220;low,&#8221; earnings per share are estimated to rise 16 percent
this year after falling 4 percent in 2012, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year-to-date performance for emerging equities relative
to the U.S. is the worst since 1995 and the worst on record
against the world, Mowat said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Emerging Markets Index rose 0.2 percent at 12:30
p.m. in London, trimming this year&#8217;s decline to 0.7 percent.
MSCI BRIC Index of equities from Brazil, Russia, India and China
has dropped 1.1 percent this year. That compares with a 13
percent increase in the MSCI World Index of developed-country
stocks and 17 percent jump in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has an underweight allocation for Russia, China,
South Africa, Korea, Taiwan and Colombia, a recommendation to
hold less than benchmark indexes. It&#8217;s overweight Turkey, India,
Mexico, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the
Philippines and Peru, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) plans to
invest as much as 50 billion yen ($487 million) in renewable
energy projects in Japan in the next five years, tapping demand
for electricity produced from solar and wind-power generators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street firm also plans to take as much as 250
billion yen of bank loans and project-financing over the same
period to move ahead with projects that would cost a total of
300 billion yen, Hiroko Matsumoto, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman for
Goldman, said by telephone. The Nikkei newspaper reported the
plan earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan began offering incentives in July through feed-in
tariffs to encourage renewables after the Fukushima nuclear-plant crisis stemming from the March 11, 2011 earthquake and
tsunami. Japan has been forced to slash its reliance on atomic
power generation since Fukushima. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe that we can leverage our global expertise in
investing in renewable energy in places such as the U.S. and
India, to help expand Japan&#8217;s renewable power capabilities,&#8221;
Ankur Sahu, co-head of the merchant banking division in the
Asia-Pacific, said by e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs formed the Japan Renewable Energy Co. unit in
August to plan, design and operate power plants run on sun,
wind, fuel cells and biomass fuels, it said on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Investor Attraction &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renewable energy has attracted interest from investors
ranging from billionaire Masayoshi Son&#8217;s Softbank Corp. (9984) and
financial-services company Orix Corp. (8591) to the country&#8217;s biggest
banks led by Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan will probably become the largest solar market in the
world after China this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commercial and utility-scale projects will boost solar
installations to a range of 6.1 gigawatts to 9.4 gigawatts in
2013, exceeding an earlier forecast of 3.2 gigawatts to 4
gigawatts, Bloomberg New Energy Finance said in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies that stand to benefit include Kyocera Corp. (6971),
Sharp Corp. and Suntech Power Japan Corp., all of which make and
sell solar panels for residential and industrial use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s Jamie Dimon prepares for a vote tomorrow on whether he should keep his chairman and chief executive officer titles, he may take comfort knowing most of his biggest shareholders are led by men with the same dual role. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seven of JPMorgan&#8217;s 10 largest owners -- including top five BlackRock Inc. (BLK), Vanguard Group Inc., State Street Corp. (STT), Wellington Management Co. and FMR LLC -- are run by CEOs who are also chairmen. The top 10 hold a combined 29.5 percent of New York-based JPMorgan&#8217;s stock, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;People just like him are going to vote on this,&#8221; said Erik Gordon, a business and law professor at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. &#8220;If you&#8217;ve told your own board that the best structure for the sake of the company is to combine the roles, then how do you turn around and say, &#8216;But that&#8217;s not true for JPMorgan?&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of JPMorgan&#8217;s top 10 shareholders, only Baltimore-based T. Rowe Price, the seventh-biggest with a 2.15 percent stake, has commented publicly on Dimon&#8217;s role. Brian Rogers -- T. Rowe Price&#8217;s chairman and chief investment officer, and not the CEO - - said in a May 16 statement that &#8220;I fully support the combined chairman and CEO role at JPMorgan under the superb leadership of Jamie Dimon.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Senate Judiciary Committee
approved legislation revising U.S. immigration law that includes
an agreement between Senator Orrin Hatch and Democrats on visas
for high-skilled foreign workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 13-5 to approve the
measure authored by a group of four Democrats and four
Republicans. Republican Hatch and two Republican co-authors of
the bill, Jeff Flake of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South
Carolina, joined all of the panel&#8217;s Democrats in voting for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with the Republican support, Flake said the measure
will require more changes on the Senate floor to win passage
there and have a chance in the Republican-led House. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of work to do on this, but this was a great
process,&#8221; Flake said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, has
said he wants to bring the measure to the full Senate &#8220;as soon
as it&#8217;s ready,&#8221; probably in early June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Patrick Leahy, the committee chairman and a Vermont

couples after Democrats and Republicans unanimously spoke
against it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We now know this is going to blow the agreement apart,&#8221;
said Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t want to blow this bill apart.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Obama Statement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama in a statement after the vote
congratulated the committee on its approval of the bill and said
the measure &#8220;meets the challenge of fixing our broken
immigration system.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several provisions Hatch proposed &#8220;were absolutely
unacceptable; we tried to find those things that were acceptable
and to build upon them, and I think we&#8217;ve reached a reasonable
compromise,&#8221; said Illinois Senator Richard Durbin, the
chamber&#8217;s second-ranking Democrat and a co-author of the
immigration proposal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate measure, S.744, seeks to balance a path to
citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S.,
sought by Democrats, with enough border-security improvements to
satisfy Republicans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accord with Hatch, a Utah Republican, would change the
formula for calculating the number of visas for foreign
technology workers while keeping the bill&#8217;s limit of 180,000 a
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Rigorous Standards&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would lift a requirement that companies look for a U.S.
worker before hiring a foreign visa holder for all companies
except those whose workforce is more than 15 percent foreign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If a firm has more than 15 percent foreign employees,
there are going to be more rigorous standards in terms of
recruitment and making these jobs available to Americans,&#8221;
Durbin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had pushed for protections for U.S. workers to be
included. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durbin, Democratic Senator Charles Schumer of New York and
other authors of the Senate immigration bill had been courting
Hatch&#8217;s vote. Hatch had said he would oppose the measure unless
Democrats agreed to his amendments favoring technology companies
that seek to hire more high-skilled foreign workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This took a while,&#8221; Schumer told the committee today.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a compromise.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Good Balance&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amendment included Hatch&#8217;s proposal to require
employers to show that a U.S. worker wasn&#8217;t available only when
they initially hire a foreign employee, not with each visa
extension. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our amendment strikes a good balance,&#8221; Hatch told fellow
Judiciary Committee members. He said it ensures that &#8220;no U.S.
worker has been or will be displaced&#8221; by a foreign worker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unions led by the AFL-CIO labor federation said technology
companies are trying to use the H-1B visa program for high-skilled foreign workers to undermine job security and
opportunities for U.S. workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hatch&#8217;s amendments &#8220;are unambiguous attacks on American
workers,&#8221; AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said in an e-mailed
statement. The amendments &#8220;would mean that American
corporations could fire American workers in order to bring in
H-1B visa holders at lower wages,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durbin said he didn&#8217;t expect an endorsement from labor
organizations, &#8220;but we at least have worked with them and
respected their input and have tried to reach an agreement that
is close to the values they bring to the table.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;100 Amendments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During its deliberations, the Judiciary Committee adopted
about 100 amendments to the measure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky told
reporters earlier today he was &#8220;hopeful&#8221; the Senate could pass
immigration legislation, adding that Republican senators share
&#8220;a view the status quo is not good.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McConnell said he would vote to bring the bill to the floor
so it could be opened up for amendments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate bill initially would raise the annual H-1B visa
limit for high-skilled foreign workers to 135,000 from 85,000.
Caps in future years could increase to 180,000, depending on
economic conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measure would require companies to recruit U.S. workers
before hiring foreign ones. Technology companies say that
invites bureaucratic scrutiny by the government and lawsuits
from U.S. workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Changes &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hatch has said it will take more than a deal on high-skilled visas to win his backing when the measure is considered
by the full Senate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For his vote then, Hatch said lawmakers must agree to his
proposed changes regarding the taxes immigrants must pay and
social benefits they receive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re going to have to resolve those conflicts for me,
or I will have to vote against the bill on the floor,&#8221; Hatch
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hatch also said he wants to require immigrants who seek
citizenship to pay additional taxes and to make it clear that
unauthorized employment can&#8217;t count toward eligibility for
Social Security benefits. He is proposing a five-year waiting
period before those on the path to citizenship could receive
subsidies under the 2010 health-care law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposals improve the bill&#8217;s prospects for gaining the
60 votes needed for Senate passage and also for passing the
Republican-controlled House, Hatch said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If they do some of the things I think ought to be done,
then I think it&#8217;s got a chance,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durbin said the agreement didn&#8217;t include Hatch&#8217;s additional
requests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He&#8217;s bargaining for as many things as he can get,&#8221;
Durbin said, referring to Hatch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merck  Co. (MRK), the second-biggest U.S.
drugmaker, reached a deal to repurchase $5 billion of its shares
from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) as part of a buyback program
announced earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck will make an initial purchase of 99.5 million shares
based on current market prices, according to a statement today
from the Whitehouse Station, New Jersey-based company. The
transaction is expected to be completed by Nov. 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck, facing generic competition to what was once its
best-selling drug, earlier this month cut its full-year guidance
in anticipation of lower sales and said it would buy back as
much as $15 billion in shares. The move is a good use of cash
and may help appease investors who have lost 22 percent of their
value in the stock over the past six years, said Bill Smead,
chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The stock has been down so long,&#8221; Smead, whose firm owns
shares, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;There is nothing else
to do with the cash if you are already expensing your RD and
already paying a good dividend. If you have extra cash there is
really nothing to do with that than a share buyback unless you
are going to make an acquisition.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck sold bonds last week to fund some of the share
repurchases, which the company had said were to reach about $7.5
billion over 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This accelerated share repurchase demonstrates our
commitment to delivering increased value to shareholders in the
short term, while continuing to invest in the important
opportunities that will drive our long-term growth,&#8221; Merck
Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Frazier said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck rose 4.7 percent to $47.33 at the close in New York
time prior to the announcement. The drugmaker has gained 26
percent in the past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck has been struggling to boost profit since its once
top-selling asthma medicine Singulair began facing generic
competition in August and research setbacks have delayed new
products. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s ESPN sports
television division fired several hundred workers today, part of
a companywide drive to improve profitability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firings number fewer than 400 and include unfilled
positions, according to a person with knowledge of the situation
who wasn&#8217;t authorized to speak publicly and asked not to be
named. ESPN, based in Bristol, Connecticut, announced the cuts
in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are implementing changes across the company to enhance
our continued growth while smartly managing costs,&#8221; ESPN said
in the statement. &#8220;While difficult, we are confident that it
will make us more competitive, innovative and productive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cuts amount to less than 6 percent of ESPN&#8217;s 7,000
employees worldwide. Disney, the world&#8217;s largest entertainment
company, has made an ongoing review of costs a crucial part of
its strategy, along with growth at its parks, media networks and
consumer products unit, to increase profit margins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company eliminated 150 jobs from its film studio in
April and shut down video-game development in Austin, Texas, and
at the recently acquired Lucasfilm Ltd., as part of broad
efficiency effort this year. The company said May 7 that fiscal
second-quarter profit rose 32 percent to $1.51 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cuts were previously reported by the sports news
website Deadspin.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, fell 0.4 percent to
$65.83 at the close in New York. The stock has risen 32 percent
this year, compared with 17 percent for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s
500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Whitney Kisling" date="May 21, 2013  5:05 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-21/s-p-500-may-reach-2-100-as-gains-last-through-2015-goldman-says.html"><headline>S&amp;amp;P 500 May Reach 2,100, Goldman Sachs Says</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the
U.S. stock-market rally may last at least another 2 1/2 years,
sending the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index (SPX) up 26 percent to 2,100. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Kostin, the bank&#8217;s New York-based chief U.S. equity
strategist, raised forecasts for the U.S. equity benchmark,
predicting it will finish 2013 at 1,750 and 2014 at 1,900 as
stock valuations increase, according to a research report dated
yesterday. The SP 500 trades at 16.3 times reported operating
profit, 16 percent below the average since 1998, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our positive 2013 outlook for SP 500 has played out much
faster than we expected,&#8221; Kostin wrote. &#8220;Reasons for a higher
multiple include increased confidence in the medium-term outlook
for U.S. economic growth, improving investor risk appetite and
the wide gap between equity and bond yields that we now assume
will be closed more by stocks than bonds.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s increase comes after Thomas Lee, JPMorgan
Chase  Co.&#8217;s chief U.S. equity strategist, lifted his estimate
to 1,715 from 1,580 last week. The SP 500 has surged 17 percent
in 2013 as companies beat earnings estimates and the Federal
Reserve continued its unprecedented bond-buying program known as
quantitative easing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The equity benchmark gained 0.2 percent to 1,669.16 at 4
p.m. New York time today. The index has rallied 128 days without
a retreat exceeding 5 percent or more, the longest stretch since
the 173 days ending Feb. 20, 2007, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dividend Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP 500 companies from Apple Inc. to Clorox Co. raised
dividends this year, giving the index a higher dividend increase
than earnings expansion for the first quarter, according to
Kostin. Dividends will rise 30 percent by 2015, with an 11
percent increase this year, adding about 150 points to the SP
500, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Dividend growth has been pretty robust,&#8221; Kostin said in
a phone interview today. &#8220;A lot of companies with these super
high margins are distributing more cash to shareholders with
high dividends.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Excess Returns &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks are poised to gain during the next five years
thanks to record-low interest rates on government bonds,
according to researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York. A survey of 29 models for the equity risk premium -- the
expected future return of stocks over the risk-free rate offered
by Treasuries -- shows &#8220;we will enjoy historically high excess
returns for the SP 500,&#8221; Fed economists Fernando Duarte and
Carlo Rosa said in a paper released on May 8. The premium rose
to a record 5.4 percent in December, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 added 2.1 percent last week, its fourth
straight weekly gain, as gauges of leading economic indicators
and consumer sentiment beat estimates. The U.S. bull market has
entered its fifth year, adding about $11.5 trillion in market
value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s certainly been a substantial and powerful move in
equity prices in a short period of time, there&#8217;s no question,&#8221;
Kostin said today. &#8220;This year, basically all that market move
has been valuation-driven,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The economy&#8217;s re-accelerating from a multi-year period of stagnation to an above-trend growth rate, and that would be consistent with P/E
expansion.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) and Starbucks
Corp. (SBUX) are among 19 retailers opting out of a $7.25 billion
antitrust settlement with Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) over
fees charged to merchants to process credit-card transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed settlement would maintain and strengthens an
anticompetitive system that allows Visa and MasterCard to fix
so-called swipe fees for banks, the companies said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It would allow credit card companies and big banks to
perpetuate an unfair and broken system that costs all
consumers,&#8221; Mike Cook, senior vice president of finance for
Wal-Mart, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement, estimated to be the largest-ever U.S.
antitrust accord, has drawn criticism from trade associations
and retailers contending that it grants the card companies too
much leeway to raise rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa, based Foster City, California, and MasterCard, based
in Purchase, New York, agreed to settle the case to resolve the
legal battle over interchange fees, which are charged to
merchants when customers pay with credit cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement received tentative approval from a federal
judge in Brooklyn, New York, in November. A hearing on final
approval is set for Sept. 12. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) (MSFT) unveiled its first new Xbox in almost eight years, seeking to position the console at the center of games and home entertainment against a growing roster of competitors that includes Apple Inc. (AAPL) (AAPL) to Facebook Inc. (FB) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The device is called Xbox One, Don Mattrick, president of Microsoft&#8217;s Interactive Entertainment division, said today in Redmond, Washington, where he unveiled the product. The player, set to go on sale later this year, will use voice commands and motion sensing to recognize users and let them switch seamlessly between games, live TV and Skype video calling. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the top seller in U.S. consoles for more than two years, faces fresh competition from Sony Corp. (6758)&#8217;s PlayStation 4, also set for release near year-end, and Nintendo Co. (7974)&#8217;s Wii U, introduced last November. It must fend off Apple, Facebook (FB), Google Inc. (GOOG) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), which all now offer an array of entertainment services, software and products. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new machine marks the first time Microsoft &#8220;has not introduced a console that is first and foremost about gaming,&#8221; said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies Inc. Exclusive content deals could help the company sell more players even as the traditional game audience fragments onto mobile devices, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To underscore the broader approach, Microsoft said it will produce a live-action TV show based on its best-selling &#8220;Halo&#8221; alien shooting game. Director Steven Spielberg, famous for films such as the &#8220;Indiana Jones&#8221; series and &#8220;Jaws,&#8221; will have a role in the production, the company said, without providing details. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fantasy Football &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft also struck a deal with the National Football League, letting the company develop applications like fantasy football games for use on the Xbox and mobile devices. The NFL will give players and coaches Microsoft products such as the Surface tablet for use on-field. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Team Xbox is on a new mission: design and build an all-in-one system to light up a new generation of games, TV and entertainment,&#8221; Mattrick said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the one system you&#8217;re going to use and love every day, the place where your games and entertainment come alive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company calls the new features &#8220;intelligent TV.&#8221; Prices won&#8217;t be revealed today, according to David Dennis, a spokesman. Games from the current model, which sells for $180 at Amazon.com, won&#8217;t work on the new Xbox, Dennis said. The company will allow trade-ins and resales of games for the new player. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Kinect Included &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Kinect controller will be included with each Xbox, the company said, allowing Microsoft and developers to create products around the device&#8217;s motion, voice and visual recognition capabilities. The Kinect will recognize users and show them a customized TV guide and a dashboard with the last five things they&#8217;ve done on the device. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kinect has been improved to operate better in low light, the company said. It uses a custom chip developed in Microsoft&#8217;s Mountain View, California, office and employs technology the company calls &#8220;time of flight&#8221; that works by tracking the speed of photons bouncing off the user to a sensor. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new machine is black and horizontally oriented. It is eight to 10 times more powerful than the Xbox 360 and will run on an 8-core system-on-a-chip processor from Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD). The Xbox One will include 8 gigabytes of random access memory and a Blu-ray disc player, the company said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft fell 0.7 percent to $34.85 at the close in New York. The stock has risen 30 percent this year, compared with a 17 percent gain for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Mobile Market &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shifts in the market, especially in mobile, are pressuring Microsoft to make the new Xbox capable of delivering more entertainment and services, moving further from video games. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. retail sales of packaged video games fell 21 percent last year to $8.9 billion, according to researcher NPD Group, while revenue from games downloaded to computers and mobile devices rose 16 percent to $5.9 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This has to last them in the living room for four to 10 years,&#8221; said Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner Inc. in San Francisco. &#8220;They have to think about what&#8217;s coming in five years and compete against the two generations of tablets which will come out during that time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI), the largest U.S. game producer, provided a first look at &#8220;Call of Duty: Ghosts,&#8221; the next version of its top-selling game franchise. Downloadable content for the game will be available on Xbox first. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fresh Titles &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft also announced a strategic partnership with Electronic Arts Inc. (EA), the second-largest U.S. video-game maker. The Redwood City, California-based game publisher will supply exclusive content from its soccer, football, basketball and fighting titles next year, Andrew Wilson, executive vice president of EA Sports, said at the briefing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it plans to offer 15 exclusive games in the first year, including eight completely new titles. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Xbox is one of Microsoft&#8217;s better-performing businesses. Sales in the entertainment and devices unit, including Xbox, rose 56 percent in the quarter that ended March 31. Operating income totaled $342 million, compared with a loss a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fiscal 2012, the entertainment unit saw sales increase 7.6 percent, while revenue in Microsoft&#8217;s Windows division dropped 3.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Industry leadership is no guarantee of future success. In November 2005, when Microsoft took the wraps off the Xbox 360, Sony led in console sales, only to came up short with the PlayStation 3 after Nintendo&#8217;s Wii upended the market with a motion-activated controller. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;U.S. Sales &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nintendo has sold 41.2 million of its first-generation Wii players in the U.S., compared with 39 million Xbox 360 consoles and 24.2 million Sony PlayStation 3s, according to NPD Group Inc., the Port Washington, New York-based researcher. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This time Xbox comes in with 28 months of market-leading sales in the U.S., according to NPD, outgunning Sony and the Wii-U, which is selling below Nintendo&#8217;s projections. Microsoft has sold 76 million Xbox 360 consoles worldwide and has 46 million subscribers to the Xbox Live online service. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Worldwide the video game industry generated hardware and software sales of $37.4 billion last year, according to Gartner. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Dina Bass" date="May 21, 2013  1:05 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-21/vmware-public-cloud-software-challenges-amazon-microsoft.html"><headline>VMware Public Cloud Software Challenges Amazon, Microsoft</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;VMware Inc. (VMW) is debuting a service
that lets customers use the Web to access information and
programs stored in its data centers, an effort to challenge
Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) in cloud computing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early testers of the vCloud Hybrid Service include News
Corp. (NWSA)&#8217;s Fox Broadcasting and the state of Michigan, VMware Chief
Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger in an interview. The product
will be more widely available in the third quarter, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VMware, the biggest provider of software that lets
computers run multiple operating systems, is expanding in cloud-computing to bolster sales as U.S. customers trim technology 
spending. With the new product, VMware is entering the 
fastest-growing part of the cloud market, according to Gartner 
Inc., which estimates that sales of so-called infrastructure-as-a-service will surge by an average 38 percent annually to 
$30.6 billion by 2017 from $6.17 billion last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Customers are asking for it -- clearly the whole public
cloud service area has been growing and maturing,&#8221; Gelsinger
said. While he declined to provide pricing information, he said
VMware&#8217;s service will be more expensive than similar offerings
from Amazon, the market leader, and Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gelsinger said VMware&#8217;s new offering can command a premium
because it lets users easily move applications between so-called
private clouds, where software and services are run on customers&#8217;
own machines, to public ones on VMware&#8217;s servers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cloud Partners &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft rolled out an infrastructure-as-a-service product 
last month along with a pledge to match Amazon&#8217;s prices on certain

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon won shareholder support to remain chairman,
surviving a campaign to split the roles after a record trading
loss at the biggest U.S. bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal to divide Dimon&#8217;s duties won 32.2 percent of
the votes, down from 40 percent last year, the bank said today
at its annual meeting in Tampa, Florida. Dimon, 57, had told
some investors he might quit if the non-binding measure passed,
according to a person with knowledge of the conversation, who
requested anonymity because the discussion was private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vote to back Dimon, who guided JPMorgan to three
straight years of record profit, is a defeat for investors who
say companies need the balance of a separate chairman and CEO.
While Dimon can keep both jobs, the vote may spur JPMorgan&#8217;s
directors to tighten how they oversee the company after
last year&#8217;s $6.2 billion &#8220;London Whale&#8221; trading loss and
identify a future successor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPMorgan changes after this annual meeting season, even
if all the votes go in the direction&#8221; JPMorgan wanted, Michael Mayo, an analyst at CLSA Ltd., told Bloomberg Television&#8217;s Erik
Schatzker in Tampa today. The bank could give more authority to
lead director Lee R. Raymond, the former chairman and CEO of
Exxon Mobil Corp., or split Dimon&#8217;s roles after he leaves, a
person with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s risk committee
could undergo changes in its membership, said Lee R. Raymond,
the bank&#8217;s lead director. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In terms of the composition of the risk committee, you
should stay tuned,&#8221; Raymond said today at the firm&#8217;s annual
meeting in Tampa, Florida. He was responding to a question from
Mike Mayo, an analyst at CLSA Ltd., on why the board didn&#8217;t
overhaul the committee following last year&#8217;s risk-management
failures in the chief investment office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholders are scheduled to vote on three members of the
risk committee, including Ellen Futter, 63, David Cote, 60, and
James Crown, 59. Futter, president of the American Museum of
Natural History in New York, wasn&#8217;t able to attend the
shareholder meeting, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A majority of preliminary ballots supported the three risk-committee members, according to the New York Times. Among them,
Futter received the least support, the newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futter didn&#8217;t immediately respond to phone and e-mail
messages seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ended a
seven-year investment in Industrial  Commercial Bank of China
Ltd. by selling a $1.1 billion stake in the world&#8217;s largest
lender by market value, a person familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank sold 1.58 billion shares in ICBC at HK$5.50
each, the person said, asking not to be identified as the
information is private. That&#8217;s a 2.5 percent discount to ICBC&#8217;s
closing price yesterday in Hong Kong trading. The Beijing-based
bank closed 2.1 percent lower at HK$5.52 today, paring its gain
for the past year to 19 percent. Singapore&#8217;s state-owned Temasek
Holdings Private Ltd. bought 280 million ICBC shares, increasing
its stake to 7.04 percent, according to disclosures posted the
Hong Kong stock exchange website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street firm joins Citigroup Inc. (C) and Bank of
America Corp. in cutting holdings in China as new capital rules
known as Basel III make it more expensive to hold minority
stakes in banks. Goldman Sachs has reaped about $12 billion in
sales proceeds and dividends from its $2.58 billion investment
in ICBC, calculations by Macquarie Capital Securities Ltd. show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Many foreign banks are facing capital shortages with the
new Basel requirement, so I&#8217;m not surprised that they dumped
holdings in Chinese banks on which they&#8217;ve already made massive
returns,&#8221; said Chen Xingyu, a Shanghai-based analyst at Phillip
Securities Group. &#8220;The exit strategy has been on the table for
these foreign investors since the very beginning because they
know these aren&#8217;t real strategic investments.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and client funds offloaded ICBC shares at
least five times before the latest transaction after first
investing in ICBC in 2006. Connie Ling, a spokeswoman for New
York-based Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong, declined to comment today
on the latest sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Capital Deductions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New rules set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
require punitive capital deductions for holding minority
investments in other financial institutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217; Tier 1 common ratio was about 12.7 percent
under Basel I and an estimated 9 percent under Basel III, Chief
Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup sold its entire stake in Shanghai Pudong
Development Bank in March 2012, nine years after buying it, for
an after-tax gain of $349 million. Bank of America sold 10.4
billion shares of China Construction Bank Corp. in November 2011
for a profit of about $1.8 billion, its fourth sale, leaving it
with a 1 percent stake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICBC last month reported a 12 percent increase in first-quarter profit, defying a sluggish domestic economy to boost
lending. The world&#8217;s most profitable lender extended 461 billion
yuan ($75 billion) of new loans in the first quarter, 25 percent
more than in the same period a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Low Valuations &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank and its closest local rivals are trading near
record-low valuations on concern that profit growth may slow as
loans sour and the government deregulates interest rates. ICBC
trades at about six times estimated 2013 earnings, down from a
high of 21 times in early 2008, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s good timing for Goldman to sell its stake in ICBC,&#8221;
said Rainy Yuan, an analyst in Shanghai at Masterlink Securities
Corp. &#8220;Valuations of Chinese banks will remain low as China&#8217;s
interest-rate liberalization is a long-term trend which will
hurt lenders&#8217; profits.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-rating companies have also warned that China isn&#8217;t
reducing risks from local-government debt and credit expansion
fast enough. China&#8217;s shadow banking system -- which includes
private lending, trust loans, and credit from non-bank
institutions -- poses systemic risks to the nation&#8217;s financial
industry after expanding by more than 67 percent over the past
two years, Moody&#8217;s Investors Service said earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Soured Loans &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese banks&#8217; nonperforming loans increased for a sixth
straight quarter, the longest streak in at least nine years, to
526.5 billion yuan as of March 31, regulatory data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe NPL figures greatly understate the potential
scope of the problem of poor quality loans,&#8221; Carson Block, the
short seller who runs Muddy Waters LLC, said in an e-mailed
reply to queries. &#8220;Our concerns implicate loans throughout the
economy -- both public and private sector.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Block said this month that he&#8217;s betting against the debt of
Standard Chartered Plc (STAN), in part because an economic slowdown in
China will lead to &#8220;considerable stress&#8221; at the U.K. lender,
which gets two-thirds of profit from Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global financial firms including Temasek Holdings Pte
invested $33 billion in Chinese lenders from 2001 to 2009,
according to the regulator. They still own at least $45 billion
of stakes in local banks, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since acquiring the stake in ICBC in 2006, Goldman Sachs
has recorded $3.47 billion in net gains on the position,
according to company filings through the first quarter of 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of March, Goldman Sachs had a $1.11 billion position in
ICBC on its own balance sheet, down from $2.08 billion at the
end of December because of a sale in January, according to the
firm&#8217;s 10-Q filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), continental
Europe&#8217;s biggest bank, was cut to neutral from overweight by
JPMorgan Chase  Co., which said tighter regulation threatens
capital levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision&#8217;s proposed
revision to a securitization framework governing riskier assets
would reduce Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank&#8217;s common equity Tier
1 capital ratio under Basel III rules to as little as 8.6
percent in 2014 from 10.2 percent, JPMorgan analysts including
Kian Abouhossein said in a report to clients from London today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reversing an increase to Deutsche Bank&#8217;s rating three weeks
ago, JPMorgan said a 3 billion-euro ($3.9 billion) capital
increase on April 30 &#8220;was clearly a defensive move&#8221; to offset
the impact of &#8220;potential capital &#8216;curve balls&#8217; such as Basel
securitization proposals.&#8221; Regulators may publish the final
rules next year, JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank fell as much as 3.6 percent to 36.16 euros in
Frankfurt trading, heading for the biggest drop in a month. The
stock will trade at &#8220;a high implied risk premium&#8221; compared
with other European banks, rising to 38 euros by December, the
analysts said. JPMorgan prefers Barclays Plc (BARC), they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rules&#8217; Impact &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators are overhauling capital rules after widespread
securitization, or repackaged assets that are sliced up and sold
on to clients, in the U.S. mortgage market contributed to the
financial crisis by spreading risk from lenders to the so-called
shadow-banking industry. Banks have written to the Basel
committee to say the plans, which will force them to hold more
reserves against such products, will tie up capital and starve
the economy of credit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liquefied natural gas exports from
the U.S. are looking more likely after the Freeport LNG terminal
got conditional approval from the Department of Energy, Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freeport LNG Development LP&#8217;s project in Texas was the
second facility to receive approval from the Energy Department
to send gas to countries that don&#8217;t have free-trade agreements
with the U.S. The terminal would be able to export 1.4 billion
cubic feet a day. The development, partly owned by
ConocoPhillips (COP), Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) and Osaka Gas Co. (9532), still needs
approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These recent developments support our view that at least
6.8 billion cubic feet a day of liquefaction of capacity will be
built in the U.S.,&#8221; Goldman Sachs analysts led by London-based
Samantha Dart said in a report e-mailed today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market doesn&#8217;t need more than 7.7 billion cubic feet a
day of U.S. LNG for the next decade based on the bank&#8217;s demand
forecasts, according to the note. Gas prices at the Henry Hub in
Erath, Louisiana, need to stay at or below $5.10 per million
British thermal units to keep U.S. LNG competitive in Europe,
Goldman Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contract for June delivery rose as much as 0.4 percent
to $4.108 per million Btu in electronic trading today on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. Futures rose 0.9 percent to close at
$4.09 yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Assuming a normalized oil price of $100 a barrel, U.S.
gas would likely be cheaper than oil-indexed contracted
deliveries in Asia for Henry Hub prices at $6.60 per million
Btu,&#8221; Dart said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cheniere Energy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. conditionally approved Cheniere Energy Inc.&#8217;s (LNG)
Sabine Pass LNG Terminal in Louisiana in May 2011 for exports of
as much as 2.2 billion cubic feet a day. The government has
weighed 20 applications for export terminals in recent months,
which could ship the equivalent of 41 percent of U.S. total
production this year, Energy Department data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. may export 6.5 billion to 8.5 billion cubic feet a
day of gas by 2020, Adam Longson, an analyst at Morgan Stanley (MS)
in New York, said in an e-mailed report yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Energy Department &#8220;will only need to approve two more
projects by early- to mid-2016 in order for U.S. LNG exports to
reach the low end of our estimates,&#8221; Longson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henry Hub gas prices will average $3.80 per million Btu
this year, higher than the previous estimate of $3.52, the
Energy Information Administration said May 7 in its monthly
Short-Term Energy Outlook. The average may slump to $3.77 in the
third quarter before climbing to $3.92 during the final three
months of the year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, is offering investors a share exchange to reduce its
80.2 percent stake in Zoetis Inc. (ZTS), the animal-health business
that the company spun off almost four months ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shareholders will have the option of swapping their
shares for Zoetis stock in a tax-free transaction, New York-based Pfizer said in a statement today. If the exchange is fully
subscribed, Pfizer will no longer have a controlling interest,
leaving Madison, New Jersey-based Zoetis fully independent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exchange would end the latest stage of Pfizer Chief
Executive Officer Ian Read&#8217;s plans to slim down the company and
concentrate on producing new drugs. Pfizer agreed in April 2012
to sell its baby food unit to Nestle SA (NESN), the world&#8217;s biggest
food maker, for $11.9 billion. Zoetis shares have risen 29
percent since trading started in February after an initial
public offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The proceeds from the IPO plus the Pfizer share reduction
from this exchange will more than offset the lost income from
Zoetis,&#8221; Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst with International
Strategy  Investment Group LLC in New York said in a note to
clients. The timing was sooner than expected, and a positive for
Pfizer because it should add to earnings next year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s board, whose
top director told investors yesterday to &#8220;stay tuned&#8221; for
changes to its risk committee, isn&#8217;t likely to add new members
immediately, according to two people with knowledge of the
board&#8217;s thinking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board isn&#8217;t seeking to replace current members and may
take months to make any additions, the people said, asking not
to be named because the talks are private. Lead director Lee R. Raymond, 74, wants to strengthen the New York-based firm&#8217;s board
by adding executives with more experience in finance and
accounting after some shareholder groups opposed re-electing as
many as six risk- and audit-committee members, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 11-member board doesn&#8217;t see a need to rush additions to
those two panels after shareholders voted yesterday in favor of
every member and increased support for Jamie Dimon&#8217;s dual roles
as chairman and chief executive officer, the people said. Three
of the risk committee&#8217;s four members received less than 60
percent support from shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In terms of the composition of the risk committee, you
should stay tuned,&#8221; Raymond told investors yesterday at the
annual investor meeting in Tampa, Florida, shortly before the
preliminary voting results were made public. Kristin Lemkau, a
spokeswoman for the bank, declined to comment on the board&#8217;s
plans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toronto Mayor Rob Ford&#8217;s brother Doug
said media reports that the head of Canada&#8217;s largest city used
cocaine are untrue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our mayor faces yet another accusation, an accusation
driven by questionable reporting,&#8221; Doug Ford told reporters at
city hall today. &#8220;Rob is telling me these stories are untrue,
that these accusations are ridiculous, and I believe him.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Toronto Star reported that two of its reporters watched
a video allegedly showing Mayor Ford inhaling from a crack
cocaine pipe. Bloomberg News has not seen the video and can&#8217;t
verify its authenticity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m not speaking for the mayor. The mayor is my brother.
I love him and he&#8217;ll speak for himself,&#8221; said Doug Ford, who is
a city councilor. &#8220;My brother is an honest and hard-working man
with integrity, a man who has dedicated his life to serving
others.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rob Ford, 43, spoke briefly to reporters on May 17, calling
the video reports &#8220;ridiculous.&#8221; He had said the story in the
Toronto Star is another example of the newspaper &#8220;going after
me.&#8221; The mayor has ignored questions from reporters on whether
the video was doctored, if he has ever used crack cocaine, and
if it was him in the video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Toronto Police say they are reviewing allegations
against the mayor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology companies, including Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Intel Corp. (INTC), have failed at almost every turn in their quest to persuade federal lawmakers to let them hire more foreign-born workers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2003, Congress took back 130,000 temporary work visas. Four years later, Silicon Valley was surprised when proposed legislation didn&#8217;t come close to addressing companies&#8217; skilled-worker needs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After the 2007 loss, the industry took a new tack. Tech leaders helped write legislative drafts spelling out what they wanted; they broadened their pitch about immigration to include legalizing undocumented immigrants in the country; and they now are using social media to press their case. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We knew we had to get into the game early and go strong,&#8221; said Robert Hoffman, senior vice president of government relations for the Information Technology Industry Council, which lobbies for technology companies. &#8220;We knew we had to think several steps down the road.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Silicon Valley&#8217;s role in pushing for changes in immigration law adds economic urgency to a debate that for more than a decade has focused mostly on the treatment of 11 million undocumented residents. The tech community&#8217;s engagement also brought to the table companies with the power to mobilize thousands of supporters to join ranks with the Latino community. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the largest software
maker, will hire several thousand workers in China to support
new cloud computing services and smartphones using its Windows
operating system, Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workforce expansion, from a current base of 4,000
staff, will take place during the next year, Ballmer said
yesterday at a press conference in Shanghai that was streamed
live on the Internet. He didn&#8217;t provide a specific number for
new workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China has become the fastest growing market for the
company&#8217;s smartphone operating system, Ballmer said. The
Redmond, Washington-based company will start a public preview of
its Windows Azure service in the country next month, making
Microsoft the first multinational to offer public cloud
computing in the nation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I visited China last about one year ago in May and it is
remarkable to me how much has changed,&#8221; Ballmer, 57, said. &#8220;At
Microsoft this is an incredibly exciting time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is counting on Azure and Internet-based business
programs to bolster growth as a global personal-computer slump
erodes demand for its software installed on desktop machines.
Shipments of PCs dropped 13.9 percent in the first three months
of this year, the steepest quarterly decline ever, International
Data Corp. reported last month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forint rose to the strongest in
three months, spurring Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to close its
trade recommendation to sell Hungary&#8217;s currency against the euro
at a loss after the economy emerged from recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forint appreciated as much as 0.6 percent and traded
0.1 percent stronger at 289.21 per euro by 5:04 p.m. in
Budapest, the seventh day of advances and extending its gains in
the second quarter to 5.2 percent, the best performance among 31
major currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Goldman said on April 18
that the forint may weaken to 310 per euro, recommending that
investors close the trade if the exchange rate strengthens past
the 290 level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economy expanded 0.7 percent in the first quarter from
the last three months of 2012, the first quarterly growth in
more than a year, the Central Statistical Office said on May 15.
The expansion in output also supported Prime Minister Viktor
Orban&#8217;s efforts to meet EU budget targets and exit the bloc&#8217;s
excessive-deficit procedure this year, which would avert the
threat of cuts in development aid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We clearly underestimated the degree of risk premium for
weaker economic outcomes already embedded in the currency,&#8221;
Goldman analysts including Thomas Stolper in London wrote in a
research report dated yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Positive Catalysts&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;strong GDP print&#8221; and a &#8220;smooth outcome in the
ongoing budget negotiations with the EU,&#8221; emerged as &#8220;positive
catalysts&#8221; for the forint as the extra yield on Hungarian debt
over U.S. treasuries declines, the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on Hungary&#8217;s benchmark 10-year forint bonds were
little changed at 5.06 percent today after reaching a record-low
4.93 percent last week. Yields on U.S. Treasuries of the same
maturity rose four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to
1.97 percent. Hungary&#8217;s central bank cut its benchmark rate for
a ninth month to a record 4.75 percent on April 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman said last month that the forint would weaken on the
narrowing rate premium and as Hungary&#8217;s policy makers tolerate a
weaker forint level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our broader fundamental view has not changed, but having
just hit our recommended stop of 290, we recommend closing the
position,&#8221; the Goldman analysts said. The trade incurred a
&#8220;potential 2.86 percent loss including negative carry of about
32 basis points in total,&#8221; the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds&#8217; returns have stayed
&#8220;lackluster&#8221; this year, with the $2.3 trillion industry
trailing the gains of the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index by about
10 percentage points, according to Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds gained 5.4 percent on average through May 10,
compared with a 15.4 percent rise for the SP 500 (SPX) and a 14.8
percent increase for the typical mutual fund, a team of Goldman
Sachs analysts led by Amanda Sneider and David Kostin wrote in a
report released today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge-fund managers have been hurt in 2013 by their bearish
wagers on stocks, with &#8220;popular&#8221; shorts such as Johnson 
Johnson (JNJ) and Gilead Sciences Inc. rising more than the broader
equity market, Goldman Sachs said. Fewer than 5 percent of the
hedge funds tracked by New York-based Goldman Sachs are beating
the SP 500 or a typical mutual fund that buys stocks of the
biggest U.S. companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &#8220;multi-year trend of lackluster hedge-fund returns
continues in 2013,&#8221; the analysts wrote. &#8220;Strong long
performance was not enough to outweigh the drag from popular
short positions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds, which typically charge clients a 2 percent
management fee and 20 percent of any investment gains, are
private pools of capital that can bet on both rising and falling
asset prices. From the start of 2009 to the end of April this
year, the average fund has risen 21 percent after fees, compared
with a 77 percent gain for the U.S. benchmark SP 500, data
compiled by Bloomberg shows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkiye Sise  Cam Fabrikalari AS (SISE), Turkey&#8217;s biggest glass-making group, is working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Is Yatirim Menkul Degerler AS (ISMEN) to take its glassware unit public, two people with knowledge of the situation said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shares of the Istanbul-based unit, Pasabahce Cam Sanayi  Ticaret AS, may be sold late this year or early next, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans are private. Sisecam, owned by Turkiye Is Bankasi AS (ISCTR), the country&#8217;s biggest lender by assets, holds 99 percent of Pasabahce. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a public company, Pasabahce may be valued at about five times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, a November report by investment firm Oyak Yatirim Ortakligi AS estimates. Oyak also estimated Pasabahce&#8217;s Ebitda last year at 211 million liras ($114 million). The company&#8217;s book value was 494 million liras at end of September, the latest available data, according to a research note by the Ekspres Invest brokerage house. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IPOs in Europe, the Middle East and Africa have raised $7 billion this year, about 80 percent more than what companies sold in the same period in 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show. In the biggest Turkish IPO this year, low-cost carrier Pegasus Hava Tasimaciligi AS raised 650 million liras selling 35.3 million shares on April 22, valuing the company at 1.88 billion liras. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Unlocked Value &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ekspres Invest, an Istanbul-based brokerage owned by OAO Sberbank, said Jan. 24 that Pasabahce&#8217;s IPO would positively affect other companies in the group -- including Trakya Cam, Anadolu Cam, Soda Sanayii (SODA) -- as &#8220;the value of Pasabahce will be unlocked and the ownership structure will be more transparent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pasabahce posted 575 million liras in net sales and 13.8 million liras in net income in the first nine months of 2012, according to the company&#8217;s website. Sisecam shares gained 0.9 percent to 3.28 liras at 10:35 a.m. in Istanbul. Trakya Cam gained 2.25 percent and Anadolu Cam 1 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs spokeswoman didn&#8217;t reply to e-mailed questions. An Is Yatirim official declined to comment.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s Xbox video-gaming
system won&#8217;t be blocked from entering the U.S. after a trade
panel found it doesn&#8217;t infringe a patent owned by Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s
Motorola Mobility unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. International Trade Commission yesterday in
Washington found the Xbox doesn&#8217;t infringe Motorola&#8217;s patent for
a way to establish communication between the gaming-system and
accessories, such as the controllers, ending a case filed in
November 2010. The agency upheld a March ruling that cleared the
Xbox, which is made in China, of the infringement claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is part of a global dispute between the companies
over who is using whose patented inventions. Microsoft wants
Motorola Mobility to pay royalties on smartphones running on
Google&#8217;s Android operating system. Google claims Microsoft owes
Motorola Mobility royalties on the Xbox and Windows operating
system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, has argued that,
even if it violates the Motorola patent, banning the Xbox would
be an extreme remedy that would reduce consumer choice and hurt
game developers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a win for Xbox customers and confirms our view
that Google had no grounds to block our products,&#8221; Microsoft
Deputy General Counsel David Howard said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt Kallman, a spokesman for Google, said the company was
disappointed and evaluating its next steps. The case can be
appealed to a court that specializes in patent law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Top Seller &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Xbox has been the top-selling U.S. game console for
more than two years. Microsoft&#8217;s entertainment unit, which
includes the Xbox, generated $9.6 billion in sales last year, or
13 percent of the company&#8217;s revenue, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft unveiled a new version, called Xbox One, earlier
this week that employs voice commands and motion sensing to
recognize users and let them switch seamlessly between games,
live television and Skype video calling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system is scheduled to go on sale later this year as
part of Microsoft&#8217;s strategy to fend off competition from Sony
Corp. (6758)&#8217;s PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Co.&#8217;s Wii U, as well as new
devices from Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft won a trade commission case last year limiting
Motorola Mobility&#8217;s ability to include on its phones a feature
called ActiveSync, which lets users coordinate schedules between
their phones and personal computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Patent Disputes &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, based in Mountain View, California, and Microsoft
also have patent disputes in Germany and Seattle. Microsoft and
Apple have also filed complaints in the U.S. and Europe accusing
Motorola Mobility of demanding unfair royalty rates for some
patents that relate to widely used technology like Wi-Fi
connections or video transmission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other patents that originally were part of the Xbox case
fell into that category. Two patents that were part of the
original complaint were on standard technology for video
decoding, and led to accusations by Microsoft and regulators
that Motorola Mobility was misusing patents to thwart
competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility dropped those two after Google reached an
agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over the use of
standard-essential patents. Two other patents were dropped
because they are expiring this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement with the FTC also covered a review of the
company&#8217;s search business. Google is facing a new antitrust
probe by the FTC into whether the company is using its
leadership in the online display-advertising market to illegally
curb competition, people familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In the Matter of Gaming and Entertainment
Consoles, Related Software and Components Thereof, 337-752, U.S.
International Trade Commission (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) investors voted to approve pay packages of top managers after Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein&#8217;s total awards climbed 73 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The compensation plan was approved with 87 percent support in the non-binding vote, according to a tally disclosed in a regulatory filing today after the firm&#8217;s annual meeting in Salt Lake City. All of the bank&#8217;s directors were elected, including former Chief Financial Officer David Viniar, who joined the board in January. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blankfein, 58, was awarded $21 million for his performance in 2012, and received a $5 million long-term incentive. That was up from $12 million and a $3 million long-term award a year earlier. Shares of the New York-based bank climbed 41 percent in 2012, the most in three years, still leaving them 24 percent below their price at the end of 2010. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Proxy-advisory firm Glass Lewis  Co. said earlier this month that shareholders should oppose the bank&#8217;s executive-pay plan. Goldman Sachs has been &#8220;deficient&#8221; in linking compensation to company performance, Glass Lewis said. ISS Proxy Advisory Services USA supported the compensation program and said the increase in executive pay for 2012 reflected stronger company results. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shareholders rejected four measures proposed by investors and opposed by the board, according to the tallies, which include abstentions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Maximize Value &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;One requested that the board hire an investment bank to explore options for maximizing shareholder value, including a merger or sale of the company. It received 1.3 percent of the vote, according to data in the filing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two others would have required the bank to disclose the amount it spends on lobbying and to set up a committee to assess its policies on human rights. Those measures received 5.6 percent and 3.5 percent support, respectively. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another would give shareholders the ability to nominate their own selections for the board. It got support from 5.2 percent of the votes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs held the meeting for the first time at its offices in Salt Lake City, the bank&#8217;s second-largest U.S. location. The bank has shifted more of its staff to what it calls high-value locations in an effort to cut costs. About 22 percent of Goldman Sachs employees work in such places, which also include Dallas and Singapore, up from 10 percent in 2007, Blankfein said in November. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Michael J.

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein said his company is
committed to growing in China even after it ended a seven-year
investment in Industrial  Commercial Bank of China Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs this week sold a $1.1 billion stake in ICBC,
the world&#8217;s largest lender by market value, a person familiar
with the matter said. The firm reaped about $12 billion in sales
proceeds and dividends from its $2.58 billion investment in
ICBC, calculations by Macquarie Capital Securities Ltd. show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;ICBC is not the key to our interest in China, or the big
reflection of it,&#8221; Blankfein, 58, said in a Bloomberg
Television interview with Erik Schatzker. &#8220;We&#8217;re investing in
China because China -- I was going to say it&#8217;s the future, but
it&#8217;s a big part of the present as well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein said earlier this month that this will probably
be China&#8217;s century, even if it struggles in certain years.
China&#8217;s economic growth slowed to 7.7 percent in the first
quarter, and a report yesterday showed manufacturing is
contracting in May for the first time in seven months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs served as a &#8220;quasi-strategic&#8221; partner for
ICBC as the Chinese government took its banking industry public,
Blankfein said in the interview. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
investment banker will pay $100,000 to resolve U.S. regulatory
claims that he made improper contributions to a Massachusetts
treasurer while seeking state underwriting business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neil Morrison, who worked on then-Treasurer Tim Cahill&#8217;s
unsuccessful run for governor from November 2008 to October 2010
while he was employed by Goldman Sachs, also agreed to be barred
from the securities industry for five years, the Securities and
Exchange Commission said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These tough sanctions against Morrison show that we take
abuses of the pay-to-play rules in the municipal securities
industry very seriously and will hold individuals accountable
for their violations,&#8221; Elaine Greenberg, head of the SEC
enforcement division&#8217;s municipal securities unit, said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs in September agreed to pay about $14 million
to resolve the SEC&#8217;s claims. Morrison, who was fired by Goldman
Sachs in December 2010, and the New York-based bank settled
without admitting or denying wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We certainly agree with Ms. Greenberg of the SEC that
these sanctions are tough,&#8221; said Tom Kiley, Morrison&#8217;s
attorney. &#8220;The fact that this is the first time there has been
an industry bar for a violation of the pay-to-play rule is a
pretty good indication the law wasn&#8217;t clear at the time of the
conduct.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan (JPM) Chase  Co. is planning its
second sale of U.S. home-loan securities without government
backing since the financial crisis the debt helped to trigger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bonds will be backed by $443 million of &#8220;high-quality&#8221; so-called jumbo mortgages, according to statements e-mailed today by Kroll Bond Rating Agency and DBRS Ltd., which
expect to grant top grades to most of the notes. Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to immediately
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal, like a $616.3 million transaction in March by the
New York-based bank, contains relatively weak contractual
promises that lenders or the issuer will repurchase loans that
fail to match their promised quality, DBRS said. Sellers have
begun taking different approaches to those terms as issuance in
the so-called non-agency mortgage-bond market revives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, &#8220;the representations and warranties framework in
this transaction does show some improvements&#8221; from JPMorgan&#8217;s
last deal, including how fraud is defined, DBRS analysts
including Claire J. Mezzanotte and Quincy Tang said in the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DBRS and Kroll said that they took the weaker provisions
into account in assigning grades to the securities. Fitch
Ratings, which will also rate most of the notes, said in a
report that it was not asked to rank a $13.7 million slice
granted AAA ratings by those two firms. The risk of
the debt means it deserves an AA grade, two levels lower, Fitch
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Slow Acceleration &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issuance of non-agency bonds has been tied to about $6
billion of new loans this year, increasing from about $3.5
billion in all of 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Barclays Plc analysts said in a May 21 report that the expansion
will be slow to accelerate and maintained a 2013 forecast of $12
billion to $15 billion. Sales peaked at about $1.2 trillion in
each of 2005 and 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relative yields buyers demand on the bonds have been
widening as issuance increases and amid investor concern that
government-backed housing debt offered better value and that the
mortgages will prepay slower than expected if interest rates
rise or faster if they fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A May 17 offering by Redwood Trust Inc. (RWT) included $299
million of top-rated bonds that priced to yield 2.82 percent, or
1.90 percentage points more than benchmark swap rates. That
compared with spreads of 1.75 percentage points on similar
securities sold last month by the Mill Valley, California-based
firm and as low as 0.97 percentage point in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jumbo home loans are larger than allowed in government-supported programs, currently as much as $729,750 for single-family properties in high-cost areas. For Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac loans with the lowest costs for borrowers using 20 percent
down payments, limits range from $417,000 to $625,500. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge predicted earnings this

&lt;p&gt;The forecast suggests that profit will rise to about $3.79
a share in the period, excluding some items, up from $3.51 a
year earlier. That matches the average analyst prediction,

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
and Waterfund LLC, a risk-management provider, agreed to add
Uganda to their global Water Cost Index, the first African
member of the investing tool the companies announced in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement with Uganda&#8217;s Ministry of Water and
Environment will let IBM collect data to calculate the cost of
producing water, in dollars per cubic meter, said Peter Williams, chief technology officer of Big Green Innovations at
IBM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global water use has grown at more than twice the rate of
population increase over the last century, according to the
United Nations. A growing number of nations are turning to the
private sector to build and maintain water networks, and
information such as the water index may facilitate investment,
Williams said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The primary purpose is to enable more capital investment
in a sector that desperately needs it,&#8221; Williams said today in
an interview from Uganda. &#8220;This is not a price index -- it&#8217;s a
cost index. The price that you charge for water is an entirely
different decision than the cost of getting it there in the
first place.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first version of the index will be released next month
with information from about a half-dozen nations, he said. &#8220;The
goal is to build it out to 25 percent of the world&#8217;s GDP.&#8221; The
index will also include countries in Asia and the Americas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) linked
bonuses and promotions to employees&#8217; success in protecting the
firm&#8217;s reputation and put new restrictions on some client
transactions to avoid a repeat of the damage to its standing in
the wake of the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &#8220;new-activity committee&#8221; will evaluate and approve
suitability when clients undertake transactions that carry new
risks, New York-based Goldman Sachs said today in a report. When
setting year-end pay, the firm is reviewing employees&#8217; efforts
to protect its reputation and win clients&#8217; trust, according to
the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which is holding its annual shareholders&#8217;
meeting today in Salt Lake City, created a business-standards
committee in May 2010 as it faced a lawsuit from the Securities
and Exchange Commission over a mortgage-related security called
Abacus 2007-AC1. The firm settled that suit by agreeing to pay
$550 million, and said it made a mistake in omitting disclosures
to investors in the product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If an Abacus transaction came today, it would encounter a
completely different framework of processes, practices,
procedures, transaction approval and review than what we had
before,&#8221; said J. Michael Evans, a Goldman Sachs partner who led
the business-standards committee with E. Gerald Corrigan. &#8220;It
might have the same name, but it would look a lot different.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nigeria&#8217;s state-owned oil company and
Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s local unit may decide to tap the bond market
in 2016 as an alternative source of funding for their joint
venture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The challenge of today is that a lot of people are going
into the bank market, and the avenue is being crowded, making it
difficult for us to obtain sufficient funding,&#8221; Mobil Producing
Nigeria&#8217;s Chief Financial Officer Segun Banwo said in a
statement on the Nigerian National Petroleum Corp.&#8217;s website.
&#8220;From the years 2013 to 2015, we will continue to use the
external financing option, but by the year 2016 we would switch
to the bond market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil, the second-largest producer in Nigeria, is the
operator of a joint venture in which it holds a 40 percent
stake, with NNPC holding the rest. The company has daily output
capacity of about 550,000 barrels of crude from 90 offshore
platforms and about 300 oil wells, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon in June said it concluded a $1.5 billion financing
arrangement with NNPC, with a $900 million loan sourced from a
group of Nigerian and international banks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. lender, named Barry Sommers chief executive officer of its
consumer bank, replacing Ryan McInerney, who&#8217;s leaving to become
president of Visa Inc. (V) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sommers will continue overseeing Chase Wealth Management
and reporting to Gordon Smith, CEO of consumer and community
banking, the New York-based company said today in a statement.
McInerney will be responsible for Foster City, California-based
Visa&#8217;s global client organization, product management and new
solutions group, according to a separate statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon shook up the consumer bank&#8217;s top
management two years ago, removing former retail chief Charlie Scharf from his position and ousting former mortgage head David
Lowman after the lender came under fire for abusive foreclosure
practices, which it spent more than $8.6 billion to settle.
Scharf left to become CEO of Visa, the world&#8217;s largest
electronic-payments network, in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Barry and Ryan have been close partners and friends for
several years, and we expect a seamless transition as we bring
these businesses under Barry&#8217;s leadership,&#8221; Smith said in the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McInerney succeeds John Partridge, who retired as Visa&#8217;s
president in March. Partridge, 63, who is staying with the
company to work on special projects, will receive a base salary
of $50,000 a month and be paid $562,000 in November as a pro-rated bonus for his work this year as president, according to a
filing last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McInerney worked at JPMorgan for eight years and was head
of the consumer bank since 2009, according to JPMorgan&#8217;s
statement. Sommers joined Bear Stearns Cos. in 1996 and came to
JPMorgan when it acquired the firm in 2008, according to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine may agree on an International
Monetary Fund loan by September because of a wide current-account gap and limited access to global financial markets,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The current-account deficit is likely to come in at
around 8 percent of gross domestic product, or $12 billion to
$14 billion,&#8221; Andrew Matheny, a Moscow-based analyst at
Goldman, said today in an e-mailed note. &#8220;This would bring
reserves from the current $25 billion down to $13 billion to $15
billion, in our view an unsustainably-low level.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ukraine will probably sign its delayed Association
Agreement with the European Union this year and may succeed in
renegotiating a natural gas supply pact with Russia, which could
save the government about $2 billion a year, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ukraine is seeking IMF aid after plunging global prices for
exports such as steel pushed its economy into recession. While
the Washington-based lender has visited the former Soviet
republic twice this year, it hasn&#8217;t agreed on a new loan because
its demands to reduce heating subsidies, make the exchange rate
more flexible and tighten fiscal policy haven&#8217;t been met. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GDP contracted 1.3 percent from a year earlier in the first
quarter, state statistics data show. Growth may rebound in 2014
should the country get IMF aid this summer, according to
Matheny. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.K. markets regulator fined a
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) unit 3 million pounds ($4.5 million) for
failing to keep up-to-date records of clients and lacking risk
and compliance controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior management at JPMorgan International Bank didn&#8217;t
have &#8220;sufficient information and oversight tools&#8221; to correct
the problem in its wealth management business for two years, the
London-based Financial Conduct Authority said in an e-mailed
statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Customers of wealth managers should be able to expect the
firm to keep complete, up-to-date client records so that they
can give the right advice,&#8221; Tracey McDermott, director of
enforcement and financial crime at the FCA, said. &#8220;In this case
the firm did not have complete records, nor did its management
have the information they needed to recognize this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator said that the bank&#8217;s computer-based record
system didn&#8217;t hold sufficient information and that its
suitability reports didn&#8217;t have adequate statements about client
needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have fully cooperated with the FCA and have enhanced
our procedures to ensure that they are compliant with regulatory
requirements,&#8221; the bank said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;As the
FCA has noted in its press release, there has been no detriment
to customers identified to date.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Bloomberg News" date="May 23, 2013  2:44 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-23/china-rule-changes-may-halt-copper-financing-deals-goldman-says.html"><headline>China Rule Changes May Halt Copper-Financing, Goldman Says</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;New rules from China to control
capital inflows are likely to end commodity-financing deals,
hurting the short-term outlook for copper, analysts at Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. wrote in a research report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulations from the State Administration of Foreign
Exchange, effective from June, will probably mean an end to
Chinese use of copper as a tool to enable interest rate
arbitrage, Goldman said. The London Metal Exchange market may
need to &#8220;carry&#8221; as much as 250,000 metric tons of additional
physical copper over one to three months, about 4 percent to 5
percent of quarterly global supply, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clampdown follows severe discrepancies in China&#8217;s trade
data in the first four months that aroused suspicions about
companies using trade deals to evade capital controls and take
advantage of interest-rate arbitrage between China and overseas.
Some Chinese banks have stopped issuing letters of credit for
copper importers as the regulators tightened rules governing
such trade, the National Business Daily reported yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The policy shift is directly targeted against abnormal
trading activity and will at least have a negative impact on
copper,&#8221; Judy Zhu, an analyst at Standard Chartered Plc, said
by phone from Shanghai today. &#8220;Still, we don&#8217;t know what
portion of copper trade falls under the more stringent rules.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman sees downside risks to its six-month target of
$8,000 a ton and unwound a September-delivery recommendation at
a 3 percent loss, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Bearish&#8217; Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While some uncertainty remains, the new policies are in
our view likely to bring to an end to these financing deals,&#8221;
analysts led by Jeffrey Currie wrote. Stopping the deals
completely &#8220;would likely be bearish for copper prices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper for delivery in three months on the LME declined 2.9
percent to $7,260 a ton at 3:42 p.m. in Tokyo. The metal has
retreated 8.5 percent this year. The contract for delivery in
September on the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell 2.6 percent to
52,200 yuan ($8,508) a ton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short-term increase in supply will also widen the so-called contango, where later-dated contracts cost more than
those with nearer dates, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s trade surplus is 10 percent the official $61
billion reported so far this year after accounting for fake
transactions used to disguise so-called hot-money inflows,
according to a report from Bank of America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state administration increased scrutiny of trade and
called on businesses with substantial foreign-exchange receipts
to explain whether the capital flows are supported by real trade,
analysts at Barclays Plc said in a research note earlier this
week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PetroChina Co. (857), the country&#8217;s biggest
oil and gas producer, will seek to increase cooperation with
companies including Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), BP Plc (BP/) and Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA) as it looks to add overseas resources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Beijing-based company will also seek to work with Eni
SpA (ENI) and Chevron Corp. (CVX) as its makes expansion abroad a priority,
Chairman Zhou Jiping told reporters today in Beijing. The
cooperation could involve teaming up to make acquisitions or
joint exploration activities, Mao Zefeng, the company&#8217;s Beijing-based spokesman said after the press conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PetroChina and its state-owned parent China National
Petroleum Corp. have announced plans to spend about $7 billion
in the past six months on assets from Mozambique to Australia,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Zhou was appointed as
chairman in April after Jiang Jiemin was promoted to the
minister of China&#8217;s state-owned enterprises supervisor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The publicly traded unit plans to invest at least $60
billion this decade in global oil and natural gas assets to
increase the share of overseas output to half of its total,
former Chairman Jiang Jiemin said in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PetroChina fell 2.2 percent to HK$9:50 as of 11:59 am in
Hong Kong. The stock has dropped 13 percent this year, compared
with a 1 percent gain at the city&#8217;s benchmark Hang Seng Index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors trying to explain the
resilience of American equities during a global selloff may want
to consider the pace that companies are repurchasing shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 79 percent of buyback orders at Goldman Sachs Group
Inc.&#8217;s corporate trading desk were active yesterday, the most
this year, according to a note to clients obtained by Bloomberg
News. Companies stepped up purchases as the Standard  Poor&#8217;s
500 Index fell as much as 3 percent from an intraday record
reached May 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buybacks may have limited losses in American equities
after shares in Japan fell the most in two years and stock
markets from London to Paris and Frankfurt saw declines of more
than 2 percent. The SP 500 closed yesterday down 0.3 percent,
trimming gains to 16 percent in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The overall buy-the-dip mentality is very, very
prevalent,&#8221; Jim Welsh, who helps oversee $6 billion at Forward
Management LLC in San Francisco, said in a phone interview.
&#8220;When you have corporate buybacks, it&#8217;s kind of like a support
underneath the market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 slipped 0.1 percent to 1,649.60 at 4 p.m. in
New York, paring losses after falling as much as 0.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;$275 Billion &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies authorize buybacks and carry them out from time
to time through brokerages as a way to reduce outstanding stock
and increase per-share earnings. U.S. firms have announced about
$275 billion of repurchases this quarter, the highest total in
more than five years, Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist
at LPL Financial Holdings Inc. (LPLA), wrote in a report this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aflac Inc. (AFL), the largest provider of supplemental health
insurance, plans to buy back $600 million in stock this year,
Chief Executive Officer Dan Amos said at a presentation to
investors this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck  Co., the second-biggest U.S. drugmaker, reached a
deal to repurchase $5 billion of its shares from Goldman Sachs
as part of a buyback program announced earlier this month,
according to a statement on May 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A lot of these corporate buybacks are on autopilots, in
other words, the board authorized X amount of purchases and
these will be done over many months,&#8221; Forward&#8217;s Welsh said.
&#8220;Whether or not it&#8217;s to the discretion of Goldman or the
investment bank, I don&#8217;t know. I do believe the amount of stock
buybacks have definitely been helpful to the overall market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nasdaq Buyback Achievers Index, which consists of
companies that repurchased at least 5 percent of their shares in
the previous 12 months, has tripled since March 2009. That
compares with the 144 percent gain in the SP 500. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares in the SP 500 are trading at about 15 times
estimates for 2013 earnings, above the five-year average of
about 13 times, according to a May 20 note from David Kostin,
the chief U.S. equity strategist at Goldman Sachs in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;InterOil Corp. (IOC), the Australian energy
company with licenses to explore about 3.9 million acres, said
it entered exclusive talks with Exxon Mobil Corp. to develop
natural gas fields in Papua New Guinea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Included in the talks is the potential sale of a stake in
Petroleum Retention License 15, which comprises the Elk and
Antelope fields, that is sufficient to supply gas to develop an
additional liquefied natural gas train, Cairns-based InterOil
said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;InterOil and Pacific LNG Group, its joint-venture partner,
may also get funding for more wells in the fields. The fields
hold an estimated 9 trillion cubic feet of recoverable sales
gas, InterOil said in its 2012 annual report. The company had
spent $384 million on the fields through March 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement was made before the start of regular
trading in New York. InterOil rose 9.1 percent to $102 at 7:34

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) recommended
selling West Texas Intermediate crude and buying North Sea Brent
contracts for December 2014 as supplies accumulate on the U.S.
Gulf Coast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discount on WTI for delivery in December 2014 against
the equivalent Brent contract has narrowed to $8.38 a barrel
from $10.11 a month ago. The spread should widen as pipelines
carrying crude out of the U.S. storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma,
cause a build-up on the Gulf Coast that would lower the price of
WTI versus the European benchmark, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If an oversupply of light, sweet crude in the U.S. Gulf
coast becomes a problem as soon as third quarter 2013, it should
be an even bigger problem in 2014,&#8221; analysts Jeffrey Currie and
Stefan Wieler in New York said in a report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discount on front-month WTI against Brent, at $8.44 a
barrel today, is still set to narrow toward $5 in the third
quarter as new pipeline capacity to move oil out of Cushing
causes stockpiles there to decline &#8220;substantially,&#8221; Goldman
said. Booming U.S. production expanded the discount on WTI to
more than $28 a barrel in October, 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refinery maintenance and reduced pipeline flows are
&#8220;putting a drag on a more meaningful decline of Cushing
inventories,&#8221; according to the report. Supplies at Cushing
increased by 0.9 percent to 50.2 million barrels in the week to
May 17, according to the Energy Department. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia&#8217;s Finance Ministry hired
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) the biggest U.S. lender, to help boost the
country&#8217;s standing among credit-rating companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was chosen after beating proposals from other
investment banks, the ministry said in a statement on its
website, without naming the other firms. Natalia Shchetinina, a
JPMorgan spokeswoman in Moscow, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia has long complained of bias by the three U.S. rating
companies that dominate the industry. President Vladimir Putin
said in 2011 the rankings given to Russia were an &#8220;outrage&#8221;
that increased borrowing costs for domestic companies and the
government. The country has &#8220;more than earned&#8221; an upgrade,
Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Storchak said in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest energy exporter last had its debt score
changed by one of the three U.S. companies in February 2009,
when Fitch Ratings cut it one level to BBB, three steps below A
and two above junk. That came three months after Standard 
Poor&#8217;s did the same. Moody&#8217;s Investors Service has held Russia
at Baa1, the third-lowest investment grade, since July 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP and Moody&#8217;s have said Russia&#8217;s reliance on oil revenue,
which makes the budget vulnerable to swings in commodity prices,
outweighs the low level of sovereign debt. Russia plans to
follow last year&#8217;s sale of $7 billion in euro bonds with another
offering of the same amount in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in February it had been hired
by the government to burnish Russia&#8217;s image overseas and attract
institutional investors. The New York-based bank signed a three-year agreement with the Economy Ministry and the Russian Direct
Investment Fund to advise on issues such as communicating
government decisions and setting up meetings with investors,
according to Sergei Arsenyev, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s managing director
of investment banking in Moscow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and New York-based JPMorgan are on a list of
23 foreign and domestic banks selected to advise Russia on its 1
trillion-ruble ($33 billion) privatization program. Last year
both American investment banks helped advise OAO Sberbank,
Russia&#8217;s largest lender, on a $5.2 billion equity sale. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Petroleos de Venezuela SA, the
country&#8217;s state-owned oil producer, signed a $2 billion
financing agreement with San Ramon, California-based Chevron
Corp. (CVX) to increase output at their Petroboscan oil joint venture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loan&#8217;s interest rate is the London Interbank Offered
Rate plus 4.5 percentage points, Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez
told reporters in Caracas today. The money will be handled
directly by Petroboscan and will help boost daily output to
127,000 barrels from 107,000 barrels, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The loan has a very low rate because it&#8217;s a corporate
loan from Chevron to its joint venture and is tied to increased
production,&#8221; said Ramirez, who signed the credit along with Ali Moshiri, Chevron&#8217;s head of Latin America, Middle East and
Africa. &#8220;That way we obligate ourselves and our partner to
focus on increasing production.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venezuela, which channels oil earnings into social programs
and regional fuel subsidies, is seeking financing from foreign
partners to tap more of the world&#8217;s largest oil reserves. The
state-owned producer reached an agreement with China on terms of
a $4 billion loan on May 15 for the Sinovensa joint venture with
China National Petroleum Corp. Ramirez said today he&#8217;ll sign the
financing agreement in Beijing this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minister said May 3 that PDVSA would invest $15.4
billion in exploration and production this year and that its
partners must meet production targets or risk having projects
disbanded. Ramirez said last month that PDVSA would ask its
partners to finance at least $8 billion of a $25 billion
investment program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venezuela is producing 830,000 barrels a day in western oil
fields, Ramirez said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) sold $4 billion of bonds
in its first dollar-denominated offering in more than four
years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest drugmaker issued $1 billion of 1.5
percent, five-year securities to yield 50 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries and an equal portion of 3 percent,
10-year debt with a relative yield of 87.5 basis points,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer also sold $750 million of 0.9 percent notes due
January 2017 paying a spread of 45 and an equal amount of 4.3
percent, 30-year debt that pays 100, Bloomberg data show. A $500
million portion of five-year, floating-rate debt yields 30 basis
points more than the three-month London interbank offered rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue will be used to repay the company&#8217;s 1.85 billion
euros of 3.625 percent bonds due June 3, according to a
regulatory filing. Proceeds may also be used to repay a portion
of Pfizer&#8217;s $750 million of 4.5 percent debentures and $1.75
billion of 5.5 percent securities, both maturing in February
2014, the company said in the filing. Other funds may be used
for investments or to pay down part of its $1.75 billion of
commercial paper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer last sold dollar-denominated debt in March 2009,
when the New-York based pharmaceutical manufacturer issued $13.5
billion of securities in five parts. That offering included
$3.25 billion of 6.2 percent, 10-year notes that were priced to
yield 325 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries.
Those bonds traded at 124.9 cents on the dollar on May 22 to
yield 1.67 percent, or 78.5 basis points more than benchmarks,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new notes are rated A1 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service,
the credit grader said in a statement today. Citigroup Inc.,
Credit Suisse Group AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc managed the offering, according to a
regulatory filing by Pfizer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libor, the rate at which banks say they can borrow in
dollars from each other, was set at 0.273 percent today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spot gasoline in California gained
against futures for the first time in four days as BP Plc (BP/) and
Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) reported flaring at refineries on the U.S.
West Coast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP&#8217;s 234,000-barrel-a-day Cherry Point plant in Washington
said there were emissions from the No. 1 diesel unit on May 25,
a federal regulatory notice showed. Exxon&#8217;s 150,000-barrel-a-day
Torrance refinery in Southern California reported planned
flaring yesterday, according to a notice to the California
Emergency Management Agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in Los Angeles
climbed 0.88 cent against futures traded on the New York
Mercantile Exchange to a premium of 3.88 cents a gallon at 4:13
p.m. New York time, rising from a seven-week low, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. Prompt-delivery of the fuel gained 2.61 cents
to $2.8842 a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retail gasoline in the state slipped 0.4 cent to $4.025 a
gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA, the nation&#8217;s largest
motoring organization, said today on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s Torrance refinery is scheduled to finish a
maintenance turnaround involving a crude unit, a coker and an
alkylation unit this week, according to a person with knowledge
of the timeline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tanker Visit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil-products tanker NCC REEM was anchored at Phillips
66 (PSX)&#8217;s Rodeo refinery in Northern California today after stopping
at BP Plc&#8217;s Cherry Point plant last week, IHS Inc. (IHS) data show.
Phillips 66 chartered the vessel last month to bring clean
products to the West Coast from South Korea, ship-fixture data
compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbob gasoline in San Francisco advanced 1.5 cents against
futures to a premium of 7.5 cents a gallon. The spread between
San Francisco and Los Angeles Carbob widened 0.63 cent to 3.63
cents a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend, or CARB, diesel in San Francisco
strengthened 2.75 cents versus ultra-low-sulfur diesel futures
on the Nymex to a discount of 4.75 cents a gallon, a one-week
high. CARB diesel in Los Angeles rose 4.25 cents to 1.75 cents a
gallon below futures, the smallest differential in a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Portland, Oregon, conventional, 84-octane gasoline
dropped 8.5 cents against futures to a premium of 6 cents a
gallon. The premium for low-sulfur diesel there narrowed 7 cents
to 2.5 cents a gallon versus ULSD futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portland gasoline&#8217;s premium to Los Angeles Carbob weakened
9.38 cents to 2.13 cents a gallon, the least in a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3-2-1 crack spread of Alaska North Slope crude, Carbob
in Los Angeles and CARB diesel in Los Angeles widened for the
first time in five days, gaining $1.81 to $17.26 a barrel at
4:29 p.m. New York time, the biggest differential in a week. The
spread, a rough measure of refining margins, is down 42 percent
from this year&#8217;s high of $29.09 on Feb. 5. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) hired Travis Machen from Morgan Stanley to run corporate banking for hedge

&lt;p&gt;Machen, 37, was co-head of Morgan Stanley&#8217;s North American

JPMorgan said today in a statement. He&#8217;ll be in charge of
JPMorgan&#8217;s financial institutions group within its commercial

&lt;p&gt;Machen&#8217;s experience will be &#8220;essential to effectively

&lt;p&gt;Trading precious metals against each
other based on purchases and sales through exchange-traded
products would have returned an annual profit of about 30
percent since 2007, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank rates investment in the products on a weekly
basis, buying the metal with the highest current holding
relative to the past six months and selling the one with the
lowest relative holding. The strategy, which was first
calculated this month, would have been successful about 56
percent of the time since 2007, according to JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold entered a bear market in April and sales from ETPs
since the start of January surpassed what was amassed in the
combined previous two years as some investors lost faith in a
store of value amid an improving U.S. economy and rally in
equities. While the four precious metals would have on average
been bought and sold equally as much each other since 2007,
JPMorgan&#8217;s strategy suggested selling gold since January and
buying platinum since the end of March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a decent success rate,&#8221; Matthew Lehmann, a global
strategist at JPMorgan&#8217;s asset allocation team in London, said
in a phone interview last week. &#8220;Even that tiny margin over
time gives you a huge advantage cumulatively against the market.
What makes this strategy interesting is that the flows appear to
work better on a relative basis. Having four metals so that
you&#8217;re not always exposed to one helps as well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gold Price &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors are now selling gold after holdings rose every
year since the first product was listed in 2003, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. Bullion for immediate delivery slipped 18
percent this year to $1,378.75 an ounce in London, valuing the
amount held through the products at $95.7 billion. About 50
percent of metal in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest gold ETP,
is owned by institutional investors, with the rest held by
retail investors, Deutsche Bank AG said in a May 14 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold ETP holdings slipped 473.5 metric tons this year,
equal to about two months of mine production. At least another
435 tons may be sold if the Federal Reserve curbs stimulus
before the end of the year, Credit Suisse Group AG said in a May
22 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 18 percent drop in gold holdings this year compares
with gains of 0.2 percent for silver, 16 percent for palladium
and 34 percent for platinum. Silver prices plunged 27 percent to
$22.2571 an ounce this year, the worst performance in the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities. Platinum is down
5.9 percent at $1,448.48 an ounce and palladium rose 3.9 percent
to $731.43 an ounce. Platinum and palladium are mostly used in
car autocatalysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ETP Flows &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve looked at ETP flows and what&#8217;s happening in gold
and found that they&#8217;re not always that correlated,&#8221; Lehmann
said. &#8220;That&#8217;s most noticeably been the case over the last two
or three years, where there&#8217;s been periods where gold sold off
but the ETP holdings kept rising.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the International Monetary Fund lowered its 2013
global growth outlook four times since July, it expects
expansion to accelerate to 4 percent in 2014 from 3.3 percent
this year. Industrial applications account for about 10 percent
of gold consumption, compared with 60 percent for platinum and
91 percent for palladium, data from the World Gold Council and
Johnson Matthey Plc, both based in London, show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) sued rival mobile-phone
maker HTC Corp. for selling products in the U.S., including the
HTC One handset, that allegedly infringe three of its patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patents pertain to &#8220;terminal, method and computer
program product for interacting with a signaling tag,&#8221;
according to the complaint Nokia filed May 23 in federal court
in San Diego. The Espoo, Finland-based company seeks a court
order halting the alleged infringement and unspecified damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia, which lost its 14-year title as world&#8217;s biggest
seller of mobile phones to Korea&#8217;s Samsung Electronics Co. in
2011, is trying to expand revenue from its patent portfolio. The
company last year sued Taoyuan, Taiwan-based HTC in the U.S. and
in Germany over alleged patent infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Upon receiving the official document, HTC is to consider
all legal options to protect our rights,&#8221; the Taiwanese company
said in an e-mailed statement May 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In dispute are patents 7,775,432, 8,306,065, and 8,366,000. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Actavis Sale of Generic Pulmicort Blocked by Appeals Court &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actavis Inc. (ACT)&#8217;s sales of a generic form of AstraZeneca PLC (AZN)&#8217;s
Pulmicort pediatric asthma treatment were cut short after a May
24 order from a federal appeals court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales were to have begun April 1, following a trial court
ruling that Parsippany, New Jersey-based Actavis didn&#8217;t infringe
AstraZeneca&#8217;s patent 7,524,834, and that a second patent at
issue -- 6,598,603 -- wasn&#8217;t valid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial court issued a temporary ban on sale of the
generic version of the drug on April 2, to give AstraZeneca a
chance to go to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit, a Washington-based court that hears appeals of patent
cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court issued its temporary order May 24, saying
that London-based AstraZeneca had established it was entitled to
that protection during the course of the appeal. AstraZeneca is
required to post a $72 million bond within 7 days of the ruling,
according to the order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the appeals court granted a request from
Israel&#8217;s Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. to file a friend
of the court brief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is AstraZeneca LP v. Breath Ltd., 2013-1312-1352,
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The lower court
case is AstraZeneca LP v. Breath Ltd., 1:08-cv-01512-RMB-AMD,

&lt;h2&gt;Chinese Researches at NYU Arrested, Charged in Espionage Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three Chinese researchers at New York University were
charged with falsification of records and commercial bribery in
an industrial espionage case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists are accused of providing information to a
Chinese medical-imaging company that flows from their research
at the university funded by grants from the National Institutes
of Health, according to the complaint filed May 19 in federal
court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government alleged in court papers that Yudong Zhu, an
associate professor in radiology at NYU, provided false
statements regarding his affiliation with a Chinese government-sponsored research institution, a Chinese medical-imaging
company, and about his application for and ownership of a patent
related to NIH-funded research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zhu&#8217;s patent 8,319,495 B1 was issued in November 2012, and,
according to the complaint, the university became aware of it
only in connection with its own investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional allegations are related to photographs taken of
lab equipment, and e-mails to the Chinese company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zhu is represented by Robert M. Baum of Federal Defenders

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s
largest energy company by market value, is boosting exploration
for oil in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico five years after dismissing
the region as too costly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technological breakthroughs in seismic imaging have enabled
Exxon&#8217;s geologists and engineers to more thoroughly assess
subsea crude deposits that previously eluded them in the deepest
parts of the Gulf, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson said in a meeting with reporters in Dallas today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve re-entered in a very active way the Gulf of
Mexico,&#8221; Tillerson said. His comments followed the Irving,
Texas-based company&#8217;s annual shareholders meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2008, Tillerson said the discoveries being made in
the Gulf weren&#8217;t large enough to justify the costs of erecting
production platforms and installing pipelines. Energy explorers
needed to &#8220;cobble together&#8221; individual discoveries to make
pumping oil and natural gas to the surface profitable, he said
at the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jive Software Inc. (JIVE), which is growing
three times faster than its peers, may become a takeover target
for International Business Machines Corp. or Oracle Corp. (ORCL) after
luring the attention of SAP AG. (SAP) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jive rallied 5.6 percent, the most in three months, on May
24 after Bloomberg News reported that SAP recently considered
buying the $1.1 billion company before deciding there was too
much product overlap. The Palo Alto, California-based developer
of software that helps employees collaborate may now lure other
suitors, including IBM and Oracle, because of its prospects for
increasing revenue, Credit Suisse Group AG said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jive is forecast to boost sales by 119 percent during the
next three years, according to analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) already bought a business similar to
Jive last year, paying $1.2 billion for Yammer Inc., and Jive&#8217;s
chief executive officer sold his last software venture to
Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) for about $4.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With SAP, &#8220;even if the talks were abandoned, it shows that
there&#8217;s interest,&#8221; Steve Ashley, a Milwaukee-based analyst with
Robert W. Baird  Co., said in a telephone interview. &#8220;They are
the leader in the social collaboration space for businesses, and
they have the strongest offering and most differentiated
offering in that new, emerging market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) challenged
European Union regulators&#8217; approval of Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s 2011
takeover of Skype Technologies SA, telling judges the deal
created so many competition concerns there should have been an
in-depth probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft should never have been allowed to &#8220;buy its way
to monopoly&#8221; in the market for communications that combine
instant messaging, voice and video calls, Cisco told the EU
General Court in Luxembourg today. Cisco wants the court to rule
whether the EU was able to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt
that the merger didn&#8217;t trigger competition problems, without an
in-depth examination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This was a very serious case and there were many factors
to show that there could be serious harm for consumers,&#8221;
Alfonso Lamadrid, a lawyer for Cisco told the court today. &#8220;The
commission brushed off these concerns. Its assessment was, with
all due respect, careless.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft won unconditional approval from the EU in October
2011 to buy Skype, the world&#8217;s most popular international
calling service, for $8.5 billion. EU regulators said the deal
wouldn&#8217;t harm competition because the market was growing and
they faced &#8220;numerous players, including Google.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission used &#8220;flawed reasoning&#8221; that conflicted
with its approach in previous cases, said Cisco, the largest
maker of computer-networking equipment. The combination of the
companies would give them a combined market share of 80 percent
to 90 percent in the market for video calls on Microsoft&#8217;s
Windows-based computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Eliminate Incentive &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would &#8220;reinforce&#8221; the new company&#8217;s dominant position
and &#8220;eliminate any incentive&#8221; to offer interoperability with
other products, Cisco said, according to a court summary of the
San Jose, California based company&#8217;s written arguments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market share hasn&#8217;t &#8220;put off&#8221; other participants,
such as Viber Media Inc., from entering the market, said
Nicholas Khan, a lawyer for the commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Cisco pretends to seek interoperability, but what it
actually seeks is that it wants Microsoft to change its
products,&#8221; Georg Berrisch, a lawyer for Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, told the three-judge panel. Microsoft bought
Skype &#8220;to expand its offerings on the consumer market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luis Ortiz Blanco, another lawyer for Cisco, said the EU
failed to show that users will be able to easily switch from one
platform to another. The commission failed to understand that
people communicate in interconnected groups and as such would be
less willing to switch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you can already reach everybody on Skype, why should
you switch to different applications,&#8221; said Ortiz Blanco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is: T-79/12, Cisco Systems and Messagenet v.
Commission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.K. government appointed UBS AG (UBSN)
and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) as joint global coordinators and
joint bookrunners for the sale of Royal Mail Group Ltd, the
state-owned postal service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc (BARC) will be joint bookrunner and sponsor, and Bank
of America (BAC) Merrill Lynch will be joint bookrunner for the deal,
the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills in London
said in an e-mailed statement today. No final decision has been
taken about how or when to sell Royal Mail, according to the
statement. The government has said its preferred option is an
initial public offering by the end of the current financial year
next March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While all options for the form of sale remain open, it is
important that we are in a position to move ahead swiftly with
our chosen route once we take the final decision,&#8221; Business
Minister Michael Fallon said in the statement. &#8220;The appointed
banking syndicate will work to make sure we are ready to proceed
when the time comes and will be able to deliver strong, high-quality investor demand to ensure a successful IPO for the
taxpayer and for Royal Mail.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planned sale of Royal Mail will be the largest
privatization in Britain since former Prime Minister John Major
broke up the country&#8217;s railway more than a decade ago. The 360-year-old company, one of the nation&#8217;s biggest employers with
about 159,000 staff, has sought to adapt its letter-focused
network to more lucrative package delivery in the face of
competition from TNT NV of the Netherlands and Deutsche Post
AG (DPW)&#8217;s DHL Express unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Mail&#8217;s operating profit more than doubled in the year
to March 31 to 403 million pounds ($609 million) as growth in
web-based shopping spurred parcel deliveries, the company said
in a statement last week. While sales gained 5 percent to 9.28
billion pounds, parcel revenue rose 9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Mail appointed Equiniti Group this month to manage
the distribution of 10 percent of its shares to employees
following any sale. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Application 20130125161, published in the database of the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office May 16, covers a method of
increasing interactive viewing by tying achievement to specific
content. Viewers who meet certain set goals will receive an

&lt;h2&gt;Louboutin Sues California Company Over Knockoff Red Shoe Soles &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian Louboutin Sarl, the Paris-based maker of shoes
that sell for as much as $6,400 per pair, sued a California shoe
distributor for trademark infringement and is seeking more than
$2 million in damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alba Footwear LLC of City of Industry, California, is
accused of importing shoes that infringe Louboutin&#8217;s red-sole
trademark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigators for Louboutin have bought Alba-supplied shoes
that featured red soles, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French shoe company asked the federal court in
Manhattan to order Alba and its co-defendants&#8217; to halt their
acts of infringement. Additionally, Louboutin is seeking an
order for the recall and destruction of infringing products and
promotional materials and for awards of money damages, attorney
fees and litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alba didn&#8217;t respond immediately to an e-mailed request for

&lt;h2&gt;Maasai Tribe May Seek Trademark Protection for Name, Images &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Africa&#8217;s Maasai tribe may consider seeking protection for
its intellectual property by registering trademarks, the BBC
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light Years IP, a Washington-based non-profit that works on
IP issues with producers in developing countries, told the BBC
that if the Maasai brand were owned by a corporation, it might
be worth more than $10 million a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 80 companies worldwide use either the Maasai name or
an image of the tribe, including LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis
Vuitton SA (MC), which uses it for a line of beach towels, hats,
scarves and duffle bags, and Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc&#8217;s
Land Rover unit, which uses the term for a series of accessories
for its vehicles, the BBC reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Arbitron Sues Saga for Unauthorized Use of Audience Rating Data &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arbitron Inc. (ARB), the media and marketing research firm, sued
Saga Communications Inc. for allegedly making unauthorized use
of Arbitron&#8217;s audience estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saga, based in Gross Pointe Farms, Michigan, is accused of
using the audience estimates without permission, beginning in
September 2010, according to the complaint filed May 23 in
federal court in Wilmington, Delaware. Saga owns and operates
radio and television stations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arbitron, of Columbia, Maryland, accuses Saga of using the
data for a variety of purposes, including setting advertising
rates for its radio stations, and making programming decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These ratings were also factored into a formula used to
determine employee compensation, Arbitron said. This was such a
common practice, Arbitron claims, that employees&#8217; bonuses were
known as &#8220;Arbitron bonuses,&#8221; based on how well a particular
radio program fared in Arbitron audience estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arbitron is asking the court for awards of damages of at
least $150,000 per act of infringement, in addition to attorney
fees and litigation costs. The company also asked for extra
damages aimed at punishing Saga for its actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saga didn&#8217;t respond immediately to an e-mailed request for
comment on the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Arbitron Inc., v. Saga Communications Inc. (SGA),

&lt;h2&gt;Taiwan&#8217;s Music Industry Seeks Blockage of Infringing Websites &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taiwan&#8217;s Recording Industry Foundation, a music-industry
trade group, is calling for amendments to that nation&#8217;s
copyright laws, the Taipei Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry favors legislation enabling the blocking of
foreign websites that infringe, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taiwan&#8217;s Intellectual Property Office said it will ask
Internet services providers to block access to domain names and
Internet protocol addresses that infringe, the Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheng Kuo-wei, who heads the Association of Digital Culture
Taiwan&#8217;s Department of Media and International Cooperation
cautioned that what he deemed excessive expansion of IP rights
could obstruct chill the development of culture-oriented
business, according to the Times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lionsgate Entertainment Accused of Anticompetitive Use of IP &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lionsgate Entertainment Corp. and its Summit Entertainment
unit were accused of using their copyright policy in an anti-competitive fashion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Los Angeles-based Between the Lines Productions LLC,
creator of &#8220;Twiharder,&#8221; a feature-length parody of Summit&#8217;s
&#8220;Twilight&#8221; series of films, accused Lionsgate of &#8220;ridiculous-to-insane overreaches of intellectual property law.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the complaint filed yesterday in federal court in
Manhattan, Between the Lines said that Summit&#8217;s copyright-enforcement actions have been conducted &#8220;by a high degree of
disregard for this nation&#8217;s copyright and trademark law.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lionsgate and Summit are accused of seeking to monopolize
the conversation in adjacent markets in which speech content is
used to comment on or criticize the &#8220;Twilight&#8221; films. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between the Lines said its film was marketed &#8220;with
complete transparency&#8221; as a parody, and it used none of the
actual content of Summit&#8217;s &#8220;Twilight&#8221; products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maker of the parody film says after it received a
cease-and-desist notice from Lionsgate, distributors revoked
their offers to do business with Between the Lines, effectively
excluding it from the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It asked the court for a declaration that its &#8220;Twiharder&#8221;
film doesn&#8217;t infringe Lionsgate&#8217;s copyrights and awards of $500
million in damages. It also requested that some of the profit
from the Twilight films to be placed in a public trust &#8220;to fund
an expedient and legitimate effort to re-codify&#8221; copyright
law&#8217;s &#8220;fair use&#8221; provisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also asked the court to cancel some of the
Twilight-related trademark registrations and to declare sections
of U.S. copyright law dealing with parodies as overboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lionsgate didn&#8217;t respond immediately to an e-mailed request
for comment on the lawsuit. The Santa Monica, California-based
company acquired Summit in January 2012 for $412.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the complaint, Between the Lines claims that the five
&#8220;Twilight&#8221; films grossed $4.34 billion in worldwide theatrical
release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Between the Lines Productions LLC v. Lionsgate
Entertainment Corp., 1:13-cv-02584, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.K. Court Approves Extradition in Industrial Spying Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A U.K. court ordered extradition of an Indian citizen
accused of industrial espionage under India&#8217;s Official Secrets
Act, the Times of India reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ravi Shankaran, who was accused of leaking confidential
military information to arms dealers, has argued that the
evidence against him was fabricated and that the lengthy delays
in the Indian judicial system would violate his human rights,
according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Shankaran said they will appeal the extradition
ruling from the Westminster&#8217;s Magistrate Court in London, the
Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s Central Bureau of Investigation, which began
investigating the case in 2006, sent a two-member team to London
to assist authorities at the extradition trial, according to the
Times. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OAO Sberbank (SBRCY), Russia&#8217;s largest
lender, will extend this year&#8217;s rally by a further 26 percent as
loan growth outweighs concern that profit is falling, according
to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Sberbank, which slumped today after posting a
drop in net income, is set for a fourth quarterly gain, the
longest stretch of advances since March 2010. The stock tumbled
2.4 percent at 12:50 p.m. in Moscow and 2.7 percent in London,
after losing 1.6 percent in New York yesterday. The Micex Index
fell 1.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Sberbank&#8217;s net income attributable to shareholders
slid 3.9 percent to 88.6 billion rubles ($2.8 billion) by
international accounting standards, that beat the mean estimate
of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg for an 8 percent
decline. Retail loans increased 6 percent in the first five
months of the year compared with a year earlier, while corporate
loans fell 0.1 percent, according to a May 14 financial report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We remain buyers as loan growth may be recovering and
valuations continue looking compelling,&#8221; Alex Kantarovich, the
head of Russian equity research at JPMorgan in Moscow, who has
an overweight rating for Sberbank since August and predicts the
shares will rise to 131.13 rubles by year-end, said by e-mail
yesterday. &#8220;The size and market share owing to the massive
footprint remains the main source of the bank&#8217;s competitive
advantage.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Updates with Widrich&#8217;s plan for move in fifth paragraph.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tel Aviv officials recognize that the city is becoming a premier destination for technology companies. That''s why the local government is working on programs to attract more foreign entrepreneurs and to reinforce why the region has become known as Silicon Wadi, an Arabic word used colloquially in Hebrew for valley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economy and Commerce Minister Naftali Bennett has agreed to push for legislation that would create the Startup Visa, allowing foreigners with creative muscle to establish residence in Tel Aviv. The city also plans to offer free Wi-Fi in all major public places, officials said at a news conference this week, so that programmers can tweak their applications while sitting on a bench outside the Habima Theatre or at the Tel Aviv Port.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a top priority for us now, to keep fostering innovation in the city," Mayor Ron Huldai said on the top floor of the Shalom Tower, where a once-neglected public library was converted into a free startup workspace overlooking the Mediterranean Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tel Aviv, which has a population of about 400,000, is home to as many as 700 early-stage startups, according to city data. Its vibrant tech scene ranked second in the world after Silicon Valley, researcher Startup Genome said in a November report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leo Widrich, co-founder of social-media app Buffer, relocated his half-dozen employees to Tel Aviv last year after moving from San Francisco to Hong Kong. His team chose the Israeli city for its buzzing startup community and pleasant weather, Widrich wrote on his blog. weather, Widrich wrote on his blog. He said Tel Aviv beat cities such as New York and Rio de Janeiro, but he did plan to move back to the U.S. later in the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffer is not the typical case. (Widrich admitted he only moved out of San Francisco because his engineers couldn''t get visas.) Silicon Valley attracts the bulk of foreign talent because it has the largest stable of venture capital and the world''s tech giants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, some Israeli companies end up moving to the U.S. when they outgrow their homeland. Waze, the crowdsourced-map provider that''s seeking $1 billion in acquisition talks with Google and Facebook, moved its headquarters and some of its operations from Israel to Palo Alto, California. BillGuard, which helps consumers identify errant charges on their credit cards, established its headquarters in New York, though it maintains an office on Rothschild Boulevard, an Israel tech hotspot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While about half of Silicon Valley startup founders are foreign born, businesses in Tel Aviv are mostly started by Israelis, according to Avner Warner, the city''s director of International Economic Development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The vision is that Tel Aviv can start to develop a more international startup culture," Warner said. "More foreigners here would attract more capital and allow for deeper engagement between locals and global innovators."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a walk along Rothschild Boulevard, Nissim Lehyani might run into venture capitalist Michael Eisenberg or an acquaintance from EBay''s innovation center. Lehyani runs Easy Social Shop, one of many tech startups with offices on the ritzy street in Israel''s second-most-populous city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lehyani said he''s had little trouble recruiting engineers to his company, which helps small online merchants market their wares on Facebook. Lehyani, like many of the nation''s high-tech entrepreneurs, made plenty of connections while serving in one of Israel''s military-intelligence units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It''s so much easier to attract talent here," Lehyani said. "This city is overflowing with cafes, good food, nice weather and young people. It feels as though things here just happen more naturally."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) crammed the new Xbox One with something for everybody. One constituency says it got short shrift: the die-hard players who tend to spend most on high-end action-packed titles. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s stepping up pressure on Microsoft, now preparing for E3, the gaming industry&#8217;s annual conference in Los Angeles, to introduce a lineup better suited for the gamers who help fuel the $67 billion video-game market. Facing new competition from Apple Inc. (AAPL), Google Inc. (GOOG) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) for consumers&#8217; time in the living room, Microsoft will also have to deliver titles that can contend with new software and consoles from longtime rivals Sony Corp. (6758) and Nintendo Co. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is critical for Xbox One to attract hard-core gamers,&#8221; said Liam Callahan, an analyst at NPD Group Inc. based in Port Washington, New York. &#8220;While Microsoft clearly focused on what Xbox One can do outside of gaming, they are using E3 to speak to the hard-core audience.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft said the first Xbox event held at its Redmond, Washington, headquarters was focused on the machine&#8217;s broad entertainment capabilities, including personalized programming recommendations for families and a fantasy-football application for gridiron fans. The bulk of new games will debut at E3, which runs from June 11 to 13, Microsoft said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It will be clear on June 10 that Xbox One is going to be the home to the biggest and best games of the current and next-generation platforms,&#8221; Letty Cherry, a spokeswoman for Microsoft, said in an e-mailed statement. Game companies usually unveil their top offerings ahead of the annual expo. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Serious Machine &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stuart Bridson, a resident of Manchester, U.K., who owns an Xbox 360 and a PlayStation 3, is just the kind of audience Microsoft needs to wow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;ll be watching E3 intently, as Microsoft needs to quell the public pressure by demonstrating some actual games,&#8221; Bridson said. &#8220;Above all else, they need to show some games to show that the One is a serious gaming machine, and not just a multimedia device which happens to play games.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sony focused more on games at a February event to unveil the PlayStation 4. While the machine&#8217;s specifications and features appealed to game developers and hard-core gamers, it also left Sony open to some criticism that the company wasn&#8217;t pushing far enough in the wider entertainment space, according to Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner Inc. in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Neither Sony nor Microsoft have announced prices for their new consoles. The current Xbox sells for $200 to $300. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Entertainment Hub &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There&#8217;s good reason for Microsoft and its peers to broaden the appeal of their consoles, targeting families and the consumer-entertainment market. Sales of packaged games are declining in the U.S., and there&#8217;s growing competition from casual games played on the Web and on mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At an event May 21, Microsoft showed how Xbox One can control live television, allow users to view programs and rapidly switch applications, games and shows using voice commands. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The machine&#8217;s Kinect sensor recognizes users and loads recommendations and the last five things they were doing. Users can see what shows and games are popular and what their friends are doing. Xbox One includes a custom-built eight-core processor by Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD), with 8 gigabytes of memory to speed up functions, and a combined graphic chip. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Xbox One reflects a focus on building the best machine for gaming, Don Mattrick, president of Microsoft&#8217;s interactive entertainment business, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We thought, &#8216;OK, clean sheet of paper, new architecture, what are you going to design?&#8217;&#8221; he said. &#8220;We want to make the best hard-core gaming box, great, how do you do that?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Independent Developers &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The number of hard-core gamers is about 10 million, according to Peter Molyneux, a veteran game developer who worked for Microsoft after the software company purchased his Lionhead Studios. That&#8217;s eclipsed by hundreds of millions of people playing games on mobile devices, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft needs to show that beyond sequel titles and its own new games, it can woo independent developers to deliver games that appeal to a wide audience, said Kevin Wong, a gamer in his second year at the University of Southern California. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;A lot of the movement in the industry, though, is toward independent developers and that&#8217;s going to be key to the success of this generation of consoles,&#8221; Wong said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There&#8217;s also some consternation among gamers about the ability to buy and sell, or share, used games. Microsoft issued a statement last week saying it&#8217;s &#8220;designing Xbox One to enable customers to trade in and resell games&#8221; and that more details would be shared later. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Early Adopters &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;As demand for personal computers wanes, the Xbox is one of Microsoft&#8217;s better-performing businesses. Sales in the entertainment and devices unit, including Xbox, rose 56 percent in the latest quarter to $2.53 billion. Underscoring the changing fortunes for companies at the intersection of software and consumer electronics, Microsoft shares have risen 24 percent over the past five years, compared with Sony&#8217;s 58 percent slump. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fanatical gamers matter because they&#8217;re vocal, Blau said. As early adopters, they buy consoles as soon as they come out. While many will eventually buy a second console later in the cycle, which one they buy first matters for game sales and in setting trends. Such consumers spend 140 percent more on games than the average buyer, according to NPD Group. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Exclusive Titles &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m a real believer that first, second and third areas of focus are about the game,&#8221; John Riccitiello, who was CEO of Electronic Arts Inc. (EA) until March, said in an interview earlier this month. &#8220;At least for the console business, the gamer is what carries the industry, and that the gamer needs to be well supported, because they&#8217;ve been left without a hardware choice for nearly a decade.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it plans 15 exclusive titles in Xbox One&#8217;s first year, with eight of those from new franchises. The company has already shown two -- a sequel to the Forza Motorsport franchise and a new game called &#8220;Quantum Break.&#8221; Games made only for one console are critical because, if they&#8217;re successful, they can boost hardware sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The only thing that really matters is that gamers are happy when they can actually go out and buy one of these things,&#8221; said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. in Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among sports titles, Electronics Arts said there would be exclusive content for Xbox. Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI) gave the first look at the new &#8220;Call of Duty: Ghosts,&#8221; the latest in a franchise that&#8217;s the top seller on Xbox. Downloadable content for that game will also come to Xbox before PlayStation 4, Activision said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Games First &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which entered the console market in 2001, has proved before that it can appeal to hard-core gamers. The company challenged Sony&#8217;s PlayStation 2 with titles such as &#8220;Halo&#8221; and Ubisoft Entertainment SA (UBI)&#8217;s &#8220;Tom Clancy&#8217;s Splinter Cell.&#8221; Microsoft was a pioneer in hardware and services that let players connect to the Internet and interact amid play. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft in the past has been first and foremost about gaming and satisfying that core audience,&#8221; said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now Microsoft pledges to show games at E3 that are equally appealing to frequent gamers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;If Microsoft doesn&#8217;t deliver on its promise, the negative sentiment that started will only get louder,&#8221; Blau said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Christopher Palmeri" date="May 30, 2013  4:41 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-30/disney-falls-after-rasulo-tempers-expectations-for-quarter-1-.html"><headline>Disney Falls After Rasulo Tempers Expectations for Quarter</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) fell the most in more
than a month after Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo tempered
expectations for the current quarter, citing film marketing
costs and tough comparisons with a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Disney, based in Burbank, California, declined
2.4 percent to $64.65 at the close in New York, the most since
April 15. The stock has gained 30 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rasulo, speaking at a Nomura Securities investor
conference, said he was reiterating and elaborating on comments
made earlier this month that the company&#8217;s film studio and theme
parks would be up against tough year-over-year comparisons in
the current fiscal third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When I&#8217;m looking at estimates across the Street, maybe I
wasn&#8217;t clear or they weren&#8217;t properly reflected,&#8221; Rasulo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney will incur significant marketing costs for &#8220;The
Lone Ranger&#8221; this quarter, while revenue from the film won&#8217;t
start to flow until July 3, after the period ends, he said.
&#8220;Iron Man 3,&#8221; while collecting about $1.2 billion at the
worldwide box office, will fall short of &#8220;Marvel&#8217;s The
Avengers&#8221; from last year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those items will lower operating income at the film unit by
about $150 million from a year earlier, Rasulo said. In
addition, cable-sports channel ESPN will recognize about $75
million less in deferred revenue for the period than a year ago,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Less Easter &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theme-park results will reflect one less week of Easter
holiday traffic, compared with the same period last year, Rasulo
said. The company won&#8217;t get the same earnings boost from the new
cruise ship Fantasy as it did a year earlier because the ship
has now been operating for more than a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts predict Disney will earn $1.05 a share this
quarter excluding items, the average of 29 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. They forecast sales of $11.8 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rasulo said the company&#8217;s acquisition strategy is focused
on film franchises that lead to business for other Disney units.
The 2006 purchase of the Pixar animation studio led to the
&#8220;Cars&#8221; movies, which translated into toys and theme-park
attractions. Marvel Entertainment brought &#8220;Iron Man 3&#8221; and
&#8220;The Avengers,&#8221; which is now being spun off into a television
show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is how we like to allocate our capital,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEMC Electronic Materials Inc. (WFR), the
second-largest U.S. polysilicon maker, rose to a 22-month high
after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) added the company to its
&#8220;conviction buy&#8221; list and increased its price target 25
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company rose 9.6 percent to $8.35 at the close in New
York, the highest since July 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MEMC &#8220;remains our top idea across our solar coverage given
a unique sum-of-the-parts story,&#8221; Brian Lee, a New York-based
analyst at Goldman, wrote in a note to investors today. Lee
increased his 12-month price target to $10 from $8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, based in St. Peters, Missouri, makes
polysilicon wafers that can be used in semiconductors and solar
cells. Shareholders are expected to vote today on changing the
company&#8217;s name to SunEdison Inc., the name of its solar unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hemlock Semiconductor Corp. is the biggest U.S. producer of
polysilicon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is restoring some old
Windows features and rolling out new ones in a bid to reignite
interest in its flagship operating system, after customers
complained about the software&#8217;s usability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows 8 debuted in October for tablets and personal
computers with a tile-based layout for selecting programs,
replacing a desktop design that let users start programs from a
button. An update later this year will restore the start button,
while adding search capabilities and other features, said Jensen
Harris, director of program management for Windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which redesigned its main product to appeal to
users switching to mobile, touch-based computing, has failed to
jump-start growth in the ailing PC market with Windows 8. While
tweaking designs and adding features will help, Microsoft needs
more applications running on Windows and a greater variety of
low-cost machines to stem the defection of consumers to tablets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure this helps them restore demand by itself,&#8221;
said Wes Miller, an analyst at Kirkland, Washington-based
Directions on Microsoft. &#8220;Bringing people back to Windows is a
question of apps and a device-cost question -- right now you
have to pay a premium price in general.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The update will let users set their machines to run the
previous desktop design as a default, rather than the new tiled
layout, Harris said. Windows 8.1 will also offer greater
flexibility to tweak the start screen&#8217;s tiles, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, said it will
release a test version of the Windows update on June 26. The
company will ship the final product later this year as a free
update for Windows 8 customers, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interim Upgrade &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users who are unfamiliar with the new design of Windows 8
had complained about the removal of the start button and menu,
and that Windows 8 machines only booted up to the new tiled
design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the update, the start button is visible when users touch
or move a mouse at the screen&#8217;s bottom-left corner. Previously,
Microsoft had a small image in that corner which also brought up
the start screen. The latest changes to Windows represent a move
forward rather than a retrenchment, said Antoine Leblond, vice
president of Windows program management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is anything but a U-turn,&#8221; Leblond said in an
interview. &#8220;There&#8217;s no question that our view is this modern
world is the future, and we want more apps developed on this
part of the platform.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Features &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Windows 8 allowed users to run two programs side by
side, the update will add the ability to adjust how much of the
screen is given to each one. For larger displays, the software
will let users open as many as four applications at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new software, code-named Blue, adds new search features
that return a wider variety of types of results. A search for
Marilyn Monroe lists her page in Windows 8&#8217;s Wikipedia app,
songs in various music apps, movie clips in other apps, as well
as web results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lock screen for Windows 8.1 will feature a slide show
of photos, and users will be able to answer Skype Web-based
calls without unlocking the machine. The automatically updating
tiles come in new sizes, from a small one to fit more apps on
the screen to a very large format that can show several recent
e-mails or appointments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PC Slump &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes are being introduced as Microsoft faces a
second straight year of shrinking PC shipments, according to
IDC. While tablet shipments are projected to climb 59 percent
this year and outpace PCs in 2015, sales of Surface, the
Microsoft&#8217;s tablet computer featuring Windows 8, are off to a
slow start, falling short of predictions, people familiar with
the matter said in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One issue, particularly for tablet customers, has been the
lack of applications for Windows 8, compared with more than
350,000 apps for Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPad. Windows now has about 79,000
apps, according to MetroStore Scanner, a website that tracks how
many apps are in the Windows store. Microsoft has added a new
health and fitness program, as well as a recipe one that can be
controlled with gestures to enable users who are cooking to keep
dirty fingers off the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Windows 8 update is a concession by Microsoft
that the new operating system may have turned off some
customers, the software maker isn&#8217;t backing away from its new
design, Miller said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s not giving in -- that&#8217;s just changing it to be
more usable,&#8221; Miller of Directions on Microsoft said. &#8220;People
need to realize Microsoft isn&#8217;t just going back to the way
Windows 7 was.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and a Chicago-based group of funds agreed to settle a lawsuit in which the
funds claimed JPMorgan gave faulty information involving
residential mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMF Funds sued JPMorgan in New York State Supreme Court in
Manhattan in February 2012, accusing the bank of making
&#8220;material representations and omissions&#8221; on underwriting
standards used to make mortgage loans pooled into $515.6 million
of securities purchased from May 2003 to May 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two sides have reached an agreement in principle to
settle the suit, according to letters filed by both sides in the
past week. Watertown Savings Bank, a Massachusetts lender and
former shareholder of AMF Funds, has asked to intervene in the
case, which both sides oppose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMF Funds, managed by Shay Assets Management Inc., had
about $590 million in assets under management in 2011, according
to its website. Mark Arisohn, an attorney with Labaton Sucharow
LLP representing the funds, and Darrell S. Cafasso, a lawyer
with Sullivan  Cromwell LLP for JPMorgan, didn&#8217;t immediately
return telephone calls seeking comment on the letters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
biggest recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
and the crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the
market for the securities evaporated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Asset Management Fund v. JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
650320/2012, New York State Supreme Court, New York County
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parliament today amended laws to require an environmental
impact study of exploration, limit usage of radioactive or toxic

Vilnius, the capital, said on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, a U.S. energy company, in January submitted the
only bid in a tender for shale-gas exploration rights in
Lithuania. The government, which seeks to develop shale-gas
resources as an alternative to imports of natural gas from
Russia, decided not to sign a deal with Chevron until laws on
the process could be improved. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MasterCard Inc. (MA), the second-biggest
U.S. payments network, will stop using Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
for asset-management services after discussing the matter with a
firm that advises shareholders on proxy votes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs had received a total of $230,000 in 2011 and
2012 for providing the services, Purchase, New York-based
MasterCard said today in a regulatory filing. Directors had
analyzed the payments when considering the independence of board
member Mark Schwartz, a Goldman Sachs vice chairman, according
to an annual filing last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwartz, 58, who joined the MasterCard board in 2006, is
chairman of the audit committee and on the corporate governance
committee, according to the April filing. Directors concluded
that the payments to New York-based Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t
compromise his independence, the filing shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MasterCard, led by Chief Executive Officer Ajay Banga, 53,
didn&#8217;t elaborate on the reasoning behind the decision in today&#8217;s
filing, which didn&#8217;t name the proxy firm. Chris Monteiro, a

Sachs&#8217;s David Wells didn&#8217;t have an immediate response. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The warehouses are Metro&#8217;s last three at the location,

&lt;p&gt;Russia selected 22 banks as possible

&lt;p&gt;The list to manage a planned $7 billion offering has four
domestic lenders and 18 foreign banks including Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), according
to a government decree published today and dated May 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The release indicates the government overcame a dispute
between the economy and finance ministries over how to pick
banks to organize the sale, which left Russia unable to tap the
market when yields fell to record lows earlier this year. The
world&#8217;s largest energy exporter sold $7 billion of bonds in
March 2012, including 30-year debt, in what was the largest
emerging-market sovereign issue since 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decree gives the Finance Ministry the right to select
from among the approved organizers for bond issues this year on
international capital markets. Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Storchak said May 16 the government was considering Deutsche
Bank and Citigroup Inc. (C), while Sberbank CIB, VTB Capital and OAO
Gazprombank were also candidates. There will be &#8220;rotation&#8221;
from the managers picked last year, according to Storchak. &lt;/p&gt;
