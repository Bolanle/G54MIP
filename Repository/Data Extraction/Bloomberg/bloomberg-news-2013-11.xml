&lt;p&gt;The following list comprises the
most-read Bloomberg News reports from the past week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;STORIES &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Goldman Pushes Junior Investment Bankers to Take Weekends Off &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc., this
year&#8217;s top merger adviser, is discouraging investment banking
analysts from working weekends as it overhauls demands placed on
entry-level employees and the support they receive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Goldman Shrinking Pay Shows Wall Street Set for Bonus Gloom &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 31 (Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which set
Wall Street pay records when stocks surged and cheap credit
abounded in 2007, is again leading the industry as markets boom
anew: putting aside less money for staff and more for investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Citigroup, JPMorgan Said to Put Senior Currency Dealers on
Leave &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 31 (Bloomberg) -- Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase 
Co. are putting their top London currency dealers on leave after
regulators probing the manipulation of foreign-exchange rates
started investigating the traders&#8217; use of an instant-message
group, three people with knowledge of the moves said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Fed Keeps $85 Billion QE Pace Awaiting Signs Growth Picks Up &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 30 (Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve decided to press
on with $85 billion in monthly bond purchases, saying it needs
to see more evidence that the economy will continue to improve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Sally Dawson, Deutsche Bank Debt Executive in London, Dies at
39 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Sally Dawson, a Deutsche Bank AG
executive in London who specialized in high-yield and
distressed-debt sales, has died. She was 39. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. Deutsche Bank Profit Slumps 94% on 1.2 Billion-Euro Charge &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Deutsche Bank AG, Europe&#8217;s largest
investment bank by revenue, said third-quarter profit slid 94
percent after it set aside 1.2 billion euros ($1.65 billion) to
cover potential legal costs and income from debt trading fell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. Insurance Policies Are Canceled in New Hurdle for Obamacare &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- The Obamacare rollout is leading to
the cancellation of hundreds of thousands of health insurance
plans nationwide, contradicting President Barack Obama&#8217;s
repeated pledge that people who like their coverage can keep it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. Barclays Said to Suspend Chief FX Dealer Ashton Amid Probe &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nov. 1 (Bloomberg) -- Barclays Plc has suspended three
currency traders, including a chief dealer in London, amid a
probe into potential foreign-exchange manipulation, according to
a person with knowledge of the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9. Citigroup Currency Staff Work London Evenings on Dodd-Frank &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 28 (Bloomberg) -- For the foreign-exchange sales team
in Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s London office, Dodd-Frank regulations mean
extra hours at work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10. U.S. Stocks Fall With Gold, Treasuries on Fed Policy
Statement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 30 (Bloomberg) -- The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index fell
for the first time in five days and gold and Treasuries dropped,
while the dollar reversed earlier declines, as the Federal
Reserve fueled speculation it will begin to slow the pace of
stimulus in coming months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;COLUMNS &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Apple&#8217;s New IPad Is Slimmed Down, Speeded Up: Rich
Jaroslovsky &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 30 (Bloomberg) -- Apple calls the latest version of
its full-sized tablet the iPad Air, which is a better name than
&#8220;iPad Semi Mini.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. If Fed Can&#8217;t Get Good Numbers, Check the Leaders: Caroline
Baum &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 31 (Bloomberg) -- Financial markets have become
increasingly dependent on the Federal Reserve. The Fed is
dependent on data (just in case you didn&#8217;t know). The data for
the next few months will be distorted by the federal government
shutdown during the first half of October. So what&#8217;s a
responsible policy maker or investor to do to get a handle on
how the U.S. economy is faring? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. China Mimics the Worst of Abenomics at Worst Time: William
Pesek &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- If imitation really is the greatest
form of flattery, Shinzo Abe should be thrilled the Chinese are
copying his &#8220;Abenomics&#8221; strategy to excite investors. The rest
of the world shouldn&#8217;t be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Federal Reserve&#8217;s Bubble Alarm Is Stuck on Snooze: Jonathan
Weil &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nov. 1 (Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve&#8217;s policy of
unrestrained quantitative easing has worked like rocket fuel for
U.S. stocks this year. Case in point: Rocket Fuel Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Edward Snowden Has Japan Copying China&#8217;s Playbook: William
Pesek &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nov. 1 (Bloomberg) -- Shinzo Abe is so obsessed with China
eclipsing Japan on the global stage that he&#8217;s adopting some of
his neighbor&#8217;s policies. What else can we say about the secrecy
law the prime minister&#8217;s cabinet approved on Oct. 25, an act
that would do so much to undermine and constrain his people&#8217;s
right to know? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MULTIMEDIA &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Rocker Lou Reed Dies at 71, Sales of Songs May Surge &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Lou Reed, a New York-based rock
musician who co-founded the Velvet Underground and wrote and
sang &#8220;Walk on the Wild Side,&#8221; has died at the age of 71. Mark
Beech reports with Francine Lacqua on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s
&#8220;The Pulse.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Sebelius Apologizes for Obamacare Website Problems &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 30 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. Health and Human Services

&lt;p&gt;Oct. 31 (Bloomberg) -- The Boston Red Sox won their third

St. Louis Cardinals, wrapping up a championship at home for the
first time in 95 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. New Apple IPad Is Slimmed Down, Speeded Up: Rich Jaroslovsky &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 30 (Bloomberg) -- Bloomberg&#8217;s Rich Jaroslovsky reviews
Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPad Air, the latest version of its full-sized
tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Cook Says Apple Is Exploring New Product Categories &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Tim Cook, chief executive officer of
Apple Inc., and Peter Oppenheimer, chief financial officer,
speak on a teleconference about the company&#8217;s fiscal fourth-quarter results and first-quarter forecast. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following list comprises the
most-read Bloomberg News reports during October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;STORIES &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Stocks Rally Most Since January, Bill Rates Fall on Debt
Talks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 10 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks jumped the most since
January and Treasury bill rates tumbled as lawmakers moved
toward an agreement to raise the debt ceiling and avoid a
default. Gold slumped while oil rallied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Goldman Pushes Junior Investment Bankers to Take Weekends Off &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc., this
year&#8217;s top merger adviser, is discouraging investment banking
analysts from working weekends as it overhauls demands placed on
entry-level employees and the support they receive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Stocks Surge as VIX, Treasury Bill Rates Slide on U.S. Debt
Deal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 16 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks surged while the
benchmark gauge of options prices slid the most in two years as
the Senate crafted a deal to end the government shutdown and
raise the debt ceiling. Treasury bill rates dropped while energy
led commodities higher and the yen fell against all major peers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Goldman Shrinking Pay Shows Wall Street Set for Bonus Gloom &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 31 (Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which set
Wall Street pay records when stocks surged and cheap credit
abounded in 2007, is again leading the industry as markets boom
anew: putting aside less money for staff and more for investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Wall Street Hires Losers Turned Winners After College
Athletics &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Inside One Equity Partners are as
many as eight Olympians and even more of their world- or Olympic
gold medals, said managing partner Dick Cashin, who competed
internationally as a rower and now hires former college athletes
while recommending others do the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. Meredith Whitney Winds Down Brokerage After Setting Up Fund &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 10 (Bloomberg) -- Meredith Whitney, who built her own
Wall Street advisory firm after winning renown for a 2007 call
on Citigroup Inc., deregistered her brokerage unit following
three unprofitable years and is setting up an investment fund,
according to industry records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. A U.S. Default Seen as Catastrophe Dwarfing Lehman&#8217;s Demise &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 7 (Bloomberg) -- Anyone who remembers the collapse of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. little more than five years ago
knows what a global financial disaster is. A U.S. government
default, just weeks away if Congress fails to raise the debt
ceiling as it now threatens to do, will be an economic calamity
like none the world has ever seen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. Ex-RBS Trader in U.K. Currency Probe Said to Be JPMorgan&#8217;s
Usher &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 15 (Bloomberg) -- Richard Usher, JPMorgan Chase 
Co.&#8217;s chief dealer in London, wrote instant messages while he
was at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc that U.K. regulators are
scrutinizing as part of their investigation of alleged currency
manipulation, two people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9. Senate Crafts Fiscal Deal Amid Signs Boehner Will Accept It &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 16 (Bloomberg) -- The bipartisan leaders of the U.S.
Senate reached an agreement to end the fiscal impasse and to
increase U.S. borrowing authority. The Senate and House plan to
vote on it later today, and the White House press secretary said
President Barack Obama supports the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;10. RBS Said to Give Currency Trader&#8217;s Chats to FCA Amid Probe &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 9 (Bloomberg) -- Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc has
handed over records of instant messages to U.K. regulators after
concluding a former currency trader&#8217;s communications with
counterparts at other firms may have been inappropriate,
according to two people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;COLUMNS &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. John Boehner to Tea Party: Shut Yourself Down: Margaret
Carlson &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 15 (Bloomberg) -- &#8220;Thank you, Mr. President. Signed,
John Boehner.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Why Wealthiest Are in the Taxman&#8217;s Crosshairs: A. Gary
Shilling &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 23 (Bloomberg) -- After the recent recession, the
personal-taxes-to-personal-income ratio dropped well below the
12.3 percent long-run average, a casualty of the tax cuts,
depressed household incomes and the weak recovery. In
combination with depressed corporate tax collections and
increased federal spending -- especially in 2009, when outlays
equaled 6 percent of gross domestic product -- these forces
pushed the federal deficit to more than $1 trillion a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Apple&#8217;s New IPad Is Slimmed Down, Speeded Up: Rich
Jaroslovsky &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 30 (Bloomberg) -- Apple calls the latest version of
its full-sized tablet the iPad Air, which is a better name than
&#8220;iPad Semi Mini.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Who Really Wins if JPMorgan Pays $13 Billion?: Jonathan Weil &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 20 (Bloomberg) -- Memories of the fictional sports
announcer Biff Burns came to mind this weekend amid all of the
anonymously attributed news reports that the Justice Department
had reached a tentative settlement agreement with JPMorgan Chase
 Co. worth $13 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.  Steve Jobs Never Worried About Debt Ceiling: Caroline Baum &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 3 (Bloomberg) -- Everyone knows, or has heard the
cliche, that markets hate uncertainty. It&#8217;s also a given that
the future is always uncertain. How, then, do markets ever
manage to function -- or, for that matter, businesses, which
must make decisions today about investments that will pay off in
the future? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MULTIMEDIA &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Draghi Says ECB Ready to Act to Control Money Markets &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 2 (Bloomberg) -- European Central Bank President Mario
Draghi speaks at a news conference in Paris about euro-area
inflation, money-market rates, economic activity and the process
of an asset-quality review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Drum-O&#8217;Neill Seeks College Athletes for Wall Street &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Carly Drum-O&#8217;Neill, founder of Drum
Associates&#8217; unit devoted exclusively to current and former
college athletes, talks about the executive search firm&#8217;s
efforts to find accomplished athletes for entry-level positions
on Wall Street. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Obama Warns of Deep Recession If Debt Limit Not Raised &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 8 (Bloomberg) -- President Barack Obama speaks about
the U.S. government shutdown and federal debt ceiling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Bitcoin Price Swings as Startups Draw Regulators&#8217; Glare &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct. 3 (Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin, the digital currency, has
gained prominence this year for its wild price swings and for
piquing the interest of regulators from New York to Germany.

Moore" date="Nov 04, 2013  7:00 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-04/goldman-sachs-to-bofa-said-to-trade-with-sac-after-guilty-plea.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs to BofA Are Said to Trade With SAC After Plea Deal</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) are among Wall Street
firms still catering to SAC Capital Advisors LP after the hedge
fund agreed to plead guilty to insider trading charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks, which also include Morgan Stanley, continue to
provide trading and prime-brokerage services to SAC, said people
briefed on the matter, who requested anonymity when discussing
specific clients. The hedge-fund firm, run by billionaire Steven A. Cohen, agreed yesterday to pay $1.8 billion -- a record
penalty for insider trading -- to settle allegations it
illicitly reaped hundreds of millions of dollars since 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The presumption is that if JPMorgan should resign the
business, then someone else would do it,&#8221; said Roy Smith, a
finance professor at New York University&#8217;s Stern School of
Business and a former Goldman Sachs partner. &#8220;These people all
say we serve our clients, so if our clients get into trouble, we
serve them as long as we can.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are weighing the potential damage to their
reputations and finances if they continue dealing with Stamford,
Connecticut-based SAC, one of Wall Street&#8217;s largest trading
clients. While SAC agreed to stop managing money for outsiders,
it may continue investing Cohen&#8217;s personal fortune of about $9
billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter Schiff lays an iPod-sized bar valued at about $40,000 on the sun room floor of his Connecticut mansion, and calculates it would cost about $250,000 for each floor tile to pave the room with gold. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He shows off $50 gold chips, to be used when paper money becomes worthless, a prediction repeated on his daily two-hour radio show broadcast from his basement studio to 68 stations in 30 states and 50,000 listeners online. The unabashed gold bug&#8217;s Euro Pacific Capital Inc. manages a $20 million mutual fund that invests in stocks related to the metal and lost 6.4 percent since it began in July. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Gold and Silver Index slid 1.5 percent in the same period. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Schiff, 50, isn&#8217;t fazed that gold is heading for its first annual price drop in 13 years, or that Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has called it a &#8220;slam-dunk sell.&#8221; He predicts bullion will reverse its 21 percent year-to-date decline and probably surge 52 percent to reach a record $2,000 an ounce within a year. That&#8217;s just the beginning: Schiff said he would &#8220;be amazed&#8221; if the U.S. dollar didn&#8217;t collapse and gold failed to skyrocket before President Barack Obama leaves office in 2017. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m waiting for the dollar crash, I&#8217;m waiting for the real crisis to hit that I know will benefit gold,&#8221; Schiff said Oct. 18 over lunch of spinach-and-beet salad and stewed rabbit in the sun room after the radio show. &#8220;The longer it takes, the longer I have to wait for that payday. But the longer it takes, the bigger that payday is going to be.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UBS AG (UBSN) and Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN),
Switzerland&#8217;s biggest banks, may have to shrink their fixed-income, currencies and commodities activities if the nation&#8217;s
regulator imposes higher leverage ratios than currently planned,
according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse in particular would be hit by rules forcing
banks to hold more capital in relation to their assets, analysts
led by Kian Abouhossein wrote in a note to clients today. While
both firms are estimated to reach Swiss leverage ratios of at
least 4.2 percent by 2015, a Finance Ministry proposal that the
measure be raised to 6 percent would lead to &#8220;material
uncertainty&#8221; and possible cuts in FICC, they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swiss Finance Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf told Schweiz
am Sonntag in an interview published yesterday that leverage
ratios of &#8220;6 percent to 10 percent are being discussed,&#8221;
calling the current level &#8220;too low.&#8221; Banks would have to
&#8220;consider whether to carry on with investment banking or focus
even more on asset management,&#8221; she told the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse declined 6.7 percent to 26.21 Swiss francs in
Zurich trading, the biggest drop since June 2012, while UBS fell
5.3 percent to 16.54 francs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Global Efforts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focus on leverage is the latest effort by global
regulators to prevent a repeat of taxpayer-funded rescues of the
financial crisis. In the U.S., banking regulators proposed
leverage ratios at 5 percent for holding companies and 6 percent
for their banking units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roland Meier, a spokesman at the Finance Ministry in Bern,
said by telephone today there won&#8217;t be any changes before the
results of a 2015 too-big-to-fail bank review are published. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS said on Oct. 29 it probably won&#8217;t be able to reach its
profitability goal in 2015 after the Swiss regulator demanded it
hold more capital for risks related to litigation. Credit Suisse
last month reported third-quarter earnings that missed analysts&#8217;
estimates as profit at its investment bank fell and said it&#8217;s
scaling back its interest-rates trading business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse would have to cut exposure by as much as 284
billion francs ($312 billion), while UBS would have to shrink by
as much as 260 billion francs, JPMorgan said in the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Cliff Edwards" date="Nov 04, 2013 11:18 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-04/valve-lines-up-console-partners-in-challenge-to-microsoft-sony.html"><headline>Valve Lines Up Console Partners in Challenge to Microsoft, Sony</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Valve Corp., the largest online
retailer of games downloaded to PCs, is working with &#8220;more than
a dozen&#8221; partners, including computer makers, to begin selling
consoles that take on Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Sony Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closely held company, maker of the &#8220;Half-Life&#8221;
titles, will introduce the companies in early January at the
Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, said Greg Coomer, one of
the lead designers. They plan to produce and sell the consoles
next year using variations of Valve&#8217;s prototype design,
controller and Steam operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s different categories of partner,&#8221; Coomer said in
an interview. &#8220;Some of them will be able to serve millions of
Steam customers, some of them are boutique shops.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valve is taking the offensive as its own market is invaded
by Microsoft, Sony and others, banking on global base of
personal-computer gamers to seize some of the $15 billion market
for home consoles. Microsoft and Sony (6758), which are introducing new
machines for the holidays, have started their own Internet
portals to duplicate Steam&#8217;s success selling games, as have Wii
U maker Nintendo (7974) and Electronic Arts Inc. (EA) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SteamOS machines will sell for different prices and
configurations, the Bellevue, Washington-based company said.
Depending on those, some Steam games may not play on each
device. This month, the company plans to test the devices with
300 users to polish features before next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valve also is working with music and movie services to
deliver streamed entertainment to the machines, Coomer said.
With Internet access, game consoles have evolved into
entertainment hubs, providing movies, TV shows and music from
Netflix Inc. (NFLX) and Pandora Media Inc. (P) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Market Share &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valve captures 75 percent of the global market for digital
PC games through its Steam store, researcher IHS Screen Digest
has estimated. While the company doesn&#8217;t disclose sales, digital
distribution of PC games this year will comprise $5.5 billion of
the $21.4 billion computer games market, according to DFC
Intelligence, another researcher. IHS estimates Valve generated
$1.1 billion in 2012 from full-game downloads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get developers to go along, Valve is passing up the
licensing fees that competitors charge for access to their
systems. Valve plans to hold a developers conference in January,
according to company officials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The main goal of Steam has always been to increase the
quality of the user&#8217;s experience by reducing the distance
between content creators and their audience,&#8221; Gabe Newell,
Valve&#8217;s co-founder, said in an Oct. 30 statement. &#8220;In the
coming year, we plan to make perhaps our most significant
collaborations with both communities through the Steam Dev Days
and the Steam Machines beta.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wooing Developers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steam&#8217;s business is also threatened by the console makers&#8217;
plans to include games compatible with Unity Technologies, which
offers a game-development engine to create products for
different platforms. Valve is trying to woo the same developers
by promising they can post updates and fixes immediately,
without waiting for the usual approvals required by big brands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SteamOS adds features to the Steam service across all
platforms, including family sharing, and in-home streaming.
Because it&#8217;s based on the Linux operating system, developers
must create games using that software. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Steel Corp. (X) and AK Steel Holding
Corp. (AKS) gained after after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its
rating on the unprofitable companies to buy from sell and said
the outlook for the domestic steel industry is improving because
of higher demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AK rose 11 percent to $5.11 at 10:31 a.m. in New York after
climbing as much as 13 percent, the biggest intraday increase
since June 27. U.S. Steel Corp., the country&#8217;s largest producer
of the metal by volume, rose as much as 5.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see the sector heading to a sustainable recovery over
the coming years,&#8221; Sal Tharani, a New York-based analyst at
Goldman, said in a note today. He revised his view of the U.S.
steel industry to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;cautious.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The supply-demand fundamentals for steel are starting to
look more appealing, particularly for flat steel, as some supply
has been taken out and demand drivers are firmly in place,&#8221; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. steel industry has suffered from global
overcapacity since the financial crisis. Pittsburgh-based U.S.
Steel, the country&#8217;s largest producer of the metal by volume,
said Oct. 30 it will permanently close parts of plants in the
U.S. and Canada as it tries to reduce costs after four
unprofitable quarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domestic steel prices are recovering. Hot-rolled steel
coil, a benchmark product used in manufacturing, are at $660 a
short ton, the highest since September last year, according to
data from The Steel Index, a trade publication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Steel and West Chester, Ohio-based AK use blast
furnaces to process iron ore and then combine the iron with
other raw materials in basic-oxygen furnaces to make steel. U.S.
competitors Nucor Corp. (NUE) and Steel Dynamics Inc. (STLD), which remelt
scrap, have cheaper operating costs. Tharani today raised Fort
Wayne, Indiana-based Steel Dynamics to buy from hold. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (MKTX), the owner
of an electronic bond and derivatives-trading system, named
former JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) investment banker William Cruger to
its board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cruger, 55, was vice chairman of investment banking for
JPMorgan before leaving the firm in June, New York-based
MarketAxess said today in a statement. He joins former Goldman
Sachs Group inc. partner Jane Chwick, who was named to the
electronic trading firm&#8217;s board last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Bill has been a trusted partner and investment-banking
adviser to MarketAxess since the firm&#8217;s inception,&#8221; Chief
Executive Officer Rick McVey said in the statement. &#8220;He is
widely respected as one of the leading market structure experts
in the global exchange and electronic-trading space.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronic bond trading is gaining momentum as new
regulations curbing risk prompt banks to trim inventories of
corporate debt, reducing their willingness to act as middlemen
between buyers and sellers. Goldman Sachs has expanded its
GSessions electronic-trading system, while BlackRock Inc. (BLK), the
world&#8217;s largest asset manager, decided this year to route some
of its trades through MarketAxess&#8217;s computerized system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cruger, who advised Raymond James Financial Inc. on its
$930 million deal to acquire Morgan Keegan  Co. last year, is
at least the second senior adviser to exchanges and other
securities businesses to leave New York-based JPMorgan in recent
months. Joseph Molluso left to join electronic trading firm
Virtu Financial LLC as its chief financial officer, the New
York-based firm said in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cruger held various senior positions at JPMorgan before
being named vice chairman of investing banking including
managing director in the financial institutions group from 1996
to 2011, according to the statement. He earlier ran the firm&#8217;s
investment-banking practices in Asia and Latin America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News,
competes with MarketAxess to provide electronic-trading systems
for fixed-income markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Christie Smythe" date="Nov 05, 2013  3:32 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-05/ecuador-judge-says-19-billion-chevron-ruling-was-his-own.html"><headline>Ecuador Judge Says $19 Billion Chevron Ruling Was His Own</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;A former Ecuadorean judge who issued
a $19 billion pollution ruling against Chevron Corp. told a U.S.
court that he worked alone on the case and denied the company&#8217;s
allegation that his decision was ghostwritten. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicolas Zambrano, the former judge, testified in a trial in
federal court in Manhattan today that the only help he received
in preparing his 188-page ruling issued in 2011 came from an
18-year-old secretary who typed his dictation and conducted
Internet research for him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron claims in a racketeering case before U.S. District
Judge Lewis Kaplan that the plaintiffs in the environmental case
won the ruling through bribery and fraud. The San Ramon,
California-based energy company alleges that Zambrano and
another former Ecuadorean judge, Alberto Guerra, were bribed to
steer the case in favor of the plaintiffs and the $19 billion
judgment was actually written by the plaintiffs and Guerra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No one has helped me to write the judgment,&#8221; Zambrano
said through a translator today when questioned by a lawyer for
Chevron, Randy Mastro. &#8220;I was the one who explicitly drafted
it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former judge, who also served as a prosecutor in
Ecuador, said he spent &#8220;many hours, many days&#8221; on the ruling.
He was unable to answer questions Mastro asked about specifics
in the judgment, such as the identity of a substance that had
been described in the document as &#8220;the most powerful
carcinogenic agent&#8221; and information described as &#8220;statistical
data of the highest importance to delivering this ruling.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Internet Research &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Zambrano said he couldn&#8217;t read or speak English or
French, Mastro asked how he had managed to cite U.S., Australian
and French legal authorities in the judgment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As I stated in my deposition, the young woman who would
help me type the judgment, she was the one going on the
Internet&#8221; and she &#8220;chose the Spanish option,&#8221; Zambrano said.
&#8220;That is how I would become aware or informed of the subject I
was interested in. She would print them so I could read them
later.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guerra testified Oct. 23 that Zambrano routinely paid him
to ghostwrite rulings in his cases, including the Chevron
ruling. Guerra also said that Zambrano had been promised
$500,000 by the plaintiffs from the proceeds of the judgment and
had told Guerra he could also get a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Draft Orders &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zambrano testified that Guerra aided him in preparing
drafts of court orders, although not in the Chevron case.
Zambrano denied paying Guerra for his help. He previously has
denied accepting bribes to issue a ruling in favor of the
plaintiffs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the second-largest U.S.-based energy firm, claims
that lawyers for the plaintiffs, led by Manhattan attorney
Steven Donziger, engaged in a scheme to extort money from the
company during a 20-year legal battle over pollution in an
Ecuador oil concession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is seeking an order barring lawyers for the
Ecuadoreans from trying to enforce the 2011 pollution judgment
in countries where Chevron has assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guerra now lives in the U.S. and receives $12,000 per month
from Chevron along with other benefits through at least 2015
under an agreement with the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Drilling Wastes &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the environmental case, Donziger and other lawyers for
indigenous people in Ecuador&#8217;s Lago Agrio region sought damages
for Texaco Inc.&#8217;s alleged dumping of toxic drilling wastes from
1964 until about 1992. The lawsuit continued against Chevron
when it acquired Texaco in 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron contends that state-owned Petroecuador, a former
Texaco joint-venture partner, is responsible for most of the
pollution and that Texaco already paid to clean up its share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donziger claims he did nothing illegal in Ecuador and that
his tactics were no different from Chevron&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The racketeering case is Chevron Corp. (CVX) v. Donziger, 11-cv-00691, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). The appeals court case is In Re Naranjo, 13-00772,
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, facing mounting calls to resign after allegations of drug use, admitted for the first time publicly he had smoked crack cocaine, likely when he was drunk. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Yes I have smoked crack cocaine,&#8221; Ford, 44, said today at city hall in a media conference broadcast by CP24 television. &#8220;Probably in one of my drunken stupors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ford&#8217;s admission comes amid pressure for him to resign after Toronto police said last week they had found a video that showed the mayor of Canada&#8217;s biggest city appearing to inhale from a glass pipe. The Toronto Star and U.S. website Gawker were the first to report on the video in May, sparking a five-month police investigation that included airplane surveillance and cameras mounted on poles tracking Ford&#8217;s movements. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the time, the mayor said he didn&#8217;t smoke crack and that he couldn&#8217;t comment on a video he had not seen. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ford, who apologized on Nov. 3 for being &#8220;hammered&#8221; at a street party in August and for being in his office at 2 a.m. on St. Patrick&#8217;s Day with a half-empty bottle of brandy, vowed to curb his drinking and get a driver. He has said repeatedly he has no plans to resign. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ford repeated that vow today and said he would not take a leave of absence, according to the Toronto Sun newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oliver Bolitho, chairman of Goldman
Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s fund management division in Asia, is leaving
after 15 years at the company, according to an internal memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bolitho will become an advisory director after his
retirement at the end of the year, according to the Nov. 4 memo
obtained by Bloomberg. Christopher Jun, a spokesman for Goldman
Sachs in Seoul, confirmed the contents of the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bolitho, a U.K. citizen, served as head of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
U.K. and Irish institutional business from 2001 until moving to
Hong Kong in 2007 to run the fund business in Asia outside of
Japan. A partner since 2008, Bolitho became chairman of Goldman
Sachs Asset Management last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His departure comes almost a year after Goldman Sachs Asset
Management moved Sheila Patel to Singapore from London to lead
the fund business in Asia outside of Japan and said that Bolitho
would report to Patel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs had $878 billion of assets under management
as of Sept. 30, according to the New York-based company&#8217;s third-quarter earnings report. The company doesn&#8217;t report how much of
that is in Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AsianInvestor, a Hong Kong-based trade journal, reported
Bolitho&#8217;s pending departure on its website earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management runs hedge funds, private
equity and real estate investments alongside those in fixed
income, stocks, money markets and commodities, according to its
website. The unit employs more than 700 investment specialists
in 32 offices worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs agreed to buy Benchmark Asset Management Co.,
India&#8217;s largest provider of index-tracking funds, in March 2011,
after setting up its own mutual-fund unit in the country in
2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also teamed up with RHB Capital Bhd. (RHBC), Malaysia&#8217;s fifth-largest banking group, in 2010 to jointly develop fund
management products. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s liquidity
coverage ratio, a measure of its ability to survive a credit-market freeze, surpasses the minimum proposed by the Federal
Reserve last month, said Treasurer Liz Beshel Robinson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs would top the minimum even under the Fed&#8217;s
proposed stricter guidelines and therefore wouldn&#8217;t be affected
by a shorter timeline than international banks may face,
Robinson said today on a conference-call with fixed-income
investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed last month proposed rules to require the biggest
banks to hold 30 days of easy-to-sell assets to make the
companies safer in the event of a credit crisis like the one in
2008. The plan had a shorter timeline than non-U.S. banks will
face and was more restrictive in what U.S. banks can include
among their assets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.K. will offer an invitation-only visa program for business travelers who use those services

&lt;p&gt;Membership in the so-called &#8220;Great Club&#8221; will be offered

an account manager to make the process easier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government is also planning to widen its priority
three-to-five-day visa service to 90 countries from the current
67, as well as introducing a VIP mobile visa service for India. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes to visa services services &#8220;will allow us to
maintain a world class, competitive visa system that can
innovate in order to serve the ever-changing needs of
business,&#8221; Home Secretary Theresa May said in the statement.
&#8220;We will continue to listen and respond to the needs of high-value and high-priority businesses so that we can provide them

&lt;p&gt;Francis Dunleavy, the JPMorgan Chase
 Co. (JPM) energy executive who ran the Houston unit that developed
trading strategies deemed illegal by the U.S. Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, has retired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move, ending a career spanning more than three decades,
took effect last month, Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for the New
York-based bank, said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dunleavy, as head of JPMorgan&#8217;s principal investments unit,
oversaw bidding strategies that the FERC said manipulated power
markets. JPMorgan agreed in July to pay $410 million and forgo
collecting on $262 million in disputed payments from
California&#8217;s grid operator to settle the charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dunleavy was a Bear Stearns Cos. veteran, joining that firm
in 1982 and becoming one of its senior energy executives,
according to Financial Industry Regulatory Authority records.
JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, acquired Bear Stearns
in 2008. Andrew Kittell and John Bartholomew, who both reported
to Dunleavy, still work for the bank, Marchiony said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the FERC didn&#8217;t sanction individuals in the case, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation opened a separate probe to see
if anyone committed crimes, a person briefed on the matter said
in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dunleavy resigned from JPMorgan warehouse operator Henry
Bath  Son Ltd., effective Oct. 25, according to a filing
earlier this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Scherman, an attorney for Dunleavy at Gibson Dunn 
Crutcher LLP in Washington, said his client wasn&#8217;t available to
comment. Reuters reported on Dunleavy&#8217;s departure from JPMorgan
earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and other underwriters on Twitter Inc. (TWTR)&#8217;s initial public offering will share about $59.2 million for managing the sale after accepting one of the smallest fee rates for a U.S. IPO this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The banks are receiving 3.25 percent of the $1.82 billion that Twitter raised in its IPO, according to a regulatory filing today. Goldman Sachs led the sale, with help from firms including Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase  Co. The fee pool is typically split unevenly among underwriters, with larger shares going to banks more actively involved in the process. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Twitter&#8217;s banker fees reflect a smaller proportion than underwriters have received in nearly every U.S. initial offering this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. While investment banks use fee income as a major measure of success in deal underwriting, firms are sometimes willing to take a smaller share of proceeds for high-profile sales that may generate future business. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman being the first name on the S-1 has little to do with fees,&#8221; Max Wolff, chief economist and strategist at ZT Wealth, said by phone from New York. &#8220;This is about Goldman rebalancing itself as a serious leader and competing with Morgan Stanley&#8217;s dominant position in technology.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) agreed to create four
television series for Netflix Inc. (NFLX) using Marvel characters such
as Daredevil, adding to the online-streaming service&#8217;s growing
lineup of original content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s Marvel TV will start bringing the shows to Netflix
in 2015, according to a statement today. They will focus on
heroes battling villains in New York&#8217;s Hell&#8217;s Kitchen. Netflix
committed to a minimum of four 13-episode series, culminating in
the miniseries &#8220;The Defenders.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multiyear deal extends Marvel&#8217;s push into live-action
TV, following the September debut of &#8220;Marvel&#8217;s Agents of
S.H.I.E.L.D.&#8221; on Disney&#8217;s ABC network. Netflix gains more
Disney content following an agreement last year for rights to
show movies including Marvel, Pixar and Lucasfilm titles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What&#8217;s exciting for a company like Disney and us is the
willingness to try something new,&#8221; Netflix Chief Content
Officer Ted Sarandos said Nov. 4 at the Business of
Entertainment event in Los Angeles, sponsored by Bloomberg and
the Tribeca Film Festival. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney is mining deeper in Marvel&#8217;s library following box-office success since purchasing the comic-book company in 2009.
&#8220;Marvel&#8217;s The Avengers&#8221; and &#8220;Iron Man 3&#8221; were the top-grossing films of 2012 and 2013 respectively. &#8220;Guardians of the
Galaxy,&#8221; about a team of superheroes in space, is planned for
next year, and an Ant-Man movie is scheduled for 2015. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North American shale explorers led by
Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and BP Plc (BP/) are failing to disclose enough data
on how they&#8217;re reducing risks associated with hydraulic
fracturing, according to a study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Hydraulic fracturing operations are under intense
scrutiny for potential harm to neighboring communities and the
environment -- from air and water pollution to increased noise,
traffic and crime,&#8221; Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow
Foundation, a non-profit focused on environmental and corporate
responsibility, said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No company disclosed information on even half of the 32
indicators that investors need to assess business risk, the
report showed. Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, and London-based
BP placed near the bottom of 24 companies evaluated. Encana
Corp. (ECA), the best performer, provided information on only 14 of
the 32 indicators. Only one company, Chevron Corp. (CVX), quantified
its reductions in the use of toxic chemicals and it failed in 29
other categories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, cracks rock with a
mixture of millions of gallons of water, sand and chemicals so
oil and natural gas will flow. Coupled with horizontal drilling
that exposes thousands of feet of petroleum-bearing rock to well
bores, it has revived growth in U.S. oil and gas production.
Checklist items in today&#8217;s report range from the absence of
diesel fuels in fracturing fluids to traffic congestion policy
and disclosure of fines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report was released by Boston Common Asset Management
LLC, Green Century (GCEQX) Capital Management Inc., Investor
Environmental Health Network and As You Sow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reduce Disruptions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies that disclose steps to reduce disruptions by
fracking &#8220;will reduce regulatory and reputational risks;
enhance their likelihood of securing and maintaining their
social license to operate; reduce liabilities associated with
poor performance, spills, contamination, and lawsuits; and
thereby increase their access to capital,&#8221; the authors wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the co-authors was Richard Liroff of Investor
Environmental Health Network, whose 2011 report on fracking was
the basis for the checklist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors thrive on quantitative information,&#8221; Liroff
said today in a phone interview. &#8220;It gives us a sense of the
extent to which various practices are being adopted that can,
one, reduce environmental risk and community impact and, two,
save the companies money.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report defined disclosure as public information on
company websites and financial statements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As You Sow is based in Oakland, California, Boston Common (BCAMX)
Asset Management and Green Century are based in Boston and the
Investor Environmental Health Network is based in Falls Church,
Virginia. &lt;/p&gt;

retiring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sherwood, a London-based vice chairman, will coordinate the
company&#8217;s units in so-called growth markets, Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and President Gary D. Cohn said today
in a memo to employees. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the New
York-based bank, confirmed the memo&#8217;s contents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sherwood, 48, &#8220;will help drive our strategy, identify new
commercial opportunities and allocate resources in countries
experiencing stronger economic growth and rapid business and
capital markets development,&#8221; Blankfein and Cohn wrote in the
memo. &#8220;Michael will also oversee the performance of our
businesses, including their footprint and pace of growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sherwood, a Briton, joined Goldman Sachs in 1986 and became
a partner in 1994, according to the memo. He was promoted to
vice chairman in February 2008, at the same time as Evans, and
kept his role as co-CEO of Goldman Sachs International. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sherwood rose through the ranks of the fixed-income
department like Blankfein, 59, and Cohn, 53. He was co-head of
the trading business from 2003 to 2008. He&#8217;s currently chairman
of the partnership committee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which had
the steepest drop in trading revenue among Wall Street&#8217;s largest
banks, posted losses from that business on 15 days during the
third quarter, the most since 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traders made more than $100 million on four days in the
three months ended Sept. 30, down from seven days in the year-earlier period, the New York-based company said in a regulatory
filing today. None of the losses were more than $50 million and
none topped the bank&#8217;s so-called value-at-risk, an estimate of
potential trading losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs generated $2.86 billion from its trading
division in the third quarter, a 32 percent decrease from the
year-earlier period. Client activity fell and the firm struggled
to manage inventory amid speculation about whether the Federal
Reserve would ease its economic stimulus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Concerns about the global economic outlook created a more
difficult operating environment for our clients in the third
quarter,&#8221; Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said on a
conference call last month. &#8220;These challenges were amplified by
the seasonal slowdown traditionally impacting client activity in
July and August.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s inventory fell to $244.3 billion, a 25 percent
drop from a year earlier and a 12 percent decline from the end
of the second quarter. The was the biggest decline and the
lowest absolute amount since the bank started disclosing the
figure at the end of 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of days with losses was the highest since the
firm had 17 such days in the fourth quarter of 2011. The four
days of gains of more than $100 million were the fewest since
the second quarter of 2012. Goldman Sachs hasn&#8217;t had fewer than
four such days in a quarter since 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. posted daily losses twice during the
quarter, including a $21 million misstep. Morgan Stanley posted
losses on seven days, including two that topped $25 million. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world&#8217;s largest
beverage company, plans to invest more than $4 billion in China
from 2015 to 2017 as it builds factories and adds new products
to meet demand and counter rising competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Atlanta-based company is also open to acquisitions in
China and may consider deals with complementary businesses, such
as makers of juices or plant-protein drinks like almond milk,
David Brooks, president of Coca-Cola&#8217;s Greater China and Korea
business unit, said in an Nov. 6 interview in Shanghai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You will see an absolute increase in investment on an
annual basis and on a three-year basis,&#8221; Brooks said,
commenting on the company&#8217;s future plan for China. Coca-Cola is
investing $4 billion in the country for 2012-2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. soda maker is ramping up its China investment as
the company and its bottlers seek to double global revenues to
$200 billion in the 10 years to 2020. While it is the country&#8217;s
largest soft-drink maker, it faces competition from companies
including PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) and the local Hangzhou Wahaha Group as it
seeks to expand in the most populous nation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PepsiCo, the world&#8217;s second-largest soft-drink maker, is
stepping up its push into China. The company has also opened new
factories and sought to expand distribution through a tie-up
with Tingyi Cayman Islands Holding Corp. (322) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competition in China&#8217;s beverage industry is intense and the
sector is one with &#8220;low growth and weak profitability,&#8221;
analyst Jean Chan from Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. wrote in a
Sept. 25 report. Sales are typically driven by promotions, she
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;China Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola said in July that its second-quarter sales volume
in China was little changed after rising 7 percent a year ago.
Sales in the third quarter have shown improvements, and this will
continue over the next several quarters, Brooks
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Asian nation has pared economic growth projections to
an average of 7 percent this decade, compared with 10.5 percent
in the previous 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola plans to open as many as two facilities each year
in China over the next decade, Brooks said. In the nearer term,
it will invest about $40 million in a new pulp blending factory
in Shanghai, and likely open a plant in the southwestern Guizhou
province in the next two years, Brooks said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The beverage market in China is still very fragmented,&#8221;
the executive said. &#8220;No company has predominant market share,
and there is a huge amount of untapped opportunity left to
grow.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chinese Flavors &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also plans to expand its offerings of Chinese-style beverages, with traditional Chinese items such as wolf
berries and herbal ingredients all being considered in future
drinks, Brooks said, declining to elaborate further. It will
also roll out more low-calorie and no-calorie drinks as it
caters to an aging population, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People like new flavors,&#8221; Chan, the analyst, said.
&#8220;Going forward, product innovations will help you expand your
categories and also drive growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese consumers are buying more juices and ready-to-drink
teas and fewer carbonated drinks as they seek a healthier
lifestyle, Chan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China regulators blocked the Coca-Cola&#8217;s planned $2.3
billion buyout of China Huiyuan Juice Group Ltd. in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging markets are increasingly important to the U.S.
company, which got about 79 percent of its operating income
outside North America last year, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. In the U.S., beverage makers have come under scrutiny in
recent years as public officials in several states have looked
to curb high obesity rates by slowing consumption of sugary soft
drinks with proposed restrictions and excise taxes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Local Cooking &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola, which broke ground on the first of its 43
factories on the mainland in 1980, already sells snow-pear fruit
drinks and sour-plum sparkling beverages there. On its website,
there are suggested recipes including sweet and spicy hoisin
spare ribs with Coca-Cola, encouraging consumers to incorporate
the carbonated beverage into local cooking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maker of drinks ranging from green teas and milk-based
Minute Maid Milky Pulpy had a 15.7 percent share in China&#8217;s 67.5
billion litre soft-drink market in 2012, according to industry
researcher Euromonitor International. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taiwan&#8217;s Ting Hsin International Group, which partly owns
Tingyi, ranked second with 12.8 percent, while PepsiCo had 4.5
percent. Wahaha Group, controlled by the nation&#8217;s second richest
man, Zong Qinghou, had a 7.3 percent share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low per-capita consumption and rising incomes will boost
beverage demand in China, helping the Asian nation become Coca-Cola&#8217;s largest market by sales volume by 2020, from third-largest today, Brooks said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;China Plenum &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s third plenum, a meeting of Communist Party leaders
to discuss economic-policy reforms, begins this week in Beijing.
The outcome of the conclave will be closely watched by foreign
investors as it would give an indication of the country&#8217;s
roadmap for the next 10 years, said Brooks, who has lived and
worked in Greater China since 1975. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The overall trend of opening and continuing to become
more transparent is very clear,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Market forces
playing a stronger role in the economy going forward is good for
all players whether you are a foreign company or state-owned
enterprise.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the world&#8217;s
most profitable securities firm before the financial crisis,
said it&#8217;s under investigation by regulators probing the
potential manipulation of foreign-exchange rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currencies and commodities were added to a list of
financial products and related activities that are subject to
investigation, according to a regulatory filing published by the
New York-based company today. The filing also added options
trading and technology systems and controls to the list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigators are looking at the firm&#8217;s &#8220;trading
activities and communications in connection with the
establishment of benchmark rates,&#8221; Goldman Sachs said in the
filing. The company &#8220;is cooperating with all such regulatory
investigations and reviews.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least eight banks including Citigroup Inc. (C) and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) have said they&#8217;re being investigated by authorities
examining the $5.3 trillion-a-day foreign-exchange market and
are cooperating. Citigroup, JPMorgan and Barclays Plc (BARC) have
suspended or put on leave some of their most senior currency
traders amid the inquiry. No one has been accused of wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Reserve is examining legal and regulatory
exemptions that have allowed banks including Goldman Sachs to
trade and own raw materials such as oil, coal and metals, a
person with knowledge of the matter said last month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. disclosed in

into currency trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s filing today added currencies and commodities to
a list of financial products and related activities that are

&lt;p&gt;U.S. banks increased their share of
Europe&#8217;s fixed-income market at the expense of local competitors
as trading volumes slid in 2013, Greenwich Associates said in an
annual survey report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc (BARC) retained its position as the biggest
secondary-market trader of European fixed-income products, with
a 12.8 percent market share, down from 13.3 percent in 2012,
Stamford, Connecticut-based Greenwich said on its website today.
Second-placed Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)&#8217;s portion shrank to 10.5 percent
from 11.9 percent, while JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) increased its
share to 9.3 percent from 8.5 percent and Citigroup Inc. (C) had 7.7
percent, up from about 6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors reported reduced liquidity in bond markets in the
second half of 2013, according to Greenwich, as speculation that
the Federal Reserve would reduce the pace of its $85 billion of
monthly asset purchases damped demand. UBS AG (UBSN) exited most fixed-income markets, while other European banks scaled back to comply
with Basel III regulatory requirements, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It has become more difficult for many institutions to
execute trades, and our data suggest that they are reaching out
to new dealers in an attempt to source needed liquidity,&#8221; Peter D&#8217;Amario, a Greenwich Associate consultant, said in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European banks are increasing the number of trading
counterparties to gain access to liquidity, according to
Greenwich. They averaged nine counterparties in this year&#8217;s
survey versus 8.4 in 2012. This increase benefited U.S banks and
European institutions including UniCredit SpA (UCG), Commerzbank AG,
Banca IMI SpA and Rabobank Groep, the Greenwich report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays, Britain&#8217;s second-biggest lender by assets, was
Greenwich&#8217;s 2013 &#8220;Quality Leader&#8221; in European fixed-income
trading, sales and overall service in rates products. JPMorgan
was the 2013 &#8220;Quality Leader&#8221; in European fixed-income
research and overall European service in credit products. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world&#8217;s largest entertainment company, said fiscal fourth-quarter profit rose 12 percent, beating analysts&#8217; estimates as the company&#8217;s theme parks and consumer products boosted income. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Net income grew to $1.39 billion, or 77 cents a share, from $1.24 billion, or 68 cents, a year earlier, Disney said yesterday in a statement, topping the 76-cent average of 27 analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue increased 7.3 percent to $11.6 billion in the period ended Sept. 28, beating the $11.4 billion average of estimates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investments in new attractions spurred higher guest spending and occupancy at Disney&#8217;s U.S. resorts, letting the company increase ticket prices. Disney, based in Burbank, California, is working on &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; rides in Orlando, Florida, and California, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger told Bloomberg Television. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a fair amount of development going on at Disney Imagineering right now to expand the &#8216;Star Wars&#8217; presence in California and in Orlando, and eventually in other parks around the world,&#8221; Iger said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Profit at Disney&#8217;s parks and resorts division increased 15 percent to $571 million in the quarter, as revenue grew 8.5 percent, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Wal-Mart Stores Inc.&#8217;s former general counsel has joined a sports-medicine clinic and foundation supported by a range of wealthy benefactors, including a member of the Walton family and a Wal-Mart director. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last month, Tom Mars became chief executive officer of the Steadman Clinic and the Steadman Philippon Research Institute, according to a statement on the group&#8217;s website. The Colorado clinic, with offices in Vail, Frisco and Edwards, specializes in orthopedic medicine and says it has treated hundreds of Olympic and professional athletes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mars left Wal-Mart in March, about two months after two members of Congress released e-mails from 2005 in which he informed Mike Duke, now CEO, of allegations that executives in Mexico were corrupt. Last year, the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission began investigating Wal-Mart for allegedly bribing Mexican officials to speed expansion efforts in that country. Wal-Mart has said it&#8217;s cooperating with the Justice and SEC inquiries. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Founded in 1988 by Dr. J. Richard Steadman, the foundation is dedicated to &#8220;keeping people physically active through orthopedic research and education,&#8221; according to its mission statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alice Walton, daughter of Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton and sister of two Wal-Mart board members, has contributed at least $100,000 and up to $500,000 to the institute, according to its 2011 annual report and a donor list on the website. Wal-Mart board member Douglas Daft has donated up to $100,000 to the institute. Other donors include investment banker Herbert Allen, Michael Dell, the computer company founder, and Nelson Peltz, CEO of Trian Fund Management. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Leadership Skills&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Tom&#8217;s executive experience, integrity and leadership skills make him the right person to lead both the Steadman Clinic and the Steadman Philippon Research Institute,&#8221; Steadman said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His partner, Marc Philippon, said in a statement: &#8220;Tom will be a great fit for us. He is an effective communicator with great people skills and will help us achieve our full potential for keeping people active.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In his statement, Mars said he and his family &#8220;are looking forward to living in the Vail Valley and being part of the community.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mars didn&#8217;t respond to a message seeking comment. Wal-Mart and a representative for Alice Walton declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Erik Larson" date="Nov 08, 2013 10:41 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-08/jpmorgan-banker-backed-200-million-madoff-loan-in-november-2008.html"><headline>JPMorgan Banker Backed $200 Million Madoff Loan in 2008</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;A former JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) banker
who managed Bernard Madoff&#8217;s account said the con man was on
track to receive a $200 million loan less than a month before
his arrest if the request hadn&#8217;t been dropped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel Bonventre, one of five ex-Madoff employees on trial
for allegedly aiding the fraud, asked JPMorgan in November 2008
to borrow twice Madoff&#8217;s credit limit of $100 million, with U.S.
Treasuries as collateral, Mark Doctoroff, who left the bank last
year, testified yesterday in federal court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They are doing well financially,&#8221; Doctoroff said of
Madoff&#8217;s securities firm in an e-mail to JPMorgan&#8217;s credit
department on Nov. 17, 2008. &#8220;They are looking at the current
market as an opportunity to make investments, true to their
value investing style.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five former employees are accused of helping Madoff
hide his fraud from customers, banks and regulators for years,
and getting rich in the process. It&#8217;s the first criminal trial
stemming from the scheme, which prosecutors say started in the
early 1970s and imploded at the peak of the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loan was part of a last-ditch attempt by Madoff to
secure cash as his Ponzi scheme was collapsing and Bonventre&#8217;s
role in the application process was one of the many examples of
his involvement in the fraud, prosecutors have said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen Elop, a candidate to replace Steve Ballmer as Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s chief executive officer, would consider breaking with decades of tradition by focusing the company&#8217;s strategy around making the popular Office software programs like Word, Excel and PowerPoint available on a broad variety of smartphones and tablets, including those made by Apple Inc. and Google Inc., said three people with knowledge of his thinking. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Elop would probably move away from Microsoft&#8217;s strategy of using these programs to drive demand for its flagship Windows operating system on personal computers and mobile devices, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the 49-year-old executive hasn&#8217;t finalized or publicly discussed his analysis of the business. Most of Microsoft&#8217;s software has been tied to running on Windows. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft became the world&#8217;s largest software provider under Ballmer and co-founder Bill Gates by making Windows-based PCs running Office applications an industry standard. When the Redmond, Washington-based company failed to come up with hit Windows-based phones and tablets, that left it with little role in the mobile market. Its refusal to adapt Office for Apple and devices based on Google&#8217;s Android operating system hasn&#8217;t helped its software usage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Microsoft Corp. chief patent
counsel Bart Eppenauer is joining Shook, Hardy  Bacon LLP as a
partner and will be the managing partner of the firm&#8217;s new
Seattle office, opening Dec. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eppenauer, who was chief patent counsel at Microsoft
starting in 2003, led the patent group in the legal and
corporate affairs department, where he developed Microsoft&#8217;s
portfolio of more than 35,000 issued patents worldwide, the firm
said. He also managed a team of more than 100 patent
professionals and worked closely with government and judicial
officials, academics and industry leaders on IP policy issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eppenauer was an associate for three years in Shook&#8217;s
intellectual property practice before leaving to join
Microsoft&#8217;s legal team in 1997. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are extremely excited to be opening a Seattle office
and to have Bart rejoining the firm,&#8221; Shook Chairman John
Murphy said in a statement. &#8220;Bart&#8217;s legal and business
experience is unparalleled and this was a truly unique
opportunity for us to open an office in a region in which we
already have a substantial footprint from a practice
standpoint.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shook is among Microsoft&#8217;s &#8220;premier provider&#8221; firms for
legal services, the firm said. The firm&#8217;s intellectual property
group includes 58 attorneys, 42 of whom are registered to
practice before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have worked closely with Shook&#8217;s intellectual property
group for more than a decade in my role at Microsoft and I am
very pleased to be rejoining them,&#8221; Eppenauer said in a
statement. &#8220;Shook is a standout, forward-looking firm in terms
of delivering creative, efficient and highly effective legal
services to their clients.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Seattle office will be Shook&#8217;s ninth in the U.S. and
11th worldwide. The firm has more than 440 attorneys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It will be a smaller office at the outset, but offer the
highest quality in terms of experience and service to our
clients,&#8221; Murphy said. &#8220;That has been a successful blueprint
throughout the history of our firm.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Latham Environmental Lawyer Nominated for Interior Post &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Obama will nominate Janice Schneider, a partner
in law firm Latham  Watkins LLP, to be assistant secretary for
land and minerals management in the Interior Department,
Bloomberg BNA&#8217;s Alan Kovski reports, citing a White House
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If confirmed, Schneider will oversee the Bureau of Land
Management, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Bureau of Safety
and Environmental Enforcement, and Office of Surface Mining
Reclamation and Enforcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schneider, a partner in Latham&#8217;s Washington office, is
global co-chairman of the firm&#8217;s energy and infrastructure
project siting and defense practice and local department
chairman of the environment, land and resources department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before joining Latham in 2001, Schneider worked for the
U.S. Department of the Interior and the U.S. Justice Department
and was counselor to the Deputy Secretary of the Interior,
according to her firm biography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New York Lawyer Wells to Lead NFL&#8217;s Workplace Probe of Dolphins &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Football League Commissioner Roger Goodell said
there&#8217;s no time limit for an independent probe into alleged
harassment in the Miami Dolphins&#8217; workplace, which will be led
by New York attorney Ted Wells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells, a senior partner in the law firm of Paul Weiss
Rifkind Wharton  Garrison LLP, will direct &#8220;a thorough and
objective&#8221; investigation and submit a report to Goodell, the
NFL said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ted Wells will have full authority to investigate as he
deems appropriate,&#8221; Goodell said. &#8220;Consistent with doing a
thorough investigation, we have not imposed a specific timetable
on him.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dolphins asked the NFL to investigate allegations that
harassment led Jonathan Martin to leave the team. Fellow
offensive lineman Richie Incognito was indefinitely suspended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I am committed to creating a professional environment for
all of the members of the Dolphins family,&#8221; Dolphins owner
Stephen Ross said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;Once the review is
completed and I have all of the facts, we will respond
accordingly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ross said the Dolphins will be &#8220;fully cooperating with the
review,&#8221; while Miami coach Joe Philbin said the team will take
&#8220;all necessary steps&#8221; to correct anything that Wells finds
amiss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESPN reported that Incognito, 30, asked Martin, 24, to
contribute financially to an unofficial team trip to Las Vegas
that Martin didn&#8217;t attend. The network also said the Dolphins
and the NFL have a copy of a voice message from April in which
Incognito used a racial slur and threatened Martin&#8217;s life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Dunn, Incognito&#8217;s agent, hasn&#8217;t responded to multiple
e-mails and a message left at his office seeking comment on the
ESPN reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billy Hunter&#8217;s firing in February as head of the National
Basketball Players Association came after an audit of the union
overseen by Wells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The review concluded that, while Hunter did nothing
illegal, he failed to manage conflicts of interest, lacked
proper corporate governance and didn&#8217;t disclose that his $3
million-a-year contract wasn&#8217;t properly ratified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells also was involved in an internal investigation into
the men&#8217;s basketball program at Syracuse University, where
federal prosecutors in November 2012 dropped a yearlong probe
into former assistant coach Bernie Fine, saying there wasn&#8217;t
enough evidence against him to support allegations of sexual
abuse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My task is to assemble the facts and present my findings
to the commissioner,&#8221; said Wells, whose report for Goodell will
be made public. &#8220;I will do so fairly and comprehensively so
that Commissioner Goodell can address this matter properly. I
will begin my work immediately and report my findings to the
commissioner as soon as practical.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cravath Represents Toll Brothers on Shapell Acquisition &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cravath, Swaine  Moore LLP represented Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL)
on its agreement to buy Shapell Industries Inc.&#8217;s homebuilding
business for about $1.6 billion, gaining 5,200 lots in the Los
Angeles and San Francisco Bay areas as buyer demand for housing
rises. Gibson Dunn  Crutcher LLP advised Shapell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cravath team included partners Eric L. Schiele, mergers
and acquisitions; Stephen L. Gordon, tax; and Kevin J. Grehan,
real estate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gibson Dunn&#8217;s team is co-led by Los Angeles real estate
partners Michael Sfregola and Dhiya El-Saden and includes the
following partners: Paul Issler, tax; Patrick Dennis, co-chairman of the environmental litigation and mass tort practice
group; Maurice Suh, litigation; and Sean Feller, benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toll, the largest U.S. luxury-home builder, will pay for
Beverly Hills, California-based Shapell with debt and a share
offering, the companies said yesterday in a statement. The deal
will more than double the number of California lots controlled
by Toll to about 9,200, with most in coastal markets where
vacant land is hard to come by, Chief Executive Officer Douglas Yearley Jr. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers are stocking up on land as U.S. home values
climb at their fastest pace in seven years. Earlier this week,
Barry Sternlicht&#8217;s Irvine, California-based Tri Pointe Homes
Inc. agreed to buy the homebuilding division of Weyerhaeuser Co.
for $2.7 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Shapell deal, 10 percent to 15 percent of the
purchase price will be covered by issuing new Toll shares, and
Toll plans to sell about $500 million of land from the Shapell
portfolio. The Horsham, Pennsylvania-based builder also stands
to make money immediately by selling homes in Shapell&#8217;s backlog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toll will keep about 150 Shapell employees. Others with the
company will continue to work for the family&#8217;s commercial real
estate division, which wasn&#8217;t sold to Toll. &lt;/p&gt;

industry team, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freeborn  Peters has more than 200 professionals at two
Illinois offices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Litigation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Police Found Blunkett Voice Mails in News Corp. Lawyer&#8217;s Safe &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recordings of voice mails left by former Home Secretary
David Blunkett on the phone of a woman he was having an affair
with were discovered in the safe of News Corp. (NWSA)&#8217;s U.K. lawyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police found the tapes and a draft News of the World
article about Blunkett&#8217;s three-year relationship with Kimberly
Quinn in Tom Crone&#8217;s safe at News Corp.&#8217;s U.K. unit, Andrew
Edis, a prosecution lawyer, told the jury yesterday. The
prosecution said the story, which was published in 2004, was the
result of phone hacking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive officer of News
Corp.&#8217;s U.K. unit and Andy Coulson, a 45-year-old former editor
of the now defunct News of the World, are among eight people
standing trial for a string of offenses stemming from wrongdoing
at News Corp. U.K. tabloids. Crone, the company&#8217;s former lawyer,
isn&#8217;t accused of wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rupert Murdoch, the company&#8217;s chairman, closed the News of
the World tabloid in July 2011 in a bid to defuse a scandal over
revelations journalists had hacked the phone of a missing
teenager, Milly Dowler, who was later found murdered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The messages related to Blunkett were &#8220;deeply personal and
intrusive,&#8221; Detective Constable Tim Hargreaves told the court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edis played a recording of a conversation in which Coulson
confronted the lawmaker before the story was published. Coulson
refused to reveal his sources and said he was &#8220;sure it was
right.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be exposing myself in this way unless I
believed the story to be true,&#8221; Coulson, who later became a
media adviser to Prime Minister David Cameron, said to Blunkett.
&#8220;I am confident.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other defendants include Stuart Kuttner, the 73-year-old former managing editor of the News of the World, and Ian Edmondson, a 44-year-old former news editor, who are both
accused of phone hacking. The newspaper&#8217;s one-time royal
reporter, Clive Goodman, 56, is charged with conspiring to
commit misconduct in a public office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brooks&#8217;s husband, her former assistant Cheryl Carter, and
the U.K. unit&#8217;s former head of security, Mark Hanna, face
charges of conspiring to pervert the course of justice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Video &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stop-And-Frisk Judge Removed, Fights Back &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, a federal appeals court panel put a hold on
changes to the New York Police Department&#8217;s stop-and-frisk
practices and created a controversy by removing Judge Shira
Scheindlin, who had ordered the changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel said Scheindlin ran afoul of judicial ethics
rules by encouraging lawyers to bring the stop-and-frisk case,
which she would hear as &#8220;related&#8221; to others on her docket, and
by speaking to reporters while the case was under way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many lawyers have come to the judge&#8217;s defense. Nancy
Gertner, a former federal judge says that the panel, not
Scheindlin, violated the rules since no party had moved to
disqualify her. &lt;/p&gt;

The film&#8217;s performance underscores the impact of last year&#8217;s &#8220;Marvel&#8217;s The Avengers,&#8221; Disney&#8217;s highest grossing film ever. &#8220;Thor&#8221; was projected to take $97 million by BoxOffice.com. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;A lot of people talk about the decline of superhero movies, but that&#8217;s just not the reality of the audience,&#8221; said Jeff Bock, an analyst at Exhibitor Relations Co. &#8220;Superhero films are the standard by which all other potential blockbusters are measured these days.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One &#8220;Avengers&#8221; character has already returned for a solo spin in theaters. &#8220;Iron Man 3,&#8221; released in May, is the top-grossing movie this year with $1.22 billion worldwide, with almost double the sales of &#8220;Iron Man 2.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a trickle-down effect,&#8221; said Phil Contrino, chief analyst for researcher BoxOffice.com. &#8220;Iron Man 3 came after it and did extremely well and now &#8216;Thor&#8217; is benefiting too. It&#8217;s a text book case of brand-building the right way.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Thor,&#8221; part of Marvel&#8217;s potent constellation of box-office superheroes, faced little competition. &#8220;Jackass
Presents: Bad Grandpa,&#8221; the comedy from Paramount Pictures (VIAB), was

Jeff Bock, an analyst at Exhibitor Relations Co. &#8220;Superhero

&lt;h2&gt;Superheroes Rule &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debut this weekend gives &#8220;Thor: The Dark World&#8221; the
fourth-highest domestic opening this year, behind &#8220;Iron Man
3,&#8221; &#8220;Man of Steel,&#8221; from Warner Bros, and &#8220;Fast  Furious
6,&#8221; from Universal Pictures, which took in $97.4 million in its
opening in May, according to Rentrak. The film is a record for a
Disney November opening and is the biggest non-summer release
for Marvel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s largest entertainment company, acquired
Marvel, the comic book and movie company, in December 2009 for
$4.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, Disney said it bought the rights to the first two
&#8220;Iron Man&#8221; movies, &#8220;Thor&#8221; and &#8220;Captain America: The First
Avenger,&#8221; from Viacom Inc.&#8217;s Paramount. The move gives Disney
more control over Marvel&#8217;s film library as it expands the
characters into its television shows and theme-park attractions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Disney said it will produce four Marvel
superhero TV series for Netflix Inc. (NFLX), the online-streaming
service, in a multiyear deal. The Burbank, California-based
company also plans a sequel to &#8220;Captain America: The First
Avenger.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Epic Battle &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &#8220;Thor,&#8221; Chris Hemsworth returns as the title
character. He battles to save Earth and the Nine Realms from the
Dark Elves, newly emerged from hibernation and armed with a
long-buried, universe-destroying substance. Thor&#8217;s challenge is
complicated when his love interest, played by Natalie Portman,
is infected with the substance. Thor must also contend with his
scheming brother Loki, played by Tom Hiddleston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RottenTomatoes.com, a review aggregator site, gave it a 66
percent fresh rating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a review-proof movie,&#8221; said Paul Dergarabedian,
senior media analyst at Rentrak. &#8220;Fans just want to have fun
watching it. Anytime a Marvel movie opens it&#8217;s like a
behemoth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Old Vegas &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among returning films, &#8220;Jackass,&#8221; from Paramount,
retained its second-place spot. Starring Johnny Knoxville, the
movie is the fourth since 2002 based on the &#8220;Jackass&#8221; MTV
reality series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The animated &#8220;Free Birds&#8221; from Relativity Media placed
third, with sales of $11.1 million, up from fourth in its debut
the previous weekend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Last Vegas,&#8221; which follows three 60-something friends
who throw a bachelor party for their buddy, played by Michael Douglas, took fourth, down from third last weekend. It collected
$11 million for CBS films. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ender&#8217;s Game,&#8221; based on the science-fiction novel about
a child warrior, dropped to fifth from first, collecting $10.3
million for Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Catching Fire,&#8221; the next installment of Lions Gate&#8217;s
&#8220;The Hunger Games&#8221; franchise, is scheduled for release on Nov.
22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oscar Frontrunner &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two films in limited release, &#8220;12 Years a Slave&#8221; and
&#8220;About Time,&#8221; expanded to more cinemas this weekend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;12 Years a Slave,&#8221; from Fox Searchlight and British
director Steve McQueen, is an adaptation of an 1853 memoir by
Solomon Northup. The movie, which has drawn rave reviews,
collected $6.7 million this weekend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;About Time,&#8221; a romantic comedy about a time traveler,
stars Domhnall Gleeson and is directed by Richard Curtis. It
took $4.8 million for Universal Pictures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These films have been playing for a few weeks now and
they really are starting to catch some of the multiplex magic,&#8221;
said Bock of Exhibitor Relations. &#8220;&#8216;12 Years a Slave&#8217; is going
to be a frontrunner for best picture, so it&#8217;s going to be in the
top 10 for some time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weekend revenue for the top 10 films fell 1 percent to
$157.9 million from the year-earlier period, Rentrak said.
Revenue this year is up 0.4 percent to $9.07 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) named Jimmy Pitaro
sole president of its interactive business, assuming duties held
by John Pleasants in a shake-up less than a week after the unit
reported its second-ever quarterly profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney is merging the games and media operations within
interactive as part of the change, the Burbank, California-based
company said today in an e-mailed statement. Pleasants, who was
co-president with Pitaro, becomes a consultant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is consolidating the interactive business under
a single leader after the successful introduction of the Disney
Infinity game system that Pleasants oversaw. The moves comes as
Infinity, combining collectibles with video games, gears up to
challenge the &#8220;Skylanders&#8221; products from Activision Blizzard
Inc. during the holiday season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Disney&#8217;s stated goal is to improve the profitability of
that division, and I would expect that to continue to be the
primary focus,&#8221; said Laura Martin, an analyst with Needham 
Co. in Los Angeles who has a hold rating on the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change isn&#8217;t likely to have a meaningful impact on
Disney&#8217;s earnings over the next 12 months, Martin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney fell 0.4 percent to $68.34 at the close in New York.
The stock has gained 37 percent this year, compared with 20
percent for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interactive Profit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interactive division posted a profit of $16 million in
the fourth quarter ended Sept. 28, as sales more than doubled to
$396 million with the release of the Infinity system, Disney
said on Nov. 7. The unit lost $76 million in the same quarter a
year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This successful launch drove Disney Interactive&#8217;s swing
to profitability in Q4 and all indications suggest the strong
demand for Disney Infinity will continue,&#8221; Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Robert Iger said on a conference call last
week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney named the two men co-presidents of interactive in
October 2010. Pitaro hailed from Yahoo! Inc.&#8217;s media unit, while
Pleasants led Playdom, a games company that was purchased by
Disney in 2010 for as much as $563 million. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest U.S. bank by assets, is weighing whether to ban traders from using electronic chat rooms to communicate with peers at other firms as the forums draw scrutiny from global regulators, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s deliberations, which should be complete by early 2014, focus on multi-dealer chat rooms for currencies and other asset classes, said the person, who requested anonymity because the talks are private. Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Britain&#8217;s biggest publicly owned lender, and Zurich-based Credit Suisse Group AG, Switzerland&#8217;s second-largest bank, also are reviewing chat-room use, two other people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Regulators have targeted traders&#8217; electronic messages, using them as evidence of wrongdoing in their investigations into the manipulation of benchmark interest rates and foreign-exchange markets. During a visit to London last month, JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon called on employees to be vigilant about language in e-mails and instant messages, two people with knowledge of the matter said then. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan may encourage traders to use phones and e-mails rather than chat rooms to assist clients in large currency transactions, the person with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) and other movie and
TV studios have asked a federal court to dismiss their
copyright-infringement case against the file-sharing website
Lime Wire LLC and its founder, Mark Gorton, according to a Nov.
7 court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The studios, including Viacom Inc. (VIAB), News Corp.&#8217;s Twentieth
Century Fox Film and Time Warner Inc.&#8217;s Warner Bros.
Entertainment, filed the suit in federal court in New York in
February 2012. They claimed a &#8220;staggering&#8221; amount of
infringement took place through the site, and that &#8220;millions of
users copied billions of files using Lime Wire&#8221; without paying
anything to copyright owners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lime Wire developed peer-to-peer software that let people
share digital entertainment files on their computers with other
people over the Internet. TV shows such as &#8220;South Park&#8221; and
&#8220;Desperate Housewives&#8221; and movies including &#8220;Avatar&#8221; and the
&#8220;Harry Potter&#8221; films were among the material allegedly
infringed, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gorton operates Tower Capital Research LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that trades securities based on mathematical
algorithms it developed. &#8220;Gorton directed and benefited from
Lime Wire&#8217;s inducement of infringement,&#8221; the entertainment
companies said in one of their filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood in May 2010 found Lime Wire
and Gorton liable for inducing infringement of copyrights for
recorded music. The site was shut down by an October 2010 court
order. Lime Wire settled with the recording industry for $105
million in May 2011 during a trial in Manhattan to determine
damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No terms for the settlement of the case brought by the
studios were disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. v. Lime Wire
LLC, 12-cv-00818, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earlier case is Arista Records LLC v. Lime Wire LLC,
06-cv-05936, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Patents &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Piggy Pushers&#8217; Sock Patent Not Infringed, Appeals Court Rules &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal appeals court affirmed a lower-court ruling that
a patent wasn&#8217;t infringed based on its understanding of the
difference between a sock and a shoe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case, filed in a Michigan federal court in July 2010,
was between two makers of footwear for infants. Piggy Pushers of
Holland, Michigan, claimed that products made by Skidders
Footwear Inc. infringed patent 6,385,779. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent covers a sock for a crawling infant. According
to the patent, which was issued in May 2002, the sock has a
gripper element in both the upper and lower surface that
increases friction and makes it possible for a baby to crawl on
slippery surfaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The product made by New York-based Skidders has a foot-surrounding sock bonded to a rubber outsole. In May 2012 the
lower court said there was nothing in the language of the patent
that could suggest the inventor meant &#8220;sock&#8221; to mean anything
other than the ordinary definition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower court said the Skidders products had a number of
differences from socks, including having a durable outsole, and
left- and right-foot designations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its Nov. 8 ruling, the Washington-based U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit said the lower court was
correct. Piggy Pushers, the court said, failed to present
evidence refuting Skidders&#8217; claim that its product didn&#8217;t fit
the definition of a sock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeal is Piggy Pushers LLC v. Skidders Footwear LLC,
2013-1107, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
(Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower court case is Piggy Pushers LLC v. Skidders
Footwear Inc., 1:10-cv-00644, U.S. District Court, Western
District of Michigan (Grand Rapids). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Furuno Complaint Against Garmin, Navico to Be Investigated &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. International Trade Commission said Nov. 8 that it
will investigate a complaint filed in September by Furuno
Electric Co. (6814) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hygo, Japan-based  Furuno said that GPS, navigation and
radar devices made by Garmin Ltd., Navico Holdings A/S and Flir
Systems Inc.&#8217;s Raymarine unit infringe four patents. Furuno is
seeking an import ban against all three companies&#8217; devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The devices are used in cars, airplanes and ships. The
patents cover systems, devices and methods for improving
navigation, radar and map displays, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Washington-based ITC has the power to exclude the
importation of items that infringe U.S. patents. Last week the
commission also said that it would investigate a complaint
Navico made against Flir fish-finding devices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dunlop&#8217;s Cleveland Golf Unit Sues Callaway Over Golf Club Name &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dunlop Sports Co. (7825)&#8217;s Roger Cleveland Golf unit sued Callaway
Golf Co. (ELY) for trademark infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit, filed in federal court in Santa Ana, California,
is related to the use of the phrase &#8220;Designed by Roger
Cleveland&#8221; on some of Callaway&#8217;s golf clubs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint, Roger Cleveland founded the
Roger Cleveland Golf Co. in 1979. The company owns a number of
trademark registrations for &#8220;Cleveland&#8221; and &#8220;Cleveland
Golf.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cleveland left the company in 1995 and, according to court
papers, departed with no rights in or to the Cleveland
trademarks. He went to work for rival Callaway, where he is now
chief of golf club design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July 2013, Callaway began marketing a club bearing Roger
Cleveland&#8217;s name, the Roger Cleveland Mac Daddy 2. Roger
Cleveland Golf said consumers have been confused by Callaway&#8217;s
use of the name, and that, to no avail, it has sent cease-and-desist notices to Carlsbad, California-based Callaway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It asked the court to bar Callaway&#8217;s use of the Cleveland
name, and for awards of money damages, including profits
attributable to the alleged infringement, together with attorney
fees and litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Callaway didn&#8217;t respond immediately to an e-mailed request
for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Roger Cleveland Golf Co. v. Callaway Golf Co.,
8:13-cv-01642, U.S. District Court, Central District of
California (Santa Ana). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Famous Jameis&#8217; Trademark Filing Is Made by Alabama Football Fan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Alabama football fan has applied to register the phrase
&#8220;Famous Jameis&#8221; as a trademark. The phrase has been used to
describe Florida State University quarterback Jameis Winston,
the Heisman Trophy favorite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mukul Mehra, 40, filed the trademark request on Oct. 24,
according to the database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mehra said in a telephone interview he has no connection to
Winston, a redshirt freshman from Bessemer, Alabama, a suburb of
Birmingham. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not necessarily geared toward him,&#8221; said Mehra, who
has a medical degree from the University of Alabama School of
Medicine in Birmingham. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what our intent
completely is. We haven&#8217;t worked all of that out.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pamela Deese, a partner at the Washington law firm Arent
Fox, said in a telephone interview that Winston probably would
be awarded the trademark if he moved to register it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We would hope the examiner is savvy enough to recognize
that Famous Jameis refers to the potential Heisman Trophy
winner,&#8221; said Deese, whose clients include Houston Rockets
guard Jeremy Lin. &#8220;You can&#8217;t register a trademark for somebody
else&#8217;s name without their permission, which is what happened
with Jeremy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mehra said he has contacted a local sports marketing
company about producing &#8220;Famous Jameis&#8221; T-shirts. He also said
he&#8217;s open to a partnership with Winston or Florida State. &#8220;If
it&#8217;s something they&#8217;re interested in using we could potentially
market it together,&#8221; Mehra said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 6-foot-4, 228-pound Winston, at -500, is the favorite
at sportsbook.com to win the Heisman Trophy, which is given
annually to college football&#8217;s best player. A $50 bet would win
$10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winston has completed 149 of 212 passes for 2,502 yards and
24 touchdowns, fifth in college football&#8217;s top level. He&#8217;s also
thrown six interceptions and run for three touchdowns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deese said it would behoove Winston to move quickly on the
trademark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The longer you wait, the more costly it gets,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Second AIDS Group Vies for Defunct Charity&#8217;s Mark, Blade Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second AIDS-related charity has made an offer to buy the
trademark of the now-defunct National Association of People with
AIDS, the Washington Blade reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Washington-based Community Education Group made an
offer to the bankruptcy court buy to buy the trademark rights to
six different names, the Blade reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The marks include &#8220;National HIV Testing Day,&#8221; &#8220;National
Gay Men&#8217;s Awareness Day,&#8221; &#8220;National Gay Men&#8217;s HIV/AIDS
Awareness Day, &#8216;&#8216;Healthy Living Summit&#8217;&#8217; and &#8216;&#8216;AIDS Watch,&#8217;&#8217;
according to the Blade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier Health HIV, also based in Washington, offered
$3,000 for the rights to just one of the marks, &#8216;&#8216;National Gay
Men&#8217;s HIV/AIDS Awareness Day,&#8217;&#8217; according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Yorkers Charged Over Fake Polo, Lacoste Clothes, WABC Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six New York residents have been charged with trademark
counterfeiting and conspiracy, WABC-TV reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were accused of selling versions of Ralph Loren
Corp. (RL)&#8217;s Polo, Lacoste SA, VF Inc. (VFC)&#8217;s North Face, and True
Religion Apparel Inc.&#8217;s clothing with a suggested retail price
of more than $13.4 million to smaller distributors, according to
the New York-based television station. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charges followed the seizure of more than 2,000 boxes
of counterfeit trademarked clothing from a storage facility in
Queens, New York, in July, WABC-TV reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York Police Department Commissioner Ray Kelly told
WABC-TV that this counterfeit-clothing operation was of
particular importance because of indications that the proceeds
went to areas in southern Lebanon that were &#8216;&#8216;of concern&#8221; to
the intelligence bureau. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Executive stock options, corporate
jets and the tax break enjoyed by hedge-fund managers are among
the targets for Democratic lawmakers seeking to negotiate a
budget deal by next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Democrats&#8217; list of options, obtained by Bloomberg News,
sets the stage for a renewed clash with Republicans, who reject
proposals to raise revenue as part of an agreement. Democrats
say taxes must be on the table as lawmakers seek an annual
budget that would replace some of the $1 trillion in automatic
spending cuts now in effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While congressional aides say the two sides are finding
some areas of compromise on spending cuts, the standoff over
revenue might be the main obstacle to reaching a deal by the
lawmakers&#8217; self-imposed Dec. 13 deadline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democrats have long urged Republicans to agree to scrap at
least some of the tax preferences on their list, while
Republicans argue that doing so would undermine efforts for a
broader tax-code revision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One proposal to limit the ability of some business owners
to avoid payroll taxes by claiming income as business profits
would save $12 billion over the next 10 years, according to the
Democrats&#8217; estimates. Another option is the carried-interest
treatment that allows hedge-fund managers and private-equity
advisers to pay a 20 percent tax rate on their income instead of
the nation&#8217;s top income rate of 39.6 percent. Ending that break
would save more than $17 billion over a decade, according to the
Democrats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limiting corporate deductions for &#8220;excessive&#8221; executive
stock options could save even more -- as much as $50 billion
over the same period, the Democrats&#8217; list says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ending preferences for corporate jets and subsidies for
yachts and vacation homes, combined, would bring in another $19
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representative Paul Ryan, the lead Republican negotiator
and chairman of the House Budget Committee, has opposed
including any tax measures as part of a budget agreement. The
29-member panel, which met last week, will reconvene on Nov. 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Ryan didn&#8217;t respond to a request for
comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Freddie Mac Profits Push Dividend Return Close to Bailout Funds &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freddie Mac (FMCC) and Fannie Mae will return $39 billion to the
U.S Treasury after reporting third-quarter profits, bringing
their total payments to within about $2 billion of the cash aid
they got after the credit crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies, which were sustained by $187.5 billion in
taxpayer money after they were placed under federal
conservatorship in 2008, will make dividend payments by next
month to boost their total returns to $185.2 billion, they said
in separate filings Nov. 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under terms of their conservatorship, the government since
last year has been taking all of the companies&#8217; quarterly
profits beyond a $3 billion net-worth cap. The money counts as a
return on the U.S. investment and not as a repayment of the aid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s aid and amount returned have left taxpayers
$9 million ahead, according to a statement. The government has
an additional $1 billion liquidation preference in the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;China Agency Lists 181 Shanghai IPO Applications as of Nov. 7 &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The China Securities Regulatory Commission said 10
applications were approved of 181 companies that submitted
applications for initial public offerings on the Shanghai
exchange as of Nov. 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty applications were approved so far this year of 311
companies applying for initial public offerings on Shenzhen&#8217;s
main and medium-small company board&#8217;s initial public offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forty-three applications of 265 companies that submitted
applications for initial public offerings on Shenzhen&#8217;s Chinext
board were approved as of Oct. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SAC Tipper Aggarwal Pleads Guilty to Securities Fraud &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sandeep Aggarwal, a former research analyst with Collins
Stewart LLC, admitted passing inside information about a deal
involving Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) to a former SAC
Capital Advisors LP fund manager. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aggarwal, 40, pleaded guilty to one count each of
conspiracy and securities fraud Nov. 8 in federal court in
Manhattan. He told U.S. Magistrate Judge Ronald Ellis that he
tipped &#8220;Richard Lee and others&#8221; about the Yahoo-Microsoft
venture in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He told Ellis he was &#8220;very sorry&#8221; for his actions, which
he did to &#8220;improve his standing as an analyst&#8221; and &#8220;increase
revenue&#8221; for his firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aggarwal faces as much as 25 years in prison when he&#8217;s
sentenced and may be deported to his native India. He agreed to
cooperate with prosecutors in hopes of receiving leniency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Aggarwal, 13-mj-01877, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s Madoff Banker Backed $200 Million Loan in 2008 &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former JPMorgan Chase  Co. (NPM) banker who managed Bernard
Madoff&#8217;s account said the con man was on track to receive a $200
million loan less than a month before his arrest if the request
hadn&#8217;t been dropped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel Bonventre, one of five ex-Madoff employees on trial
accused of aiding the fraud, asked JPMorgan in November 2008 to
borrow twice Madoff&#8217;s credit limit of $100 million, with U.S.
Treasuries as collateral, Mark Doctoroff, who left the bank last
year, testified Nov. 7 in federal court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctoroff described Madoff&#8217;s securities firm in an e-mail
to JPMorgan&#8217;s credit department on Nov. 17, 2008 as &#8220;doing well
financially.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five former Madoff employees are accused of helping
Madoff hide his fraud from customers, banks and regulators for
years and getting rich in the process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loan was part of a last-ditch attempt by Madoff to
secure cash as his Ponzi scheme was collapsing, and Bonventre&#8217;s
role in the application process was one of the many examples of
his involvement in the fraud, prosecutors have said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the loan never went through, Doctoroff said he
thought the loan would have been granted and that he didn&#8217;t know
why the loan process stopped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said he never met Madoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonventre, who oversaw the broker-dealer and proprietary
trading operations of Madoff&#8217;s company, where real trading took
place, pleaded not guilty and has denied involvement in the
fraud, saying he was duped like thousands of others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonventre&#8217;s lawyer, Andrew Frisch, asked if the loan
request and the fraudulent capital figures given by Bonventre
could have come from Madoff himself. Doctoroff agreed Madoff
could have given the fake figures to Bonventre. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to
comment on the testimony. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The office of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan is
investigating JPMorgan in relation to Madoff. Bharara is
weighing a deferred-prosecution agreement or fine to resolve the
probe, a person familiar with the matter said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. O&#8217;Hara, 10-cr-00228, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hedge Fund Founder Says U.K. Fraud Prosecutors Acted Unfairly &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnus Peterson, the founder of the collapsed hedge fund
Weavering Capital (UK) Ltd., is seeking to delay a criminal
prosecution against him by arguing that U.K. prosecutors acted
unfairly in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decision by the director of the Serious Fraud Office to
reopen a probe into the firm&#8217;s collapse after the former
director closed the investigation is an &#8220;abuse of process&#8221; by
the agency, Peterson&#8217;s lawyer, Peter Lodder, said at a hearing
in London Nov. 8. The court will hear his arguments in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peterson will also argue that the SFO&#8217;s initial decision to
open the probe could be unlawful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weavering Capital, which once had about $640 million under
management, collapsed in March 2009 after discovering the
counterparty for its biggest trading position was controlled by
the fund&#8217;s manager. Peterson and about 10 employees were ordered
by a U.K. court last year to repay a total of $450 million to
liquidators of the collapsed hedge fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peterson was charged in December with fraud and other
counts related to the collapse. A trial is scheduled for October
next year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bharara Says Budget Constraints May Derail Future Prosecutions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said a federal hiring
freeze is threatening his office&#8217;s ability to carry out its job
of prosecuting financial and other crimes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bharara made the remarks Nov. 8 at a Practising Law
Institute event in New York, where he spoke on a panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re OK now but at some point that will cease to be
true,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other governmental departments and offices have faced
financial constraints as a result of federal budget cuts known
as sequestration. Bharara said he&#8217;s not able to replace
prosecutors who leave through normal attrition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, in contrast to the SEC&#8217;s policy to seek admissions
from defendants only in a subset of cases, Bharara said there is
&#8220;a very strong presumption&#8221; that if his office pursues a civil
case, it will require admissions of wrongdoing. Companies will
often be willing to pay &#8220;huge sums&#8221; of money to settle a
matter yet are ready to go to trial over an admission, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not just the financial component, but the story
needs to be told,&#8221; Bharara said. &#8220;We&#8217;re a little tired of
recidivism.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bharara said prosecutors are looking more into holding
institutions accountable for employees&#8217; misconduct, both
criminally and civilly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;SEC Names Gaunt Head of Muni Securities and Public Pensions Unit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission appointed
LeeAnn Ghazil Gaunt to be chief of the agency&#8217;s Enforcement
Division&#8217;s Municipal Securities and Public Pensions Unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaunt oversaw the commission&#8217;s first &#8220;pay-to-play&#8221;
enforcement action for in-kind political campaign contributions.
The action occurred in September 2012, when the agency charged
Goldman Sachs (GS) with violations related to contributions to the
state treasurer of Massachusetts, the agency said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Michael J. Moore" date="Nov 12, 2013  6:13 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-12/blankfein-sees-goldman-roe-boost-without-wholesale-change.html"><headline>Blankfein Sees Goldman ROE Boost Without Wholesale Change</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the U.S.
bank most reliant on trading, won&#8217;t make any &#8220;wholesale
strategic change&#8221; to help improve returns, Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While we have generated good relative returns in the last
five years, they are hardly aspirational,&#8221; Blankfein, 59, said
today at an investor conference in New York. &#8220;We are committed
to improving them regardless of the challenges presented in the
current environment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has earned a return on equity of 10 percent
so far this year, compared with 11 percent in 2012 and more than
30 percent before the financial crisis. The shares trade at 1.06
times book value, indicating that investors estimate the firm&#8217;s
cost of equity at around 10 percent, a figure that Blankfein
said the company is focused on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People throw out that number, 10 percent, I happen to
think that&#8217;s a pretty high number given that the risk-free rate
of return is zero,&#8221; Blankfein said at a separate conference in
New York today. &#8220;But the market seems to have focused on that,
so we&#8217;ve kind of focused on that number. Not for the long-term,
but for this part of the cycle, I think that looks OK.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which before the financial crisis targeted a
long-term ROE of 20 percent, has declined to set a goal since
then, saying it wanted to see the effects of new rules. Recent
international regulations have required banks to hold more
equity capital, pushing down ROE. &lt;/p&gt;

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein said the firm would increase return on equity, a measure of profitability, by making &#8220;incremental improvements&#8221; in revenue, expenses and capital management. Close

&lt;p&gt;A gauge of U.S. company credit risk
rose as signs of an improving economy fueled speculation that
the Federal Reserve will reduce stimulus sooner than estimated.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) sold $1 billion of floating-rate bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, increased
1.5 basis points from Nov. 8 to 73.3 basis points as of 4:24
p.m. in New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.
Bond markets were closed yesterday in the U.S. for the Veterans
Day holiday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasury yields have climbed to an eight-week high since
the Labor Department&#8217;s better-than-forecast jobs report last
week stoked speculation that the central bank would accelerate
its timetable for slowing the pace of its $85 billion in monthly
purchases of Treasuries and mortgage bonds. The central bank&#8217;s
program is becoming riskier by the day, Dallas Fed President
Richard Fisher said in a speech in Australia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given the sell-off in Treasuries that started on Friday
and has continued to some extent today, the markets are a little
on edge on when tapering will take place,&#8221; Marc Pinto, the head
of corporate bond strategy at Susquehanna International Group
LLP, said in a telephone interview from New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The swaps index typically rises as investor confidence
deteriorates and falls as it improves. Credit swaps pay the
buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations,
less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals
$1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Tipping Point&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American employers added 204,000 workers in October,
topping the most optimistic forecast in a Bloomberg poll of
economists, Labor Department figures showed on Nov. 8. The
median forecast of 91 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called
for a gain of 120,000 jobs, with estimates ranging from
increases of 50,000 to 175,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. 10-year yield climbed 2 basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.77 percent as of 4:24 p.m. in New York
from the close on Nov. 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed will start cutting its bond buying in March,
according to the median estimate of 32 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey conducted Nov. 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a tipping point where monetary accommodation
comes to be viewed not as the pleasant stimulus that levitates
bond and stock and housing markets all over the world,&#8221; Fisher
said today at an event in Melbourne. &#8220;None of us really know
where that tipping point is.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goldman Bonds &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets, sold
the five-year, senior unsecured notes to yield 110 basis points
more than the three-month London interbank offered rate,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The debt is expected to
be rated A3 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk premium on the Markit CDX North American High
Yield Index, a credit-swaps benchmark tied to speculative-grade
bonds, rose 6.1 basis points from Nov. 8 to 356.7 basis points,
Bloomberg prices show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average extra yield investors demand to hold dollar-denominated, investment-grade corporate bonds rather than
similar-maturity Treasuries increased 1.4 basis points to 129.2
basis points, Bloomberg data show. The measure for speculative-grade, or junk-rated, debt rose 5.5 basis points to 540.6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-yield, high-risk, or junk debt is rated below Baa3 by
Moody&#8217;s and lower than BBB- at Standard  Poor&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Lisa Abramowicz" date="Nov 12, 2013  1:13 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-12/bond-exodus-at-broad-funds-hits-pimco-jpmorgan-credit-markets.html"><headline>Bond Exodus at Broad Funds Hits Pimco, JPMorgan: Credit Markets</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;In a year of record withdrawals from
taxable bond funds, no category has been harder hit than the
biggest broad market strategies managed by firms from Pacific
Investment Management Co. (PTTRX) to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors yanked $61.8 billion from intermediate-maturity
debt funds in the first nine months of the year, while pouring
$46.2 billion into bonds maturing in less than three years,
according to data compiled by Morningstar Inc. Buyers are
showing a preference for shorter-maturity and high-yield bonds
that are less sensitive to rising benchmark borrowing costs as
the Federal Reserve weighs curtailing the pace of its
unprecedented stimulus that&#8217;s bolstered credit markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concern is mounting that a general basket of bonds won&#8217;t
preserve income and generate returns for investors who reaped
average annual gains of 6.3 percent from the start of 2009
through last year. As the central bank prepares to start slowing
its bond buying, the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Broad
Market Index is on pace for its first annual decline since 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People aren&#8217;t getting enough income from their bond
portfolios as they need,&#8221; Michael Rawson, a fund analyst at
Morningstar in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;You&#8217;re
going to see money come out of intermediate bond funds and into
these more income producing bond categories.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pimco, JPMorgan &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors withdrew $28.1 billion from Pimco&#8217;s $247.9
billion Total Return Fund in the first nine months of the year,
the most among all intermediate bond strategies, Morningstar
data show. JPMorgan&#8217;s $24.6 billion Core Bond Fund had the third
biggest outflow with $4.6 billion of redemptions, while American
Funds&#8217; $28.2 billion Bond Fund of America reported $4.8 billion
of withdrawals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same period, non-traditional bond funds that give
managers more flexibility in how they invest received $45
billion of deposits, Morningstar data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While core bond categories have experienced outflows
industry-wide, we have continued to see inflows into our
absolute return and unconstrained strategies,&#8221; Mark Porterfield, a spokesman for Newport Beach, California-based
Pimco, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s Core Bond Fund, which was started on Dec. 31,
1983, and focuses on investment-grade notes with medium-term
maturities, reported a $2.3 billion withdrawal on Oct. 28,
spurring the biggest weekly outflow from U.S. investment-grade
debt funds since June, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;High Yield &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there have been some withdrawals from JPMorgan&#8217;s core
bond strategies, &#8220;most of the outflows have come from clients
aiming to diversify their fixed-income portfolios,&#8221; with many
of the same clients depositing money into flexible debt funds,
Gregory Roth, a spokesman for the New York-based firm, said in
an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The withdrawal last month reflected a client moving assets
from the Core Bond fund into a different vehicle managed by the
firm and not a rotation of money out of investment-grade debt,
Roth said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buyers pulled $2.2 billion from broader bond strategies in
the U.S. during the week ended Oct. 30, the biggest outflow in
more than three years, data compiled by Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc show. Funds focused on high-yield bonds reported
$752.7 million of deposits in the period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculative-grade debt, rated below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service and lower than BBB- at Standard  Poor&#8217;s, is
less sensitive to rising interest rates because of the bigger
premium it pays over benchmarks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notes Underperform &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pimco&#8217;s Total Return Fund, started in 1987 and managed by
Bill Gross, has shrunk by an estimated $37.5 billion since the
start of this year, ending October with about $248 billion in
assets, according to data provided by Pimco and compiled by
Bloomberg. It ceded its title as the world&#8217;s largest mutual fund
to Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund, which ended October
with $251 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medium-term notes are poised to under-perform shorter-term
ones for the first year since 2008, when the Fed embarked on an
unprecedented quantitative easing program to jump start the
world&#8217;s biggest economy from the depths of the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate bonds maturing in five to seven years have
declined 0.01 percent this year compared with a 1.6 percent gain
for notes maturing in one to three years, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Treasury Yields &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Broad Market Index
has lost 2.01 percent this year after posting a 2.45 percent
decline in the three months ended June 30, its biggest quarterly
loss since the start of 1994. The index gained 4.53 percent in
2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke rattled fixed-income markets
in May by telling Congress that the central bank may reduce the
pace of its $85 billion of monthly purchases of Treasuries and
mortgage bonds if the economy showed sustained improvement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on 10-year Treasuries rose as high as 3.01 percent
on Sept. 6, up from 1.76 percent at the end of December, as
speculation mounted that the Fed would change the pace of its
bond buying at its September meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While policy makers surprised forecasters by maintaining
the level of stimulus, yields reached a seven-week high of 2.75
percent at the end of last week as reports showed the economy
expanded in the third quarter beyond projections and added more
jobs in October than forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Overriding Factor&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re in an environment where the likelihood is that
interest rates are going to move higher and that hasn&#8217;t been the
case for 30 years,&#8221; Gregory Kamford, a credit analyst at RBS in
Stamford, Connecticut, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the end of May, investors have removed $14 billion
from U.S. intermediate-maturity corporate bond funds while
putting $11.6 billion into funds focused on one-to-three year
corporates and $12.9 billion into notes due in more than 10
years, RBS data show. &#160; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fidelity Investments, which manages $1.9 trillion globally,
started three funds that focus on short-term bonds to address
investor concern over rising interest rates, the Boston-based
firm said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The only logic to follow at the moment is whether the
central banks continue to supply the capital market with more
liquidity,&#8221; Arthur Tetyevsky, a credit strategist at Imperial
Capital LLC, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;That seems to be
the overriding factor.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shell Bonds &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in credit markets, the cost of protecting
corporate bonds from default in the U.S. rose, with the Markit
CDX North American Investment Grade Index, which investors use
to hedge against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness,
increasing 1.3 basis points from Nov. 8 to a mid-price of 73
basis points as of 1:09 p.m. in New York, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bond markets in the U.S. were closed yesterday for the
Veterans Day holiday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measure typically rises as investor confidence
deteriorates and falls as it improves. Credit-default swaps pay
the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell Plc plans to sell dollar-denominated
bonds in a four-part offering of notes due in five years or
fewer after Europe&#8217;s biggest oil company borrowed $3.75 billion
of longer-term debt three months ago. Its Shell International
Finance (RDSA) unit intends to sell two portions of floating-rate bonds
due in two and three years and fixed-coupon notes that mature in
three and five years, according to a person with knowledge of
the offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds of Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) are the most actively
traded dollar-denominated corporate securities by dealers today,
accounting for 3.6 percent of the volume of dealer trades of $1
million or more, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The New
York-based telephone carrier raised $49 billion on Sept. 11 in
the largest corporate bond issue ever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OAO Gazprom snapped two days of
losses as JPMorgan Chase  Co. raised Russia&#8217;s natural gas
export monopoly to the equivalent of buy, citing prospects for a
Chinese deal and dividends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares advanced 1.3 percent to 146.64 rubles by 2:16
p.m. in Moscow after falling 1.8 percent yesterday. The volume
traded was equivalent to about 77 percent of the three-month
average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gazprom rallied after JPMorgan raised it to overweight on
the possibility of a gas contract with China and of switching to
a dividend based on international reporting standards, according
to an e-mailed note. The shares fell yesterday after Interfax
reported Ukraine&#8217;s state-run energy company halted purchases
from the natural-gas exporter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No other large cap stock in Russia offers better
potential to double over the next three years than Gazprom, we
believe,&#8221; JPMorgan analysts led by Artem Konchin said in an e-mailed note. &#8220;We see the company&#8217;s valuation as still
undemanding, and its ability to generate cash remains intact.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gazprom&#8217;s global depositary receipts increased 0.5 percent
to $8.88 in London. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, promoted 280 employees to managing
director, up from 266 last year, as it begins making the
selections every two years instead of annually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The promotions disclosed today on the company&#8217;s website
take effect Jan. 1 and won&#8217;t happen again until 2015, after the
bank decided earlier this year to change to a biennial process.
New York-based Goldman Sachs last year named 70 people to its
partnership, the fewest since the firm became a public company
in 1999, and won&#8217;t promote new partners until next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein said yesterday
that the firm is always focused on recruiting and retaining top
talent, even as it sets aside a lower portion of revenue for
compensation. Blankfein, 59, said the average tenure for
employees with a title of vice president or higher is 9.1 years,
up from 7.6 years in 2001. Managing director is the second-highest title among non-executives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The insight and perspective that is gained by living
through several cycles is impossible to quantify, and having a
group of professionals who have experienced those cycles
together also carries an immeasurable benefit,&#8221; Blankfein said
yesterday at an investor conference in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;The Federation&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The securities division has the most new managing directors
with 94, while 51 are in investment banking, 39 in investment
management, 14 in research and eight in merchant banking, said
David Wells, a bank spokesman. The other 74 work for the firm&#8217;s
administrative arm, known as &#8220;The Federation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 56 percent of those just promoted are based in the
Americas, 27 percent in Europe, Middle East and Africa, 15
percent in Asia-Pacific and 2 percent in India, Wells said. Last
year, about 58 percent were in the Americas, 26 percent in EMEA
and 17 percent in Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women comprise 20 percent of the incoming class of managing
directors, compared with 23 percent in 2012 and 19 percent in
2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average compensation cost per employee at Goldman Sachs
fell 5 percent to $319,755 in the first nine months of 2013,
even as revenue climbed 2 percent. The company employed 32,600
people at the end of September, 3,100 fewer than at the end of
2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Rigorous Exercise&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managing directors typically receive a base salary of
$500,000, lower than the $900,000 granted to partners. Both also
get bonuses that can boost total compensation into the millions
of dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 7 percent of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s employees hold the
managing director title. The firm created a non-partner managing
director title in 1996 to recognize top workers who weren&#8217;t yet
partners, and decided in March to switch from the annual
tradition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A biennial process will allow us to invest more in the
managing-director selection process so that it will continue to
be a disciplined and rigorous exercise,&#8221; the bank said in a
March memo to employees. &#8220;This will help to ensure that the
managing director title remains as aspirational as it should be
for our top performers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s first class of 87 managing directors included
William C. Dudley, now president of the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York; Clifford S. Asness, who left in 1998 to start hedge
fund AQR Capital Management LLC; and Richard J. Gnodde, who was
named co-head of global investment banking at Goldman Sachs in
May 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s fourth-quarter trading revenue will be slightly down from last year,
according to Michael Cavanagh, who co-runs the bank&#8217;s corporate
and investment bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Fixed income and equities are tracking very well versus
client volumes, which are down slightly&#8221; from last year,
Cavanagh said at an investor conference in New York today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment-banking fees for underwriting bond and equity
issuance and advising on mergers and acquisitions are
&#8220;healthy&#8221; this quarter and may be close to the previous three
months, when JPMorgan generated $1.5 billion in fees, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Last year&#8217;s fourth quarter was a particularly strong
underwriting quarter. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll achieve that again,
but it&#8217;s a healthy quarter,&#8221; Cavanagh said, adding that the
final figure &#8220;might come in looking something similar to the
third quarter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cavanagh and Daniel Pinto run the corporate and investment
bank, whose traders compiled a perfect record in the first nine
months of this year by generating profits every day the markets
were open. On three of those days, traders made more than $200
million, JPMorgan said in a regulatory filing this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Sarah Mulholland" date="Nov 13, 2013 12:53 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-13/goldman-sachs-pulls-loan-from-commercial-mortgage-bond-deal-1-.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Pulls Loan From Commercial Mortgage Bond Deal</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. pulled a
loan from a commercial-mortgage bond deal sold last week after
investors balked at the debt amid concern that underwriting
standards are slipping in the $550 billion market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $47.5 million loan, linked to 10 shopping malls in
Nebraska and South Dakota, was removed because of a &#8220;potential
dispute&#8221; between the borrower and a lender, according to a
filing today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debt, called the Perkins Retail Portfolio, was
originated by Jefferies Group Inc., according to deal documents
obtained by Bloomberg News. C-III Capital Partners, the servicer
overseeing the mortgage, was seeking additional information from
the borrower about the properties while the $1.1 billion
commercial-mortgage backed securities offering was being
marketed, according to a Nov. 5 statement on C-III&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is one of the first instances that we are aware of
that a loan was pulled out of CMBS deal after pricing,&#8221; said
Richard Hill, a debt analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York.
&#8220;That deal priced at a significant concession to another deal
priced that same day, so investors were already concerned about
the credit quality.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A top-ranked portion of the transaction maturing in 10
years was sold to yield 108 basis points more than the benchmark
swap rate, compared with 96 basis points on similar debt sold by
JPMorgan Chase  Co., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Incorrect Statements&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, and Richard
Khaleel of Jefferies declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Perkins loan wasn&#8217;t the only mortgage that raised red
flags. In a supplement distributed to bond buyers prior to the
pricing, the underwriters disclosed additional information about
a $3.8 million loan linked to manufactured housing in Virginia,
noting that the loan documents were being modified because the
borrower failed to disclose a guilty plea in 1989 arising from
&#8220;incorrect statements&#8221; submitted to lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of bonds linked to everything from strip malls to
skyscrapers are poised to double to $70 billion this year as
investors chase riskier assets with the Federal Reserve
suppressing interest rates for almost five years, according to
Credit Suisse Group AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s Investors Service is increasing the amount of
credit protection required to obtain investment-grade rankings
on the debt as loans get risker, the New York-based rating
company said in an Oct. 28 report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An aspect of U.S. tax law is being criticized by some lawmakers and consumer groups concerned that it may be worth billions of dollars for JPMorgan Chase  Co in negotiations with the Department of Justice. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An agreement between the government and the bank over mortgage-bond sales that&#8217;s silent on taxes would let the company take a deduction and shave 35 percent off any settlement cost publicized in headlines. That would, for example, turn an announced settlement of $10 billion into one for $6.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It shouldn&#8217;t have hidden subsidies or sweeteners in the settlement,&#8221; said Francisco Enriquez, a tax and budget associate at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, which says it operates as a counter to big banks. &#8220;If the DOJ is in the end going to look for a $6.5 billion price tag, then that&#8217;s what they should say.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tax implications are a complicated part of settlement talks between companies and the U.S. government. Companies focused on after-tax costs negotiate with government agencies that may be more concerned about how big a payment they can claim to have extracted than about how much money ends up in the Treasury. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;At dinner parties, a billion sounds better than $700 million, even if a billion is tax deductible and $700 million is not,&#8221; said Gregg Polsky, a law professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who has studied the taxation of penalties and damage payments. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brian Fallon, a DOJ spokesman, declined to comment because the talks are continuing on resolving multiple legal issues surrounding the mortgage-bond sales. Also declining to comment was Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for the New York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fines, Restitution &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. tax law places payments to government agencies into two categories: fines and penalties, which are not deductible, and compensatory damages and restitution, which can be deducted as business expenses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If a settlement agreement is silent on taxes, a company is free to claim a deduction against the 35 percent federal corporate income tax and state income taxes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Internal Revenue Service may challenge the deduction, a path that can lead to litigation over whether payments were deductible restitution or non-deductible penalties. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some government settlement accords include clauses where companies agree not to take deductions. For example, the agreement this month between the Justice Department and SAC Capital Advisors LP prevented the hedge fund from deducting any of the $1.8 billion payment in that settlement and a related case with the Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s $5.1 billion settlement on Oct. 25 with the Federal Housing Finance Agency included no clause limiting tax deductions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Pretty Clear&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Absent such an agreement, I think it&#8217;s pretty clear that virtually all of the payment will be deductible,&#8221; said Robert Willens, a New York-based tax and accounting consultant. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. lawmakers including Representative Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat, want the bank to forgo a tax deduction. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was the taxpayer who initially funded the bailout of Wall Street,&#8221; Welch wrote on Oct. 30 to Jamie Dimon, the bank&#8217;s chairman and chief executive officer. &#8220;It was the taxpayer who continues to endure the consequences of the worst recession since the Great Depression. The taxpayer should not, therefore, be required to contribute a nickel towards the fines imposed for conduct that got America into this mess in the first place.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Grassley, Reed &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Senator Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, and Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, introduced legislation this month that would require the government and companies to reach advance agreements on how settlements will be taxed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A 2007 version of the measure was estimated to generate $263 million in government revenue over 10 years, according to Jill Gerber, a spokeswoman for Grassley. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cases with punitive and compensatory components are complicated by the differing goals of those involved in the negotiations, Polsky said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The defendant cares about the after-tax dollars,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The IRS cares about the after-tax dollars. The regulatory agency that&#8217;s settling the case, they don&#8217;t seem to care about the after-tax&#8221; amount. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Enriquez said settlement deductibility is a systemic issue that amounts to a loophole, letting companies deduct payments that are really being made to avoid formal fines. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Quite Angry&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Wrongdoing should not constitute a tax writeoff and wrongdoing shouldn&#8217;t be subsidized by the American people,&#8221; he said. &#8220;People are just generally quite angry and rightfully so that JPMorgan could get a massive $3.5 billion tax deduction for their suffering.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Willens said lawmakers have become more aware of the deductibility of settlements, making it possible that the JPMorgan agreement could include clauses on taxes to make the real cost more closely match the announced amount. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given the outrage that has been expressed by some about the ability to deduct this, including some pretty influential politicians, I would think there probably would be something in the agreement,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Reed-Grassley bill is S. 1654. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Michael J. Moore" date="Nov 13, 2013 12:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-13/blankfein-says-goldman-sachs-can-boost-roe-without-major-changes.html"><headline>Blankfein Says Goldman Sachs Can Boost ROE Without Major Changes</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the U.S.
bank most reliant on trading, won&#8217;t make any &#8220;wholesale
strategic change&#8221; to help improve returns, Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While we have generated good relative returns in the last
five years, they are hardly aspirational,&#8221; Blankfein, 59, said
yesterday at an investor conference in New York. &#8220;We are
committed to improving them regardless of the challenges
presented in the current environment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has earned a return on equity of 10 percent
so far this year, compared with 11 percent in 2012 and more than
30 percent before the financial crisis. The shares trade at 1.06
times book value, indicating that investors estimate the firm&#8217;s
cost of equity at around 10 percent, a figure that Blankfein
said the company is focused on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People throw out that number, 10 percent, I happen to
think that&#8217;s a pretty high number given that the risk-free rate
of return is zero,&#8221; Blankfein said at a separate conference in
New York yesterday. &#8220;But the market seems to have focused on
that, so we&#8217;ve kind of focused on that number. Not for the long-term, but for this part of the cycle, I think that looks OK.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which before the financial crisis targeted a
long-term ROE of 20 percent, has declined to set a goal since
then, saying it wanted to see the effects of new rules. Recent
international regulations have required banks to hold more
equity capital, pushing down ROE. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Berkshire Hathaway Inc. reported a stake in Exxon Mobil Corp. valued at about $3.7 billion as Warren Buffett&#8217;s company disclosed its largest new holding since adding International Business Machines Corp. in 2011. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Buffett&#8217;s company owned 40.1 million shares of Exxon on Sept. 30, Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire said today in a regulatory filing. The world&#8217;s biggest oil company by market value closed at $93.22 today in New York. It rose to $93.90 in extended trading at 5:14 p.m., after the filing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Berkshire has benefited this year as its stock picks rallied along with the broader market, affirming a strategy of favoring equities instead of bonds amid near record-low interest rates. Buffett has tracked Exxon and bought its stock in the past, holding a stake in the Irving, Texas-based energy producer as recently as 2011. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil &#8220;is undervalued, in his opinion, and pretty much being ignored by the market,&#8221; said David Kass, a professor at the University of Maryland&#8217;s Robert H. Smith School of Business who has taken students to meet Buffett in Omaha. &#8220;He knows the company. He knows it well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About three-quarters of the Exxon holding was added in the three months ended June 30, according to a separate filing today. Berkshire requested confidential treatment in an August filing listing its holdings at the end of the second quarter. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sometimes allows companies to withhold information from the public to limit copycat investing while they build or cut a position. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highfields Capital Management LP,
the Boston hedge fund run by Jonathon Jacobson, sold its stake
in JPMorgan (JPM) Chase  Co. and Oracle (ORCL) Corp. in the third quarter
and halved its holdings in Capital One Financial Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highfields sold more than 1.9 million shares of New York-based JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. lender, according to a
regulatory filing today. The hedge fund also sold 500,000 shares
of Capital One, the bank and credit-card issuer based in McLean,
Virginia, the filing shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hedge fund eliminated its 3.4 million shares in Oracle,
the software company based in Redwood City, California founded
by Larry Ellison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highfields disclosed a 2.69 million-share stake in
Brookfield Office Properties Inc. (BPO), the New York company that
owns, develops and manages office buildings, worth about $51.4
million at current prices. The fund also added 294,000 shares of
PacWest Bancorp, the Los Angeles-based bank holding company,
valued at about $11.5 million at today&#8217;s closing price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money managers who oversee more than $100 million in

&lt;p&gt;Banks led by JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
are marketing $3.5 billion of commercial-mortgage bonds tied to
Hilton Worldwide Inc. as Blackstone Group LP prepares to take
the hotelier public, people with knowledge of the offering said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest such transaction since the credit crisis is
linked to 23 properties across the U.S., said the people, who
asked not to be identified because terms aren&#8217;t public. JPMorgan
is working with Deutsche Bank AG, Bank of America Corp., Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley to arrange the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hilton deal comes with sales of securities linked to
commercial real estate loans poised to surpass $70 billion in
2013, more than double the volume in 2012, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The commercial-mortgage securities are
enabling Blackstone (BX), the world&#8217;s largest private-equity firm, to
pay down a portion $13.4 billion in debt refinanced in October,
deal documents show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2007 takeover of Hilton for $26 billion was the largest
ever for a hotel company, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackstone restructured the debt in April 2010, reducing
its debt load by $4 billion and pushing back maturities to 2015,
as consumers and businesses cut back on travel amid the economic
downturn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven months later, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs
sought to sell about $3 billion of the restructured debt in a
commercial-mortgage bond deal. The transaction was cut in half
when investors demanded additional yield to buy the securities,
prompting Goldman to pull its portion of the sale, people with
knowledge of the deal said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real estate investors are cashing in on hotels as values
climb along with occupancy and room rates. Prices for
hospitality properties in non-major markets, which excludes the
largest U.S. cities such as New York, have climbed 28.3 percent
over the last 12 months, according to Moody&#8217;s Investors Service. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ford is facing new allegations contained in police
documents released yesterday, including that he brought
prostitutes to his office, guzzled vodka in his car, made a
racial slur to a taxi driver and sexually propositioned a female
staff member. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford, who has already admitted he smoked crack cocaine and
bought illegal drugs while in office, was responding to
allegations that were made in police interviews with former Ford
staff members. None of the allegations have been proven in court
and police have said there isn&#8217;t enough evidence to warrant
charges against the mayor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford said one of the women named in the police documents
who came back to his office after a St. Patrick&#8217;s Day party last
year wasn&#8217;t a prostitute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;She&#8217;s a friend, and it makes me sick how people are
saying this,&#8221; Ford told reporters outside his city hall office.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve never had a prostitute here.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also denied saying he wanted to have oral sex with a
staff member, who no longer works in his office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would never do that, I&#8217;m happily married.&#8221; Ford said.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got more than enough to eat at home.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Not Perfect&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reporters present reacted with gasps to that statement and
the mayor&#8217;s use of a vulgar sexual idiom. Ford later apologized
for those remarks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For the past six months, I have been under tremendous,
tremendous stress,&#8221; Ford said at a press conference, which was
attended by his wife Renata. &#8220;The revelations yesterday of
cocaine, escorts and prostitution has pushed me over the line
and I used unforgivable language.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mayor said today he is receiving &#8220;support from a team
of health-care professionals.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I am taking accountability,&#8221; he said, without
elaborating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier, Ford said he may have driven a car after drinking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I might have had some drinks and driven, which is
absolutely wrong,&#8221; he told reporters. &#8220;I&#8217;m not perfect, maybe
you are, but I&#8217;m not.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Personal Issues&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The police documents were released by an Ontario court the
same day that Ford said for the first time he had bought illegal
drugs within the past two years. Ford made the statement amid
questioning at a city hall meeting in which a majority of city
councilors passed a non-binding motion asking him to take a
leave of absence to address his &#8220;personal issues.&#8221; Ford has
refused to resign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Ford&#8217;s few remaining allies among city councilors,
Giorgio Mammoliti, threatened today to withdraw support for the
mayor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If he doesn&#8217;t admit that he needs help, then he&#8217;s lost me
and I&#8217;ll be taking a stand with my colleague Councilor Minnan-Wong and asking him to step down completely,&#8221; Mammoliti said,
referring to Denzil Minnan-Wong, who backed the council motion
yesterday for the mayor to take a leave. &#8220;He&#8217;s got till the end
of the day.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Don&#8217;t panic, please city of Toronto, do not panic,
everything is OK down here,&#8221; Mammoliti said in separate
interview broadcast on CP24 television after Ford&#8217;s apology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne said the things she is
hearing about Ford are &#8220;truly disturbing,&#8221; adding the province
would consider stepping in to help the city if asked by council.
Canadian municipalities are governed by provincial laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Provincial Response &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If council were to clearly indicate that they lack the
ability to function as a result of this matter, the province
would respond to a request from council to be provided new tools
depending on what that request might be,&#8221; Wynne told reporters
at the provincial legislature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Every day he lowers the bar, and this is another one of
those days,&#8221; Minnan-Wong, a former Ford supporter, said to
reporters. &#8220;I&#8217;m very sad for the city and I&#8217;m exceedingly angry
at the mayor. The mayor has got to go.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to two former staff members quoted in the
documents, women who may have been prostitutes were in Ford&#8217;s
city hall office on St. Patrick&#8217;s Day in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the same night, Ford called a taxi driver a &#8220;Paki,&#8221;
and made &#8220;mocking fake language sounds,&#8221; one of the staff
members said, according to the documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vodka Swig &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another incident last year, a former staff member told
police that Ford pulled over his car, drank an 11- or 12-ounce
bottle of vodka in two minutes and then drove away. Another
staffer told police she bought Ford a bottle of vodka that size
twice a week. Iceberg was his preferred brand, according to the
documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview with police, Mark Towhey, Ford&#8217;s former
chief of staff, said he believed the mayor was an alcoholic and
that he had consumed alcohol while at city hall, though he&#8217;d
never seen him drink himself, according to the police documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towhey was fired after recommending the mayor seek
treatment, according to the documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutor Tom Andreopoulos sent the 500 pages of
partially redacted police documents to media yesterday in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the latest allegations were released, 30 members of
the 44-person council in Canada&#8217;s largest city presented a
letter asking the mayor to step aside as Toronto&#8217;s reputation
has been &#8220;damaged&#8221; and it has become difficult to focus on
city business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Drunken Stupor &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The non-binding motion comes as Ford, 44, vowed to remain
in office after saying last week he smoked crack likely in one
of his &#8220;drunken stupors.&#8221; Ford, who has been mayor since 2010,
admitted to using the drug after Toronto police said on Oct. 29
they had found a video showing him inhaling from a glass crack
pipe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Ford said he was &#8220;humiliated&#8221; by his recent
actions, he repeated yesterday that he would stay in office and
run in municipal elections next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is no need for me to take a leave of absence,&#8221;
Ford said in city council. He said he used drugs &#8220;out of sheer
stupidity&#8221; and had been &#8220;inebriated&#8221; a number of times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s motion for Ford to step aside is symbolic
because there&#8217;s nothing city council can do to force a sitting
mayor from office, according to municipal rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford, who was removed from his position as a high school
football coach this year, wore a Toronto Argonauts jersey when
he spoke to reporters this morning. That prompted Twitter
messages from the Canadian Football League team, which plays in
a semifinal game this weekend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The situation with respect to the mayor and his
leadership is unseemly at best,&#8221; the CFL team posted on Twitter
today. &#8220;These latest remarks, while wearing our team&#8217;s jersey,
are particularly disappointing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, will wean off of BlackBerry (BBRY) Ltd.&#8217;s phones, citing
concerns that the mobile technology company might not be around
in the future or may have service interrupted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer told employees who use BlackBerry devices to instead
get an Apple Inc. phone or one run on Google Inc.&#8217;s Android
operating system. The drugmaker cited Waterloo, Ontario-based
BlackBerry&#8217;s declining market share and noted that the company
attempted to sell itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In response to declining sales, the company is in a
volatile state,&#8221; New York-based Pfizer told employees in a memo
obtained by Bloomberg News. &#8220;We recommend that BlackBerry
clients use their BlackBerry devices and plan to migrate to a
new device at normal contract expiration.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After years of losing customers to Apple&#8217;s iPhone and
devices running Android, BlackBerry is struggling to keep
remaining users from defecting. The new BlackBerry 10 operating
system, meant to fuel a comeback, drew a tepid response from
buyers, and the company had to write off almost $1 billion in
unsold inventory last quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer had 92,000 employees as of its last annual filing,
making it the eighth-biggest employer among U.S. and Western
European-based health-care companies, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Contingency plans have been developed in case
BlackBerry shuts down or is unable to provide services, Pfizer
said in the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We never go out in the media and talk about our service
providers,&#8221; said Joan Campion, a Pfizer spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A $4.7 billion takeover bid for BlackBerry was scrapped
this month, prompting a shakeup at the company. BlackBerry
installed former Sybase Inc. Chief Executive Officer John Chen
as the head of the company and raised $1 billion in convertible
debt to help bolster its disappearing cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a blog post on Nov. 13, Chen tried to reassure customers
that the company is not going anywhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We also want our customers to know that BlackBerry has
significant financial strength for the long-haul,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
am confident that we will rebuild BlackBerry for the benefit of
all of our constituencies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the target of at least eight Justice Department investigations, was mocked and taunted by Twitter users after asking followers to send questions to an executive using the hashtag #AskJPM. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The online forum, which the bank canceled late yesterday, was intended in part to give college students an opportunity to communicate directly with a senior executive, said Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for the New York-based company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;#Badidea! Back to the drawing board,&#8221; the bank posted less than six hours after its original post, which drew more than 6,000 responses from users in that span, according to social media tracking service Topsy. The #AskJPM hashtag had more than 24,000 posts on Twitter as of 10 a.m. New York time, according to Topsy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you&#8217;re in the banking industry with what&#8217;s happened over the last five years, it might not be a good idea to go out and solicit comments on social media,&#8221; said Brad Adgate, a senior vice president at marketing firm Horizon Media Inc. in New York. &#8220;They are paying all these fines and billions of dollars to the federal government. I question the timing of this.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &#8220;Snarkpocalypse,&#8221; as @ReformedBroker dubbed it, started after the company&#8217;s official Twitter account posted a call for questions at 1:26 p.m. in New York yesterday for investment bank Vice Chairman James Lee, using #AskJPM. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global regulators this week put
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) at the pinnacle of a
list of 29 too-big-to-fail banks that face tougher capital rules
than other lenders. The companies were also handed a map to plot
their descent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time since it started compiling a roster of
lenders whose collapse would threaten the global economy, the
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision also disclosed the
thresholds for how it determined the level of extra capital
requirements that such banks should face. The move will enable
lenders to find ways to move down to a lower surcharge category
or exit the list altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The capital surcharges for globally systemic lenders add an
extra layer of safety beyond beefed-up standards known as Basel
III that emerged in the wake of the 2008 collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. Regulators said the additional buffers
were vital to protect taxpayers and prevent crises from
cascading through the financial system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think the Basel committee would be quite happy in this
instance for banks to change their scores by becoming smaller,
less interconnected, less complex,&#8221; said Patricia Jackson, head
of prudential advisory at Ernst  Young LLP in London. &#8220;It&#8217;s
also a shot across the bows in the sense that if they become
more complex, larger, relative to others they go up the list.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. authorities are examining
JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s (JPM) ties to a consulting firm owned by the
daughter of former Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao as part of a probe
into whether the bank awarded contracts and jobs in order to win
business deals, the New York Times reported today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is cooperating with the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the U.S. attorney&#8217;s office in Brooklyn, which are
leading the investigation, and also conducting its own internal
review, the newspaper reported. The bank hasn&#8217;t been accused of
any wrongdoing, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     Nov. 14 (Bloomberg) -- International Business Machines
Corp.&#8217;s Watson technology, famous for outsmarting humans on the
game show &#8220;Jeopardy!,&#8221; will be offered as a cloud-based tool
to application developers, letting them tap a resource capable
of giving everything from shopping tips to medical advice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programmers will be able to access the IBM Watson
Developers Cloud, an online marketplace with resources for
developing apps, use a content store with data from third-party
providers and get help from IBM and contracted professionals,
the Armonk, New York-based company said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is so much more that can be accomplished by drawing
on the creativity of individuals, organizations, entrepreneurs,
startups and established businesses that truly innovate every
day on their own,&#8221; said Stephen Gold, vice president of Watson
Solutions, in an interview. &#8220;Watson can be this ultimate
assistant to help individuals get their questions answered and
their problems solved.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opening up the Watson platform to outside developers is
IBM&#8217;s latest step to commercialize the technology as it tries to
boost revenue from cloud computing amid a decline in its
hardware business. Watson, which can answer questions after
being preloaded with documents and websites, has been deployed
in the health and finance markets since its debut on the
&#8220;Jeopardy!&#8221; in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;App Developers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Application developers, from startups to established
businesses, can submit their requests to use Watson&#8217;s services
on IBM&#8217;s website beginning this week, said Lori Bosio, a
spokeswoman for the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no upfront cost for access and partners who use
the service in their apps will be charged on a metered usage
model, Gold said. He declined to comment on expected sales from
the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three apps developed on the cloud-based platform are
targeted to enter the market early next year, IBM said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MD Buyline, a company that provides supply-chain services
for hospitals and health-care systems, will introduce its
Hippocrates app to let clinical and financial users make &#8220;real-time, informed decisions,&#8221; according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluid Inc., an e-commerce services company, will offer its
Fluid Expert Personal Shopper app to help consumers with
purchase decisions. Welltok Inc.&#8217;s CafeWell Concierge app will
combine users&#8217; input and Watson&#8217;s ability to learn to create
personalized health plans catered to an individual&#8217;s needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introduction of the Watson cloud service follows six
quarters of declining revenue for IBM, underpinned by slumping
sales in its hardware business. The company said it generated
more than $1 billion in revenue from cloud products and services
in the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We really believe in the future opportunity it represents
in a revenue and upside perspective,&#8221; Gold said of the Watson
cloud service. &#8220;This is clearly IBM&#8217;s most prized possession
that we are opening up to the world.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) reported a stake in Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) as Warren Buffett&#8217;s company disclosed its largest new holding since International Business Machines Corp. in 2011. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Buffett&#8217;s company owned 40.1 million shares of Exxon on Sept. 30, Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire said yesterday in a regulatory filing. The world&#8217;s biggest oil company by market value rose 2.2 percent to $95.27 at 4:15 p.m. in New York today, the highest close in at least 33 years. At that price, the holding would be worth about $3.8 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Berkshire has benefited this year as its stock picks rallied along with the broader market, affirming a strategy of favoring equities instead of bonds amid near record-low interest rates. Buffett, 83, has tracked Exxon and bought its stock in the past, holding a stake in the Irving, Texas-based energy producer as recently as 2011. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil &#8220;is undervalued, in his opinion, and pretty much being ignored by the market,&#8221; said David Kass, a professor at the University of Maryland&#8217;s Robert H. Smith School of Business who has taken students to meet Buffett in Omaha. &#8220;He knows the company. He knows it well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon had advanced 7.7 percent this year through yesterday&#8217;s close in New York, trailing the 26 percent surge in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index.

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) had a furnace fire in
the &#8220;cracking 2 area&#8221; at its Pascagoula refinery in
Mississippi that caused the death of one worker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fire occurred at 2 a.m. local time at the 330,000-barrel-a-day plant on Mississippi&#8217;s Gulf Coast, Kurt Glaubitz, a
San Ramon, California-based spokesman for the company, said in
an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cracking 2 unit has been shut, Terry Jackson, Jackson
County deputy director of emergency services, said by phone. The
rest of the refinery isn&#8217;t shut, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refinery personnel responded to the fire and secured the
site, Glaubitz said. He wouldn&#8217;t say if the fire has been
extinguished, nor whether any portion of the refinery has been
shut down in response. Allison Cook, a Pascagoula-based
spokeswoman for the company, identified the location of the fire
in a message on a community hot line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery produces 130,000 barrels of gasoline, 68,000
barrels of diesel and 50,000 barrels of jet fuel a day,
according to a company website. It also produces bunker fuel,
liquefied petroleum gases and other products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plant processes heavy, high-sulfur crude. In August, it
imported 278,000 barrels of oil a day from Brazil, Canada,
Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela. Two of its shipments from
Colombia were the highest-density crudes imported to the U.S.
that month, according to Energy Information Administration data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve Bank of New York
asked a judge to dismiss a lawsuit filed by a former bank
examiner who alleged she was fired for refusing to change
findings about Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s conflict of interest
policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Fed said in a filing yesterday in Manhattan
federal court that Carmen Segarra &#8220;flagrantly violated&#8221; the
bank&#8217;s policies, federal regulations and federal criminal law by
making confidential supervisory information public in her
lawsuit and circulating it to the news media without permission
from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed also said Segarra can&#8217;t sue under the federal
whistle-blower statute because her concerns about Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s policy didn&#8217;t involve a violation of law or regulations.
While she claimed Goldman lacked a firm-wide conflict-of-interest policy, Goldman&#8217;s policies were actually available and
posted on its public website, the Fed said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The gravamen of the complaint is not a whistle-blower&#8217;s
provision of information, but a non-actionable disagreement
between a supervised employee and more senior colleagues over
how to interpret a Federal Reserve policy,&#8221; lawyers for the Fed
wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank said it fired Segarra for cause and not because
she identified a possible violation of law or regulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Segarra said in a lawsuit filed in October that she
examined the legal and compliance divisions of Goldman Sachs in
late 2011 and early 2012 and found that they lacked a policy
that conformed with federal banking regulations. She alleges she
was fired because she refused to withdraw her findings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said then that it has a comprehensive
approach to addressing conflicts through firmwide and divisional
policies and infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Segarra v. Federal Reserve Bank of New York,13-cv-07173, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nov. 15 (Bloomberg) -- Tesla Motors Inc. shareholders have
had much to fret about lately, from a nosebleed valuation and
sagging stock price to periodic YouTube videos of exploding
Tesla electric cars. Here&#8217;s another one for the list: Sometimes
Tesla acts like it doesn&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s doing when it comes to

&lt;p&gt;Nov. 11 (Bloomberg) -- Last year, shortly after the
excellent James Bond film &#8220;Skyfall&#8221; was released, I asserted
in a column that an anagram at the heart of the film suggested
that a critical subplot had been left on the cutting-room floor.
I received several e-mails asking why I hadn&#8217;t disclosed what I
thought I knew. The answer is that I couldn&#8217;t explain the
anagram without including several spoilers. Now that a year has
passed since the U.S. opening (November 9, 2012), I suppose it&#8217;s
time to explain what I meant. (Warning: Those aforementioned
spoilers are below!) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) agreed to drop
litigation against the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. over some
mortgage bonds sold by Washington Mutual Inc., clearing the way
for a $9 billion accord with state and federal officials, two
people briefed on the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement will be announced tomorrow, said one of the
people, requesting anonymity because the negotiations aren&#8217;t
public. JPMorgan, the largest U.S. lender by assets, agreed
today to the terms of $4 billion in consumer relief payments,
the person said. The remaining $5 billion will go toward
penalties and resolving claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank battled with the FDIC over who should pay some
liabilities from WaMu, the failed Seattle thrift that the agency
placed into receivership in 2008 while selling assets to New
York-based JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement, which is being brokered by the Justice
Department, won&#8217;t interfere with JPMorgan&#8217;s ability to sue the
FDIC to cover part of a $4 billion settlement last month with
the Federal Housing Finance Agency, two people familiar with the
matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also won&#8217;t prohibit the bank from seeking reimbursement
from the FDIC for claims against WaMu from private investors,
they said. JPMorgan announced a tentative $4.5 billion deal last
week with 21 institutional investors, including Pacific
Investment Management Co., to settle claims that the lender and
its subsidiaries sold faulty mortgage bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Attorneys General &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $9 billion settlement, which includes a $2 billion
fine, will end civil investigations by the Justice Department
and the California and New York state attorneys general, as well
as lawsuits by the FDIC and National Credit Union
Administration, people briefed on the talks said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Gray, a spokesman for the FDIC, JPMorgan&#8217;s Brian Marchiony and Brian Fallon at the Justice Department said they
couldn&#8217;t comment because the negotiations are confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consumer-relief portion of the accord, negotiated over
the weekend by Associate Attorney General Tony West and U.S.
Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan, requires
JPMorgan to hire an independent monitor and provide the entire
$4 billion by the end of 2016, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s costs include at least $1.5 billion in principal
writedowns for struggling homeowners with federally backed
loans, the person said. Of that, $1.2 billion would be for first
lien principal writedowns. At least $300 million must go toward
forbearance, in which banks shift loan terms to account for a
change in a debtor&#8217;s income, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vacant Homes &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An additional $2 billion would fund interest-rate
reductions of existing loans, new loans or loan originations
that JPMorgan would be required to keep in its portfolio, the
person said. The bank also would receive credit for so-called
anti-blight efforts, such as the costs of demolishing vacant
homes and absorbing the mortgages of such properties the bank
has yet to foreclose on, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If JPMorgan doesn&#8217;t provide the entire $4 billion by the
end of 2016 then the bank would be required to pay any leftover
portion to the government or a nonprofit, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and the U.S.
Justice Department will announce tomorrow a $13 billion
settlement to resolve civil probes into the bank&#8217;s sale of
mortgage bonds, a person familiar with the matter said. A
portion of the total proposed settlement was resolved earlier
with the Federal Housing Finance Agency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which
bought aluminum warehouse firm Metro International Trade
Services LLC in 2010, has received inquiries from potential
buyers after the London Metal Exchange imposed new rules on how
storage facilities operate, a person briefed on the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs hasn&#8217;t engaged in a formal sale process, said
the person, who requested anonymity because the talks are
private and didn&#8217;t identify the prospective purchasers. Gary Cohn, president of the New York-based company, told CNBC in July
that it was allowed to own Metro for 10 years and that it would
sell the business at &#8220;an appropriate time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LME, the world&#8217;s biggest industrial-metals marketplace,
changed its rules earlier this month to speed up withdrawals
from warehoused stockpiles amid consumer complaints that
prompted scrutiny from U.S. regulators. The changes will affect
depots where waiting times exceed 50 calendar days, a broader
group than the original proposal that pertained to sites where
waits were longer than 100 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs received interest from private-equity firms
and international commodity companies in potentially buying
Metro after the rule change eliminated some uncertainty in the
warehouse industry, the person said. The bank, the fifth-biggest
in the U.S. by assets, may not pursue a sale in the near future,
the person said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron
will introduce laws to force search engines&#8217; to cooperate if new
efforts to curb child pornography online fail, he said today
while lauding efforts by Google Inc. (GOOG) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameron credited the two with making &#8220;significant
progress&#8221; in helping prevent such content from proliferating,
in a statement ahead of today&#8217;s meeting of Internet companies,
the National Crime Agency and charities on curbing child porn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Child abuse &#8220;highlights the depths to which humanity can
sink,&#8221; Google Chairman Eric Schmidt wrote in Britain&#8217;s Daily
Mail newspaper today. &#8220;While society will never wholly
eliminate such depravity, we should do everything in our power
to protect children from harm.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, Cameron detailed his effort to stop child
pornography and better protect children from pedophiles by
enlisting help from companies and the law-enforcement agency.
Since then, U.K. Internet providers have been installing home
filters so parents can help prevent their children from being
targeted and the largest Wi-Fi networks have activated so-called
family-friendly filters in public areas where children may
access the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameron cited a 20 percent drop in Internet users searching
for illegal content thanks to efforts by Cupertino, California-based Google. Cameron also unveiled a U.K.-U.S. taskforce to
identify trans-Atlantic criminals and said the Internet Watch
Foundation -- an industry group that identifies and removes
illegal content -- will expand operations and recruit new
analysts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and its Skype unit
were cleared of privacy violations related to the U.S. spying
scandal by a Luxembourg regulator that said the companies didn&#8217;t
provide widespread data access to the U.S. National Security
Agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Luxembourg data protection regulator&#8217;s probe concluded
that the transfer of some data to affiliate companies in the
U.S. &#8220;appear to take place lawfully&#8221; under a so-called safe
harbor agreement, according to a statement by the watchdog
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator conducted the investigation because the
companies have their European headquarters in the country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) will pay a record $13 billion to resolve U.S. Justice Department probes into the bank&#8217;s sale of mortgage bonds that officials said helped feed the financial chaos of 2008. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The accord settles allegations that JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. lender by assets, misled investors and the public when it sold bonds backed by faulty residential mortgages, according to Justice Department statement today. U.S. and state officials blamed the bank&#8217;s actions in the statement for helping to cause the credit crisis, and said the settlement doesn&#8217;t shield JPMorgan or its employees from criminal charges. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Without a doubt, the conduct uncovered in this investigation helped sow the seeds of the mortgage meltdown,&#8221; Attorney General Eric Holder said in the statement. &#8220;JPMorgan was not the only financial institution during this period to knowingly bundle toxic loans and sell them to unsuspecting investors, but that is no excuse for the firm&#8217;s behavior.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan&#8217;s chief executive officer, said in a separate statement that the settlement resolves a significant portion of claims tied to mortgage-backed securities issued by the lender and two firms it bought during the credit crisis, Bear Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual Inc.&#8217;s bank unit. The sum is covered by reserves, and JPMorgan is cooperating with the Justice Department&#8217;s criminal case, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU), the
second-largest U.S. life insurer, hired Robert Cignarella as co-head of global leveraged finance from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cignarella will join in January and help oversee more than
$33 billion, including bank loans and high-yield bonds in the
U.S. and Europe, the Newark, New Jersey-based company said today
in a statement. He&#8217;ll work withPaul Appleby, a managing
director and the current head of Prudential Fixed Income&#8217;s
leveraged finance team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Rob&#8217;s more than 20 years of experience and insight in
leveraged finance will be a valuable addition in leading our
investment management efforts,&#8221; Appleby said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer John Strangfeld, 59, is bolstering
Prudential&#8217;s asset-management businesses to expand fee income, a
strategy also pursued by rivals including MetLife Inc. (MET) and
Principal Financial Group Inc. Prudential Fixed Income had about
$397 billion in assets under management as of Sept. 30, compared
with $232 billion at the end of 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loans to junk-rated companies in the U.S. are on pace to
exceed $1 trillion this year, a level not seen before the
financial crisis. The boom is being fueled by lenders and
investors seeking to boost returns as the Federal Reserve keeps
interest rates at about zero for a fifth year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates said he and other directors have met with &#8220;a lot of CEO candidates&#8221; to replace Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The board convened yesterday to discuss some of the candidates, Gates said at the company&#8217;s annual shareholder meeting in Bellevue, Washington, Ballmer&#8217;s last before he steps down. Gates said he wouldn&#8217;t give a timeline for the decision. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest software maker is going through its biggest transition in decades, seeking a new leader while it adopts a new corporate structure focused on devices and services. Microsoft is also buying Nokia Oyj&#8217;s handset unit, its largest acquisition by number of employees. The new CEO will have to keep pace with a shift among consumers and businesses to mobile devices and Web-delivered software. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a complex role to fill,&#8221; Gates said. He thanked Ballmer and choking up, said that &#8220;we share a commitment to make sure the next CEO is the right person for the right time for the company we both love.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s directors, including Ballmer, were re-elected by a majority. Shareholder advisory firm Glass Lewis had recommended withholding votes for lead independent director John Thompson, who is also leading the CEO search committee. Glass Lewis expressed concern that Thompson is the CEO of startup Virtual Instruments Inc., which received $2.3 million from Microsoft in fiscal 2013 for software and equipment. Glass Lewis considered this a conflict of interest. &lt;/p&gt;

They asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Brian Marchiony, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. authorities are examining whether New York-based JPMorgan violated anti-bribery laws by hiring the children and other relatives of well-connected politicians and clients in China so that their family members would steer business to the firm, a person with knowledge of the investigation said in August. JPMorgan said it was cooperating with the probes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in May requested records from JPMorgan concerning Tang Xiaoning, the son of China Everbright Group Chairman Tang Shuangning, the New York Times reported in August, citing a confidential government document. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related News:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Henry Bath  Son Ltd., the
commodities warehouse unit of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) that it wants

jumped 24 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit dropped from $27.7 million a year earlier due to tax
changes, Liverpool, England-based Henry Bath said in a filing
with the U.K.&#8217;s Companies House. Before taxes, profit rose to
$42.57 million from $34.19 million. Revenue rose to $148.96
million from $120.28 million. The company provides storage for
cocoa, coffee and metal stockpiles. &lt;/p&gt;

to get out of the business of owning and trading physical
commodities. The firm could sell or spin off holdings that
include Henry Bath, as well as stakes in power plants and
traders in materials such as gas and coal. The New York-based
firm has sought $3.3 billion for the division, a person with
direct knowledge of the sale process said last month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Draper Fisher Jurvetson-backed
Bharat Light  Power Pvt. and International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) are combining efforts to boost the electricity output of
wind farms in India, seeking to expand capacity fivefold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under a 10-year agreement, IBM&#8217;s technology will raise the
profitability of Bharat Light projects by better managing wind-farm data, said Balki Iyer, chief development officer of the
renewable developer founded by the former country head of
General Electric Co. (GE), Tejpreet S. Chopra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clean-energy utilities such as Bharat Light and Morgan
Stanley-backed Continuum Wind Energy Pte are sparking a shift in
India&#8217;s wind industry by focusing on maximizing generation as
they compete against fossil-fuel plants to deliver power. India,
fighting blackouts that restrain its growth, is trying to cut
dependence on imported fossil fuels and double clean energy
capacity to about 59 gigawatts by 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These projects are usually located in very remote parts
of India and the level of intelligence dispatched from the field
is low,&#8221; Iyer said today in a phone interview. The
collaboration with IBM will allow Bharat Light to generate power
at levels &#8220;way beyond&#8221; what wind farms, often managed by
turbine suppliers in India, currently can do, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wind farms are already able to supply power at the same
cost or cheaper than new coal-fired plants in some Indian
states. That trend was helped by falling turbine prices, down a
quarter from their 2009 peak amid global oversupply, as well as
newer machines that produce more power at lower wind speeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Operational Efficiencies &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is only so much you can do to improve existing
turbines,&#8221; Iyer said. In contrast, raising the operational
efficiency of remote wind farms by just 1 percent can lead to a
&#8220;huge&#8221; increase in revenue. Continuum Wind Chief Executive
Officer Arvind Bansal said Oct. 29 that generation losses at
Indian wind projects can be reduced from 6 percent to less than
1 percent by managing assets better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clean-energy utilities such as Bharat Light, backed by
Menlo Park, California-based venture capital firm Draper Fisher
Jurvetson, which bet early on such companies as Skype Inc., and
Continuum are expanding faster than traditional wind-farm
investors that are exiting the market after the expiration of a
tax break. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of India&#8217;s 20,000 megawatts of wind capacity was built
claiming tax breaks, leading to small holdings that owners often
allowed to rust and idle once the depreciation benefits were
claimed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s technology will also help Bharat Light comply more
easily with a government directive on July 15 that ordered wind
farms to forecast day-ahead power output or face fines, Iyer
said. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s ReNew Wind Power Pvt. and Tata
Power Co. (TPWR) say the rule would wipe out industry profits because
it&#8217;s too difficult to meet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asset Acquisitions? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s fragmented wind industry is ripe for mergers and
acquisitions as indebted companies such as property developer
DLF Ltd. and truck maker Ashok Leyland sell off wind portfolios
built for tax breaks, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.
Such assets can be bought for less than half the cost of
building a new wind farm, according to Mumbai-based developer
Ushdev Power Holdings Pvt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bharat Light owns about 200 megawatts of operating wind
farms, including 150 megawatts of capacity acquired from DLF in
July. It plans to diversify into solar, biomass and hydropower
to reach 1,000 megawatts in five years through acquisitions and
by building projects, Iyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developer is in talks with potential overseas investors
to help fund that growth, he said, declining to elaborate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is combining efforts with Bharat Light in &#8220;a sunrise
industry,&#8221; Ajoy Menon, a director at IBM in India, said by
phone. &#8220;We&#8217;re betting on renewables.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CLP Holdings Ltd. (2), Hong Kong&#8217;s
biggest electricity provider, recorded its largest acquisition
after agreeing to pay HK$14 billion ($1.8 billion) for stakes in
two Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CLP will pay HK$12 billion for a 30 percent stake in Castle
Peak Power Co., which owns three plants in Hong Kong, the
company said today in a statement. It will also pay HK$2 billion
for a 51 percent stake in Exxon&#8217;s Hong Kong Pumped Storage
Development Co. Exxon will also sell a 30 percent stake in
Castle Peak to China Southern Power Grid Co., owner of China&#8217;s
second largest power distribution network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal tops CLP&#8217;s $1.69 billion purchase of Australian
natural gas and electricity assets in 2005 from Singapore Power
Ltd., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. CLP doesn&#8217;t
expect the transaction to affect customer bills in the near
term, CLP Vice Chairman Betty Yuen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The purchase will improve the operation of our generation
business and the integration with power distribution,&#8221; Yuen
said today at a media conference in Hong Kong. &#8220;It&#8217;ll also
increase our cooperation with China Southern and could create
opportunities for partnerships in the future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CLP gained 0.7 percent to HK$62.15 at the close in Hong
Kong, while the benchmark Hang Seng Index was little changed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., which is planning to break off its buyout unit, is in talks to sell about $4 billion of private-equity stakes to an investor group, said three people familiar with the situation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The potential buyers examining the holdings include Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Coller Capital Ltd., Lexington Partners, HarbourVest Partners LLC, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Ardian, said two of the people. They asked not to be named because the talks are private. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The investor group would also provide capital for new deals to One Equity Partners, the private-equity arm of JPMorgan that&#8217;s in the process of becoming an independent firm. The business, which used to invest the bank&#8217;s own money, will begin raising its next fund from an external group of investors, the bank said in June. JPMorgan joins banks including Credit Suisse Group AG and Citigroup Inc. in cutting back private-equity holdings to focus on its main businesses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tasha Pelio, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined to comment, as did officials for the investment firms. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Citigroup, the third-biggest U.S. lender, agreed in September to sell its emerging-markets private-equity unit to the Rohatyn Group to comply with new curbs on bank investments. Credit Suisse, Switzerland&#8217;s second-biggest bank, in February struck a deal to sell its stake in the first fund of Global Infrastructure Partners to Lexington Partners Inc., according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The bank in August agreed to sell its private-equity, infrastructure and real estate investment business to Grosvenor Capital Management LP. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., (MSFT) the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, filed a lawsuit today claiming patent-licensing
firm Acacia Research Corp. breached a contract between the two
companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint was filed today under seal in federal court
in Manhattan and a public copy wasn&#8217;t available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acacia, which buys patents to generate a profit from
licensing revenue, filed seven lawsuits last month against
Microsoft in Delaware, Illinois and Texas. In the past, the two
companies have reached agreements, including a 2011 deal over e-mail messaging and one in 2010 over patents for smartphone
technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Acacia&#8217;s lawsuits are the worst kind of abusive
litigation behavior, attempting to extract payment based on
litigation tactics and not the value of its patents,&#8221; Microsoft
Deputy General Counsel David Howard said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acacia, which reported $115.5 million in sales for the
first three quarters, doesn&#8217;t sue in its own name, though it has
filed hundreds of lawsuits. Instead, it forms a unit to handle a
specific portfolio and then the unit -- named for the technology
it covers -- files the suits. In its annual report, the Newport
Beach, California-based company said it had 143 &#8220;technology
licensing programs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuits filed in October against Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft include one for light-emitting panel assemblies
and another for a way to control the use of licensed software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam Handelsman, a spokesman or Acacia, had no immediate
comment on the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Troll Suits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government Accountability Office found that 19 percent
of all patent lawsuits filed between 2007 and 2011 were by
companies often derided as trolls, whose sole business is to buy
up patents and then demand royalties. With changes in
legislation that limited the number of defendants in a single
suit, that number increased even more in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress is considering proposals that would limit some
litigation practices by patent-licensing firms. The provisions
being considered include a requirement that patent owners
provide more details about both what the patent covers and how
its infringed, disclose who benefits financially from the
litigation, and make the loser in a case pay the winner&#8217;s legal
costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Microsoft Corp. v. Acacia Research Corp. (ACTG), 13-cv-8275, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bill Gates should serve as Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s chief executive officer for a year as the software company he co-founded seeks a replacement for Steve Ballmer, according to Charles Schwab. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest software maker is seeking a new leader after Ballmer said in August that he would retire within a year. The management change is happening as Microsoft adopts a new corporate structure focused on devices and services. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gates should return to revamp Microsoft&#8217;s culture, Schwab said. Warren Buffett, the billionaire chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and confidant of the software maker&#8217;s chairman, has ruled out the possibility of a return, and Gates isn&#8217;t being considered for the role, people with knowledge of the matter have said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think it would behoove Gates to go back for at least a year,&#8221; Schwab, the chairman of Charles Schwab Corp., said today at The Year Ahead: 2014 conference hosted by Bloomberg LP in Chicago. &#8220;He&#8217;s the only guy who can really reshape the cultural aspects. Otherwise the organization will spit anybody out, anybody coming in.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gates, who was Microsoft&#8217;s CEO until Ballmer took over in 2000, said at a shareholder meeting yesterday that he and other directors have met with &#8220;a lot of CEO candidates.&#8221; The board is aiming to narrow the list of CEO candidates to three to five, a person with knowledge of the matter said last week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve should lower its jobless-rate threshold for raising interest rates to 5.5 percent if it takes both the unemployment and participation rates into account, keeping its main interest rate lower for longer, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. research. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The analysis updates a study Goldman Sachs published earlier this month by factoring in the labor force participation rate rather than simply addressing unemployment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Taking into account adverse supply side effects -- by aiming to normalize both the unemployment and participation rates -- strengthens the case for lowering the 6.5 percent unemployment threshold,&#8221; economists led by Jan Hatzius say in the note written by Sven Jari Stehn and dated Nov. 19. &#8220;Our small model suggests that the most desirable unemployment threshold in this case would be around 5.5 percent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study builds on papers presented by Fed officials earlier in November. William English, head of the Division of Monetary Affairs, wrote that the strategy of not raising interest rates if unemployment is above 6.5 percent has provided useful stimulus and suggested an even lower threshold could be effective. David Wilcox, the research and statistics chief, argued for loose policy amid contained inflation expectations and high labor slack, noting that &#8220;participation appears to have moved noticeably lower.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s previous analysis, which looked at English&#8217;s work, found that a threshold of 6 percent would deliver &#8220;the best combination of a stronger recovery and modest inflation.&#8221; The update takes into account &#8220;the supply side mechanisms of the Wilcox paper,&#8221; the economists wrote. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the Fed tried to address the entire employment picture by taking into account a measure of the so-called participation gap, the Fed&#8217;s policy rate would be on hold until mid-2016, they found. In that case, a 5.5 percent jobless rate threshold is best, the Goldman Sachs economists wrote. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our analysis suggests that taking into account that weak aggregate demand might have adverse effects on labor supply strengthens the case for lowering the 6.5% unemployment threshold,&#8221; they said in the paper. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Andrea Tan" date="Nov 20, 2013 11:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-20/goldman-seeks-to-halt-singapore-tycoon-yen-real-lawsuit.html"><headline>Goldman Seeks to Halt Singapore Tycoon Yen-Real Lawsuit</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. unit asked a court to halt Singapore tycoon Oei Hong Leong&#8217;s lawsuit over losses after he was allegedly misled into making leveraged trades that the yen would fall against the Brazilian real. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs International said in a Nov. 6 filing with the Singapore High Court that proceedings should be suspended in favor of private and confidential arbitration. Court papers detailing reasons aren&#8217;t publicly accessible. A closed hearing is scheduled for tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oei, who in 2009 settled a claim against Citigroup Inc. over S$1 billion ($804 million) in trading losses, accused Goldman Sachs in his Sept. 20 lawsuit of making fraudulent representations that the real was a stable and liquid currency anchored to the U.S. dollar. He&#8217;s seeking $31.7 million in trading losses, plus interest. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will defend Oei&#8217;s lawsuit, which is without merit, Hong Kong-based spokesman Edward Naylor said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oei will challenge Goldman Sachs&#8217;s arbitration bid, his lawyer, Siraj Omar, said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Oei&#8217;s position is that the Singapore court is the proper place to decide the claim, especially since the misrepresentation that he is complaining about occurred in Singapore,&#8221; Omar said. &#8220;He sees no basis for moving this to confidential arbitration in London.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s record $13
billion deal to end probes into mortgage-bond sales may save the
bank billions more because of what the agreement lacked: an
explicit admission of wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees of JPMorgan and two firms it acquired knew some
of the loans included in bonds didn&#8217;t meet underwriting
standards, a fact not shared with buyers of those securities,
the U.S. Justice Department said yesterday in a statement. That
doesn&#8217;t mean the company misled investors, said Chief Financial
Officer Marianne Lake, disputing how some state and federal
officials characterized the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, sought to end one of the
largest legal uncertainties it faced without providing fodder to
private litigants. The firm is still the subject of Justice
Department probes into its energy-trading business, recruiting
practices in Asia and its relationship with Ponzi scheme
operator Bernard Madoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;ve left themselves some wiggle room to say, &#8216;No we

prosecutor and Securities and Exchange Commission attorney who

least some acknowledgment that there were improprieties, but
exactly what they were remains open, and certainly they can deny
it in any specific case.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years the public has vented about half-baked government settlements in which corporations and white-collar defendants &#8220;neither admit nor deny&#8221; the allegations against them. The Justice Department wasn&#8217;t about to go down that path when it unveiled its big, not-really-$13 billion deal this week with JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So the government made a few sly tweaks. The result is a mutant offspring of the no-admit genre that may be even less satisfying than the parent. JPMorgan didn&#8217;t have to admit to any violations of the law. And here&#8217;s the rub: The Justice Department didn&#8217;t allege any, either. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the settlement agreement, the bank will pay a civil penalty &#8220;pursuant to&#8221; a statute called the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act. However, the Justice Department didn&#8217;t lodge any claims against JPMorgan for breaking that law or any other. This was an out-of-court settlement. The Justice Department didn&#8217;t file a complaint. No judge&#8217;s approval was needed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The agreement did incorporate an 11-page statement of facts that explained in vague terms what JPMorgan did. Yet none of the acknowledgments by JPMorgan in that document hurt the bank. JPMorgan didn&#8217;t admit liability or even any mistakes. That&#8217;s no better than the old &#8220;neither admit nor deny&#8221; boilerplate. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;No Justice &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This isn&#8217;t justice. It&#8217;s more like the greenmail that companies sometimes pay to corporate raiders who demand premium prices for their shares in exchange for going away. No individuals got pinched. We don&#8217;t know much about the details of what the Justice Department&#8217;s investigation found. It&#8217;s unclear why prosecutors didn&#8217;t accuse JPMorgan of fraud, although one possible explanation is that the government lacks proof. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The wording of the settlement agreement was awkward at times, too. It said the Justice Department had investigated the mortgage-bond operations of JPMorgan and two failing companies that it bought: Bear Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual Inc. &#8220;Based on those investigations, the United States believes that there is an evidentiary basis to compromise potential legal claims by the United States against JPMorgan, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, for violation of federal laws,&#8221; the agreement said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That line makes it seem like the U.S. doubted its own case, although perhaps it was just poorly drafted. The sentence would have made more sense if it said there was enough evidence to &#8220;bring&#8221; claims against JPMorgan, not &#8220;compromise&#8221; them. Maybe the prosecutors were trying to say they believed there was sufficient evidence to merit a settlement. But that doesn&#8217;t make much sense, either: The act of settling speaks for itself. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As an aside, it&#8217;s fitting that Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley took part in the same accord. Of the $13 billion headline figure -- which combined the Justice Department&#8217;s $2 billion penalty with the amounts secured by several state and federal agencies -- the settlement agreement earmarked about $34 million for Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2009, Coakley took a similar claim-free approach to squeeze money from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Her office didn&#8217;t file a lawsuit or allege that Goldman Sachs violated any statutes or rules. Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t admit anything, either. But it did pay $60 million to make the Massachusetts investigation go away. Coakley&#8217;s office had been looking into Goldman Sachs&#8217;s packaging of subprime mortgage bonds. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Surely some of the money that JPMorgan shells out will go to good use. Yet something important is lost when law-enforcement officials strike bargains with powerful corporations behind closed doors and fail to be transparent about what their investigations uncovered. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Justice Department said this week that the settlement &#8220;does not absolve JPMorgan or its employees from facing any possible criminal charges.&#8221; By this point, though, it&#8217;s hard to take the Justice Department seriously when it says to stay tuned. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Not Really &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The department also said that &#8220;JPMorgan acknowledged it made serious misrepresentations to the public&#8221; as part of the agreed-upon statement of facts. Actually, it did no such thing. The document didn&#8217;t use the word &#8220;misrepresentation&#8221; or similar language to describe any of JPMorgan&#8217;s actions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Usually when corporations settle with the Justice Department, they agree not to contradict the government&#8217;s assertions publicly. Yet on this occasion JPMorgan felt compelled to set the record straight. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t say that we acknowledge serious misrepresentation of the facts,&#8221; JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said during a Nov. 19 conference call. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She was right: The Justice Department overreached in its characterization. It isn&#8217;t a good sign when the company paying billions of dollars to resolve a government probe comes across as more believable than the government lawyers who cut the deal. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(Jonathan Weil is a Bloomberg View columnist.) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Tom Schoenberg" date="Nov 21, 2013  4:36 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-21/jpmorgan-deal-offers-turning-point-for-attorney-general-holder.html"><headline>JPMorgan Deal Offers Turning Point for Eric Holder</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department&#8217;s $13 billion
mortgage securities settlement with JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is a
record and also a rarity -- Attorney General Eric Holder&#8217;s first
big win against a bank at the heart of 2008&#8217;s financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Holder, the part of the deal announced this week that
requires the bank to pay $9 billion to resolve allegations it
knowingly sold bad mortgage securities is a potential turning
point after a tenure studded with controversy.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several more announcements are on the way to bring
financial institutions to account, Holder has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You have to wait until we are finished with all the work
that we will do,&#8221; Holder said in an interview. &#8220;When we get to
that point you will see that we have taken the mandate that we
were given seriously, that we held people accountable, that we
held institutions accountable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan deal has its critics. Some say it&#8217;s too tough
on the bank after the government called it in to take over Bear
Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual Bank when they failed. Others
say Holder hasn&#8217;t gone far enough, because he hasn&#8217;t brought
criminal charges against bankers. Several lawmakers and others
have faulted the deal for leaving open the possibility that the
bank could write off a portion of the penalties, essentially
passing some of the burden to taxpayers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the Wall
Street firm with the biggest revenue decline last quarter, said
its currency trading business didn&#8217;t incur a loss in the period
as the bank sought to clarify a figure in a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman Sachs did not suffer a loss in our currencies
business in the third quarter,&#8221; Michael DuVally, a spokesman
for the New York-based bank, said today in an e-mailed
statement. &#8220;Gains or losses in one product type frequently
offset gains or losses in other product types.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reuters reported earlier today that the bank posted more
than $1 billion in market-making losses on currency products in
the third quarter, citing U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission and Federal Reserve filings. Goldman Sachs said in
its quarterly SEC filing on Nov. 7 that the figure isn&#8217;t 
representative of how it manages the business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The filing discloses market-making revenue from different
products. Each product&#8217;s revenue can include gains or losses
that are booked in another business, such as a commodity deal
that&#8217;s hedged with currency swaps. The figure also excludes
trading commissions and net interest income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mortgages, Commodities &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the SEC asked Goldman Sachs to disclose
how much products such as mortgages and commodities contribute
to its trading revenue to give investors more clarity on how the
firm makes most of its money. The SEC completed its review after
the firm responded that it would give more &#8220;qualitative
disclosure&#8221; and already had provided the market-making figures
by product. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gold, iron ore, soybeans and copper will probably drop at least 15 percent next year as commodities face increased downside risks even as economic growth in the U.S. accelerates, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The risks are strongest for iron ore and follow increases in supplies, analysts including Jeffrey Currie wrote in a report yesterday that identified the New York-based bank&#8217;s top 10 market themes for the coming year. Price pressures will mostly become visible later in 2014, the analysts wrote, forecasting that bullion, copper and soybeans will decline to the lowest levels since 2010. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Commodities tracked by the Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI Index lost 4.7 percent this year, led by corn as supplies surged, and precious metals on expectations the Federal Reserve will taper stimulus. Goldman described the forecast losses for iron ore, gold, soybeans and copper as significant, and said that they could help weaken currencies in producing countries, including the Australian dollar and South African rand. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Last year, we pointed to the ongoing shift in our commodity views, ultimately towards downside price risk,&#8221; the analysts including Currie wrote. &#8220;The impact of supply responses to the period of extraordinary price pressure continues to flow through the system.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alstom SA, the French builder of trains and power plants, has mandated Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to explore a sale of its air preheaters and gas-gas heaters unit, according to people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The business may draw interest from private-equity companies, said two of the people, who declined to be identified as the plan is not public. The unit has annual sales of between 400 million euros and 500 million euros ($671 million), said two of the people. More information will be sent to potential bidders in coming weeks, they said. Representatives for Alstom and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The products, made in the German cities of Mannheim and Dusseldorf, are used by power plants and boiler companies, according to Alstom&#8217;s website. While air preheaters are directly involved in the power-generation process, gas-gas heaters are used in the flue gas cleaning process. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alstom, based in Levallois-Perret near Paris, said this month it will deepen a cost-cutting drive and sell as much as 2 billion euros in assets by the end of 2014 as it seeks to sustain profit. Possible disposals include a minority stake in train and railway-equipment unit Alstom Transport that may attract industry and private-equity buyers, it said Nov. 6. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Venture Plans &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alstom shares reversed losses and gained as much as 1 percent in Paris intraday trading after Bloomberg News reported the potential sale of the preheaters and gas-gas heaters unit. The stock was up 0.5 percent as of 11:22 a.m., valuing the company at 8.3 billion euros. Before today, the stock had dropped 11 percent this year, while the French benchmark CAC 40 index gained 17 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2011, Alstom and China&#8217;s Shanghai Electric Group Co. announced a plan to create a joint venture to sell boilers for coal-fired power plants and spare parts for services. The talks about that venture are &#8220;in a coma,&#8221; Alstom Chief Executive Officer Patrick Kron said this month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company also plans to reduce costs by as much as 1.5 billion euros by April 2016 as demand for gas turbines weakens and pricing pressure hurts profit from onshore wind turbines and power-transmission gear. The manufacturer plans to cut 1,300 jobs, mainly in Europe. The reductions will affect the information-technology department and the boiler unit, and may be extended to other operations if needed, Kron has said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s Investors Service in June cut Alstom&#8217;s long-term credit rating by one level to Baa3, the lowest investment grade. Standard  Poor&#8217;s, which gives Alstom debt its second-lowest investment rating of BBB, has said it may make a similar move. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Adam Ewing" date="Nov 21, 2013  4:21 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-21/microsoft-to-take-over-nokia-s-landmark-headquarters.html"><headline>Microsoft to Take Over Nokia&#8217;s Landmark Headquarters</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. will take over Nokia
Oyj (NOK1V)&#8217;s glass-walled headquarters, one of Finland&#8217;s best-known
buildings, once the software giant&#8217;s deal to buy the Finnish
company&#8217;s mobile-phone business is completed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia will move to a location further away from central
Helsinki, to a campus where its network-equipment business is
based, James Etheridge, a spokesman for the Finnish company,
said today in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft gains occupancy of a landmark complex whose
construction in the 1990s symbolized Nokia&#8217;s rise into Finland&#8217;s
first major global corporation. The building, just outside
Helsinki in Espoo, is by the shore and offers expansive views to
the Baltic Sea from its meeting rooms. It is situated on a busy
highway between Finland&#8217;s two biggest cities and is seen by tens
of thousands of commuters every day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Karaportti campus, where Nokia will move, is further
inland in Espoo and resembles more of a traditional industrial
estate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia&#8217;s shareholders agreed this week to sell its device
unit to Microsoft in a 5.44 billion-euro ($7.3 billion) deal.
The majority of workers in the current head office, which Nokia
sold last year and leased back to cut costs, work for the unit
to be acquired by Microsoft. Nokia is renovating a building at
the Karaportti campus for its future use, Etheridge said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s not often that a city known for its 7 a.m. breakfast meetings and workaholic residents also gains renown as a premier party town. Yet in Medellin, Colombia, the paradox begins to make sense very late on a raucous Friday night, when I find myself in a packed nightclub discussing the finer points of entrepreneurialism and urban planning between shots of 60-proof aguardiente. And that&#8217;s before I&#8217;m hugged by a mustachioed dwarf in a mariachi outfit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Until recently, Medellin hasn&#8217;t had a whole lot to offer in the way of nocturnal amusements or legitimate business deals, Bloomberg Pursuits magazine will report in its Holiday 2013 issue. Police curfews often kept people inside their high-security homes, and the most significant commercial transactions tended to involve large amounts of cocaine. The city was the longtime stronghold of Pablo Escobar and his Medellin cartel, which once controlled the majority of the cocaine shipped illegally into the U.S. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More from the new issue of Bloomberg Pursuits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s Pixar studio is
eliminating jobs after deciding to delay next year&#8217;s theatrical
release &#8220;The Good Dinosaur.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cuts amount to less than 5 percent of Pixar&#8217;s 1,200
employees, according to a person with knowledge of the matter
who wasn&#8217;t authorized to speak publicly and requested anonymity.
That&#8217;s fewer than than 60 positions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are constantly re-evaluating the creative and business
needs of our studio,&#8221; Emeryville, California-based Pixar said
in a statement, without providing specific numbers. &#8220;With the
release date change of &#8216;The Good Dinosaur,&#8217; we have realigned
our production and support priorities, which includes a small
reduction in our staffing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to delay &#8220;The Good Dinosaur&#8221; for 18 months
left the animation studio that produced &#8220;Toy Story&#8221; and
&#8220;Cars&#8221; without an annual release for the first time since
2005. Disney announced the later date in September and said in
October it would close a Vancouver facility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Good Dinosaur,&#8221; about a 70-foot-tall teenage
Apatosaurus that befriends a young boy, was pushed back to Nov.
25, 2015, Disney said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, rose 0.4 percent to
$70.20 at 4 p.m. in New York, an all-time closing high. The
stock has gained 41 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pixar&#8217;s most-recent release, &#8220;Monsters University,&#8221; has

&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Chandler-Saunders buys Doc McStuffins toys because the Walt Disney Co. (DIS) character teaches her two-year-old daughter to care for others. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;My daughter fell in love with Doc right away,&#8221; said Chandler-Saunders, who nabbed a $35 Doc McStuffins medical kit from Toys &#8220;R&#8221; Us Inc. after the toy topped her daughter&#8217;s Christmas list. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dottie &#8220;Doc&#8221; McStuffins, a six-year-old aspiring physician who treats her toys with help from her dragon and snowman friends, is making most-popular lists this season. The doll is already flying off store shelves, say retailers, which sell about $10 billion worth of toys in the fourth quarter or about half the annual total, according to researcher NPD. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Based on &#8220;Doc McStuffins,&#8221; Disney Junior channel&#8217;s animated hit show, the dolls are vying with toys inspired by Viacom Inc. (VIAB)&#8217;s Dora The Explorer character, long the undisputed queen of the toddler set. For parents like Chandler-Saunders, Doc&#8217;s skin color enhances the appeal. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m Caucasian, and the doll is black, so it&#8217;s kind of cool kids can look up to someone&#8221; of another race, said the 35-year-old mother of two, who runs her own insurance agency in Jetersville, Virginia. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doc McStuffins&#8217;s rapid ascent since debuting last year is something of a departure for an industry that has a tendency to reboot old brands. Exhibit A: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which debuted in the 1980s and was revived last year as a line of toys and a Nickelodeon series, is a top pick for boys this year, according to hot-toy lists. Another familiar friend is Hasbro Inc. (HAS)&#8217;s Big Hugs Elmo, the latest incarnation of the fuzzy Sesame Street character, which industry analysts predict also will be a top seller this holiday-shopping season. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Insufficient Inventory &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last year, McStuffins&#8217;s popularity took some retailers by surprise, leaving them with insufficient inventory, said Jim Silver, editor-in-chief of toy review website Time to Play. The shortage prompted moms to hit websites such as EBay Inc. (EBAY) where they spent double the toy&#8217;s $10 retail price, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s stock rose 0.4 percent to $70.20 at the close in New York. The shares have gained 41 percent this year, while the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index has advanced 27 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This year retailers are prepared. Disney&#8217;s top four U.S. retail accounts, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), Target Corp., Toys &#8220;R&#8221; Us and Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD)&#8217;s Kmart, have on average quadrupled the shelf space given to McStuffins from last holidays, said J.D. Edwards, senior vice president of licensing for Disney Consumer Products. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Quick Greenlight &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doc McStuffins appeals to a wide range of demographics, said Jennifer Dominiquini, Sears chief marketing officer for fitness, sporting goods and toys. &#8220;It addresses that human need for nurturing. It&#8217;s a perfect recipe for success.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Disney executives were pitched Doc McStuffins in 2008, they greenlighted the show quickly because it introduced the concept of nurturing to children&#8217;s television. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was almost like one of those &#8216;duh why didn&#8217;t we think of this before&#8217; moments,&#8221; said Nancy Kanter, executive vice president of original programming and general manager of Disney Junior Worldwide. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company made one key switch: changing the family&#8217;s race from white to black. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Diverse Brand &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s important to us that the brand and the content represents the world as kids live it and see it and that is a world that&#8217;s very diverse,&#8221; Kanter said. &#8220;Just the notion that for some kids this will look exactly like their families and for others it will look like what they see in their neighborhoods.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This year, Disney added a range of accessories, including clothes, bedding and even Doc McStuffins Band-Aids from Johnson  Johnson. The company is also releasing toys aimed at boys, including a blue rather than pink check-up kit because the show&#8217;s viewers are almost evenly split between boys and girls. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The brand&#8217;s growth helped more than double retail sales of Disney Junior products to $1.8 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 28, Edwards said. He declined to give specific data for Doc McStuffins. Success in the toy division is important to Disney because the unit generates high-margin sales on characters already created by other businesses. Consumer products accounted for 10 percent of profit in the most recent fiscal year, while making up 7.9 percent of total company sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Toy Fads &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hot holiday toys come and go. That&#8217;s why toymakers rush to add bells and whistles to keep kids interested. In September, for example, Viacom released the Dora Sizzling Surprises Kitchen and Spin  Skate Dora and Boots. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ten years running Dora remains a beloved property and is doing very well for us this holiday,&#8221; said Dan Martinsen, a spokesman for Viacom&#8217;s Nickelodeon networks. &#8220;Dora continues to be a trailblazer and has a long, bright future ahead of her.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For now, Doc&#8217;s race and her TV family&#8217;s reversal of gender roles -- mom is a doctor; dad stays home -- has strong appeal for some parents, said Laurie Schacht, chief executive officer of &#8220;The Toy Book,&#8221; a trade publication. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It makes it more real, and more interesting,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Whether we&#8217;re talking about color or women, everyone has come a long way, and it&#8217;s nice to see that in our kids .&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Such distinctions are beside the point for toddlers, who relate to the story and character -- not what makes adults feel good, said Nancy Zwiers, a former marketing executive for Mattel Inc. Parents&#8217; discomfort with sexy Bratz fashion dolls didn&#8217;t prevent MGA Entertainment Co. from building a billion-dollar business. The Barbie brand hasn&#8217;t suffered from complaints that the doll&#8217;s unrealistic proportions may hurt girls&#8217; self-esteem. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Emotional Choices &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We adults like to overlay our perspective on things, and that&#8217;s not the way kids make choices,&#8221; said Zwiers, who now does brand consulting for toy and entertainment companies, including Disney. &#8220;Kids are making choices emotionally.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doc McStuffins, who once soothed a bubble bottle character&#8217;s stomach ache after it was accidentally filled with paste instead of soap, is seen as a role model. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She &#8220;teaches manners and how to be respectful and how to be nice toward others,&#8221; said Chandler-Saunders. &#8220;That&#8217;s hard to teach children.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Saijel Kishan and Joshua Fineman" date="Nov 22, 2013  4:18 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-22/druckenmiller-shorting-ibm-in-bet-cloud-computing-to-win.html"><headline>Druckenmiller Shorting IBM in Bet Cloud Computing to Win</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Stan Druckenmiller, who has one of
the best track records in the hedge-fund industry over the past
three decades, said he&#8217;s betting against the shares of
International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) because the company&#8217;s
business will be replaced by technology such as cloud computing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s one of the more higher-probability shorts I have
seen in years,&#8221; Druckenmiller, 60, said in an interview with
Bloomberg TV&#8217;s Stephanie Ruhle at the Robin Hood Investors
Conference in New York today. &#8220;IBM is old technology being
replaced by cloud technology.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM fell 1.9 percent to $180.53 at 3:07 p.m. in New York.
James Sciales, a spokesman for Armonk, New York-based IBM,
didn&#8217;t immediately respond a phone call and e-mail requesting
comment on Druckenmiller&#8217; wager. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s sales have dropped for six straight quarters as the
growth of services such as cloud computing have failed to make
up for slowing demand for older businesses like hardware. The
company is selling less-profitable divisions and is devoting
cash to stock repurchases to help reach its forecast for growth
in earnings per share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM said last month that it added $15 billion to its
buyback plan, part of Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty&#8217;s

&lt;p&gt;MBIA Inc. (MBI) didn&#8217;t even read a report
the bond insurer says was altered to hide deficiencies in a
$1.16 billion pool of mortgages until a week after it agreed to
insure the loans, attorneys for JPMorgan Chase  Co. told a New
York state judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for JPMorgan asked state Supreme Court Justice Alan
D. Scheinkman in White Plains to throw out a lawsuit filed
against the bank by MBIA last year accusing its Bear Stearns
unit of inducing the insurer to back the pool by removing
information from a report showing underwriting and compliance
problems with the loans in the pool. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) put its
uranium trading unit up for sale as prices for the radioactive
metal fall and regulatory scrutiny of banks&#8217; commodity
activities increases, a person briefed on the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person asked not to be identified because the decision
hasn&#8217;t been made public. SparkSpread, an online energy
publication, reported the move earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices for uranium have declined since Japan&#8217;s Fukushima
nuclear disaster, which eroded demand for the metal as nations
shuttered reactors. Banks from JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) to UBS AG
have cut their price outlooks for next year as the radiation
leaks fan speculation that the restart of Japan&#8217;s idled plants
will take longer than expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve is reviewing companies including
Goldman Sachs as U.S. lawmakers and regulators raise concerns
that banks might abuse their various roles in physical
commodities markets for their own benefit, or that the
businesses pose risks to the firms&#8217; financial stability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank received inquiries from potential buyers for its
aluminum warehousing company, Metro International Trade Services
LLC, a person briefed on the matter said this week. New York-based Goldman Sachs bought Metro as a merchant banking
investment in 2010 and must sell it by 2020. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the world&#8217;s second-largest non-state energy company by market value, said its
Rosebank oil discovery off the coast of Scotland would be
unprofitable to bring into production at this time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron plans to continue evaluating the 240 million-barrel
field along with partners OMV AG (OMV) and Dong Energy A/S for ways to
improve the project&#8217;s potential returns, the San Ramon,
California-based company said in an e-mailed statement today. A
final decision on whether to proceed will be made next year,
according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosebank&#8217;s unprofitability is a blow to U.K and Norwegian
efforts to halt the slide in North Sea oil output as fields
first drilled in the 1970s and 1980s near the end of their
productive lifespans. Dropping North Sea supplies are expected
to drive a 15 percent decline in European crude and gas liquids
production by 2018, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries said in its annual world outlook on Nov. 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosebank &#8220;does not currently offer an economic value
proposition that justifies proceeding with an investment of this
magnitude,&#8221; Chevron said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron and its partners hired South Korea&#8217;s Hyundai Heavy
Industries (009540) Co. Ltd. in April to construct a $1.9 billion
platform that could offload crude directly to tankers, Hyundai
said in a Nov. 15 slide presentation. The vessel would have
capacity to draw 100,000 barrels of oil and 190 million standard
cubic feet of gas daily from the seafloor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron hasn&#8217;t disclosed any cost estimates for the total
development. Rosebank is located 80 miles (130 kilometers)
northwest of the Shetland Islands and 3,700 feet (1,130 meters)
beneath the sea surface. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron discovered Rosebank in 2004 and owns a 40 percent
stake. OMV owns 50 percent and Dong holds a 10 percent interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. is the largest oil company by market
value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)&#8217;s HIV drug
Tivicay was recommended for approval by the European Union&#8217;s
drug regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tivicay won the backing of the Committee for Medicinal
Products for Human Use in combination with other antiretroviral
medicines for the treatment of HIV patients over the age of 12,
the European Medicines Agency said in a statement today. The
drug was developed by ViiV Healthcare Ltd., Glaxo&#8217;s venture with
two other drugmakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treatment, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration in August, reduced the HIV virus to undetectable
levels in more people than Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD)&#8217;s Atripla, the
world&#8217;s best-selling AIDS drug, in a clinical trial released
last year. The medicine, also known as dolutegravir, is an
integrase strand transfer inhibitor that interferes with the
enzymes necessary for HIV to multiply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck  Co. makes the first and only other approved
integrase strand transfer inhibitor, Isentress, which was
cleared in 2007 and had sales of $1.5 billion last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ViiV is an independent company that is a venture of Glaxo,
New York-based Pfizer Inc. and Osaka, Japan-based drugmaker
Shionogi  Co. Glaxo owns 76.5 percent of ViiV while Pfizer has
a 13.5 percent stake and Shionogi holds 10 percent, according to
Glaxo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EMA&#8217;s recommendations are the final stage before the
European Commission, the EU&#8217;s executive arm, approves or rejects
a drug for sale to patients in the 28-nation region. The EC
usually follows the committee&#8217;s advice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s (JPM) record $13
billion deal to end mortgage bond probes has terms that
undermine U.S. efforts to reduce taxpayer support of the market,
according to BlackRock Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest money manager. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Washington has a public policy goal of reducing the role
that the government plays in the housing-finance market, and at
the same time we now have a series of settlements where no
investors were at the table and where money toward the
settlements may come from investors&#8217; pockets,&#8221; said Barbara Novick, vice chairman of BlackRock. &#8220;It discourages the
allocation of private capital to mortgage credit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan struck the agreement this week to settle potential
state and federal civil claims of misrepresentations in
mortgage-bond sales by the lender and companies it acquired. The
largest U.S. bank can earn credit toward meeting $4 billion of
consumer relief required by the deal through reworking mortgages
owned by investors in the securities, potentially harming
holders, according to Novick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock (BLK), which oversees $4.1 trillion, and other buyers
of mortgage bonds without government backing have criticized
multiple federal and local actions in the wake of the U.S.
housing crash as unfair to investors, saying they deter
participation in the $9.3 trillion home-mortgage market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Best Interest&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With taxpayer-backed programs financing about 85 percent of
new home loans, issuance of non-agency bonds is about 1 percent
of the record level reached in 2005 and 2006. Sales of
commercial-mortgage securities have recovered to 34 percent of a
pre-crisis peak and loans to junk-rated companies are on pace to
exceed $1 trillion this year, more than during the boom years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Loan modifications will be done only if they are in the
best interest of the investor and in accordance with the bank&#8217;s
agreements with the investors,&#8221; said Adora Andy Jenkins,
Justice Department spokeswoman. &#8220;So when these modifications
are made, it&#8217;s because they&#8217;re good for investors, consumers and
neighborhoods across the country that are still recovering from
the financial crisis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock&#8217;s Novick said, &#8220;that&#8217;s hard for us as investors
to measure: We don&#8217;t get enough transparency into what&#8217;s going
on.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amy Bonitatibus, a spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the agreement, JPMorgan will receive partial credit
for steps it takes on loans serviced for others, according to a
settlement document on the Justice Department&#8217;s website. For
instance, the bank typically will get a 50 cent credit for each
dollar of principal reductions for homeowners whose debt it
doesn&#8217;t own. The bank gets 100 percent for loans it owns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lobbying Justice &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Association of Mortgage Investors was among groups that
lobbied the Justice Department to preclude the bank from getting
credit for loans owned by investors to help fulfill its
obligations, as occurred with 2012 agreements over foreclosure
practices involving JPMorgan and four other banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 32 percent of credit granted to JPMorgan under the
earlier deal was tied to loans the bank serviced and didn&#8217;t
hold, according to a court filing last month by the monitor for
the settlement, which was sparked by allegations of &#8220;robo-signing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graham Fisher  Co. analyst Joshua Rosner said that
allowing any consumer aid that may harm bondholders to be part
of the latest deal makes little sense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Investors Misled&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These were claims about investments where investors were
misled,&#8221; Rosner said in a Nov. 19 interview on Bloomberg
Television. &#8220;Why is money going to consumers?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homeowners also were harmed by shoddy securitization
practices, according to a government official involved in the
settlement. Giving JPMorgan credit for loans held within bonds
will help more of the neediest get aid because many of the worst
mortgages were packaged into securities, said the official, who
asked not to be named because the discussions were private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama, Democrat and Republican lawmakers
and regulators including the Treasury Department and Federal
Housing Finance Agency have all said they want more private
capital in the home-loan market five years after the government
rescued Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mortgage-bond investors are still wary of the market after
record losses from the worst housing crash since the Great
Depression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, Bears Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual Inc.
home loans from 2005 through 2008 placed into non-agency bonds
have experienced more than $76 billion of losses, and $30
billion of the remaining debt is at least 60 days delinquent,
according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Promised Quality &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors, insurers and regulators have said in lawsuits
against JPMorgan that reviews of soured loans showed in some
cases that more than 80 percent failed to match their promised
quality. The bank bought Washington Mutual&#8217;s banking assets and
Bear Stearns in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock, which is JPMorgan&#8217;s biggest shareholder, and
other investors have also opposed efforts by local governments
to use their eminent domain powers to seize and rework mortgages
held within bonds. The asset manager, which joined in August
with competitors to seek a court order to block Richmond,
California&#8217;s efforts to advance such a plan, contends it will
depress private lending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Municipalities in about 11 states from California and
Washington to Ohio, New York, New Jersey are still at least
looking into the idea, according toRobert Hockett, a Cornell
University professor who&#8217;s advised the local governments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The servicer settlement and the eminent domain proposals
all discourage private capital,&#8221; Novick said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t know what your rights are as an
investor, why would you allocate capital?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Investors&#8217; Ire &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors&#8217; ire has built since a 2008 settlement between
Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s Countrywide Financial unit and state
attorneys general in which claims of predatory lending yielded a
deal that called for mostly investor-owned loans to be revised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, state and federal governments have taken a
series of steps to temporarily freeze or slow foreclosures.
Congress passed a law protecting servicers from certain investor
suits and the federal Home Affordable Modification Program was
structured in a way that aids banks, mortgage investors have
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In JPMorgan&#8217;s latest deal, the bank can get credit for
extinguishing second mortgages a day before a foreclosure in
which the debt will be wiped out, saidLaurie Goodman, director
of Urban Institute&#8217;s housing finance policy center. The bank
gets 40 percent credit for non-performing second loans, up from
as little as 10 percent in the earlier deal in which observers
questioned the credit, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Principal Forgiveness &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a role for giving credit for principal
forgiveness on second liens but the 40 cents on the dollar seems
miscalibrated,&#8221; said Goodman, a former mortgage-bond analyst at
firms including UBS AG and Amherst Securities Group LP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit is also available for refinancing Fannie Mae (FNMA) and
Freddie Mac mortgages serviced by others under the federal Home
Affordable Refinance Program, which JPMorgan &#8220;might be doing
anyway,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s costs from the consumer relief are already
accounted for in its provisions, Chief Financial Officer
Marianne Lakesaid on a Nov. 19 conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving JPMorgan partial credit on investor-owned loans
hurts rather than helps bondholders because it means the lender
has to write down more mortgages to get the same amount, said
Chris Ames, a senior portfolio manager at Schroder Investment
Management North America Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Judgment Call &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The decision by a servicer to write off debt is a
judgment call,&#8221; Ames said in an e-mail. The type of settlement
creates &#8220;perverse incentives, and the servicing of private
label securities isn&#8217;t transparent enough for investors to
evaluate the decision-making.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The perceived harm to bondholders would be even less likely
if a separate agreement reached last week between JPMorgan and
21 institutional investors including BlackRock is finalized,
according to the government official. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under that proposed settlement of mortgage-bond holders&#8217;
own claims of misrepresentations, JPMorgan would allow servicing
on certain loans to be transferred along with paying $4.5
billion. The agreement doesn&#8217;t cover Washington Mutual debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trustees representing all investors in the deals have as
many as 120 days to accept the proposal. Certain investors may
seek to resist the accord, according to Nomura Securities
International analysts Paul Nikodem andPratik Gupta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nomura Estimate &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 7 percent payout relative to past and projected losses
on the loans is lower than the about 10 percent seen in a $8.5
billion proposed deal reached in 2011 by Bank of America still
being fought over in court, according to Nomura. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novick declined to comment on that settlement, whileKathy Patrick, a partner at Gibbs  Bruns LLP representing the
investor group, didn&#8217;t return an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Novick said BlackRock isn&#8217;t opposed to borrowers
getting their balances lowered, the firm &#8220;stands by&#8221; its view
that the step should mainly occur under a mediation process in
which borrowers&#8217; unsecured debt such as credit-card borrowing
and second mortgages are extinguished first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re in favor of the rule of law, and the forgiveness of
debt in the order it should be under contract law,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. said it sold more than 1 million Xbox One video-game consoles in less than a day after the new machine went on sale in 13 countries. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The tally surpassed first-day sales for the predecessor Xbox 360 and set a record for Microsoft, the Redmond, Washington-based company said yesterday in a statement. The Xbox One went on sale in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain, the U.K. and U.S. after the company cut eight countries from the initial sales list, citing production issues. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sony Corp. said on Nov. 17 that it sold more than 1 million PlayStation 4 consoles in North America in the first day of release, topping initial sales for the predecessor PlayStation 3 in 2006. The PS4 goes on sale Nov. 29 in 30 countries in Europe and Latin America, followed by Japan on Feb. 22. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The two companies are competing for the attention of gamers and trying to revive a console market that shrank 32 percent to $13.3 billion from 2008 to 2012, according to market researcher NPD Group. Both are offering machines with upgraded graphics and more entertainment tie-ins. The Xbox One sells for $499, while the PlayStation 4 is offered for $399. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stan Druckenmiller, who has one of
the best track records in the hedge-fund industry over the past
three decades, said he&#8217;s betting against shares of International
Business Machines Corp. (IBM) while wagering on younger technology
companies such as Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;IBM is old technology being replaced by cloud
technology,&#8221; Druckenmiller, 60, said in an interview with
Bloomberg TV&#8217;s Stephanie Ruhle at the Robin Hood Investors
Conference in New York yesterday. &#8220;It&#8217;s one of the more higher-probability shorts I have seen in years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales at the 102-year-old IBM have dropped for six straight
quarters as the growth of services such as cloud computing have
failed to make up for slowing demand for older businesses like
hardware. The company is selling less-profitable divisions and
is devoting cash to stock repurchases to help reach its forecast
for growth in earnings per share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Druckenmiller said he&#8217;s betting on Amazon, and praised
Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos, who founded the online
retailer in 1994. Amazon&#8217;s Web Services division, whose server
farms generate the processing power the retailer sells to heavy
corporate data users on the cheap, &#8220;is killing it,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bezos is a &#8220;serial monopolist,&#8221; Druckenmiller said. IBM
should be investing in its business and taking on the
&#8220;challenge of the Amazons of the world&#8221; instead of doing share
buybacks, according to Druckenmiller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM fell 1.5 percent to close at $181.30 yesterday in New
York. James Sciales, a spokesman for Armonk, New York-based IBM,
didn&#8217;t respond to a phone call and e-mail requesting comment on
Druckenmiller&#8217;s wager. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Buyback Plan &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM lost 5.4 percent this year, compared with a 27 percent
gain for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index and a 48 percent
increase for Amazon. If IBM ends the year in negative territory,
it will be its first annual decline since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM said last month that it added $15 billion to its
buyback plan, part of CEO Ginni Rometty&#8217;s plan to achieve $20 in
adjusted earnings a share by 2015, up from $15.25 last year. The
hardware unit, which makes servers and other devices for
business users, reported a loss last quarter.  Rometty took over
as CEO in January 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s backers include billionaire Warren Buffett, who has
said long-term investors should root for IBM shares to languish
in the short term, giving it a lower price to repurchase stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Druckenmiller said that while he has great respect for
Buffett, he isn&#8217;t known for tech investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think technology is his area of expertise,&#8221;
Druckenmiller said. &#8220;He has often said that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recommending Google &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Druckenmiller described Google Inc. as the most
&#8220;innovative company on the planet,&#8221; citing the company&#8217;s web-enabled eyeglasses and self-driving cars. He said investors who
want to bet on innovation should buy shares of Google and those
who want to bet against innovation should buy IBM shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Druckenmiller, a former chief strategist for billionaire
George Soros, shut his hedge-fund firm three years ago and now
manages his own wealth through his Duquesne Family Office LLC.
From 1986 through 2010, he produced average annual returns of 30
percent at his hedge fund Duquesne Capital Management LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Druckenmiller said that while his returns over the last 10
years were &#8220;very subpar,&#8221; they are superior to the returns
currently in the market. Hedge funds have returned an average of
6.9 percent this year through October, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Druckenmiller said he doesn&#8217;t share hedge-fund manager
David Tepper&#8217;s view that the stock market offers a &#8220;no-brainer
opportunity&#8221; for investors. Still, Druckenmiller said he
doesn&#8217;t see anything to change the rising trend of the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said in September that he had only a few small trades on
as he waited to see who might replace Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben S. Bernanke when he steps down at the end of January. Vice
Chairman Janet Yellen has since been nominated to the post and
is awaiting confirmation by the Senate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, Druckenmiller said investors should bet against the
Australian dollar. The currency has since fallen about 9.8
percent against the U.S. dollar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America Movil SAB (AMXL) said it reached an
agreement to broadcast the 2014 Winter Olympic Games through 26
of Mexico&#8217;s regional television networks, sidestepping the two
major national broadcasters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, Latin America&#8217;s largest mobile-phone carrier,
will also air the games on its Claro Sports cable-TV channel and
on its UnoTV website, it said today in a statement. Mexico City-based America Movil, controlled by billionaire Carlos Slim,
holds exclusive rights for coverage of the Sochi, Russia,
Olympics across all platforms in Latin America, excluding
Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement proves America Movil can reach a national
audience without working with Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO) and TV Azteca
SAB, which dominate Mexico&#8217;s broadcast-TV ratings. Slim, whose
companies haven&#8217;t advertised through the two broadcasters since
2011, has sought to circumvent them as their media businesses
come into direct competition with his telecommunications empire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These will be the Olympic Games with the most coverage in
the history of Mexico,&#8221; Arturo Elias, Slim&#8217;s spokesman and the
director of UnoTV, said today in a news conference in Mexico
City. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Televisa and TV Azteca haven&#8217;t asked for permission
to broadcast the games, America Movil remains open to
programming deals with both broadcasters and other parties, he
said. America Movil also holds the Latin American rights to
broadcast the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A press representative at Televisa declined to comment. TV
Azteca&#8217;s press office didn&#8217;t reply to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The broadcast of these Games will be in reach of all
citizens,&#8221; America Movil said. The local broadcasters range
from Mexico City&#8217;s Canal 22 to the Baja California Sur State
Institute of Radio and Television&#8217;s Canal 8. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) asked a federal judge
in New York to find that a racketeering plot was behind a
multibillion-dollar pollution verdict against the company handed
down by an Ecuadorean court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closing arguments began today in Manhattan after six weeks
of trial in which the company claimed lawyers for the plaintiffs
in the Ecuador environmental case bribed judges and drafted much
of the actual ruling. Steven Donziger, a New York attorney
accused of leading the scheme, has denied allegations of
wrongdoing and maintained the judgment is valid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Randy Mastro, a lawyer for Chevron, the second-largest U.S.
energy company, argued to U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan that
the evidence showed the pollution ruling was a fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;One thing has always been certain: this judgment was
ghostwritten by these plaintiffs,&#8221; Mastro told Kaplan today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mastro said &#8220;strings of words&#8221; from Donziger&#8217;s e-mails
and sequences of numbers from an internal database that appear
verbatim in the judgment show the plaintiffs&#8217; influence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is like not even fingerprints,&#8221; Mastro said. &#8220;This
is like 10 fingers, both palms. Their internal work product
shows up word for word in the document because they wrote it
themselves.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Toxic Waste &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donziger and a team of other lawyers won the $19 billion
judgment in 2011 on behalf of Ecuadorean rainforest villagers
who claimed Texaco, later bought by Chevron, dumped billions of
gallons of drilling-generated toxic waste from the 1960s through
the early 1990s. The award was cut in half on Nov. 12 by the
Ecuadorean National Court of Justice, the nation&#8217;s highest
tribunal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Friedman, an attorney representing Donziger, said
many of Donziger&#8217;s statements from e-mails and documents have
been taken out of context. The case is bigger than Donziger and
the thousands of Ecuadoreans who will be affected by the ruling,
Friedman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;ll be looking to see if American courts will follow
their own rules of law,&#8221; Friedman said. &#8220;They&#8217;ll be looking to
see if there are special exceptions, special rules for large
American corporations. What he&#8217;s accomplished by legitimate, yet
noisy, boisterous, unconventional ways, has caused people around
the world to look with fresh eyes at how our corporations treat
the Third World.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lead Adviser &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, has refused to pay
any of the judgment and is seeking an order from Kaplan barring
Donziger from trying to enforce it. The company claims Texaco
already cleaned up its share of the damage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donziger, a Harvard Law School graduate originally from
Jacksonville, Florida, got involved in the Ecuadorean case in
the 1990s and became its lead adviser. He contends that his role
has since diminished and Ecuadorean lawyers are now in charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said in written testimony that the pollution judgment is
&#8220;a profound historical accomplishment of indigenous and farmer
communities in securing justice for wrongs inflicted upon them
by one of the most powerful corporations on the planet.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the ruling can be upheld in a country where Chevron has
assets to seize, Donziger stands to collect as much as $600
million, he acknowledged in court on Nov. 18 under questioning
by Mastro. Donziger has also been paid during the litigation,
receiving $150,000 in one year while the lead Ecuadorean lawyer
on the team, Pablo Fajardo, received just $24,000, Mastro said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making Money &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mastro, the Chevron lawyer, said today that Donziger&#8217;s
testimony about his smaller role in the case is contradicted by
the fact that he makes &#8220;six or seven times&#8221; more than Fajardo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In every business I&#8217;ve ever been in the boss makes more
money,&#8221; Mastro told the judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To him the ends came to justify the means, the methods
didn&#8217;t matter,&#8221; Mastro said. &#8220;He set about to make the big
score and set his sights on Chevron.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, the team working on behalf of the plaintiffs have
filed enforcement actions in Canada, Brazil and Argentina.
Canada, in particular has &#8220;a history of giving respect to
foreign judgments&#8221; and is a country where oil companies have
&#8220;very substantial assets,&#8221; Donziger said in an interview with
journalists Nov. 15. Chevron has no physical assets in Ecuador. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two Judges &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two former Ecuadorean judges who handled the pollution case
also testified during the trial: Nicolas Zambrano, who issued
the ruling, and his former colleague Alberto Guerra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guerra told the court that he regularly drafted rulings for
Zambrano, who wasn&#8217;t as experienced at handling civil cases. He
testified that he and his colleague were promised proceeds from
the judgment to throw the case in the plaintiffs&#8217; favor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guerra, now living in the U.S. and receiving $12,000 a
month from Chevron, said he helped write the 188-page judgment
against the company based on materials from the plaintiffs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zambrano denied he was bribed. He told the court that while
Guerra regularly helped him draft some rulings, he worked on the
Chevron ruling with help only from an 18-year-old assistant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mastro said today in his closing argument that Zambrano
lied on the stand when he denied paying Guerra to help with the
judgment and denied being bribed to write the ruling in favor of
the plaintiffs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Weak Judiciary &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He couldn&#8217;t admit that he was paid to ghostwrite the
judgment,&#8221; Mastro said. &#8220;He admitted too much and he lied way
too much.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron filed its racketeering case against Donziger after
pre-trial information exchanges produced materials that included
hundreds of hours of outtakes from a 2009 documentary on the
Ecuador case called &#8220;Crude,&#8221; by filmmaker Joe Berlinger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron alleged the material showed Donziger discussing
ways to take advantage of Ecuador&#8217;s weak judiciary. Donziger
said the outtakes were edited by Chevron and that some of his
statements were taken out of context. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supporters of Donziger&#8217;s efforts include Trudie Styler,
wife of musician Sting, who helped start a project to provide
clean water for the rainforest dwellers. The couple watched
Donziger testify in Manhattan federal court Nov. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The racketeering case is Chevron Corp. v. Donziger, 11-cv-00691, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index will
probably fall 10 percent in the next 12 months before rebounding
to end the year at 1,900, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1,900 forecast from the New York-based firm implies
about a 5 percent advance from today&#8217;s level. The 25 months
since the SP 500 (SPX)&#8217;s last 10 percent drop is the longest stretch
without such a decline since 2007, according to SP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It will be less smooth sailing,&#8221; David Kostin, the
bank&#8217;s chief U.S. equity strategist, said on Bloomberg
Television&#8217;s &#8220;Market Makers&#8221; program. &#8220;The likelihood is we
will have something that will prompt a reduction -- a retreat in
the market. But overall the market should be rising, and that&#8217;s
because the U.S. economy will be getting better.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kostin predicts the SP 500 will reach 2,100 by the end of
2015 and 2,200 by the end of 2016. He said he favors technology,
industrial and consumer discretionary companies because they
will benefit the most from an improving economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast U.S. economic
growth will accelerate to 2.6 percent next year and 3 percent in
2015, compared with a 1.7 percent expansion in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy shares of companies that are
increasing capital spending or repurchasing stock, he said. He&#8217;s
also bullish on firms that have above-average operating
leverage, a measure of how well a company can control fixed and
variable costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All these themes are about taking advantage of the
economy improving,&#8221; Kostin said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) is betting on career insider Doug McMillon, who learned the business from founder Sam Walton, to revive a company struggling with slowing growth at home and in the international regions he oversaw. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest retailer yesterday named McMillon, 47, chief executive officer, replacing Mike Duke, 63, who retires Feb. 1. An Arkansas native, McMillon has held senior-level executive positions in the U.S. and overseas after starting as a worker in a Wal-Mart warehouse almost 30 years ago. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the new CEO has struggled to boost growth in China and Brazil, his strong knowledge of store operations and consumer behavior may help him improve the U.S. business, said Burt Flickinger, managing director at Strategic Resource Group, a retail consulting firm. His main challenge at home will be reversing an underinvestment in stores that has resulted in inadequately stocked shelves and poor customer service, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;He knows how to do it because he spent most of his Wal-Mart life in retail operations and buying,&#8221; said Flickinger, who noted that Duke worked in logistics and distribution before becoming CEO. &#8220;The stores have suffered from a lack of investment in people and adequate stocking levels.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bidders including Blackstone Group
LP (BX) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) dropped out of an auction of
1,458 rental homes in Spain, leaving the properties unsold, two
people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madrid&#8217;s regional government received no binding offers for
the portfolio comprising 22 developments in and around the
Spanish capital by the Nov. 22 deadline, according to the
people, who asked not to be named because the information is
private. At least seven companies expressed an interest in
buying the properties, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three years of government austerity, unemployment at 26
percent and subdued mortgage lending are forcing more Spaniards
to consider renting rather than buying homes. It&#8217;s also
prompting foreign funds to invest in the country&#8217;s unsold
residential properties, which may total 1.3 million units,
according to Idealista.com, Spain&#8217;s largest real estate website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the regional government of Madrid wasn&#8217;t
immediately available for comment. Sophie Bullock, a spokeswoman
for Goldman Sachs in London, and Andrew Dowler, a spokesman for
Blackstone, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Asking Price &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minimum asking price for the homes, which are 94
percent occupied with a delinquency rate of 21 percent, was 67.2
million euros ($91 million), the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home prices have fallen by an average of 40 percent since
the market&#8217;s peak in 2007, according to Fotocasa.es and the IESE
business school. Rents in Madrid have fallen 19 percent since
June 2008. In Barcelona, Spain&#8217;s second-largest city, they&#8217;ve
dropped 24 percent, according to data compiled by Idealista.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackstone, the world&#8217;s largest private-equity firm, which
has spent $7.5 billion buying 40,000 homes in the U.S., agreed
in July to purchase 18 apartment blocks from the city of Madrid
for 125.5 million euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Azora Capital SL, a Madrid-based private-equity firm with 2.3 billion euros of assets under management,
agreed in August to pay almost 20 percent more than the minimum
asking price for 32 social-housing developments sold by the
capital&#8217;s regional government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spain&#8217;s bad bank, known as Sareb, failed to attract high
enough bids in its first sale of commercial real estate and will
cut the size of the portfolio offered to make it easier to sell,
three people familiar with the matter said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Maria Levitov" date="Nov 26, 2013 10:41 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-26/goldman-says-buy-china-russia-stocks-on-valuations-to-reforms.html"><headline>Goldman Says Buy China, Russia Stocks on Valuation to Reform</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended
buying Chinese (SHCOMP) and Russian stocks as a pick up in growth in
developed countries and government reforms boost prospects for
the &#8220;least-expensive&#8221; emerging markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman upgraded equities in the two countries to
overweight, the equivalent of buy, from market weight, saying
Chinese banks and Russian energy companies could experience
&#8220;modest valuation expansion,&#8221; according to a report today. The
New York-based bank kept Korea and Mexico at overweight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Micex Index (INDEXCF) in Moscow trades at 4.3 times projected 12-month earnings, while the multiple for the Shanghai Composite
Index is 8.6, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That
compares with 10.5 times for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.
China, the world&#8217;s second-largest economy, and Russia, the
largest global energy exporter, are &#8220;relatively insulated&#8221;
from concern about Federal Reserve stimulus tapering, which may
start around March 2014, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficiency of capital allocation and the treatment of
minority shareholders &#8220;are improving,&#8221; analysts including
Christopher Eoyang said. &#8220;In Russia, we feel the market is
over-focused on the importance of the price of oil, and
unwilling to credit the effects of various reform programs, the
drive for greater efficiency&#8221; and a potential increase of
energy exports to Asia, it said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iron ore will probably drop 19
percent by the end of the year as demand slows and supply
increases, Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) said, joining Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. in forecasting declining prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ore may fall to $110 a ton by the end of the year, Justin Smirk, the second-most-accurate industrial metals forecaster
tracked by Bloomberg over the past eight quarters, said in a
report today. Prices may rebound to about $140 a ton in mid-2014
before dropping back to $110 in September, he said. Goldman said
last week the steelmaking ingredient was among commodities that
may decline at least 15 percent next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron ore climbed to a two-month high on Nov. 6 as China,
the biggest buyer, boosted stockpiles to the highest level in a
year. Banks from Goldman to UBS AG expect that supply expansions
led by Australian producers will push the seaborne market into
surplus next year. The pace of China&#8217;s economic growth may slow
to 7.4 percent in 2014 from 7.6 percent this year, according to
economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are now looking for prices to ease by the end of the
year, as demand slows and supply picks up a little more,&#8221;
Smirk, a senior economist at Westpac, said in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ore with 62 percent iron content delivered to the Chinese
port of Tianjin was unchanged at $136.50 a dry ton yesterday,
according to The Steel Index Ltd. Prices climbed to $137.10 on
Nov. 6, the highest since Sept. 5, paring this year&#8217;s loss to
5.8 percent. Iron ore for May delivery on the Dalian Commodity
Exchange rose 0.9 percent to 941 yuan ($154) a ton today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Global Surplus &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman said last month that prices will average $130 a ton
this quarter and $117 a ton in the first quarter of 2014 from
$133 in the three months ended Sept. 30. Surging output in
Australia, the biggest exporter, will swell the global surplus
to 154 million tons, from 24 million tons in 2013, UBS AG says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The glut may not emerge until the second half of 2014,
according to Morgan Stanley. Supply in the seaborne market will
fall 25 million tons short of demand in the first half, before a
49 million-ton surplus emerges in the final six months, it said
Oct. 7. Prices will average $125 this quarter, $130 in the next
and $120 in the three months through June, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stockpiles in China were 77.86 million tons on Nov. 22, the
highest since Nov. 30, 2012, according to Beijing Antaike
Development Co. Inventories climbed 18 percent after slumping in
March to the lowest since 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rio Tinto Group, which expects continued demand for raw
materials from China, plans to expand output in Australia&#8217;s
Pilbara region to 360 million tons from 290 million tons.
Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG) is tripling its capacity in the
Pilbara to 155 million tons. The first ore from BHP Billiton
Ltd. (BHP)&#8217;s Jimblebar expansion in Western Australia arrived six
months early. BHP is the biggest mining company followed by Rio. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. corporations are switching chief executive officers at the fastest pace in five years as companies from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to Microsoft Corp. grapple with shifting customer tastes, competition from upstarts and restive shareholders. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This year, through the third quarter, 43 companies in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index were working under new CEOs, according to executive recruiter Spencer Stuart. That suggests 2013 will surpass the 49 of 2011, the biggest for turnover since 2008. Wal-Mart joined those ranks yesterday, saying Doug McMillon, head of its international business, will replace Mike Duke in February. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;CEOs are required to master a broader range of skills than in the past, when top executives might have climbed the ranks with just one discipline. Companies are bigger, more global and increasingly complicated, and there&#8217;s accelerating competition in countries such as China, India and Brazil. Executives must also adapt to quicker technological change, including shifts brought on by widening use of mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Companies in every industry are dealing with a new digital world where sales happen differently, the consumer is reached differently and products have to be made and moved around the world in a new way,&#8221; said Bob Benson, who heads RL Benson  Associates, a New Canaan, Connecticut-based consultant to search firms. &#8220;CEOs who don&#8217;t have a digital orientation are worried.

&lt;p&gt;What&#8217;s the difference between
trading currency products and currency trading? More than $1
billion, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment bank said last week that it didn&#8217;t have a
third-quarter loss in currency trading. That followed a report
by Reuters on Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Nov. 7 Securities and Exchange
Commission filing, which shows a $1.32 billion loss from market-making in currency products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disconnect stems from the fact that the biggest U.S.
banks don&#8217;t provide a revenue breakdown for units that make up
their equity- and fixed-income trading divisions, which reap
more than $70 billion a year. An SEC requirement that banks give
some specifics on those businesses resulted in disclosures that
firms such as Goldman Sachs, which gets more than half its
revenue from trading, said lack meaningful context. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you&#8217;re trying to figure out the profitability of
different lines of business, I don&#8217;t know how you effectively do
that,&#8221; said Edward Siedle, a former SEC attorney and president
of Ocean Ridge, Florida-based Benchmark Financial Services Inc.
&#8220;The commission needs to be careful not to require a disclosure
scheme that is just as likely to be misleading as it is to be
revealing,&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) are among Wall Street firms that offered deals to
help Venezuela obtain U.S. dollars amid a plunge in the nation&#8217;s
foreign reserves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A swap proposed by Goldman Sachs would provide $1.68
billion in cash and be backed by $1.85 billion of the central
bank&#8217;s gold, documents obtained by Bloomberg News show. Bank of
America said it could be an intermediary for $3 billion in
payments to firms seeking U.S. dollars, documents show. Neither
deal has been completed, a government official with direct
knowledge of the matter said, requesting anonymity because the
talks are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dollars are becoming scarce in Venezuela, limiting the
supply of products from medicine to toilet paper in a nation
that imports about three-quarters of goods it consumes. Foreign
reserves dropped 28 percent this year, touching a nine-year low
of $20.7 billion this month, largely because 70 percent of the
assets are in gold. The metal plunged 26 percent in the period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fact you have dollar shortages is symptomatic of an
economy that&#8217;s completely broken down,&#8221; Robert Abad, who helps
oversee $53 billion in emerging-market debt at Western Asset
Management Co., said yesterday in a telephone interview from
Pasadena, California. &#8220;This is something that&#8217;s just incredibly
unnecessary, very unfortunate, and the victim of all of this is
the real economy, real people.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Billionaire Alvaro Saieh hired
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Bank of America Corp. to sell a
controlling stake in Corpbanca (CORPBANC), according to two people familiar
with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4) is one of the banks they have
approached, said one of the two people, who asked not to be
named because the negotiations are private. Santiago-based
Corpbanca has a market value of $4.22 billion. Saieh and his
family directly and indirectly own 76 percent of the bank,
according to its most recent annual report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Itau&#8217;s chief executive officer, Roberto Setubal, told
analysts on an earning conference call on Nov. 12 that Chile is
a priority market and that the bank is considering acquisitions
in Latin America. Neither Corpbanca nor its controler have made
any agreement to sell all or part of the bank, chief executive
officer Fernando Massu said today in a statement to the stock
exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Duvally, a spokesman from Goldman Sachs in New
York, declined to comment on the transaction, as did Kerrie
McHugh, a spokeswoman from Bank of America in New York. Itau
also declined to comment, according to an official who asked not
to be named in keeping with company policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Share Rally &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corpbanca&#8217;s shares leaped 7.9 percent to 6.60 pesos today
in Santiago, bringing their gain to 40 percent since reaching a
low of 4.727 pesos on Aug. 28. The stock is up 3.6 percent so
far this year, while the IPSA index of Chile&#8217;s most-traded stock
has fallen 13.1 percent. Corpbanca&#8217;s bonds due 2018 have
returned 0.7 percent this month, beating losses in bonds of
Banco de Chile, Banco Santander Chile and Banco de Credito 
Inversiones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chilean securities regulation stipulates that a bidder must
present a public offer to all shareholders of a listed company
if it&#8217;s seeking effective control of the target, or if the buyer
increases an existing stake above two thirds of all shares. If a
bidder is seeking to buy a non-listed company whose assets are
mostly stakes in a listed firm, the law will also require it to
bid for the publicly traded unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saieh completed the investment of an additional $300
million in his supermarket chain SMU SA last week after losses
at the company led it to break debt covenants. SMU&#8217;s $300
million of bonds due 2020 have lost 37 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Asset Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saieh sold other assets as he sought to fund the cash
injection into SMU. Inversiones La Construccion SA said on Oct.
1 it would pay $170 million in cash and assumed debt for a 67
percent stake in Corp Group Vida Chile SA, the holding company
through which Saieh controls two insurers. He also sold 31 bank
branches for $83 million to Independencia Rentas Inmobiliarias,
a real estate fund that will lease the space back to Corpbanca. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Mostrador website reported today that Corpbanca was in
talks with four banks, including Itau, over a possible merger
that would enable Saieh to retain some control over the bank,
citing a document drawn up by Bank of America. The other banks
are Banco de Credito e Inversiones, Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) and
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, the website said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Tobin, a spokesman for BBVA in Madrid, declined to
comment. Calls to a press official at BCI weren&#8217;t immediately
returned. Bank of Nova Scotia doesn&#8217;t comment on rumors,
spokeswoamn Paula Cufre said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombian-born Saieh, who has a doctorate in economics from
the University of Chicago and whose family immigrated to Chile
when he was three years old, built CorpBanca into Chile&#8217;s fifth
biggest bank by assets. The bank&#8217;s shares have tripled since the
company went public in 2002. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saieh now sits on the board of his alma mater, alongside
Credit Suisse Group AG CEO Brady Dougan, and in his spare time
collects Italian renaissance art. Last year he outbid the Los
Angeles County Museum of Art to buy Girolamo Romanino&#8217;s Christ
Carrying the Cross for $4.6 million, according to artnet.com.
Saieh is a member of the European paintings visiting committee
of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stood down from the board of Corpbanca in February of
last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PetroChina Co. (857), the country&#8217;s
biggest oil and gas producer, agreed to buy a 25 percent stake
in Iraq&#8217;s West Qurna 1 field from Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stakeholders in the field, which also include Royal
Dutch Shell and Oil Exploration Co. of Iraq, own contracts to
drill for oil. PetroChina&#8217;s interest will allow it to &#8220;achieve
synergies with its other projects in Iraq&#8221; and &#8220;develop a
larger and stronger presence in the upstream operations in the
Middle East,&#8221; the Beijing-based company said in a statement. It
didn&#8217;t disclose how much it&#8217;s paying for the stake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West Qurna 1 is near the Rumaila field run by BP Plc (BP/) and
China National Petroleum Corp., PetroChina&#8217;s state-owned parent.
Exxon&#8217;s 60 percent stake in the field could be worth $3 billion,
according to an August estimate by Neil Beveridge, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;PetroChina has all the expertise in developing mature
fields at a relatively low cost,&#8221; said Shi Yan, an analyst with
UOB-Kay Hian Ltd. &#8220;They have several projects in the southern
part of the country and collectively they can find a way to
deploy their equipment and crew members more effectively.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CNPC produces about 1.65 million barrels of oil a day from
its Iraqi projects, the company said in October 2012. Exxon, the
world&#8217;s biggest oil company by market value, planned to produce
about 600,000 barrels of oil per day by the end of 2013, Madhi
Abdul Razzak, head of the Joint Management Committee for the
oilfield, said in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Eglinton, Exxon&#8217;s Houston-based spokesman, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to an e-mail after hours seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq, home to the world&#8217;s fifth-largest crude reserves, is
producing 3.3 million barrels a day and in August exported 2.58
million barrels a day, Deputy Prime Minister for Energy Affairs
Hussain al Shahristani said in a September interview. Export
capacity will exceed 6 million barrels a day once four offshore
plants are operating next year and terminals in the south are
upgraded, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s board is focusing on Ford Motor Co. Chief Executive Officer Alan Mulally and internal executive Satya Nadella as part of a group of more likely candidates to become the next CEO of the world&#8217;s biggest software company, according to people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While internal candidate Tony Bates and former Nokia Oyj CEO Stephen Elop remain in the mix, they&#8217;re currently considered less likely to be offered the job, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private. Preferences remain fluid and other people are being considered and could emerge as front-runners, said one of the people, without identifying any. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The board is aiming for a quick replacement for longtime CEO Steve Ballmer, who said in August that he will retire within the next 12 months. The Redmond, Washington-based company has seen its software leadership decline amid a shrinking of the personal-computer market, which was its core business. Microsoft is shifting strategy to focus more on hardware and Internet-based services and away from its software roots as it competes with Apple Inc. and Google Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Frank Shaw, a spokesman at Microsoft, declined to comment or to make any executives available yesterday. Susan Sheehan, a spokeswoman for Nokia, which is still Elop&#8217;s employer, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

to an e-mailed statement from the Beijing-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon currently owns a 60 percent stake of the West Qurna
field in Southeastern Iraq, while Royal Dutch Shell Plc holds 15
percent and Oil Exploration Co. of Iraq owns the remaining 25
percent, according to Exxon&#8217;s website. Exxon, The world&#8217;s
biggest oil company by market value, estimated the field will
produce as much as 600,000 barrels of oil per day by the end of
2013. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OAO Inter RAO UES, Russia&#8217;s state-run electricity exporter, headed for its biggest advance since
May after JPMorgan Chase  Co. raised the stock to the
equivalent of buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inter RAO rose 5.5 percent, the biggest increase in the 50-stock Micex Index (INDEXCF), to 0.78 kopeks by 4:34 p.m. in Moscow. The
number of shares traded was equivalent to about 5.3 times the
three-month daily average. Inter RAO is the third-worst
performer on the Micex over the past 12 months, with a drop of
69 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan analysts, including Nadezhda Timokhova, lifted the
stock to overweight, citing the shares&#8217; underperformance and
lower valuations in an e-mailed note dated yesterday. Inter RAO
has declined after being removed from MSCI Inc.&#8217;s Russia index
effective Nov. 27, while the MSCI Russia Utility index has
slumped 52 percent this year on concern earnings will suffer
from a tariff freeze imposed by the government next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The overall negative news flow on the electric utilities
sector this year related to the tariff freeze&#8221; resulted in &#8220;a
considerable correction in utility names,&#8221; the JPMorgan
analysts said in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A potential acquisition by state-run OAO Rosneftegaz may
lead to an improved in dividend policy, according to JPMorgan.
Inter RAO trades at 4.2 times estimated earnings, which compares
with 11 times for Enel SpA (ENEL), Italy&#8217;s largest utility. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden succeeded where President Barack Obama couldn&#8217;t -- getting Microsoft Corp., Google Inc. and Yahoo! Inc. to upgrade computer security against hackers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The companies are adopting harder-to-crack code to protect their networks and data, after years of largely rebuffing calls from the White House and privacy advocates to improve security. The new measures come after documents from Snowden revealed how U.S. spy programs gain access to the companies&#8217; customer data -- sometimes with their knowledge, sometimes without -- and that&#8217;s threatening profits at home and abroad. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;These companies actively fought against numerous mechanisms that would have mandated far more secure data,&#8221; Sascha Meinrath, director of the Open Technology Institute at the New America Foundation in Washington, said in a phone interview. &#8220;Now they are paying the literal price.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Google, Yahoo, Microsoft and Facebook Inc. provide data to the government under court orders, they are trying to prevent the NSA from gaining unauthorized access to information flowing between computer servers by using encryption. That scrambles data using a mathematical formula that can be decoded only with a special digital key. &lt;/p&gt;
