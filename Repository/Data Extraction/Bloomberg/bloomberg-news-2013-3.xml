&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s oil regulator expects
Chevron Corp. (CVX), which suspended operations in the country last
year after an offshore spill, to participate in an auction for
new oil blocks this year, Magda Chambriard, head of the agency
known as ANP, said in an interview in Houston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator also sees OGX Petroleo e Gas Participacoes as
a model producer of gas for electricity plants ahead of a gas
block auction in October, she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AudioCodes Ltd. (AUDC), the Israeli company
whose Internet calling technology is used by Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), is
beating the biggest telecommunications companies on the Nasdaq
market on prospects demand for its products will boost sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of AudioCodes advanced 11 percent in February,
extending its rally in the past six months to 186 percent and
making the Lod, Israel-based company the best performer on the
Nasdaq Telecommunications Index. The Bloomberg Israel-US Equity
Index (ISRA25BN) of the largest U.S.-traded Israeli equities in New York
dropped for a third week, led by Allot Communications Ltd. and
Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AudioCodes, which supplies Internet voice call products to
Microsoft, is benefiting from plans by the world&#8217;s largest
software maker to catch up with Cisco Systems Inc. in the
Internet telephony and communications market, which Forrester
Research Inc. (FORR) predicts will reach $14.5 billion in 2015.
AudioCodes will probably report in 2013 the fastest revenue
growth in three years, according to Oppenheimer  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Microsoft people are crazy excited about it, and
there is a real opportunity here for AudioCodes to make a name
for themselves,&#8221; Andrew Uerkwitz, an analyst at Oppenheimer,
said by phone from New York on Feb. 28. &#8220;This company really
had an identity crisis, and once AudioCodes got its strategy
figured out, investors came back to it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of AudioCodes gained 0.1 percent to 15.30 shekels,
or the equivalent of $4.11, at the close in Tel Aviv today. The
benchmark TA-25 Index fell 0.4 percent to 1,216.09. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Internet Phones &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AudioCodes plunged to a three-year low of $1.37 in August,
as sales slumped for six consecutive quarters. The company&#8217;s
focus on Microsoft&#8217;s Lync communications system has lured back
investors that had abandoned the stock as its price tumbled 45
percent during 2011 and 2012, Uerkwitz said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from Microsoft&#8217;s Lync program, which offers
corporate phone, video and instant messaging services, grew 35
percent in the second quarter, according to a Jan. 24 earnings
call. The Redmond, Washington-based company has about 5 million
Lync users, with revenue from the segment nearing $1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of AudioCodes&#8217; Lync products, which range from
Internet handsets to call recording software, may grow as much
as 40 percent in 2013, Uerkwitz said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg Israel-US gauge retreated 0.3 percent to
87.26 last week as the TA-25 (TA-25) index increased 0.3 percent to
1,221.47. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allot, the Hod Hasharon, Israel-based maker of products
that track wireless traffic, declined 9.9 percent to $13.09 in
the week, making it the worst performer on the Bloomberg Israel-
US gauge. The shares in Tel Aviv dropped 8.4 percent to 48.75
shekels, or $13.10, today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Stopped Spending&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Procera Networks Inc. (PKT), a U.S. competitor that also helps
cable companies and mobile operators report on network traffic,
plunged 32 percent last week as its fourth-quarter earnings and
revenue missed analysts&#8217; estimates. Slumping growth at Fremont,
California-based Procera may signal a broader slowdown in the
industry, Wedbush Securities Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The customers have stopped spending temporarily,&#8221; Sanjit Singh, a New York-based analyst at Wedbush who rates Allot (ALLT)
shares neutral, said by phone on March 1. &#8220;It&#8217;s not that the
projects are going away, we just don&#8217;t know when they&#8217;re going
to land.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mellanox dropped 3.1 percent to $51.19 in its fourth
consecutive week of declines, while shares traded in Tel Aviv
slipped 0.4 percent to 191.5 shekels, or $51.39, in the week
ended Feb. 28. The stock was the worst-performing company on the
TA-25 Index in the last six months with a 59 percent plunge
through Friday. Mellanox shares gained 0.1 percent to 191.60
shekels, or $51.47, in Tel Aviv today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Citigroup Inc. (C) stepped up warnings to shareholders about cyber attacks as the U.S. prodded banks and government agencies to bolster their defenses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Online and mobile banking give new points of entry that can be used to disrupt or penetrate operations, the two New York- based firms said last week in annual regulatory filings. The companies said they&#8217;re vulnerable to tactics that overload websites to shut off public access, such as assaults that disrupted the nation&#8217;s largest lenders late last year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. banks are speculating that foreign nations, organized crime or terrorists are behind efforts to cripple their websites and warning that costs to keep intruders at bay will rise. President Barack Obama directed the government on Feb. 12 to develop voluntary security standards for companies running vital infrastructure and is pushing Congress to set formal rules. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are going to see more disclosures, and that&#8217;s a warning sign that things are really getting bad,&#8221; said Lawrence Ponemon, chairman of Ponemon Institute LLC, a Traverse City, Michigan-based security research firm, which predicts a 30 percent increase in expenses tied to cyber intrusions this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel Wainstein, chairman of
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s Brazil investment-banking business,
will leave the company, two people with direct knowledge of the
matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has been discussing the changes with
Wainstein for the past several months, according to a person at
the New York-based firm who asked not to be identified because
the decision hasn&#8217;t been announced. Wainstein, 42, and Andre Laport Ribeiro are Goldman Sachs&#8217;s only partners in Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wainstein asked to leave after working at the firm since
2000, one of the people said. He was appointed chairman of
Brazil investment banking in April 2012, when Antonio Pereira
and Fabio Bicudo were named co-chief operating officers. The
bank ranked sixth in equity underwriting in Brazil last year,
with $732 million in transactions, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. It was No. 8 among merger advisers with $14.3 billion in
deals, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment on Wainstein&#8217;s departure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said in October it would double capital in
Brazil to 800 million reais ($407 million) while closing its
asset-management business in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm, which doesn&#8217;t disclose Brazil revenue or profit,
named Paulo Leme as chairman for the country a year ago. Goldman
Sachs has said its strategy in Brazil is to focus on complex
products with higher profit margins, such as convertible debt
and receivables securitization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Local Competition &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. and international banks are competing against Brazil-
based companies such as Bradesco BBI SA, Banco Itau BBA SA and
Banco BTG Pactual SA, which have used their stronger local
contacts to squeeze out foreign firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs completed its strategy to become a full-
service bank in Brazil in 2009, after two failed attempts to buy
local firms. In 1998, Goldman Sachs tried to buy Banco de
Investimentos Garantia SA, which was acquired by Credit Suisse
Group AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven years later it sought to purchase Banco Pactual SA,
an investment bank later acquired by UBS AG. Pactual was sold
back to BTG Partners in 2009 and is now Banco BTG Pactual SA.
BTG went public last year in a $1.94 billion initial offering
that Goldman Sachs helped underwrite. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank, asked regulators to approve a higher quarterly
dividend and reduced stock buyback after suffering its biggest
trading loss ever last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We know that we would like to increase our dividend,&#8221;
Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake told investors during a
Boston investor conference sponsored by Citigroup Inc. &#8220;We did
ask for buybacks, but lower than last year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve forced JPMorgan to suspend a $15
billion share repurchase program last year after the lender
disclosed derivatives losses that eventually swelled to more
than $6.2 billion. JPMorgan&#8217;s board of directors cut Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon&#8217;s pay for 2012 in half after a
review of the so-called London Whale episode held him partly
responsible for the botched trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon previously told analysts that JPMorgan reduced its
2013 buyback target by at least 20 percent to less than $3
billion per quarter. The bank is projected to raise its 30-cent
quarterly dividend to 35 cents a share, according to analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire capital plan needs Fed approval as part of the
central bank&#8217;s annual review of the biggest U.S. lenders, with
an answer expected by mid-March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re going to find out over the course of the next week
or so whether or not we get our capital plan approved,&#8221; Lake
said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stress Test &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While JPMorgan executives want to return more capital to
shareholders, next year&#8217;s payouts will depend on new
international capital rules and how they affect the Fed&#8217;s so-
called stress test, Lake said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ll make our decision when we know how things shake out
toward the end of this year,&#8221; Lake said. &#8220;And we&#8217;d like to
return capital back to shareholders. So we hope to have a chance
to do that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan purchased $1.6 billion shares before its buyback
program was shut down last year. The Fed later approved the
repurchase of $3 billion in additional shares in this year&#8217;s
first quarter, leaving $10.4 billion of the original amount
still unused. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon has said he&#8217;s inclined to buy back shares when the
price falls below tangible book value, a theoretical measure of
what the company would be worth in a liquidation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coverity Inc. has held talks with
banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and JPMorgan Chase 
Co. about holding an initial public offering later this year,
Chief Executive Officer Anthony Bettencourt said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco-based company, which makes applications
to detect errors in software, would look to raise less than $100
million in an IPO for future acquisitions, Bettencourt said in
an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coverity is on track for annual revenue of about $70
million, and sales are growing at 30 percent a year, Bettencourt
said. More than 1,100 customers, including Microsoft Corp.,
Samsung Electronics Co. and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, license Coverity&#8217;s tools, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our eye is on the public markets,&#8221; Bettencourt said.
&#8220;It helps with the credibility. It&#8217;s nice to have a war chest
in reserves.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman at Goldman Sachs, and Justin Perras, a spokesman at JPMorgan, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coverity raised $22 million from Foundation Capital and
Benchmark Capital in 2008, and currently has $25 million in the
bank and is cash-flow positive, Bettencourt said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is expanding
its business in Argentina as the country remains a ``key'' market
in the region, the bank&#8217;s senior country officer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, is leasing an additional
three floors in its headquarters in Buenos Aires and hiring
about 15 people this year, Facundo Gomez Minujin said. The New
York-based bank has operated its local investment unit in
Argentina since 1985, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;Argentina remains a key element of our JPMorgan franchise
in Latin America,&#8221; Gomez Minujin wrote in an e-mail. &#8220;In the
last 12 months we have increased our headcount.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is expanding in South America&#8217;s second-largest
economy even as competitors have cut staff and closed divisions
amid a tightening of currency controls and financial oversight
by President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner&#8217;s government.
Barclays Plc (BARC) closed its wealth management office in Buenos Aires
in January 2012 &#8220;for strategic reasons&#8221; while Exotix, a
brokerage, last year transferred some staff to New York and
London due to regulations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gomez Minujin denied a report published today from Buenos
Aires-based newspaper Clarin that the bank was leaving the
country by the end of the month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re maintaining our presence Argentina just like we
always have,&#8221; he said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extra demand for Romanian debt
stemming from inclusion in an emerging-market bond index will be
limited as investors have already boosted their holdings by $3.5
billion through January, JPMorgan  Chase  Co. (JPM) said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank, which will incorporate three Romanian leu-
denominated fixed-income securities in its GBI-EM index over
three months starting March 1, had estimated total inflows of $2
billion amid the inclusion, according to a research note sent to
clients today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors have already increased their exposure to
Romanian bonds and we expect extra demand from index inclusion
to be limited,&#8221; JPMorgan said in the note. &#8220;The potential
future inclusion of additional Romanian bonds in the index,
which depends on liquidity, may add to further demand.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leu-denominated bonds and the currency have rallied since
January after JPMorgan said three of the country&#8217;s local notes
are eligible for index inclusion. Eleven Romanian notes are also
eligible for entry to a Barclays Plc (BARC) emerging-market index,
according to e-mailed comments from Societe Generale SA. (GLE) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leu strengthened 0.3 percent to 3.3428 per euro by 7:53
p.m. in Bucharest. It has gained 2.1 percent against Europe&#8217;s
common currency this year, the seventh-best performance among
more than 20 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.
The yield on Romania&#8217;s January 2016 bonds slid to 5.73 percent
at an auction on Feb. 14, compared with a rate of 6.03 percent
at a similar-maturity sale on Jan. 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Foreign Holders &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign investors&#8217; holding of Romanian debt rose to more
than 20 percent in February from 5 percent in November,
according to JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increased interest from international investors helped
the Finance Ministry raise a record 11.4 billion lei ($3.4
billion) of local debt in January in addition to 503 million
euros ($655 million) of bonds also sold domestically. It also
raised 4.03 billion lei last month, more than the 3.7 billion
lei planned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romania&#8217;s October 2015, January 2016 and July 2017 leu
bonds are eligible for the JPMorgan index, phased in over a
three-month period concluding on May 1, JPMorgan said in the
note. Their final expected weight in the GBI-EM Global
Diversified index is 0.87 percent, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That compares with the country&#8217;s current weight of 0.29
percent, Patrick Burton, a spokesman for the bank, said in an e-
mailed response to questions from Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan raised its estimate for Romania&#8217;s economic growth
to 1.5 percent this year from 0.8 percent, adding that it sees
risks from the &#8220;uncertainty around a new deal with the
International Monetary Fund.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) said it filed patent-
infringement lawsuits today against generic-drug makers
including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) to prevent them
from selling a low-cost version of the painkiller Celebrex until
December 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer had won a ruling in 2008 that prevents Teva from
entering the market until May 2014. In that case, an appeals
court invalidated a patent that expires in December 2015. Pfizer
said today it had persuaded the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
to reissue that patent with changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celebrex, also known by the active ingredient celecoxib,
generated $1.75 billion in U.S. sales last year, the company
said Jan. 29. Each day that Pfizer can delay generic competition
means about $5 million in revenue for the New York-based
company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reissued patent covers methods of treating
osteoarthritis with celecoxib. In addition to Petach Tikva,
Israel-based Teva, the world&#8217;s largest generic-drug maker,
Pfizer said it sued Mylan Inc., Actavis Inc. (ACT), Lupin Ltd. (LPC) and
Apotex Inc. in federal court in eastern Virginia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Continued development of new medicines that enhance
patient lives is supported by protecting intellectual property
and innovation,&#8221; Pfizer General Counsel Amy Schulman said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exchange operators NYSE Euronext (NYX), Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. and
Bats Global Markets Inc. also said they would submit bids, as
did high-frequency trading technology provider Tradeworx Inc.,
which supplies a system to the Securities and Exchange
Commission that compiles information from private data streams
about quotations and trades. The list of 31 candidates was
published on the website for the so-called consolidated audit
trail that the exchanges and Finra are developing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audit trail, one of former SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro&#8217;s
main projects, will track all securities orders and trades in
the U.S. from start to completion and give the agency and other
regulators a powerful system to monitor markets and reconstruct
crashes. The exchanges and Finra said in November they would
submit the plan in December 2013, eight months later than
initially expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a milestone since the key inputs of the
consolidated audit-trail plan will result from this request-for-
proposal process,&#8221; Manisha Kimmel, executive director of the
New York-based Financial Information Forum, a group of brokers,
exchanges and vendors in the securities industry that focuses on
operational and technology issues, said by phone. The firm that
wins the bid will have a &#8220;definite impact on the CAT process
from an operational angle and the fact we&#8217;re now going to get
multiple perspectives on this is very positive,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stockholm, London &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cinnober Financial Technology AB, a Stockholm-based company
that offers trading and clearing platforms, will bid for the
project, according to the list. MillenniumIT, owned by the
London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE), will also bid. The Colombo, Sri
Lanka-based unit provides systems to the LSE, London Metal
Exchange, Icap Plc and Turquoise, an alternative venue owned by
the London market operator, the company&#8217;s website said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s good to have competition,&#8221; James Angel, a finance
professor at Georgetown University in Washington, said in a
phone interview. &#8220;A lot of the names are the usual suspects
such as Finra and Nasdaq and other financial players, but some
aren&#8217;t. It&#8217;s an interesting mix of financial-data companies,
exchanges and big IT companies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Computerized Trading &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC, hurt by criticism that it doesn&#8217;t have the data to
analyze high-speed computerized trading, approved a rule in July
requiring the exchanges and Finra, known as self-regulatory
organizations, to produce a plan to establish the audit trail.
The SEC must approve the submission by the 17 exchanges and the
private-sector regulator, which oversees almost 4,300 brokerage
firms, before it can be built. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC Chairman Elisse Walter said she hopes the audit-trail
initiative can be expanded beyond stocks and options to include
equities traded in the U.S. without being listed on American
exchanges, bonds and futures. In addition to monitoring markets
and analyzing market crashes, a well-constructed data initiative
could be used to inform how new regulations are written, she
said in a speech on Feb. 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I can&#8217;t overestimate the importance of CAT,&#8221; Walter
said. &#8220;Comprehensive public and non-public data about the
market, coming from a single system, could be the most important
regulatory development in my lifetime.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Consolidated Trail &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The self-regulatory organizations tasked with proposing the
plan for the consolidated audit trail can bid for the job of
constructing and managing it. Finra said last year it wanted to
build and administer the data system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A document prepared for a conference for potential bidders
on Jan. 29, before the publication of the official request-for-
proposal, or RFP, included a disclosure that said exchange or
Finra officials attending the meeting would represent the views
of the group instead of their organization. Some personnel may
assist with the group&#8217;s efforts and an SRO&#8217;s RFP response, the
document said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exchanges and Finra said last month they would
establish an advisory group to offer input on the audit-trail
development process and consider how the plan may affect brokers
and the broader industry. Participants will include individuals
from the Financial Information Forum, Securities Industry and
Financial Markets Association, and Security Traders Association,
according to the notice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Identification Codes &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That group may discuss issues such as customer
identification codes, different scenarios for how orders are
handled within the data system, conflicts of interest and
funding alternatives for the audit trail, the notice said. It&#8217;s
different from the SEC-mandated advisory committee that will be
formed once the regulation governing the audit trail goes into
effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group responsible for the audit-trail plan will hold a
conference for organizations submitting bids on Friday. Bids are
due on April 25, according to the group&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomson Reuters Corp. and SunGard Data Systems Inc. will
also seek to win the contract to build and manage the audit
trail. The former is a data and news provider while the latter
offers trading and risk management systems. Bloomberg LP, the
parent company of Bloomberg News, competes with Thomson Reuters
in supplying financial news and information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other firms offering consulting, telecommunications, data
and technology systems that intend to submit offers for the
audit-trail initiative include Sapient Corp. (SAPE), Wipro Ltd., Grant
Thornton LLP, Capgemini Financial Services USA Inc., BT Group
Plc (BT) and GXS Inc. GXS, a spinoff of General Electric Co., helped
develop the Basic computer language, according to a company
history on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broad interest in the audit-trail project isn&#8217;t surprising,
Sang Lee, managing partner at Boston-based research firm Aite
Group LLC, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For those technology vendors and exchanges with
substantial technology business, it gives them the opportunity
for revenue generation as well as becoming the central hub for
data collection and dissemination,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) investors turned
back calls for a future split of the two top jobs held by
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger, rejecting the
demands of three state pension funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixty five percent of shareholders voting opposed the
split, Disney said today at its annual meeting in Phoenix. The
company&#8217;s executive compensation and bonus plans passed, and
Iger was re-elected to the board with 98 percent support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors in Disney, the world&#8217;s largest entertainment
company, were considering a proposal by the Connecticut
Retirement Plans  Trust Funds to split the roles of chairman
and CEO going forward. Iger, who plans to step down as CEO in
March 2015, led Disney to a 76 percent total shareholder return
for the fiscal year ended in September, the company has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He&#8217;s had phenomenally good performance,&#8221; said Kannan
Ramaswamy, a professor of management at the Thunderbird School
of Global Management in Glendale, Arizona, who spoke before the
meeting. &#8220;Shareholders should be happy. This was not the most
opportune time to pick a fight.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney reached an all-time closing high yesterday of
$56.48. The shares fell 0.2 percent to $56.36 at the close today
in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) was fined 561
million euros ($731 million) by European Union regulators for
violating the terms of a settlement to give users a choice of
web browsers aside from its Internet Explorer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s fine -- about 1 percent of the company&#8217;s 2012
revenues -- brings to 2.24 billion euros the penalties imposed
on Microsoft in its EU antitrust clashes over the past decade,
including an initial 899 million-euro fine for failing to obey
an order to share data with competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest software maker agreed in 2009 to offer
access to other browsers as a part of a settlement to repair its
relationship with the bloc&#8217;s regulators. The company said last
July it only learned that month that it didn&#8217;t offer its browser
choice software on some 28 million computers running Windows 7
Service Pack 1, or 10 percent of the computers that should have
received it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a big fine, but it&#8217;s a big company and a
sophisticated company that made a commitment and they failed to
honor it,&#8221; said Charles Whiddington, a lawyer at Field Fisher
Waterhouse LLP in London. &#8220;Commitments are really important to
the commission because they lubricate the efficiency of its
policing of the rules.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft took &#8220;full responsibility for the technical
error that caused this problem and have apologized for it,&#8221; the
company said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Candid Assessment&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We provided the commission with a complete and candid
assessment of the situation, and we have taken steps to
strengthen our software development and other processes to help
avoid this mistake -- or anything similar -- in the future,&#8221;
Microsoft said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based company fell 1.3 percent to
$27.98 at 12:02 p.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer&#8217;s yearly
bonus was cut last year to $620,000, partly as a result of the
company&#8217;s browser problems with the EU and also due to the
disappointing performance of its online services unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft ended more than 10 years of EU antitrust
investigations with its 2009 pledge to give consumers who bought
personal computers using its software a choice of the 12 most
widely used browsers to install in addition to, or instead of,
Internet Explorer. The company told regulators in December 2011
that it was complying with its commitment to display a browser-
choice screen to Windows operating system users. The new fine
marks the first time a company has been sanctioned for failing
to stick to the terms of a legally binding settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think Twice &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said regulators
were &#8220;more naive than today&#8221; in letting Microsoft monitor its
own compliance. In the future, the EU will detail what they
expect from a trustee appointed to monitor a settlement and
check reports more carefully, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I hope this decision will make companies think twice,&#8221;
Almunia told reporters today. &#8220;We trusted in the reports about
the compliance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) is negotiating its own settlement with EU
regulators to end a probe into claims it discriminates against
competitors in its search results. Microsoft, the operator of
the Bing search engine, is one of several companies that have
complained about Google&#8217;s behavior. Almunia said last month that
an accord could be finalized later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fourth Penalty &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The penalty is the fourth levied on Microsoft since it was
fined 497 million euros in 2004 for abusing its position as the
world&#8217;s largest supplier of desktop software to hinder rivals
for server and media programs. It was fined 280.5 million euros
in 2006 and another 899 million euros in 2008 for not supplying
interoperability information to server rivals on fair terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 899 million-euro penalty was reduced to 860 million
euros by the EU&#8217;s General Court last year. That fine is only
exceeded by a 1.06 billion-euro sanction against Intel Corp.
which is also being challenged in court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla Corp. General Counsel Harvey Anderson said in an
October blog post that daily downloads of his company&#8217;s Firefox
browser fell by 63 percent prior to Microsoft fixing the
browser-choice issue and that the company may have lost as many
as 9 million potential downloads as a result of the glitch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft was also warned by the EU last year to modify how
it presents Internet Explorer in Windows 8 to avert another
antitrust clash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google&#8217;s Chrome was the most popular web browser globally
in February, with 37 percent of market share, according to
statistics from web analytics firm StatCounter. Microsoft&#8217;s
Internet Explorer followed with 30 percent, while Mozilla&#8217;s
Firefox accounted for just over a fifth of users. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s Fabio Bicudo and Antonio Pereira will become co-heads of the Brazil
investment-banking business after Daniel Wainstein retired from
the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bicudo and Pereira are currently co-chief operating
officers of the business, the New York-based firm said today in
internal memos. The contents of the memos were confirmed by a
Goldman Sachs spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs had been discussing the changes with
Wainstein for the past several months, a person at the firm said
yesterday, asking not to be identified because the decision
hadn&#8217;t yet been announced. Wainstein, 42, and Andre Laport Ribeiro are Goldman Sachs&#8217;s only partners in Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wainstein, who asked to leave after working at the firm
since 2000, was appointed chairman of Brazil investment banking
in April 2012, when Pereira and Bicudo were named co-COOs. The
bank ranked sixth in equity underwriting in Brazil last year,
with $732 million in transactions, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. It was No. 8 among merger advisers with $14.3 billion in
deals, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bicudo and Pereira are members of the board of Goldman
Sachs Bank in Brazil and serve on the company&#8217;s management
committee for the country. Bicudo joined Goldman Sachs in 1999
and stayed until 2006. He came back to the company in 2010.
Pereira joined the firm in 1996 in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Paulo Leme &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which doesn&#8217;t disclose Brazil revenue or
profit, named Paulo Leme as chairman for the country a year ago.
Goldman Sachs has said its strategy in Brazil is to focus on
complex products with higher profit margins, such as convertible
debt and receivables securitization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. and international banks are competing against Brazil-
based companies such as Bradesco BBI SA, Banco Itau BBA SA and
Banco BTG Pactual SA, which have used their stronger local
contacts to squeeze out foreign firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs completed its strategy to become a full-
service bank in Brazil in 2009, after two failed attempts to buy
local firms. In 1998, Goldman Sachs tried to buy Banco de
Investimentos Garantia SA, which was acquired by Credit Suisse
Group AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven years later it sought to purchase Banco Pactual SA,
an investment bank later acquired by UBS AG. Pactual was sold
back to BTG Partners in 2009 and is now Banco BTG Pactual SA.
BTG went public last year in a $1.94 billion initial offering
that Goldman Sachs helped underwrite. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) said it filed patent-
infringement lawsuits yesterday against generic-drug makers
including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) to prevent them
from selling a low-cost version of the painkiller Celebrex until
December 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer won a ruling in 2008 preventing Teva from entering
the market until May 2014. In that case, an appeals court
invalidated a patent that expires in December 2015. Pfizer said
yesterday that it had persuaded the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office to reissue that patent with changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    Celebrex, also known by its active ingredient
celecoxib, generated $1.75 billion in U.S. sales last year, the
company said Jan. 29. Each day that Pfizer can delay generic
competition means about $5 million in revenue for the New York-
based company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reissued patent -- RE44084 -- covers methods of
treating osteoarthritis with celecoxib. In addition to Petach
Tikva, Israel-based Teva, the world&#8217;s largest maker of generic
drugs, Pfizer said it sued Mylan Inc., Actavis Inc. (ACT), Lupin Ltd. (LPC)
and Apotex Inc. in federal court in Virginia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Continued development of new medicines that enhance
patient lives is supported by protecting intellectual property
and innovation,&#8221; Pfizer General Counsel Amy Schulman said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AstraZeneca Says Australian Court Invalidated Crestor Patents &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), maker of the Nexium ulcer drug and the
Xylocaine topical anesthetic, said an Australian court found
three patents protecting its Crestor anti-cholesterol drug to be
invalid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a March 5 statement, the London-based pharmaceutical
company said the Federal Court of Australia invalidated one
patent covering Crestor&#8217;s formulation and two others related to
the use of the compound in the treatment of high blood
cholesterol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annual sales of the drug in Australia have reached about
A$350 million ($359 million), according to the statement.
AstraZeneca said it&#8217;s evaluating options, including filing an
appeal. The Australian patents were challenged by Apotex Pty
Ltd., Watson Pharma Pty Ltd. and Ascent Pharma Pty Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, a federal appeals court in the U.S. issued a
ruling blocking generic versions of the drug from coming onto
the U.S. market until July 2016. The drug generated $2.3 billion
in sales in the U.S. in the first nine months of 2012, and
accounts for 22 percent of the company&#8217;s revenue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Louis Vuitton Tells Chinese Hairdresser His Furniture Infringes &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC), the French luxury-
brand company, accused the owner of a Hong Kong-area beauty
salon of trademark infringement for using a covering on its
chairs that the company says infringes its mark, the South China
Morning Post reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The salon owner said the luxury-goods company is demanding
a published apology and money damages, according to the
newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The furniture came from Shenzhen, in China&#8217;s Guangdong
Province, and the salon owner said he was unaware the pattern
belonged to Louis Vuitton, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He told the newspaper he couldn&#8217;t afford to pay what Louis
Vuitton is seeking, even after the luxury-goods company cut its
damages request in half, and that he may have to close. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philips Wins Challenge to Spectrum&#8217;s &#8216;Steam Glide&#8217; Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Philips Electronics NV (PHIA) successfully challenged a U.K.
trademark belonging to Spectrum Brands Holdings Inc. (SPB)&#8217;s Russell
Hobbs Ltd. unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union&#8217;s Court of Justice affirmed a lower-
court holding that the &#8220;Steam Glide&#8221; trademark registered by
Salton Europe in 2008 for use with irons was too generic to be
afforded protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salton changed its name in 2009 to Russell Hobbs, which
merged with Spectrum Brands Holdings Inc. of Madison, Wisconsin,
in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russell Hobbs argued that the combination of &#8220;steam&#8221; and
&#8220;glide&#8221; acts to &#8220;stimulate the imagination to create a mental
image of suspension and hovering, which does not in fact
exist.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court disagreed, saying &#8220;the smooth movement of an
iron across clothes, which results from the steam, corresponds
to what the consumer may expect from a product of that type, the
description of that movement by the word in question thus does
not &#8216;conjure up&#8217; an image of hovering but is clearly descriptive
of a very real characteristic of the goods in issue.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court said there was nothing unusual about combining
the two English words, and &#8220;there is no perceptible difference
between the expression &#8216;steam glide&#8217; and the mere sum of the
words of which it is composed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spectrum&#8217;s appeal was dismissed and the court said the
Madison-based company had to pay its own costs, the costs of the
European trademark authority and Philips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Spectrum Brands (UK) Ltd. v. Office for the
Harmonization of the Inner Market (Trademarks and Designs), T&#8209;
544/11, General Court, European Court of Justice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ikos Co-Founder Coward Sues Hedge Fund Over Software Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Coward, the co-founder of Ikos Asset Management
Ltd., sued his estranged wife&#8217;s businesses in a U.K. court over
ownership of copyrights to software that runs the hedge fund&#8217;s
trading platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coward was the &#8220;architect&#8221; of the &#8220;bedrock of the family
business,&#8221; he created with Elena Ambrosiadou, his lawyers said
at the start of a three-week trial in London yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Practically all of the financial markets expertise at
Ikos resided in Coward,&#8221; said Michael Bloch, his lawyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ikos, a hedge fund with $1.36 billion in assets under
management that uses computer algorithms to spot profitable
futures markets trades, has been embroiled in litigation
involving Coward and other former employees around the globe.
The estranged couple, who started divorce proceedings in Greece
in 2009, have filed more than 40 lawsuits against each other in
at least four countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambrosiadou, who was dropped as a defendant in the suit and
is expected to testify this week, has denied Coward&#8217;s version of
events -- dating back to how the company was formed in 1995. The
couple&#8217;s &#8220;relationship has turned toxic,&#8221; Bloch told the
court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coward, who left Ikos in 2009, paid 50,000 pounds ($75,800)
in damages and apologized to Ambrosiadou in January for
providing divorce papers containing personal information to
journalists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambrosiadou &#8220;has tried to get Coward sent to prison,&#8221; for
allegedly copying software, put tracking devices on his car and
wire-tapped their family home, Bloch said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coward, who faces criminal charges in Monaco and Cyprus,
was &#8220;caught red-handed stealing&#8221; the software, lawyers for
Ikos said in documents filed at the London court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ikos counter-sued Coward for copyright infringement and
breach of confidence for downloading the software, described as
the fund&#8217;s &#8220;crown jewels, on which the entire business is
based,&#8221; according to the filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Electronic-theft laws need to be introduced in U.K. and
Europe,&#8221; Ambrosiadou said in response to an e-mail requesting
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Coward v Phaestos Limited, U.K. High Court of
Justice, Chancery Division, case no. HC10C02788 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;EU to Quiz Germany Over Draft Rules for Google&#8217;s News Clips &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany will be questioned by European Union regulators
over a draft law that limits what Google Inc. (GOOG) and other so-
called aggregators can use to bundle news clips on the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU regulators analyzed the bill passed by German
parliamentarians last week and will seek further information
from the country&#8217;s government, Carlo Corazza, a spokesman for
the European Commission, said in an e-mail. The Brussels-based
authority received complaints over the draft law on ancillary
copyright, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google and others may continue to show short news items on
their websites without being required to pay, German lawmakers
decided in last week&#8217;s parliamentary vote. German publishers
including Axel Springer AG (SPR) and Bertelsmann SE, which face
falling revenue from newspapers and magazines, have argued that
search engines and aggregators like Google News should pay for
displaying short excerpts from news stories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishers would retain the exclusive right of use for any
content exceeding &#8220;single words or very small text excerpts,&#8221;
under the draft agreed last week. The bill by Germany&#8217;s Justice
Ministry gives publishers one year during which they have the
sole rights to commercially use their journalistic content. The
draft needs to be approved by Germany&#8217;s upper house before it
can enter into force. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Al Verney, a spokesman for Google in Brussels, declined to
comment. Mountain View, California-based Google said last week
in response to the German vote that &#8220;ancillary copyright in its
most damaging form has been stopped&#8221; and the best outcome for
Germany would be no new legislation that may threaten
innovation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, which doesn&#8217;t display ads on its news aggregator
pages in Europe, argued that its so-called snippets are actually
helping publishers by driving traffic to their sites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corazza referred to EU rules that seek to cut technical
standards set by one country which may hamper trade across the
27-nation bloc. He didn&#8217;t say who complained to the EU
regulator. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. lacked viable
options to adding MTBE to gasoline, a witness told a New
Hampshire jury that will decide whether the company is liable
for contaminating drinking water with the chemical. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Irving, Texas-based oil company is trying to persuade a
jury that federal law required the use of the additive, methyl
tertiary butyl ether, to combat air pollution and that it didn&#8217;t
harm anyone in New Hampshire. The company began presenting its
case March 4 in Concord. The trial started Jan. 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Eizember, an Exxon Mobil executive who was in charge
of dealing with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulations
in the 1990s, said it had to blend MTBE with gasoline because
other companies were adopting the chemical. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the Northeast in particular we don&#8217;t control our
proprietary distribution system,&#8221; Eizember told the jury today.
&#8220;We share a lot of terminals. We share almost all the
pipelines. Sharing the facilities greatly increases the
reliability, but it means I can&#8217;t do something different
necessarily than someone else is doing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross-examining Eizember, Jessica Grant, a lawyer for the
state, asked if he had been aware that another Exxon Mobil (XOM)
executive had warned the company in a report that if MTBE leaked
into the groundwater the costs of monitoring and cleaning it up
would be high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No, I was led to believe the opposite,&#8221; Eizember said.
&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t aware of any information that said we needed to take
increased remediation costs into consideration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adequate Warnings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victor Dugan, a former Exxon employee, testified March 5
that MTBE was extensively researched before it was added to fuel
and that its benefits outweighed the risks. He also said
gasoline dealers and distributors were given adequate warnings
about the hazards of gasoline and how to deal with leaks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil is the last defendant in the state&#8217;s
$818 million lawsuit alleging oil companies knew MTBE would
contaminate groundwater and didn&#8217;t alert the state to the risks.
New Hampshire seeks damages based on the company&#8217;s share of
gasoline sales in the state, which an economist said was about
30 percent. With an estimated cost of $818 million to test,
monitor and clean up wells, New Hampshire might be seeking at
least $245 million from the company. Exxon Mobil said using
refinery data would have shown a market share as low as 6.9
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Underground Leak &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Maryland on Feb. 26 a court of appeals reversed two jury
verdicts against Exxon Mobil. The plaintiffs won $1.65 billion
in two cases alleging financial and property damage from an
underground leak in 2006 that released MTBE into the water. The
appeals court said Exxon Mobil hadn&#8217;t made fraudulent statements
and the plaintiffs failed to show physical harm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire&#8217;s suit is one of scores of cases involving
MTBE filed since 2000 against refiners, fuel distributors and
chemical makers. Other MTBE lawsuits were consolidated in
federal court in New York for pretrial evidence-gathering and
motions. In 2009, a federal jury ordered Exxon Mobil to pay New
York City $104.7 million after finding it liable for polluting
wells in the city. Exxon Mobil has appealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2003, New Hampshire sued Exxon Mobil, Shell Oil Co.,
Sunoco Inc., ConocoPhillips (COP), Irving Oil Ltd., Vitol SA, Hess
Corp. (HES) and Citgo Petroleum Corp. All except Exxon Mobil reached
settlements with the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reduce Pollution &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil has argued in court that in adding MTBE to
gasoline it was complying with federal regulations, which pre-
empt state law. The additive was used to make gasoline burn more
thoroughly to reduce air pollution, as required under the 1990
Clean Air Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies by the American Petroleum Institute were cited in
court showing that at mid-to-high levels of ingestion or
inhalation MTBE elevated the risk of brain tumors, liver cancer,
blood cancer and kidney cancer in mice and rats. Exxon Mobil
said there has been no evidence that MTBE causes illness in
humans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is simply no MTBE crisis,&#8221; Charles Engelmann, an
Exxon Mobil spokesman, said in an e-mail. &#8220;MTBE hasn&#8217;t been
used in the state since 2005 and there is not a single personal
injury being claimed in this lawsuit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MTBE is highly soluble in water and can be carried great
distances from the source of leaks. It leaked from gas stations,
vehicle junkyards, underground storage tanks and pipe fittings,
the state said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state estimated that about 40,000 New Hampshire wells
are contaminated with MTBE and that 5,590 have levels determined
to be unfit for drinking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is New Hampshire v. Hess Corp., 03-C-0550, New
Hampshire Superior Court, Merrimack County (Concord). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest overhaul of financial
regulation since the 1930s is creating one of the largest
sources of revenue growth for JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), according to
managing director Carlos Hernandez. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank said it expects the investor-services unit, one of
three parts of the corporate and investment bank, to boost
return on equity by about 4 percentage points in coming years as
the firm helps customers comply with rules governing how swaps
trades are executed, collateralized and cleared. That compares
with drops of about 2 percentage points in the CIB&#8217;s banking
section and 3 percentage points for the markets unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The secular trend for these clients is the constant need
to reduce execution costs,&#8221; Hernandez, global head of investor
services, said in an interview at his office in New York. &#8220;It&#8217;s
creating pressure from our clients to become more efficient.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The swaps market is being regulated for the first time
after some contracts helped to amplify the credit crisis and
made it more difficult for international regulators to know how
interconnected banks had become following the 2008 failure of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Mandatory swaps clearing begins
March 11 for dealers including JPMorgan and their largest
customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Revenue Tailwinds &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules may cost JPMorgan $1 billion to $2 billion in
revenue, according to a Feb. 26 presentation. To reduce this
loss, the fees it can charge customers to help them trade, clear
and collateralize swaps may produce new revenue of $300 million
to $500 million by 2015, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There will be other parts of the house that are
impacted,&#8221; such as the swaps-trading desks that will see
compression in bid-offer spreads, Hernandez said, referring to
the difference in what the bank charges to buy and sell a swap.
&#8220;The headwinds in some businesses are the tailwinds for our
investor-services business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan earned $5 billion in 2008 trading over-the-counter
fixed-income derivatives, including swaps, as the collapse of
Lehman Brother Holdings Inc. that year widened bid-ask spreads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those days are unlikely to return as rules meant to add
transparency to swaps prices allow investors to know levels at
which derivatives are trading before they buy or sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standardizing contract terms so they can be processed by
clearinghouses and requiring trades to be done on regulated
exchanges or similar systems will further cut dealer profits by
more closely aligning trading with the futures market, where
banks earn smaller fees for executing and clearing trades for
clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dodd-Frank &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hernandez&#8217;s group will offer trade execution, collateral
management, clearing services, prime brokerage and fund
financing and administration, he said. The unit acts only as an
agent for its clients and doesn&#8217;t trade directly with them,
Hernandez said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I tell everybody it&#8217;s like flying a plane with one
passenger or 200 passengers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Because of the fixed
costs associated with an airplane, the marginal cost of those
199 people is low.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dodd-Frank Act is requiring most swaps trades in the
U.S. to be backed by clearinghouses, which require upfront
collateral. Global bank regulations are compelling lenders to
keep more cash and easy-to-liquidate investments on hand to
protect against losses. That may boost demand for high-grade
assets by $2 trillion to $4 trillion, according to an April 2012
report from the International Monetary Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Transforming Collateral &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as $6.7 trillion in additional collateral may be
needed to satisfy new bank capital rules and swaps-clearing
mandates, securities-industry consultant Finadium LLC said in
December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scarcity of cost-effective assets to back swaps trades has
led some market users to engage in so-called collateral
transformation, in which lower-rated securities are exchanged
for cash or highly rated securities. The extent of that
transformation will depend on whether banks and money managers
believe too few assets are available to cover their swaps
positions, Finadium said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fees for collateral transformation are included in the $300
million to $500 million revenue estimate JPMorgan made last
month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Empresas Copec SA (COPEC), Chile&#8217;s largest
pulp exporter, fell to a two-month low after JPMorgan Chase 
Co. recommended selling the stock, citing high valuation and
slower growth prospects than its regional peers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copec dropped 1.7 percent to 7,970 pesos at 4:25 p.m. in
Santiago, its lowest level on a closing basis since Jan. 8. The
benchmark Ipsa index fell 0.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan initiated coverage of the stock with a rating
equivalent to sell and a year-end price target of 7,300 pesos,
saying the stock&#8217;s valuation isn&#8217;t &#8220;compelling&#8221; even when
taking into account growth prospects, analysts Lucas Ferreira
and Rodolfo R. De Angele said in a research note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The lack of clear stock catalysts should limit re-rating
potential, while valuation remains close to a cyclical peak,&#8221;
the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copec is trading at 27.6 times its estimated earnings,
above its five-year average ratio of 21.8, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Klabin SA (KLBN4) and Duratex SA (DTEX3) will show higher
returns, JPMorgan said in the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also initiated coverage of Empresas CMPC SA (CMPC),
Chile&#8217;s second-largest pulp exporter, with the equivalent of a
hold rating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s
largest energy company by market value, said the head of its
Egypt and Cyprus unit was released safely with his wife after
&#8220;being held briefly&#8221; by kidnappers in Egypt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy Wells and his wife were held by gunmen in Sinai
earlier today demanding the release of defendants in an arms
smuggling case, Mahmoud El-Hifnawy, head of security in South
Sinai, said by phone. Exxon Mobil said the couple were released
without being harmed, according to Alan Jeffers, a company
spokesman, in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sinai has been the site of several kidnappings of tourists
since the start of the uprising that ousted Hosni Mubarak in
2011, highlighting the diminished ability of the country&#8217;s
police force to provide security. Two Americans and their
Egyptian tour guide were taken hostage in the peninsula for four
days in July before being released safely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nokia Oyj (NOK1V), the Finnish mobile-phone
maker attempting a comeback with handsets running Microsoft
Corp. software, expects to pay its partner about a net 500
million euros ($650 million) as part of the companies&#8217; accord. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sum will be paid over the remaining term of the
agreement, Nokia said today in a statement, without disclosing
the duration of the pact. Nokia, based in Espoo, Finland, also
reiterated its long-term financial targets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company teamed up with Microsoft two years ago to
challenge Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPhone and devices using Google Inc.&#8217;s
Android operating system, choosing Windows over Android which
Google gives away for free. The effort has yet to reverse
declines in Nokia&#8217;s smartphone market share, though sales of the
company&#8217;s flagship Lumia increased last quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia is paying Microsoft license fees for the Windows
Phone software, while receiving payments from its partner for
supporting its push into the wireless business. Support payments
from Microsoft will still this year exceed royalty payments made
to the software maker, Nokia said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Nokia, which reported a seventh straight drop in
quarterly revenue in January, closed 1.6 percent higher at 2.79
euros in Helsinki. The stock has lost more than 80 percent since
the iPhone and the Android software were introduced in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia said in January that future royalty payments to
Microsoft will probably exceed support payments received,
without disclosing the amount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Targets Repeated &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said today it keeps trying to boost its devices
unit&#8217;s operating profit, excluding some items, to 10 percent of
sales or more, while targeting faster revenue growth than the
market as a whole. In the fourth quarter, that margin was 1.3
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia&#8217;s forecast compares with an average analyst
projection for 2015 operating margin of 6.1 percent, Sami Sarkamies, an analyst at Nordea Bank AB in Helsinki, said in a
note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia also said Chief Executive Officer Stephen Elop&#8217;s
compensation for 2012 declined to 4.33 million euros from 7.94
million euros a year earlier, as stock and option awards
declined and he received no bonus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
largest U.S. bank by assets, will name new managing directors
every two years instead of annually as it overhauls a process
adopted 17 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After recipients are announced at the end of 2013, the firm
won&#8217;t select managing directors until 2015, the firm wrote in an
internal memo. David Wells, a spokesman for the New York-based
bank, confirmed the contents of the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs created the managing director title in 1996
to recognize top employees who weren&#8217;t yet partners. The firm
promoted 266 employees to managing director in 2012, up from 261
a year earlier. About 7.2 percent of the bank&#8217;s employees hold
the title. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A biennial process will allow us to invest more in the
managing-director selection process so that it will continue to
be a disciplined and rigorous exercise,&#8221; the bank said in the
memo. &#8220;This will help to ensure that the managing director
title remains as aspirational as it should be for our top
performers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business Insider reported the change earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managing directors typically receive a base salary of
$500,000, lower than the $900,000 granted to partners. Both also
get bonuses that can boost their total compensation into the
millions of dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first class of 87 managing directors included William C. Dudley, now president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York; Clifford S. Asness, who left in 1998 to start hedge fund
AQR Capital Management LLC; and Richard J. Gnodde, who was named
co-head of global investment banking at Goldman Sachs in May
2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The number of managing directors at Goldman Sachs has
grown as a percentage of our population since the first class,
reflecting the growth of our business and the expansion of our
global footprint,&#8221; the firm said in the memo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) hired Kate Richdale from Morgan Stanley (MS) to head investment banking services
for Asia excluding Japan as the Wall Street firm looks to
strengthen client relationships in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 13-year Morgan Stanley veteran will be responsible for
covering clients, according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg
News. Richdale, who was head of investment banking for Asia-
Pacific at Morgan Stanley, was also made a partner at Goldman
Sachs, according to the document. Edward Naylor, a Hong Kong-
based spokesman at the bank, confirmed the memo&#8217;s contents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richdale&#8217;s departure follows Morgan Stanley&#8217;s deferral of
bonuses for some senior bankers and traders over three years, a
person briefed on the matter said in January. Goldman Sachs paid
employees more in 2012 than the previous year on average, as
revenue surged 19 percent and it cut staff by 3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She will report to Dan Dees and Matthew Westerman, Goldman
Sachs co-heads of investment banking for the region, according
to the memo. Tim Leissner, former Asia head of investment
banking services, was promoted to vice chairman of investment
banking for the region, Naylor said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richdale will join the firm in June and be based in Hong
Kong, according to the memo. She had been head of Asian
investment banking at Morgan Stanley since March 2011 and her
previous roles at the New York-based bank included chief
executive officer for Southeast Asia, the document showed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the sixth-
largest U.S. bank by assets, can&#8217;t omit a shareholder proposal
calling for an independent chairman from its annual meeting, the
Securities and Exchange Commission said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC&#8217;s Office of Chief Counsel said it didn&#8217;t agree with
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s claim that the proposal was &#8220;inherently vague
or indefinite,&#8221; according to a letter dated March 5 that was
posted today on the agency&#8217;s website. The proposal says that the
bank must appoint a chairman that&#8217;s independent of management
whenever possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 58, has also
held the chairman role since he took the firm&#8217;s helm in 2006.
That&#8217;s similar to the structure at Morgan Stanley (MS) and JPMorgan
Chase  Co., while Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. have
separate roles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposals that call for an independent chairman at other
public companies have received more than 30 percent of votes
supporting the measures, CtW Investment Group, which submitted
the proposal, said in a letter to the SEC in January. It cited
data from Institutional Shareholder Services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs awarded Blankfein $21 million in compensation
for 2012 performance, the highest amount since 2007. The firm
had a 10.7 percent return on equity last year, and the shares
rose 41 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Morgan Stanley (MS) lagged behind peers in a key measure of capital strength used by U.S. regulators to stress-test their resiliency in a severe recession. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The three firms submitted more-optimistic estimates of their capital strength and ability to avoid losses on trading and lending than Federal Reserve projections released yesterday for the 18 biggest U.S. banks. Of the three, the gap was widest for Goldman Sachs, which predicted that its Tier 1 common ratio may fall as low as 8.6 percent in a sharp economic downturn, compared with the central bank&#8217;s 5.8 percent estimate. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The disparities -- including a gap of 1.3 percentage points for JPMorgan -- raise the risk that some banks may have been too aggressive while seeking Fed approval to distribute capital to investors through dividends and share repurchases. The companies must maintain Tier 1 common ratios of at least 5 percent under their capital plans. The Fed is set to release the results of those requests next week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you came in with rosier assumptions than the Fed&#8217;s own baseline, then you&#8217;re definitely at risk of failure&#8221; in the capital request, said Christopher Whalen, executive vice president at Carrington Investment Services LLC. &#8220;The Fed is going to push back on those banks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, all based in New York, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Shares Decline &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs dropped 2.3 percent to $152.98 in New York, the second-biggest decline in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. The Bloomberg Banks Stress Test Index, which includes all 18 firms subject to yesterday&#8217;s test, declined 0.2 percent. JPMorgan fell 0.9 percent to $50.20 and Morgan Stanley dropped 0.8 percent to $23.03. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Auto lender Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY) had a capital ratio of 1.5 percent, the lowest of the firms tested. Detroit-based Ally, which is majority-owned by the U.S., disputed the Fed&#8217;s results, calling the analysis &#8220;inconsistent with historical experience&#8221; and &#8220;fundamentally flawed.&#8221; The company predicted its capital ratio would be 5.7 percent under the Fed&#8217;s scenario, according to a filing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The results are a prelude to the Fed&#8217;s capital-plan review of the same banks scheduled for release on March 14. Yesterday&#8217;s results don&#8217;t forecast next week&#8217;s because the first test excludes management&#8217;s plans, a Fed official said yesterday on a conference call with reporters. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Banks have said they were coming into this year&#8217;s process more cautious even as investors of the six biggest U.S. lenders were anticipating capital payouts that could total $41 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Conservative Plan &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz told analysts in January that the firm works closely with regulators to ensure it has a &#8220;conservative capital plan.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan scaled back its $15 billion share-buyback program by at least 20 percent and hopes to boost the bank&#8217;s 30-cent quarterly dividend, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said this year. The bank&#8217;s buyback request was about half of last year&#8217;s program, the Financial Times reported today, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter. Joe Evangelisti, a company spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley CFO Ruth Porat said in January that her firm only requested approval for buying the remaining 35 percent of its brokerage venture from Citigroup Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not asking for a lot won&#8217;t help lenders if the assumptions they use aren&#8217;t appropriately cautious, said Richard Bove, a bank analyst with Rafferty Capital Markets LLC. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even if they were conservative in their request, the capital plans will be turned down if the assumptions were too aggressive,&#8221; Bove said in a phone interview. &#8220;The Fed risks looking like it caved to pressure&#8221; if it doesn&#8217;t reject those plans, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Market Risk &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley both cited market risk rules under new international capital requirements, which increased risk-weighted assets, as a reason their capital ratios fell in the test. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We were surprised that the brokers&#8217; capital ratios came so close to the 5 percent minimum requirement, which could limit capital returns,&#8221; Brennan Hawken, an analyst at UBS AG, wrote in a research note. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hawken had estimated that Goldman Sachs would request a $5 billion buyback. That amount would be larger than the firm&#8217;s buffer above the 5 percent minimum, he said. Morgan Stanley&#8217;s 5.7 percent ratio makes a capital return less likely in the second half of the year, Hawken said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The banks were hurt by their trading risk, analysts said. The six biggest firms were projected to lose $97 billion on trading in nine quarters through 2014, compared with $116.5 billion in losses estimated in last year&#8217;s test, the central bank said. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan had the most such risk, with the Fed projecting losses of $24.9 billion and $23.5 billion, respectively. JPMorgan said its trading losses would be $17.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Volatile Business&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a much more volatile business,&#8221; said Jennifer Thompson, an analyst at Portales Partners LLC. &#8220;In a stressed environment you will have potentially massive losses. The offset should be that they are getting better returns from those businesses. Theoretically, it should all equal out.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Citigroup, the only U.S. bank among the six biggest to have its capital plan rejected last year, saw its Tier 1 common ratio fall to 8.3 percent under the central bank&#8217;s projections. The company sought permission to repurchase $1.2 billion of its shares without seeking a dividend increase, Citigroup said in a presentation after the Fed posted its report. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Offset Dilution &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The planned buyback would &#8220;offset estimated dilution created by annual incentive compensation grants,&#8221; the New York-based lender said in the presentation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since the 2008-2009 financial crisis, U.S. regulators have tried to minimize the odds of another taxpayer rescue, compelling banks to retain some earnings and reinforce their buffers against possible losses. The Fed said the aggregate Tier 1 common capital ratio for the 18 banks would fall from an actual 11.1 percent in the third quarter of 2012 to 7.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014 under its scenario. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Tier 1 common ratio measures a bank&#8217;s core equity, made up of common shares and retained earnings, divided by its total assets adjusted for risk using global banking guidelines. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, projected that its key capital ratio wouldn&#8217;t fall below 7.6 percent, compared with 6.3 percent estimated by the central bank. The lender said pretax losses through 2014 would total $200 million while the Fed said they would be $32.3 billion. JPMorgan also was more optimistic than the Fed in estimating net revenue, loan losses and provisions it would need to cover those losses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Morgan Stanley &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley estimated its Tier 1 common ratio could fall to as low as 6.7 percent, 1 percentage point higher than the Fed&#8217;s projection. The bank&#8217;s estimate for net revenue in the stressed period was $5.1 billion higher than the Fed&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Managements probably need to be a little bit more optimistic, the Fed&#8217;s a regulator,&#8221; Stifel Financial Corp. (SF) CEO Ronald Kruszewski told Matt Miller in an interview on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;Fast Forward&#8221; program. &#8220;That&#8217;s not unusual.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Fed&#8217;s minimum projected ratio for Bank of America Corp. (BAC), which didn&#8217;t request buybacks or a dividend increase last year, would drop to 6.8 percent in the most adverse scenario while Wells Fargo  Co.&#8217;s would be 7 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Losses for the 18 firms, which represent more than 70 percent of the assets in the U.S. banking system, would total $462 billion over nine quarters, according to the Fed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Under the Fed&#8217;s worst-case scenario -- where U.S. gross domestic product doesn&#8217;t grow or contracts for six straight quarters, unemployment peaks at 12.1 percent and real disposable income falls for five consecutive periods -- the 18 companies would lose $316.6 billion on soured loans, led by Bank of America. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based firm would lose $57.5 billion, followed by $54.6 billion for Citigroup and $54 billion each for Wells Fargo and JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Home Loans &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Home loans were the largest source with $60.1 billion in projected losses on first mortgages and $37.2 billion on junior liens and home-equity loans. Bank of America would face $24.7 billion in losses, as San Francisco-based Wells Fargo would incur $23.7 billion, the Fed estimated. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next-largest source of bad debt was credit cards, which the Fed estimated would cost banks $87.1 billion. Citigroup, the world&#8217;s biggest credit-card lender, led loss estimates with $23.3 billion. Capital One Financial Corp. (COF), which gets more than half its revenue from credit cards, would lose $16.4 billion. The lender&#8217;s own analysis estimated credit card losses at $13.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The stress analysis and underlying assumptions are informed by a number of factors, including our experience in the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent recession,&#8221; McLean, Virginia-based Capital One said in a presentation on its website. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Capital One &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a share of a company&#8217;s loans, Capital One&#8217;s portfolio performed worst, with losses amounting to 13.2 percent of its holdings, according to the Fed. That compares with 6.9 percent for Bank of America and 7.7 percent for JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon, 56, expressed confidence about the outcome of the stress test when he spoke to analysts and investors last week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Whatever happens, the company will be fine, as long as we can freely compete with everybody else in the world,&#8221; Dimon said Feb. 26 at the company&#8217;s investor day. &#8220;That, to me, is the most important thing of all.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects to remove reference to energy shares in the
second paragraph.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should favor U.S. equities
over European or emerging-market shares, according to Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, chief investment officer for Goldman Sachs
Group Inc.&#8217;s private wealth-management unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said she&#8217;s bullish on bank shares because they are
cheap even after the industry in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index
rallied 8.1 percent this year. The group has a price-earnings
ratio of 11, compared with 15.3 for the U.S. equity benchmark,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;U.S. equities, in the long-run, are the place where
clients should have their core assets, relative to Europe or
emerging markets,&#8221; Mossavar-Rahmani said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mossavar-Rahmani recommended investors underweight
government bonds and predicted inflation will remain low.
Investors shouldn&#8217;t expect stocks to return as much as they have
in the past few years, she said. The SP 500 is up 129 percent
since March 9, 2009. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty sees &#8220;big data&#8221;
services, which let customers mine vast troves of information to
make better decisions, as the company&#8217;s biggest focus this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s certainly everything around big data and
analytics,&#8221; Rometty said in a brief interview last night when
asked about IBM&#8217;s priority in 2013. She had just given a speech
in front of the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, where
she emphasized that data will give companies and governments a
competitive advantage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I want you to think about data as the next natural
resource,&#8221; she told the audience of business and political
leaders. Data-based insight helped reduce crime by 30 percent in
Memphis, Tennessee, and correctly predicted the outcome of swing
states for President Barack Obama&#8217;s campaign, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For IBM, the capabilities are helping it break into new
overseas markets and sell services covering a wider range of
tasks -- from traffic management to weather monitoring to
payroll. About 80 percent of growth is coming from outside the
U.S., she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM increased its 2015 sales forecast for data analytics to
$20 billion last week, from an earlier goal of $16 billion.
Revenue from the category in 2010, when IBM first set he goal,
was about $10 billion. Since 2005, IBM has spent more than $16
billion on 35 acquisitions to boost its analytics capabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of the Armonk, New York-based company climbed 0.5
percent to $210.38 at the close in New York. The stock has risen
9.8 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Monitoring Workers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Businesses are using analytics to track individual employee
performance and treat customers based on personal preference,
she said. That means they don&#8217;t have to make as many blanket
assumptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You will see the death of the average,&#8221; Rometty said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analytics also will help companies fight the mounting
threat of cybercrime by predicting where the next attack might
happen, Rometty said. She called on countries to work together
on a data-based strategy, instead of individual legal
approaches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If every country tries to regulate this themselves, you
will have a standstill and a great vulnerability,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hollywood may finally have found a successful way back to Oz. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s &#8220;Oz the Great and Powerful,&#8221; opening in theaters today, marks the latest attempt to reimagine the classic story from L. Frank Baum, seven decades and two flops after the 1939 classic. Projections have risen on positive social-media buzz, with Boxoffice.com increasing its estimate for U.S. weekend tickets sales by 17 percent to $75 million. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Oz&#8221; is also the biggest bet yet on Hollywood&#8217;s strategy du jour -- mining famous tales to create new stories with modern special effects and humor. Studios have released more than a dozen such films in the past three years, with Disney&#8217;s 2010 &#8220;Alice in Wonderland&#8221; the most successful. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger is leaning on characters known to fans worldwide through books, movies or comics to generate higher profit from his volatile film division. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Disney seems to be collecting every myth, legend and fantasy in the Western world with Marvel, the Muppets, Winnie the Pooh and Star Wars,&#8221; said Jonathan A. Kuntz, a film historian at the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television. &#8220;It&#8217;s no surprise they&#8217;ve grabbed onto &#8216;Oz.&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The strategy can pay off when a film clicks with fans. Barton Crockett, an analyst at Lazard Capital Markets who recommends Disney stock, estimates the picture will generate about $400 million in worldwide ticket sales and about $200 million in home-video revenue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;If it has stronger international box office than domestic, an increasingly common occurrence with big event movies like this, the movie could become nicely profitable,&#8221; Crockett said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Film Cost &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;With a budget of about $225 million, the new &#8220;Oz&#8221; cost more than &#8220;Alice&#8221; and &#8220;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,&#8221; based on estimates for those earlier films from IMDB.com and Box Office Mojo, two industry websites. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;SNL Kagan, which assesses film profit prospects based on production budgets, marketing costs and estimates of revenue, said Disney will make profit from &#8220;Oz.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The movie probably will fall between &#8220;Alice,&#8221; which had $334.2 million in domestic sales, and &#8220;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,&#8221; which tallied $292 million, SNL Kagan said today in an e-mailed report. &#8220;Alice&#8221; scored 3.21 on the Kagan Profitability Index and &#8220;Narnia&#8221; 3.11. Films exceeding 1.75 generally make money. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Family Films &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Oz&#8221; fits neatly into Burbank, California-based Disney&#8217;s strategy of releasing family friendly films based on established brands. The studio lost $200 million last year on &#8220;John Carter,&#8221; a movie based on a lesser-known book series from Edgar Rice Burroughs, the creator of Tarzan. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new &#8220;Oz&#8221; features James Franco as Oscar Diggs, a circus con artist who gets caught in a tornado that delivers him to that magical land. There he matches wits with an evil witch played by Rachel Weisz. The film is directed by Sam Raimi, whose three Spider-Man films for Sony Corp. (6758) grossed a combined $2.5 billion worldwide. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exhibitors were skeptical of &#8220;Oz&#8221; a year ago at an industry convention, saying the film &#8220;seemed a little talky without much action,&#8221; according to Matthew Harrigan, a Wunderlich Securities analyst in Denver who has a hold rating on Disney stock. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;They are now very upbeat,&#8221; Harrigan said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;International Role &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;That should ward off comparisons with &#8216;Jack the Giant Slayer,&#8217;&#8217; last weekend&#8217;s Warner Bros. release based on the classic children&#8217;s tale &#8220;Jack and the Beanstalk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That film, produced at a cost of about $200 million, collected $27.2 million in its U.S. debut, with the studio, a division of Time Warner Inc. (TWX), now counting on international ticket sales and home video to take up the slack. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Internationally, we&#8217;ll do very well,&#8221; said Jeff Goldstein, Warner&#8217;s executive vice president of domestic distribution. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Oz&#8221; producer Joe Roth, a former chairman of Disney&#8217;s studio, also cites a growing foreign market for U.S. films. He&#8217;s produced three reimagined classics, including &#8220;Alice&#8221; and &#8220;Snow White and the Huntsman,&#8221; and is working on &#8220;Maleficent,&#8221; based on the villain from Disney&#8217;s animated feature &#8220;Sleeping Beauty.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Five years ago you wouldn&#8217;t have a movie released in China or you wouldn&#8217;t collect a nickel out of Russia,&#8221; Roth said in an interview last year with Bloomberg Television. &#8220;And these are gigantic markets that are coming on board.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Oz History &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The name Oz is no guarantee of success. In 1985, Disney released &#8220;Return to Oz&#8221; to domestic box office sales of $11.1 million, according to IMDB.com. That was less than half the $25 million production budget. Universal Pictures produced &#8220;The Wiz&#8221; with Michael Jackson and Diana Ross in 1978. The $24 million movie took in $13 million from U.S. theaters. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new film hasn&#8217;t won over critics. &#8220;Oz the Great and Powerful&#8221; earned a rating of 44 out of a possible 100 at Metacritic.com, a website that aggregates published reviews. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney is marketing &#8220;Oz&#8221; heavily, running interviews with the stars on the otherwise ad-free Disney Channel and sneak previews at its California Adventure theme park. The company closed Hollywood Boulevard for the premiere, erecting a big balloon evoking memories of the 1939 film. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Warner Bros. will release a 3-D conversion of the original &#8220;The Wizard of Oz&#8221; this year to commemorate the 75th anniversary, Ronnee Sass, a studio spokeswoman, said in an interview. The picture also will be available on Blu-ray disc and in digital formats, she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Film Slate &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney rose 1.9 percent to $57.39 at 4 p.m. in New York, a new closing high. The stock has gained 15 percent this year, compared with 8.8 percent for the SP 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company will release 10 movies in 2013. That compares with 38 a decade ago, according to researcher Box Office Mojo. Of the 10, two are Marvel sequels, two are Pixar spinoffs, and two, &#8220;Oz&#8221; and &#8220;The Lone Ranger,&#8221; resurrect well-known tales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since purchasing Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm Ltd. for a combined $15 billion in the past seven years, Iger is limiting his releases largely to those familiar nameplates, and Disney&#8217;s own label. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;In a sea of unbelievable choice, relentless choice, I do think that you have some advantage if you&#8217;ve got a good brand,&#8221; Iger told the Hollywood Radio  Television Society in January. &#8220;Our film strategy has largely evolved to basically branded films, franchise, branded films.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Christopher Palmeri in Los Angeles at cpalmeri1@bloomberg.net; Michael White in Los Angeles at mwhite8@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Anthony Palazzo at apalazzo@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s $600 million
foray into creating motor fuels from algae may not succeed for
at least another 25 years because of technical hurdles, Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, scientists haven&#8217;t been able to develop a strain of
algae that reproduces quickly enough and behaves in a manner
that would produce enough raw material to supply a refinery,
Tillerson said in an interview that aired yesterday on PBS
television&#8217;s &#8220;Charlie Rose&#8221; show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve come to understand some limits of that technology,
or limits as we understand it today, which doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s
limited forever,&#8221; Tillerson said. The venture is &#8220;probably
further&#8221; than 25 years away from successfully developing fuels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the world&#8217;s biggest maker of gasoline and diesel,
has been studying the potential for algae-based fuels for 3 1/2
years in a joint venture with J. Craig Venter&#8217;s Synthetic
Genomics Inc. When the project was announced in July 2009, Exxon
predicted it could produce fuels in five to 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon gained 0.3 percent to $88.97 at the close in New
York. The shares have increased 2.8 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon and Synthetic Genomics announced plans in 2009 to
build a greenhouse near San Diego to test various algae strains.
The goal was &#8220;to produce a new source of oil,&#8221; Emil Jacobs,
Exxon&#8217;s vice president of research, said during a July 14, 2009,
conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Basic Science &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venter, best known for his role in the sequencing of the
human genome in the 1990s and early 2000s, said during the same
call that algae ponds would produce 10 times as much fuel as the
ethanol fed by corn fields covering the same amount of space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What we&#8217;ve come to understand is the hurdle is pretty
high and the hurdle seems to exist at the basic science level,
which means it&#8217;s even more difficult to solve,&#8221; Tillerson said
yesterday. &#8220;These are very challenging problems.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientific barriers to cultivating the sort of &#8220;super
algae&#8221; Exxon sought have induced the industry to focus on
&#8220;robust, cheap local strains of algae that aren&#8217;t exotic,&#8221;
said Riggs Eckelberry, chairman and CEO of OriginOil Inc. (OOIL), a Los
Angeles-based algae-extraction company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Algae may turn out to be better suited to use as a polymer
precursor and a blending agent that will boost the energy
content of fuels made from waste products such as sawdust,
rather than as a replacement for crude, Eckelberry said in a
telephone interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OriginOil rose 4.5 percent to 55 cents. The stock lost 69
percent of its value in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) cut its
recommendation on emerging market dollar-denominated government
bonds to neutral, as investors withdraw funds and falling yields
limit returns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan downgraded the debt from overweight, analysts led
by Joyce Chang wrote in a report dated yesterday. The New York-
based bank kept a buy recommendation on local-currency bonds in
developing nations and advised clients to maintain bets on gains
in emerging-market currencies, including the South Korean won,
the Indian rupee and South African rand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funds focused on emerging-market dollar debt experienced
outflows in three of the past five weeks, a scenario last seen
in May, according to the JPMorgan report. The bank&#8217;s EMBI Global
Index of developing-country dollar notes has dropped 1.7 percent
this year, as yields fell to a record-low 4.4 percent in
January, cutting their advantage over U.S. Treasuries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the market may be due for some consolidation,
with the most crowded positions appearing more vulnerable,&#8221; the
analysts wrote. &#8220;Return opportunities for investment-grade
emerging-market sovereign debt are more limited.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors in emerging markets will continue to shift funds
out of sovereign dollar debt and into local-currency and
corporate bonds because of the higher returns, the analysts
said. Emerging dollar debt yielded 4.84 percent yesterday,
compared with 5.51 percent on local-currency notes and the 4.58
percent yield for corporate bonds, according to JPMorgan&#8217;s
indexes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan survey last month showed investors reduced
holdings of emerging-market government debt to the lowest level
since October 2008 as rising U.S. Treasury yields eroded the
allure of the assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Venezuelan Debt &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries touched 2.08 percent
today, the highest level since April 2012 based on closing
prices, after a government report showed U.S. employers added
more jobs than forecast and the unemployment rate in the world&#8217;s
largest economy unexpectedly fell to four-year low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan recommends investors retain an overweight position
in Venezuelan bonds, as the yields, currently at 9.67 percent,
are high enough to compensate investors amid uncertainty over
the political climate following President Hugo Chavez&#8217;s death
this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should be underweight Argentinean debt, JPMorgan
says, citing legal risks as the government fights a group of
bondholders demanding payments on securities related to the
nation&#8217;s 2001 default in a U.S. court. High-yielding corporate
bonds from companies including Petroleos de Venezuela SA and
Mexico&#8217;s Cemex SAB de CV (CEMEXCPO), as well as Russian financial companies
will probably gain, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) raised its
three-month outlook for raw materials to &#8220;overweight&#8221; after
prices declined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index will
advance 3 percent in 12 months, led by gains of 7 percent in
industrial metals, 5 percent in livestock and 3 percent in
energy, the bank said in its monthly asset allocation report
dated yesterday. On Feb. 8, Goldman forecast a 1 percent return. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The recent sell-off in commodities on worries about
Chinese growth is overdone in our view and we upgrade to
overweight on a 3-month horizon,&#8221; Jeffrey Currie, head of
commodities research in New York at the bank, said in the
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP GSCI Enhanced gauge slid 5.6 percent the past four
weeks and is down about 0.5 percent this year. Hard red winter
wheat traded in Kansas City is down the most, at 12 percent this
year and copper fell 2.9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman forecasts copper will rise to $9,000 a metric ton
in six months as demand from top consumer China picks up &#8220;both
seasonally and on the back of continued growth in construction
completions, property sales and power infrastructure related
demand,&#8221; Currie said in the report. Prices will fall to $8,000
a ton in 12 months as Chinese construction completions diminish,
the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper for delivery in three months fell 0.5 percent to
$7,729 a ton by 10:19 a.m. in the London Metal Exchange. Brent
oil for April delivery dropped 0.6 percent to $110.52 a barrel
on the London-based ICE Futures Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limited supplies of oil will support front-month prices
near current levels, while longer-dated Brent pries will be
&#8220;well-anchored&#8221; at about $90 a barrel, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron&#8217;s
commitment to cutting Britain&#8217;s debt isn&#8217;t working and is
leaving the country in a similar position to the &#8220;weaker&#8221;
euro-area nations, Goldman Sachs Asset Management Chairman Jim O&#8217;Neill said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political expediency will lead Cameron and Chancellor of
the Exchequer George Osborne to change their strategy as the
2015 election approaches, O&#8217;Neill said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television&#8217;s Mark Barton in Cernobbio, Italy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;ve put themselves into a bit of a box&#8221; with an
unwavering commitment to debt reduction, O&#8217;Neill said. &#8220;The
strategy of the coalition, three years in, is &#8216;let&#8217;s cut debts,&#8217;
and what has it done other than in fact not cut debts?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Cameron and Osborne get closer to the election they
will need to rethink their strategy, O&#8217;Neill said. Osborne is
facing pressure to ease the pace of his fiscal-consolidation
plans in his March 20 annual budget as the economy stagnates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re now into the second half of their office and it
makes common sense for them that they cannot just carry on,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Whatever they call it, they will shift the broad net
fiscal stance because it doesn&#8217;t seem to be delivering what they
thought it would.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unclear what further quantitative easing by the Bank
of England would do to improve the U.K. economy as the weakness
of the pound is increasing import costs and &#8220;cramping&#8221;
consumers, O&#8217;Neill said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beach Energy Ltd. (BPT) said the Cooper
Basin region in Australia&#8217;s outback, where it&#8217;s searching for
natural gas with Chevron Corp. (CVX), will be a &#8220;major onshore
petroleum province.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The region, straddling the South Australia and Queensland
state borders, may have enough gas to allow exports, Reginald Nelson, managing director of the Adelaide-based company, said in
an interview yesterday with Australian Broadcasting Corp.
television, according to a transcript. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment of as much as $349 million by Chevron in
Beach&#8217;s exploration follows shale investments by ConocoPhillips,
Statoil ASA, BG Group Plc and Hess Corp. in Australia, a nation
estimated by the U.S. Energy Information Administration to have
the world&#8217;s sixth-biggest potential reserves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This reinvigorates the Cooper as a gas producing province
and it&#8217;s one of the major onshore gas producing areas in
Australia,&#8221; Nelson said. &#8220;If the volumes are there then
clearly there&#8217;s opportunities to look at export potential.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s is the biggest single investment in Australian
shale. Beach shares have risen 15 percent since the announcement
on Feb. 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cooper Basin may help supply $60 billion of projects to
export liquefied natural gas from Australia&#8217;s east coast,
according to a Jan. 11 report from Commonwealth Bank of
Australia. Domestic gas prices in eastern Australia may double
to A$10 a gigajoule between 2014 and 2019 after the LNG projects
in Queensland begin shipments to Asia, according to Macquarie
Group Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty, who took the job in
January 2012, earned $16.2 million in compensation last year,
including $9.26 million in stock awards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total figure was almost double the $8.3 million she
made the previous year, when she was a senior vice president in
charge of sales at IBM, the company said today in a filing. The
pay package included $1.5 million in salary and $3.92 million in
non-stock incentive pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rometty has overseen IBM during a period of profit growth,
even as sales remain sluggish. The Armonk, New York-based
company said in January that earnings would be at least $16.70 a
share in 2013, beating analysts&#8217; estimates and sending the stock
on its biggest one-day gain in a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rometty runs the ninth-largest company by market value and
has emerged as one of the best-paid female leaders in corporate
America, topping the level of Meg Whitman and other high-profile
CEOs. Whitman earned $15.4 million at Hewlett-Packard Co. in
2012 -- only 70 percent of her targeted compensation because the
struggling company missed its goals for the year. PepsiCo Inc.&#8217;s
Indra Nooyi, meanwhile, received $17.1 million in 2011. Her pay
for last year hasn&#8217;t been released yet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The yen may decline to its weakest
level in almost four years versus its U.S. counterpart if a key
support level fails to hold, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Japanese currency will face a test at the 97-to-97.80
zone, according to Niall O&#8217;Connor, a technical analyst at
JPMorgan in New York. The yen may depreciate to 100, which would
be its lowest level since April 2009, if it breaches that
support level, O&#8217;Connor said. The currency fell 3 percent over
the five days ended March 8, its biggest weekly decline since
November 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Depending on how dollar-yen progresses toward the 97-
to-97.80 area, the next big zone could come in between 99 and
100,&#8221; O&#8217;Connor said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yen decreased 0.1 percent to 96.06 per dollar at 11:51
a.m. in New York after reaching 96.26. The currency fell 0.1
percent to 125 per euro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s currency may strengthen back to 93.50 if it moves
past a key resistance zone from 94.10 to 94.75, according to
O&#8217;Connor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That would be near-term negative for dollar-yen and
suggest that it could move lower,&#8221; O&#8217;Connor said. &#8220;But those
initial levels should probably hold and maintain the more
immediate upside bias.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yen fell 2.6 percent over the past week among the 10
developed-nation currencies monitored by the Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar gained 0.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index. Resistance refers to an area on a chart where
sell orders may be gathered, and support is an area where there
may be buy orders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil prices will be supported by
emerging market demand, a lack of spare supply and improvements
in transporting U.S. output, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relatively low oil inventories around the world, limited
spare capacity in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries and continued demand growth among emerging-market
economies will sustain the market&#8217;s current &#8220;backwardation,&#8221;
where prices for immediate and near-term delivery exceed those
for later, Goldman Sachs said in a report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premium of the front-month April Brent contract over
May was at 47 cents today on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
London. The grade has been in backwardation since July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs also forecast that a glut of crude at
Cushing, Oklahoma, the main U.S. depot for the New York
Mercantile Exchange, will shift to a &#8220;large deficit&#8221; in the
second quarter. Completion of refinery maintenance and new
pipeline capacity from the Permian basin to the U.S. Gulf Coast
starts will divert crude away from Cushing, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Substantial pipeline debottlenecking in North America
during the second quarter is expected to support second and
third quarter West Texas Intermediate prices,&#8221; the Goldman
Sachs analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of these changes, Goldman Sachs predicted a
three-month return of 6 percent for petroleum investments, and
said the price spread between Brent and WTI will narrow
substantially to average $7.50 a barrel this year. Brent was at
a $18.44 a barrel premium to WTI today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;William Demant Holding A/S (WDH) rose to
its highest price in more than two weeks in Copenhagen trading
after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said shares in Denmark&#8217;s biggest
hearing-aid maker are undervalued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WDH gained as much as 1.9 percent to 487 kroner, the
highest since Feb. 21. The stock added 1.8 percent to 486.50
kroner at 9:15 a.m. in the Danish capital, with trading volume
at 43 percent of the three-month daily average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WDH, which last month reported sales and profit that missed
analyst estimates, had before today lost 1.2 percent of its 2012
market value. That compares with a 28 percent jump for its
biggest Danish rival GN Store Nord A/S (GN) and an 11 percent
increase in the Nasdaq OMX Copenhagen 20 index in the same
period. In a note distributed today, Goldman raised its
recommendation on WDH&#8217;s stock to buy from neutral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe that the stock&#8217;s recent underperformance has
created an attractive entry point,&#8221; Veronika Dubajova said in
the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Smoerum, Denmark-based company on Feb. 26 reported 2012
revenue of 8.56 billion kroner ($1.49 billion), missing the
average estimate of 8.66 billion kroner in an analyst survey.
Net income fell to 1.15 billion kroner, missing the estimate of
1.19 billion kroner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB,
Mexico&#8217;s second-largest publicly traded bank, rallied the most
in a week after entering a consulting agreement with
International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock advanced 2.2 percent to 93.53 pesos at the close
of Mexico City trading. It was the second-biggest advance on the
Mexican IPC index of stocks, which fell 0.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10-year agreement will allow Mexico City-based Banorte
to cut costs as a percentage of revenue while increasing the
bank&#8217;s return on equity to more than 20 percent, the companies
said in a statement today on PR Newswire. Banorte&#8217;s ROE in 2012
was 14.3 percent, according to its year-end report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is very good news,&#8221; Rafael Escobar, an analyst with

said in a telephone interview. &#8220;The investments in technology
will be useful to Banorte.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the agreement, Armonk, New York-based IBM will

&lt;p&gt;Doctors should be aware of
potential risks to patients with heart conditions when
prescribing the antibiotic azithromycin, U.S. regulators said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration today updated the labeling
information on the drug to reflect increased risk of fatal
irregular heartbeats in patients. Research published last year
found that the pills, used to treat infections, caused a small
increase in cardiovascular deaths, especially among people with
a higher risk of heart problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Health-care professionals should consider the risk of
fatal heart rhythms with azithromycin when considering treatment
options for patients who are already at risk,&#8221; the FDA said in
a statement today on the label change. The agency said
azithromycin isn&#8217;t alone in carrying heart risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zithromax is made by Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, and multiple generic manufacturers, and sometimes
goes by the names Zithromax, Zmax or Z-Pak. The medicine
generated about $435 million for New York-based Pfizer in 2012.
It&#8217;s prescribed to treat bacterial infections of the respiratory
system and urinary tract and for tonsillitis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has updated the label on the drug, said Lauren
Starr, a company spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The majority of patients treated with Zithromax
(azithromycin) are not affected by this label update,&#8221; Starr
said in an e-mail. The drug &#8220;has had a well established benefit
risk profile for more than 20 years and continues to be an
effective treatment option for patients all over the globe
suffering from many types of bacterial infections.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer fell 1.1 percent to $27.94 at the close in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

time this year as smaller, cheaper alternatives to the iPad gain
favor with consumers, according to IDC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devices running Google&#8217;s Android software will climb to 49
percent of the market in 2013, while Apple&#8217;s share will slip to
46 percent, IDC said in a statement today. Last year, Apple
commanded 51 percent, compared with Google&#8217;s 46 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machines introduced since the iPad&#8217;s debut in 2010 --
including Google&#8217;s own Nexus tablet and products from Amazon.com
Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. -- are gaining ground with
prices starting around $200, less than half the cost of the
newest iPad model. Apple released the iPad mini in October,
charging $329 for the most affordable version, in a bid to
defend its market dominance amid mounting competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;One in every two tablets shipped this quarter was below 8
inches in screen size,&#8221; Jitesh Ubrani, an analyst at IDC, said
in the statement. &#8220;We expect smaller tablets to continue
growing in 2013 and beyond.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global shipments will reach 190.9 million units this year,
IDC said, higher than its prior prediction for 172.4 million.
The tablet market will surge to 350 million units by 2017. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kvaerner ASA (KVAER), a Norwegian builder
of oil platforms, climbed the most in more than four months in
Oslo trading after winning a $1.5 billion contract from Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM) in Canada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kvaerner rose as much as 8.1 percent, the biggest intraday
gain since Oct. 31, and traded up 4 percent at 12.9 kroner as of
12:23 p.m. local time. Trading volumes today have already
surpassed the three-month daily average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon awarded Kvaerner an engineering, procurement and
construction-services contract for the Hebron heavy-oil project
off Canada&#8217;s eastern coast, according to a statement today. That
may ease investor concern that rivals of the Fornebu-based
company were beating it to new orders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a strategically important project for us,&#8221;
Kvaerner&#8217;s executive vice president responsible for concrete
solutions, Bjoern Gundersen, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kvaerner has slumped more than 20 percent in two months,
dropping as much as 6.6 percent on Jan. 21 after losing out on a
$1.1 billion contract for the Aasta Hansteen gas project to
Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. Competitors Daewoo Shipbuilding 
Marine Engineering Co. and SembCorp Marine Ltd. (SMM) have also won
so-called topside contracts this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total value of the Hebron project to Kvaerner is about
8.5 billion kroner ($1.5 billion), including about $240 million
of work already conducted, Pareto Securities ASA said in an e-mailed note. &#8220;New work is thus 7.1 billion kroner, below our 9
billion-kroner estimate but largely in line with consensus.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yme Opportunity &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kvaerner, which was spun off from Aker Solutions ASA (AKSO) in
2011, may also benefit from a decision by Talisman Energy Inc. (TLM)
and SBM Offshore NV (SBMO) to scrap a platform at the Yme field in the
Norwegian North Sea, Nordea Bank AB said in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possible work at Yme &#8220;could provide a new home-market
opportunity for Kvaerner from a client badly burned by poor
execution,&#8221; Nordea said. &#8220;The absence of home-market topside
awards has made investors question Kvaerner&#8217;s business model.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topside describes the upper half of an offshore oil
platform, on which equipment is installed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aker ASA, which owns about 28 percent of Kvaerner, has
urged the company to focus on regaining market share in Norway
rather than bidding for higher-risk international projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Securities Exchange
LLC, an electronic options-trading forum, is set to renew legal
hostilities with Chicago Board Options Exchange Inc. in a fight
over a patent covering automated trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jury selection began yesterday at the federal courthouse in
Chicago for a trial that U.S. District Judge Joan Lefkow told
the prospective panelists may last into early April. The case is
one of at least four legal disputes between Deutsche Borse AG-
owned ISE and CBOE Holdings Inc. (CBOE), the Chicago-based operator of
the biggest U.S. options exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The evidence will establish that CBOE deliberately copied
ISE&#8217;s patented system for executing trades,&#8221; New York-based ISE
said in a court filing last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competition is increasing among derivatives-exchange
operators including NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ) ISE
in a March 1 regulatory filing revealed plans to start a second
options market called Topaz which, if approved, would be the
12th such U.S. forum. Nasdaq OMX owns three of the venues while
CBOE and NYSE Euronext (NYX) have two each. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISE&#8217;s patent scrap with the Chicago Board Options Exchange
began with a complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan in
2006. The case was transferred to Chicago after CBOE counter-
sued there, seeking a finding of non-infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISE seeks a royalty and lost profits, as well as either an
injunction barring further infringement or royalties for the
balance of the patent&#8217;s life. The patent expires in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBOE contends in court papers that ISE did nothing more
than acquire a patent for a method that had already been used
elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Automating such floor-based trading is far from new,&#8221;
the Chicago exchange&#8217;s lawyers said in a pretrial brief filed
last month. CBOE argued that the ISE patent claims lack
innovation and should be declared invalid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lefkow declared the patent invalid in March 2011. A federal
appeals court reversed that ruling in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Chicago Board Options Exchange Inc. v.
International Securities Exchange LLC, 07-cv-00623, and
International Securities Exchange LLC v. Chicago Board Options
Exchange Inc., 07-cv-04709, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of Illinois (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IIPSC to Offer IP Insurance Policy for Small Companies &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intellectual Property Insurance Services Corp., a 25-year-
old insurance company based in Louisville, Kentucky, has begun
offering an insurance product aimed at inventors and small
companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a company statement, the product is for
individuals and companies with one to three patents, patent
applications, trademarks or trademark applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policies offer coverage of as much as $500,000 and
terms of as many as three years, with a 10 percent copayment.
This specific policy doesn&#8217;t cover software or website patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pre-existing infringement excludes the infringing activity
from coverage, according to the company statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intellectual Property Insurance Services Corp. was founded
in 1988 by Robert W. Fletcher, a chemical engineer turned patent
lawyer, who has served as a patent counsel for Standard Oil Co.
and General Electric Co. (GE) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;EPO Says Patent Applications Increased 5.2 Percent in 2012 &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Patent Office experienced a 5.2 percent
increase in patent filings last year over the previous year&#8217;s
total. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a statement from the EPO, in 2012 it received
257,744 filings. Top country filers were the U.S., with 24.6
percent of all applications, followed by Japan, with 20.1
percent; Germany, with 13.3 percent; China, with 7.3 percent;
and Korea, with 5.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Korea&#8217;s Samsung Electronics Co. was the leading corporate
filer. This is the first time an Asian company won the top spot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greatest number of applications was filed in the
medical-technology area. In that area, 42 percent of the
applicants came from the U.S. The EPO said that 60 percent of
all applications in the transportation segment -- including
automobiles and air transport -- came from European Union member
countries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wild Squirrel Changes Name to Wild Friends After Trademark Fight &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wild Squirrel Nut Butter, a specialty food company begun in
2011 by two University of Oregon students, has changed its name
in the wake of two trademark suits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tualatin, Oregon-based company, which produces sesame
cranberry peanut butter and chocolate sunflower seed almond
butter, changed its name to Wild Friends, according to a March 4
blog posting. The posting makes no reference to the litigation,
saying instead that &#8220;we chose it to call out the wild flavors
we create, and the friendly ingredients we use.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 10, Wild Squirrel filed suit in Portland, Oregon,
seeking a declaration it didn&#8217;t infringe trademarks belonging to
Squirrel Brand Holdings LP of McKinney, Texas, which sells nuts
and candy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Oregon company said it had received a cease-and-desist
notice from Squirrel Brand Holdings and asked the court to find
that it didn&#8217;t infringe and wasn&#8217;t competing unfairly with the
Texas company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two days later, Squirrel Brand holdings filed its suit in
federal court in Sherman, Texas, saying the Oregon company
infringed trademarks and that customers were likely to be
confused by the name similarity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both cases were dismissed in November 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wild Squirrel&#8217;s case is Wild Squirrel LLC v. Squirrel Brand
Holdings LP, 3:12-cv-01239-HZ, U.S. District Court, District of
Oregon (Portland). Squirrel Brand Holdings&#8217; case is Squirrel
Brand Holdings LP v. Wild Squirrel LLC, 4:12-cv-00429-RC-ALM,
U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas (Sherman). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diageo&#8217;s &#8216;Guinness&#8217; Dispute With Aqualife to Be Heard April 12 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Russian soft-drink manufacturer&#8217;s trademark dispute with
London-based Diageo Plc (DGE) over the &#8220;Guinness&#8221; trademark is set
for April 12 in Moscow Commercial Court, the Russian Legal
Information News Service reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqualife, which is a parallel importer of Guinness, has
claimed the Diageo&#8217;s Russian &#8220;Guinness&#8221; trademark should be
terminated and that the U.K.-based company isn&#8217;t using the brand
in Russia, according to the news service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Diageo said the company is using the brand,
which is associated with an Irish beer made since 1759, the news
service reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presently Guinness is being imported under license into
Russia by Heineken NV (HEIA), according to the news service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applied Microcircuits Registers &#8216;Hardsilicon&#8217; as U.S. Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applied Microcircuits Corp. (AMCC), a Sunnyvale, California-based
semiconductor manufacturer, registered &#8220;hardsilicon&#8221; as a
trademark March 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office, Applied Microcircuits filed an application in July 2011
to register the mark. The company said it plans to use the term
for semiconductors, circuit boards and central processing units. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Disney&#8217;s Oz Lacks Ruby Slippers Because of Copyright Issues &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s &#8220;Oz the Great and
Powerful,&#8221; which sold more than $80 million worth of tickets
this past week, has many merchandise tie-ins, the famed ruby
slippers won&#8217;t be part of the product mix, the Los Angeles Times
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s because such items as the slippers and Dorothy&#8217;s
distinctive blue gingham dress are from the 1939 &#8220;Wizard of
Oz&#8221; film and, as such, are Time Warner Inc. (TWX)&#8217;s Warner Bros.
unit&#8217;s intellectual property, according to the Times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lutz Miller, who heads consumer-products company Kloters
Trading Corp., told the Times that having two large companies
simultaneously offering different takes on the same intellectual
property -- the out-of-copyright novels by L. Frank Baum -- is
unprecedented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warner Bros., the Times reported, is planning an Oz-related
television program, and many of its own new products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hacked Belgrade Billboard Displays File-Sharing Website Logo &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An electronic billboard on Belgrade&#8217;s Republic Square was
recently hacked and its advertising display replaced with the
logo of the Pirate Bay file-sharing site, according to the
TorrentFreak anti-copyright news website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students who did the hacking said their intention was
primarily to demonstrate how poorly protected some computer
systems are, according to TorrentFreak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They told TorrentFreak that while raising awareness of poor
computer security was their primary aim, they also wanted to
support Pirate Bay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pirate Bay is the closest thing they have to a free
apolitical independent worldwide organization that supports
their values, according to TorrentFreak. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;China Cyber Attacks Harm U.S. Bid for Tighter Ties, Donilon Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s campaign of cyberespionage against U.S. companies
risks undermining President Barack Obama&#8217;s second-term effort to
build stronger ties with Asia, said White House National
Security Adviser Thomas Donilon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The widespread theft of intellectual property and trade
secrets through attacks &#8220;emanating from China on an
unprecedented scale&#8221; has become a point of contention with the
Chinese government, Donilon said yesterday in prepared remarks
for a speech at the Asia Society in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have worked hard to build a constructive bilateral
relationship that allows us to engage forthrightly on priority
issues of concern,&#8221; said Donilon. &#8220;The United States and
China, the world&#8217;s two largest economies, both dependent on the
Internet, must lead the way in addressing this problem.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donilon emphasized that the Obama administration intends to
keep shifting U.S. foreign policy toward Asia, a change in
direction from the Middle East that was announced in the
president&#8217;s first term. He said the policy shift wasn&#8217;t designed
to rein in China, the world&#8217;s second-largest economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebalancing U.S. priorities toward the Pacific &#8220;does not
mean containing China or seeking to dictate terms to Asia,&#8221;
said Donilon, who has helped shape Obama&#8217;s policy overseas.
Obama has &#8220;engaged with China at an unprecedented pace,
including twelve face-to-face meetings with Hu Jintao,&#8221; he
said, referring to the departing Chinese leader. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donilon said China needs to recognize the scope of the
hacking issue, take steps to halt computer espionage and start a
&#8220;constructive dialogue&#8221; with the U.S. on standards for conduct
in cyberspace. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China Galaxy Securities Co., a
brokerage backed by China&#8217;s sovereign wealth fund, picked
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. to help manage
its initial public offering in Hong Kong, two people with
knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Beijing-based firm may raise as much as $1.5 billion in
the second quarter, said the people, asking not to be identified
because the information is private. The two New York-based
banks, along with Galaxy Securities&#8217;s Hong Kong unit, will act
as sponsors and global coordinators for the offering, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central Huijin Investment Ltd., a unit of China Investment
Corp., owned 79 percent of Galaxy Securities at the end of 2011,
according to Huijin&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galaxy Securities has shortlisted more than 10 other banks
to help arrange the sale and their roles are yet to be decided,
the people said. The brokerage was forced to put on hold its
Shanghai listing plan after Chinese regulators suspended IPO
approvals, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IFR reported earlier today that China Galaxy picked 16
banks for the offering. An external spokeswoman for Galaxy
Securities declined to comment on the IPO plan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the largest
U.S. oil company, said North America may be able to export 15
percent of its natural gas output and 5 percent of oil by 2040
as the region&#8217;s production surges and demand stalls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North America probably will become a net energy exporter by
about 2025, after importing 35 percent of its oil in 2010,
Irving, Texas-based Exxon said in an energy outlook report
released today. Asia Pacific countries may import almost 40
percent of their total energy needs by 2040 as demand increases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;After decades of relatively flat production, output of
oil and other liquid fuels in North America is projected to rise
by about 40 percent from 2010 to 2040,&#8221; Exxon said in the
report. Meanwhile, &#8220;overall U.S. energy consumption is expected
to gradually plateau and then decline by about 5 percent from
2010 to 2040.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technological advances have helped tap oil and gas from
shale-rock formations, as well as extracting it from oil sands
and deep-water prospects in North America. Monthly U.S. oil
production exceeded 7 million barrels a day in November, for the
first time in 20 years. The International Energy Agency said in
November the U.S. is poised to surpass Saudi Arabia as a crude
producer in the next decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. liquefied natural gas exports will stay below 10
billion cubic feet a day, Bill Colton, Exxon&#8217;s vice president
for corporate strategic planning, said during a presentation on
the outlook at Rice University in Houston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Emissions Price &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon assumes that at some point in the next 30 years
governments around the world will begin putting a price on
carbon emissions, Colton said. Exxon sees a possible price of
$60 a ton of carbon dioxide emitted in the U.S. in 2030. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under that circumstance, the price to burn coal to generate
electricity jumps well above gas, which has about 50 percent
fewer emissions, Colton said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Coal&#8217;s got a lot of environmental pushback, wind and
solar are growing but they&#8217;re limited from a practical
standpoint, nuclear is also limited from practical and political
considerations,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That provides this huge opening for
natural gas as sort of the fuel of choice for the future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More use of gas instead of coal and increased output from
nuclear and renewable energy sources will reduce U.S.
greenhouse-gas emissions, Exxon said. Carbon-dioxide emissions
may drop more than 25 percent by 2040 to the lowest levels since
the 1970s, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blend Wall &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon wants the U.S. government to revise its rules for
blending ethanol into gasoline to cap the level at 10 percent of
total gasoline consumption, Colton said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automobile manufacturers aren&#8217;t comfortable with ethanol
making up more than 10 percent of fuel blend, he said.
Government regulations are calling for the total amount of
ethanol to be blended into gasoline this year to be greater than
10 percent of total expected gasoline demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We call it the blend wall,&#8221; Colton said. &#8220;The problem
is, when they set those mandates and they have them growing, I
don&#8217;t think they realized demand for gasoline would be
shrinking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;It&#8217;s just another reason why it&#8217;s difficult to make
gasoline, and frankly it puts cost pressures on making
gasoline,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So we think it&#8217;s in the general good to
cap it at 10 percent, and even less would be a bonus for
consumers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, Exxon released a broader report with its
global energy outlook, boosting its long-term estimate for
worldwide demand growth to 35 percent from 32 percent as
expanding populations in Africa and India use more electricity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM). Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has called the bank&#8217;s money-losing London Whale trade &#8220;harpooned&#8221; and &#8220;killed.&#8221; Today in Washington, it will be revived. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, led by retiring Senator Carl Levin, will release the panel&#8217;s findings after probing JPMorgan&#8217;s record trading loss last year. The flawed bet on credit derivatives cost the company more than $6.2 billion and stained Dimon&#8217;s 31-year Wall Street career. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s stock recovered after disclosure of the trading loss at JPMorgan&#8217;s chief investment office erased as much as $51 billion in market value. The shares have gained 14 percent this year, closing yesterday at $50.16. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s sad that investors are so complacent,&#8221; said Paul Miller, a bank analyst with FBR Capital Markets in Arlington, Virginia. &#8220;But political issues never die. It&#8217;s a chance to bring these guys up to Congress and make them shiver a little bit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Former Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew, 56, among Wall Street&#8217;s most powerful women until she resigned four days after the bank disclosed the initial trading losses, will testify tomorrow in her first public appearance since her May 14 exit. Dimon, 57, said he was &#8220;dead wrong&#8221; to dismiss as a &#8220;tempest in a teapot&#8221; news reports in early April that a trader had amassed a large and illiquid position in credit derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) shares reached an all-time high, valuing the world&#8217;s
largest provider of computer services at $236.3 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM gained 0.7 percent to $212.06 today in New York, the
highest level on record. Shares of the Armonk, New York-based
company have climbed 11 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has propelled its stock price by boosting
earnings per share, divesting underperforming units and moving
into higher-margin software businesses such as data analysis.
IBM has said it will deliver at least $20 in earnings per share
in 2015, compared with $15.25 last year. It also has set aside
$50 billion for share repurchases and $20 billion for dividends
between the end of 2010 and 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM last reached a record closing high of $211 on Oct. 16.
After the markets closed that day, IBM reported third-quarter
revenue that fell short of analysts&#8217; estimates, causing the
shares to slump for the next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with the recent gains, the shares trade at a 10
percent price-to-earnings discount to the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
Index. IBM has a PE ratio of 13.9, compared with 15 for the SP
500 information-technology index, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past month, IBM has said its data-analysis business
will perform better than expected, adding $20 billion in revenue
in 2015. That compares with an earlier goal of $16 billion. The
company also said it will double investment in mobile
technologies this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cia. Brasileira de Distribuicao
Grupo Pao de Acucar, Brazil&#8217;s biggest retailer, rose to a record
high as JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) recommended buying the stock,
citing expansion of small neighborhood stores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares (PCAR4) increased 3.9 percent to 107.87 reais at 2:34 p.m.
in Sao Paulo. A close at that level would be the highest since
October 1995, when the stock started trading. The benchmark
Bovespa index fell 0.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan raised its recommendation on the stock to the
equivalent of buy from hold as Pao de Acucar accelerated the
expansion of its high-return neighborhood minimarkets, increased
margins on its electronics unit and enhanced corporate
governance by appointing new board members. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those changes signal the beginning of a &#8220;virtuous cycle&#8221;
and will help sales grow 11 percent this year, Andrea Teixeira
and Pedro Leduc, analysts at JPMorgan, wrote in a research note
to clients today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pao de Acucar advanced 15 percent this year through
yesterday while the Bovespa slid 4.5 percent during the same
period. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. will reduce carbon-dioxide emissions in 2040 to levels last seen in the 1970s as the use of natural gas and renewables increases and efficiency measures cut demand, Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Energy-related emissions will fall 25 percent in part because of a &#8220;pronounced shift away from coal in favor of less- carbon-intensive fuels such as natural gas,&#8221; the Irving, Texas- based company said in a U.S. energy outlook report today. U.S. coal consumption will plummet more than 65 percent by 2040 and a 5 percent reduction in energy demand will also help cut emissions, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Based on what they&#8217;re assuming about energy consumption, that makes sense -- we&#8217;ve already seen some of these trends happening,&#8221; Ethan Zindler, a Bloomberg New Energy Finance analyst based in Washington, said yesterday in an interview. Exxon&#8217;s figures indicate the U.S. may still fall short of President Barack Obama&#8217;s target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020, Zindler said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Emissions from fossil fuels fell an estimated 3.9 percent in the U.S. last year, according to government data, as expanded gas production led to a 10-year low in prices. The Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement setting emissions targets, calls for member nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 18 percent below 1990 levels from 2013 to 2020. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. hasn&#8217;t ratified the Kyoto Protocol and Exxon&#8217;s figures show carbon-dioxide emissions would rise to 5 billion tons in 2025 from 4.9 billion in 1990. By 2040, the U.S. would emit 4 billion tons under Exxon&#8217;s projections. Global energy- related carbon-dioxide emissions are expected to plateau around 2030, Exxon said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;EIA Projections &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Energy Information Administration projects a 1.9 percent increase this year in energy-related carbon-dioxide emissions and a 0.7 percent rise in 2014. By 2040, it forecasts a decline of 5.1 percent from 2005 levels. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon sees U.S. gas consumption increasing more than 25 percent and nuclear power use expanding as &#8220;wind, solar and biofuels also grow sharply.&#8221; Renewables will generate about 7 percent of the nation&#8217;s power by 2040, the company said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Oil will remain the country&#8217;s most popular fuel, but oil demand is expected to fall as American vehicles become more fuel efficient,&#8221; according to the report. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Justin Doom in New York at jdoom1@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Reed Landberg at landberg@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joshua Rosner, co-author of a book
detailing Fannie Mae&#8217;s role in the housing crisis, said he sees
parallels between the failed mortgage-finance giant and the
strategies JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) uses to win government and
investor confidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, like Fannie Mae before its collapse in 2008, has
a reputation among industry executives and analysts for being
the best managed among its competitors, yet the bank still faces
more regulatory and legal actions unrelated to mortgages than
most of its rivals, Rosner, a 46-year-old analyst at Graham
Fisher  Co. in New York, wrote yesterday in a 45-page note
titled &#8220;JPMorgan Chase: Out of Control.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPM appears to have taken a page out of the Fannie Mae
playbook,&#8221; Rosner wrote, referring to the New York-based
company by its stock ticker. Fannie Mae &#8220;perfected the art of
cozying up to elected officials, dominating trade associations,
employing political heavyweights and their former staffers and
creating the image of American flag-waving, apple-pie-eating,
good corporate citizen.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosner, who was one of the first analysts to say the
housing market was overheated in 2005, doesn&#8217;t suggest that
JPMorgan has an accounting problem akin to the one that toppled
Fannie Mae and led to its government rescue. Yet he said
regulators have gone easy on the firm, which escaped fines from
bank supervisors earlier this year over control weaknesses
related to at least $6.2 billion in losses at its chief
investment office in London. The bank uses campaign
contributions and Washington influence to soften oversight,
Rosner said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment
on Rosner&#8217;s report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Early Warnings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosner was one of the first analysts to highlight
accounting and control problems about a decade ago at mortgage
finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac before each was
forced to restate earnings and oust management amid separate
earnings scandals. He was also among early analysts to warn of
an impending credit crisis in late 2006 in the residential
mortgage-bond markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had the second-largest corporate political action
committee and employed dozens of lobbyists, including former
Capitol Hill aides, at year-end, according to Rosner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s new global head of regulatory strategy, Timothy Ryan, 67, rejoined the firm this year after running one of the
industry&#8217;s largest securities trade groups, the Securities
Industry  Financial Markets Association, for five years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ellen Cooper, the chief investment
officer hired by Lincoln National Corp. (LNC) from Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) last year, is shifting the insurer&#8217;s hedge-fund bets in her
first months on the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooper, who ran Goldman Sachs&#8217;s insurance asset-management
unit, said she is moving about $125 million from so-called
multistrategy funds to managers that employ individual
approaches with low correlation to stocks and bonds. The insurer
is invested in a customized pool of funds, and Cooper declined
to name the specific investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooper, 48, is working to boost yields on Lincoln&#8217;s
portfolio of $99.1 billion amid low interest rates spurred by
Federal Reserve stimulus policies. While bonds make up more than
80 percent of the Radnor, Pennsylvania-based insurer&#8217;s
investments, Cooper said that using hedge funds and other
alternatives to increase yields is among her most important
tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m looking for better performance and less volatility,&#8221;
she said in a March 8 interview in New York. &#8220;I&#8217;m not looking
to shoot for the moon here and pray.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds have underperformed the MSCI All-Country World
Index in five of the past seven years, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Multistrategy funds fell 5.7 percent last
year on average, while the MSCI index gained. Individual
strategies with low correlation to stock and bond markets can
include funds that bet on corporate events such mergers,
spinoffs and bankruptcies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase  Co., the world&#8217;s biggest trading firms, must submit new capital plans to regulators to address weaknesses the Federal Reserve found in their planning processes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The central bank didn&#8217;t object to the capital plans of the two New York-based companies, and approved proposals from 14 other banks, the Fed said yesterday in a report. Capital plans submitted by Ally Financial Inc. and BBT Corp. were rejected, while American Express Co., the biggest U.S. credit-card issuer by customer spending, revised its submission to win approval. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The deficiencies found at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan related to projections of losses and revenue, according to a Fed official. While the two firms can immediately implement dividend and buyback plans, they must fix the weaknesses and resubmit their proposals by the end of the third quarter, the official said. Regulators, intent on preventing a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis, have run annual stress tests to see how the largest lenders would fare in a recession or economic shock to ensure that banks don&#8217;t jeopardize the financial system. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan exhibited weaknesses in their capital planning that were &#8220;significant enough to require immediate attention, even though those weaknesses do not undermine the quantitative results of the stress tests for that firm or the overall reliability of the firm&#8217;s capital-planning process,&#8221; the Fed said in a report on the test results. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) engaged in
high-risk proprietary trading under the guise of ordinary
hedging, said Senate investigators, who urged U.S. regulators to
strengthen the proposed ban on such trades known as the Volcker
rule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators should require banks that hold federally insured
deposits to explicitly link positions in derivatives to the
underlying risk they are hedging, the Senate&#8217;s Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations recommended in a 300-page report
released yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue of which trades are hedges and which are risky
bets that could destabilize a bank is the crux of a stalemate
over the Volcker rule, which was adopted as part of the 2010
Dodd-Frank Act designed to rein in systemic risks. The rule,
which is in the final stage of drafting by five U.S. regulators,
would restrict the kinds of trades permitted by banks holding
deposits insured by taxpayers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks have lobbied heavily against the Volcker rule,
arguing that it will restrict market-making and other standard
banking practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report and its recommendations, issued jointly by the
committee&#8217;s Democrats and Republicans, is expected to increase
pressure on regulators to tighten exemptions in the draft
Volcker rule. The Volcker rule was one of the most controversial
provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, generating more than 18,000
comment letters from the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank officials and regulators are scheduled to be
questioned on the report&#8217;s findings in a hearing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Increased Risk&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPMorgan&#8217;s chief investment office increased risk by
mislabeling the synthetic portfolio as a risk-reducing hedge
when it was really involved in proprietary trading,&#8221; said
Senator John McCain of Arizona, the panel&#8217;s top Republican. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subcommittee Chairman Carl Levin, a Democrat from Michigan
who sponsored the Volcker rule, said regulators should close a
loophole in an early draft of the rule that would permit broad
&#8220;portfolio&#8221; hedges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re going to continue to work very hard for a final
rule that does not allow the kind of manipulation, the kind of
concoctions that were created here by the bank to be accepted in
the name of hedging,&#8221; Levin said in a news conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subcommittee released the panel&#8217;s findings after a
nine-month probe into JPMorgan&#8217;s record trading losses that came
to light when Bloomberg News first reported them on April 5. The
flawed bet on credit derivatives by a trader in London
eventually cost the company more than $6.2 billion and stained
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon&#8217;s 31-year Wall Street
career. The trader was dubbed the &#8220;London Whale&#8221; because the
derivatives positions were so large they moved credit markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Significant Mistakes&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While we have repeatedly acknowledged significant
mistakes, our senior management acted in good faith and never
had any intent to mislead anyone,&#8221; Mark Kornblau, a spokesman
for JPMorgan, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin and Senator Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon,
sponsored the measure that eventually became known as the
Volcker rule in honor of its original proponent, former Federal
Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, and was included in the Dodd-
Frank Act. The law bars federally insured banks from proprietary
trading, or trading for their own account, while allowing
regulators to make exemptions for market-making and hedging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subcommittee found that officials at the bank&#8217;s main
regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,
expressed skepticism that the trades were a hedge. In a May 2012
internal e-mail, an OCC examiner referred to synthetic credit
portfolio as a &#8220;make believe voodoo magic &#8216;composite hedge&#8217;.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;OCC &#8216;Misinformed&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bryan Hubbard, a spokesman for the OCC, said the agency
continues to investigate the matter. As a result of the report&#8217;s
findings on regulators&#8217; shortcomings, the OCC has taken steps to
improve its supervision, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are very disappointed that the bank misinformed the
OCC which hampered our supervisory efforts,&#8221; Hubbard said in an
e-mailed statement. &#8220;We will take additional action as
appropriate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subcommittee said the investigation uncovered evidence
that bank officials portrayed the losing trades as a hedge when
internal communications suggested otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, in an April 13, 2012, earnings call, former
Chief Financial Officer Douglas Braunstein called the positions
&#8220;consistent&#8221; with the Volcker rule. However, two months
earlier, the bank made the opposite assessment, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Proprietary Trading &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Feb. 13, 2012, the bank submitted an official comment
letter to its regulators, including the OCC, expressing concern
that the credit derivatives trading might be prohibited by the
Volcker rule. In the letter, Barry Zubrow, a former risk officer
who retired in December, wrote that under the proposed Volcker
rule this activity &#8220;could have been deemed proprietary
trading.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, Ina Drew, former chief investment officer for the
bank, told Braunstein the day before the April earnings call
that the Volcker rule was a &#8220;poor fit&#8221; with the CIO&#8217;s credit
derivatives trading; Braunstein said the opposite on the call
the next day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Braunstein&#8217;s optimistic assessment during the April
13 earnings call may have reassured investors, but that is no
justification for misinforming the public about the bank&#8217;s
official position that the Volcker rule might prohibit the SCP
as an example of high-risk proprietary trading,&#8221; the
subcommittee report stated, referring to the bank&#8217;s synthetic
credit portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Volcker Violation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report said that Braunstein should have known that his
comments contradicted the bank&#8217;s own 68-page Volcker rule
comment letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the investigation found that the bank
considered the unit a proprietary trading operation as early as
2007. In November of that year, the bank&#8217;s internal audit group
issued a report characterizing the CIO&#8217;s credit-trading
activities as &#8220;proprietary position strategies executed on
credit- and asset-backed indices.&#8221; The report didn&#8217;t mention
hedging as a purpose of the unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan officials told the subcommittee that the trades
were intended to function as insurance or to &#8220;hedge&#8221; against
credit risks. Although the original document seeking approval
for the synthetic credit portfolio outlined hedging as a goal,
the bank was unable to produce documentation over the next five
years detailing its hedging objectives, strategies, assets,
risks or events it was supposed to hedge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The bank was also unable to explain why the SCP&#8217;s hedges
were treated differently from other types of hedges within the
CIO,&#8221; the subcommittee report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Regulatory Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin said the findings call for regulators to quickly
complete the Volcker rule and strengthen it. Specifically, he
said any allowance for banks to hedge should be documented and
tied to a specific risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We cannot allow the argument of the banks that they can
hedge their entire inventory somehow where we get global
hedges,&#8221; Levin said at the news conference. &#8220;If they are going
to claim that trades are a hedge, they&#8217;ve got to be able to
identify what is being hedged against, what are the assets being
hedged and what is the proof that it is a hedge.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s loss re-ignited the debate in Congress over
whether aggregate portfolio hedging is appropriate at all and
how to define and spot these trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It has made regulators take another look at hedging and
what constitutes appropriate hedging and what may fit within the
Volcker rule limits,&#8221; Satish Kini, co-chair of the Debevoise 
Plimpton LLP&#8217;s Banking Group, said in advance of the report&#8217;s
release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Ill-Advised Loopholes&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the bank disclosed its losses May 10, Levin and
Merkley sent a letter to five federal regulators urging them to
remove &#8220;ill-advised loopholes&#8221; from the Volcker draft;
regulators have yet to finalize the rule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merkley said the PSI report is another reminder for
regulators to complete a &#8220;strong, simple Volcker firewall.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPMorgan&#8217;s huge losses continue to cast a whale-sized
shadow over these extended delays, and remind us once again just
how important it is to separate risky, hedge-fund-style trading
from the banking system that Main Street depends on,&#8221; Merkley
said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comptroller of the Currency Thomas Curry said in a June
2012 hearing that the JPMorgan incident was a &#8220;risk-management
issue, regardless of whether or not the Volcker rule was in
play.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think our experience here, as it unfolds with JPMorgan
Chase, would help inform our views in the final rule-making,&#8221;
Curry said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subcommittee will hold a hearing on the findings today
with witnesses from the bank, including Drew and Braunstein, and
from the OCC, including Curry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The investigation of our Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations into the JPMorgan whale trades opens a window
into the hidden world of high-stakes derivatives trading by a
major bank,&#8221; Levin said. &#8220;We found a trading operation that
piled on risk, ignored limits on risk taking, hid losses, dodged
oversight and misinformed the public.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said U.S. retailers
sold 302,000 Xbox 360 games consoles in February, citing data by
NPD Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the 26th consecutive month Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft led console sales, it said in a statement. Its
machines account for 41 percent of current-generation console
sales. Microsoft sold 426,000 Xbox 360 units a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank, raised its quarterly dividend more than most analysts
estimated to 38 cents and expanded stock buybacks after the
Federal Reserve conditionally approved the firm&#8217;s proposal to
return more of its profit to shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s new dividend for the second quarter beat the 36-
cent average prediction of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The
New York-based bank said in a statement today it would buy back
as much as $6 billion more of its own stock, after scaling back
a $15 billion repurchase program approved last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators intent on preventing a repeat of the 2008
financial crisis have run annual stress tests on the largest
lenders to see how they might fare in a recession or economic
shock. JPMorgan was among the bottom four performers last week
in the Fed&#8217;s initial test of strength, which showed the bank had
submitted more optimistic estimates of its capital levels in a
severe recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While that was still good enough to pass, the Fed also
required the 18 firms to submit plans for managing their
capital, which could include buying back shares and boosting
payouts. The central bank then gauged how strong each firm would
be with the funds that remained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s approval indicates JPMorgan&#8217;s capital may stay
above the minimum 5 percent threshold after accounting for
proposed dividends and buybacks. Chief Executive Officer Jamie
Dimon and Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake had signaled the
bank would request a higher dividend and lower buyback amount
earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Planning Weakness &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank said in a report today that JPMorgan and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s plans were conditionally approved
because of weaknesses in their planning processes. Projections
of losses and revenue were the issue, according to a Fed
official. The banks can immediately implement dividend and
buyback plans, and must fix the weaknesses and resubmit by the
end of the third quarter, the official said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPMorgan Chase is fully committed to meeting all of the
Fed&#8217;s requirements,&#8221; Dimon said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan fell 2.5 percent to $49.75 at 5:08 p.m. in New
York. The lender had gained 17 percent in the year through the
close of normal trading today, compared with the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 Index&#8217;s 12 percent advance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan projected its key capital ratio wouldn&#8217;t fall
below 7.6 percent, compared with 6.3 percent estimated by the
Fed. The lender said pretax losses through 2014 would total $200
million while the Fed said they would be $32.3 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Net Revenue &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank also was more optimistic than the central bank in
estimating net revenue, loan losses and provisions it would need
to cover those losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed&#8217;s decision gives a boost to Dimon, 57, whose
reputation suffered during last year&#8217;s London Whale episode in
which JPMorgan&#8217;s U.K.-based chief investment office lost more
than $6.2 billion with a wrong-way bet on credit derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew and other current
and former executives are scheduled to testify tomorrow at the
Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations about the loss. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM)&#8217;s Bridget Van Kralingen, its head of business services, is
pulling more of the company&#8217;s thousands of researchers out of
isolated labs and having them tackle customer problems, a bid to
give it an edge in data-intensive consulting projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One out of every four IBM researchers are now helping
automate tasks such as marketing, sales or services for clients,
rather than sticking to behind-the-scenes work on software or
engineering, Van Kralingen said in an interview. Customers can
come to a new lab that combines consulting with research, or
researchers are getting sent out on client projects to study
analytical questions that haven&#8217;t been answered before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is trying to capitalize on its brain trust at a time
when its consulting work is getting increasingly complex. The
company has 3,000 researchers across 12 labs, and they&#8217;re
weighing questions ranging from replicating the human brain to
predicting traffic patterns. By putting more of them in touch
with customers, IBM looks to improve its business analytics --
the ability to mine corporate data to discover patterns or make
better decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There will be increasing fusion between the skills of a
consultant, who is practical, and the skills of a researcher,
who I think is more analytical and future-oriented,&#8221; Van
Kralingen said. Working on new ways for businesses to reach
customers &#8220;requires more of an analytical research-oriented and
experimental mindset,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Revenue Goal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is aiming for $20 billion in sales from business
analytics by 2015, more than double the 2010 figure. IBM has
hired or shifted 8,100 people to solving data-analysis issues in
the last three years, Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty said
in an annual letter to shareholders. IBM also has the largest
private mathematics department in the world and has devoted 400
of those staffers to data analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Two decades ago, 70 percent of our researchers were
working in materials science, hardware and related technology,&#8221;
Rometty said in the letter. &#8220;Even the one in 10 working in
software were focused on operating systems and compilers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new customer-focused lab was started with a joint
investment from Van Kralingen&#8217;s division and the research side
of the company that will total in the hundreds of millions, IBM
said. The company shifted 100 scientists and more than 200
consultants to the project. Armonk, New York-based IBM spends
about $6 billion a year in total on research and development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Share Gains &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s analytics prospects have helped fuel a stock rally
this year, sending the shares into record territory. The shares
rose 1.8 percent to $215.80 at the close today in New York,
bringing their year-to-date gain to 13 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB, a Mexican bank, signed a $1
billion deal to work with IBM&#8217;s new lab over the next 10 years
on customer-experience technology. The companies said this week
that the project will increase the bank&#8217;s return on equity to
more than 20 percent. Shares of the Mexican company jumped 3.6
percent to 98.93 pesos today, reaching a record high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank was looking to differentiate its offering from
competition, especially on mobile, CEO Alejandro Valenzuela said
in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If this platform was just the next best thing, we would
be out of business really fast,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM also has researchers collaborating with customers in
one of its most intensive projects -- the effort to
commercialize its Watson artificial-intelligence system for use
in the health and finance fields. Watson helps answer questions
about diagnosing cancer, for example, based on the millions of
pages of medical journals and case studies it has stored. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It gives us a level of evidence and confidence around
very complex challenges,&#8221; Anne Altman, a general manager at
IBM, said today at a Bloomberg Link Big Data conference in
Washington. The approach lets businesses study giant sets of
information, rather than having to focus on a specific
categories or geography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are no longer going to be thinking in terms of
segments,&#8221; Altman said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ranked
No.1 in commodities revenue in 2012, according to analytics
company Coalition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) had the second-biggest revenues from
commodities and Morgan Stanley (MS) came third, London-based
Coalition said in a report e-mailed today. Spokesmen for the
three banks declined to comment. Barclays Plc and Bank of
America Merrill Lynch were the strongest performers when
measured against 2011 returns, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities revenue at the 10 largest banks slumped 24
percent last year to $6 billion, Coalition estimated in
February. The Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI Spot Index of raw materials
climbed less than 0.3 percent in 2012, the worst performance in
four years, and is little changed in 2013. The gauge&#8217;s 100-day
historic volatility fell to as low as 14.1 percent in May, from
as much as 23.8 percent in January 2012, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Low volatility and reduced client activity&#8221; spurred a
drop in commodity revenues in 2012, Coalition said in a report
last month. Increasing concerns about regulation and capital
sensitivity also led banks to re-examine commodity strategies,
it said. The Volcker rule ban on proprietary trading and rules
designed to increase transparency in derivatives markets are
among regulations mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act awaiting
completion by U.S. authorities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tier Two &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG, Barclays and UBS AG were among &#8220;tier
two&#8221; performers, rated No. 4 to No. 6 for commodity revenues,
Coalition said today without providing the banks with specific
rankings. BofAML, Citigroup Inc. (C) and Credit Suisse were in
&#8220;tier three,&#8221; and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc wasn&#8217;t
ranked, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays said in February it would shut its speculative
agricultural trading, Deutsche Bank has cut power and natural
gas traders in the U.S. and Europe, and UBS is ceasing to trade
oil, industrial metals and agricultural products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was the largest investment bank, with $24.1
billion in revenue and $14.4 billion in fixed income, currencies
and commodities, Coalition said. Goldman Sachs was the second-
largest investment bank, followed by Citi, BofAML and Deutsche
Bank tied for the third-largest ranking, according to the
report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) won

its new European headquarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials recommended that the City of London financial

&lt;p&gt;The London Metal Exchange, the
world&#8217;s biggest metals marketplace, selected JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM), Citigroup Inc. (C) and Bank of America Merrill Lynch to provide
services related to its clearing system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will be the custodian for gold used by exchange
members as collateral to back trades through its clearinghouse,
the LME said today in an e-mailed statement. Citigroup will act
as custodian for fixed-income collateral and &#8220;facilitate&#8221; LME
Clear&#8217;s secure payment system, while Bank of America Merrill
Lynch will provide treasury execution services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearinghouses, which stand between buyers and sellers to
reduce the risk of default, have become more valuable as
regulators seek to increase central clearing of derivatives. The
LME, which handled $14.5 trillion worth of contracts last year,
is building its own system to replace LCH.Clearnet Group Ltd.,
the exchange&#8217;s current provider of clearing services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Exchanges  Clearing Ltd., which bought the LME
last year for 1.39 billion pounds ($2.1 billion), is helping to
build the clearinghouse. LME Clear is set to go live in 2014,
according to today&#8217;s statement. The London exchange lists
contracts for industrial metals from aluminum to tin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Janus Capital Group Inc. (JNS), the money
manager that made its name placing big bets on stocks, is trying
something new to stem a five-year customer exodus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Richard M. Weil is introducing
funds that seek to spread risk across asset classes and protect
clients from sharp market drops. Instead of focusing on returns,
which are difficult to forecast, the so-called asset allocation
funds offer investors varying levels of volatility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors, in general, have less confidence in
aggressive, active equity management than they did 5 or 10 years
ago,&#8221; Weil, whose firm oversees $157 billion, said in an
interview. &#8220;Risk-adjusted returns, rather than swing-for-the-
fences returns, are absolutely more important.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janus, named for the two-faced Roman god who looked to both
the past and future, is following firms from BlackRock Inc. (BLK) to
Invesco Ltd. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in using the promise
of lower risk to lure back clients burned by losses during the
stock market rout five years ago. With equities approaching
record highs again and volatility declining, the industry&#8217;s
latest sales pitch has been hampered by underperformance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asset allocation funds returned a risk-adjusted 0.8 percent
in the year ended Feb. 28, compared with 1 percent for the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index and 1.3 percent for the Barclays
U.S. Aggregated Bond Index. Over three years, the funds gained
2.3 percent, compared with 2.5 percent for stocks and 5 percent
for bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Too Good&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg&#8217;s calculation of risk-adjusted returns is based
on total return divided by volatility, or the degree of daily
price variation, giving a measure of income per unit of risk.
The figures aren&#8217;t annualized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s definitely been a trend in response to the crisis
of 2008 and to people&#8217;s fears about the stock market,&#8221; Josh
Charlson, analyst at fund research firm Morningstar Inc., said
in an interview. &#8220;There are a lot of new products designed to
lower volatility while also producing some decent returns,
although it sounds like a formula that&#8217;s too good to be true.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selling safer funds after a crisis isn&#8217;t Janus&#8217;s first
attempt to staunch investor withdrawals, and it&#8217;s turning to a
strategy that&#8217;s had mixed results for competitors. Sales of U.S.
asset-allocation funds peaked at $59 billion in 2004, two years
after the collapse of the technology-stock bubble. Investor
deposits rose to $25 billion in 2012 from about $14 billion in
each of the previous two years, according to Chicago-based
Morningstar Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beyond Conviction &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janus has been hurt by more than a decade of turmoil. Its
concentration in technology stocks led to a rapid rise and steep
fall when the sector&#8217;s 1990s boom turned to bust. Assets peaked
at $325 billion in the first quarter of 2000, before shrinking
by 59 percent over the next three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm, based in Denver, introduced the first of its new
funds, the Janus Diversified Alternatives Fund (JDAIX), in December,
using derivatives to mirror returns from stocks, bonds,
commodities, currencies and real estate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derivatives are contracts such as futures, swaps and
options whose value is derived from one or more underlying
assets. They typically use leverage to amplify returns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 82 percent of its investments in actively run equity
portfolios, the company is seeking to reverse a 24 percent drop
in assets since the end of 2007 as clients pulled money in 18 of
the last 20 quarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Janus&#8217;s Brand &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Janus&#8217;s brand clearly stands for high-conviction stock-
picking,&#8221; Weil, who has already built up the firm&#8217;s fixed-
income group, said in the interview in New York. &#8220;We would like
to expand the brand to mean more than that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among 263 U.S.-registered mutual funds categorized by
Bloomberg as asset-allocation products, 130 have opened since
the end of 2009. The group ranges from traditional stock-and-
bond balanced funds to more varied versions such as Janus&#8217;s
Diversified Alternatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invesco, based in Atlanta, beat the wave with its Balanced-
Risk Allocation Fund (ABRZX) in June 2009. The fund is similar to
Janus&#8217;s offering in its use of derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balanced Risk has grown to $12.9 billion, returning a risk-
adjusted 6 percent from its June 2009 inception through Feb. 28,
versus 4 percent for the SP 500 Index. Versions sold in Canada,
the U.K. and continental Europe hold an additional $7.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When other fund companies see Invesco getting $12
billion, you&#8217;re going to get some copycats,&#8221; Charlson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goldman, Franklin &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock, the world&#8217;s largest money manager, refashioned a
stock-and-bond fund in January 2012 when the New York-based
company added asset classes and renamed it the BlackRock Multi-
Asset Income Fund. (BIICX) The $2.4 billion fund has since returned a
risk-adjusted 3.2 percent, compared with 1.3 percent for the SP
500. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., also based in New York, has seen
its $1.3 billion Dynamic Allocation Fund return a risk-adjusted
2 percent since its January 2010 opening, compared with 2.3
percent for the SP 500. San Mateo, California-based Franklin
Resources Inc.&#8217;s $866 million Franklin Templeton Multi-Asset
Real Return Fund has returned 1.4 percent after price swings
since starting in December 2011, versus 2.3 percent for the U.S.
benchmark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As money poured into fixed-income and asset-allocation
funds last year, the stock funds in Janus&#8217;s traditional
wheelhouse dealt with redemptions. Large-cap growth funds, or
those targeting large-capitalization companies expected to
achieve above-average profit increases, lost $38 billion to
withdrawals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Black&#8217;s Reign &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of the industrywide redemptions, Janus suffered a
setback in 2004 when it agreed to a $225 million settlement with
New York and Colorado regulators over allegations it permitted
favored customers to engage in the improper trading practice
known as market timing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Struggling to regain assets even as fund performance
recovered, then-Chief Executive Officer Gary Black set out to
rein in the independence of fund managers and reduce their pay
after taking over in 2006. Several top-rated managers left and
one, Edward Keeley, won $4.8 million in 2009 when a Colorado
jury found the firm had breached his contract and committed
fraud in cutting his pay. Black quit that July, paving the way
for Weil&#8217;s hiring in February 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fund performance slumped anew when the 2008 financial
crisis struck. Even as the picture began to brighten in 2012,
four-fifths of the company&#8217;s stock pickers remained in the
bottom half of their Morningstar categories over the three years
ended Dec. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Industry &#8216;Failed&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to improving core fund performance, Weil said
Janus can do a better job than competitors with products
promising risk-adjusted returns, because the company will focus
more on diversifying the sources of risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The industry has failed investors in the asset-allocation
structure,&#8221; he said. Most products &#8220;sound diversified, but the
underlying return streams aren&#8217;t.&#8221; The variation in returns
among asset-allocation funds comes largely from the degree of
equity risk, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That explains why many such funds didn&#8217;t protect customers
well enough during the financial crisis, Weil said. The average
asset-allocation fund dropped 25 percent in 2008, the same year
the SP 500 Index (SPX) slid 38 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weil in May hired Andrew Weisman, a former chief investment
officer and board member at Nikko International, to head the
firm&#8217;s new alternative-investments group. In September he added
Richard Lindsey, a former Bear Stearns Cos. executive, to be
chief strategist of the group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Forecasting Volatility &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new fund doesn&#8217;t target a specific mix, Weisman said,
but seeks to identify independent sources of risk found within
asset classes. The goal is to make investments across asset
classes that won&#8217;t collectively move in step with broad markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Dec. 31, Janus Diversified Alternatives had invested
29 percent in commodities, 26 percent equities, 21 percent bonds
and 20 percent currencies, according to the firm. The
allocations change over time based on risk weightings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We can do an OK job at forecasting volatility,&#8221; Weisman
said. By lowering the volatility for a given average return, the
fund can give clients a smoother ride and greater wealth in the
long run. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first fund seeks 3 percent historical volatility, a
measure of price variation, on an annual basis. That compares
with 2.4 percent volatility for the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond
Index in the year ended Feb. 28, and 13 percent for the SP 500.
Two other strategies Janus offers only to institutional
investors target 6 percent and 9 percent volatility. The company
plans additional mutual funds in the series, Weil said, without
providing details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Liquid Alternatives&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The push into what Janus calls &#8220;liquid alternatives&#8221;
follows earlier efforts by Weil, a former chief operating
officer at Bill Gross&#8217;s Pacific Investment Management Co., to
expand the firm&#8217;s bond team and the assets it oversees. Fixed-
income investments have grown to $26.4 billion, or 17 percent of
assets, from $7.8 billion, or 5 percent, since he took over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weil, 49, said serving existing clients was &#8220;exponentially
more important&#8221; than adding products. Even so, he said, &#8220;We&#8217;ve
elected to make a huge bet on liquid alternatives by bringing in
this really world-class team and making a commitment to filling
out this area.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janus faces two hurdles in its latest attempt to diversify,
according to Geoff Bobroff, a fund consultant in East Greenwich,
Rhode Island. It lacks the track record in multiasset investing
that firms such as Invesco and BlackRock carry, and it&#8217;s joining
the trend late. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many financial advisers, he said, will want to see two or
three years of history before they use a fund, and by then, the
draw of conservative asset allocation may have faded if equity
markets continue their recent advance. Invesco&#8217;s Balanced Risk
Fund returned 1.3 percent this year through Feb. 28 as the SP
500 rose 6.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Part of the problem with these products is that they work
well in saw-toothed markets,&#8221; Bobroff said, referring to
elevated volatility. &#8220;If we end up in a bull market, they will
severely underperform.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) pushed back the
release of its Infinity video-game system by two months,
postponing a potential source of profit at its interactive unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s largest entertainment company, unveiled
the Infinity platform in January, saying it would reduce costs
and boost earnings at the unit. The platform, which incorporates
characters from multiple Disney films in the same game, was to
hit store shelves in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have moved the launch date for Disney Infinity to
August 18 to capitalize on the critical fall retail season,&#8221;
John Pleasants, co-president of Disney Interactive, said in a
statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interactive unit makes video games and designs websites
based on Disney content. In the quarter ended Dec. 29, it posted
its first profit since Disney began breaking out results in
2009. Bob Iger, chairman and chief executive officer of the
Burbank, California-based company, has pledged the division will
be profitable this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The delay in the release of the Infinity system will
&#8220;definitely impact our goal of achieving profitability for the
year&#8221; at the unit, Pleasants said, according to an earlier New
York Times report, citing an interview. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben S. Bernanke&#8217;s efforts to revive
housing are making real estate bulls even more bullish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) more than doubled its forecast for
U.S. home price gains in 2013 to 7 percent this week, and
predicts a more than 14 percent increase through 2015. Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) said last week property values will jump 8 percent
this year, up from a prior estimate of 4.7 percent in a report
titled &#8220;Someone say house party?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two biggest U.S. banks are predicting an accelerating
rebound as homebuyers and investors rush to acquire a dwindling
supply of properties and the Federal Reserve pushes down
borrowing costs by buying mortgage bonds. That&#8217;s strengthening
the economy and sustaining a rally in homebuilder shares after
the stocks more than doubled since the end of 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We still think we are in the early innings of a prolonged
recovery in housing and the economy,&#8221; said Samantha McLemore, a
money manager for Bill Miller&#8217;s $1.2 billion Legg Mason Capital
Management Opportunity Trust, which has a range of holdings tied
to a housing rebound and has gained 20 percent this year besting
99 percent of rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home prices rose 6.8 percent in December from the year
earlier, the biggest gain since 2006, according to the SP/Case-
Shiller home-price index of 20 cities. The measure is still 29
percent below the peak that year after soaring homeowner
defaults helped trigger the global financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) needs to win
back public trust after losses on a derivative portfolio swelled
to more than $6.2 billion and eroded confidence in the largest
U.S. bank, a company risk manager told lawmakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This whole thing is regrettable and unacceptable,&#8221;
Ashley Bacon, acting chief risk officer of the bank, told the
Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations today in
Washington. &#8220;The onus of proof is on us now to demonstrate how
this can&#8217;t happen in other places, how we weathered the
financial crisis well everywhere else, and how we can make the
entire firm a safer place to the satisfaction of you, everybody
else and our regulators.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is seeking to restore confidence in a company that
withstood the 2008 housing crisis better than most rivals and
then stumbled last year with losses on bets by U.K. traders. The
Senate panel released a report yesterday saying the New York-
based bank hid losses and dodged regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You had to figure Congress would hold JPMorgan to the
fire,&#8221; Adrian Miller, director of fixed-income strategies at
GMP Securities LLC in New York, said by e-mail. The bank and
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon are &#8220;thought to be the best
in the business in managing a global bank and the risks that
come with it. So when high expectations come up short,&#8221; Wall
Street and Washington demand answers, he said. &#8220;Someone was
going to be taken to task.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) market-
risk executive Pete Weiland told lawmakers he erred last year
when dismissing internal loss estimates on botched trades as
&#8220;garbage&#8221; before they proved prescient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Yes, I acknowledge it now, with all the information we
have today, that was correct,&#8221; Weiland said today in testimony
to the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. The
panel had quoted his &#8220;garbage&#8221; remark in a 301-page report
yesterday on JPMorgan&#8217;s so-called London Whale bets, which lost
$6.2 billion in last year&#8217;s first nine months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the trades soured in the bank&#8217;s chief investment office
last February, an internal JPMorgan metric known as the
comprehensive risk measure showed the portfolio might suffer a
$6.3 billion annual loss, lawmakers found. Weiland was the
unit&#8217;s chief market risk officer at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We got some CRM numbers and they look like garbage as far
as I can tell,&#8221; Weiland wrote in an e-mail dismissing the
estimates&#8217; accuracy. He stepped down later in the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CIO&#8217;s then-chief, Ina Drew, also doubted the accuracy
of the estimates, the senators&#8217; investigation found. By the time
she believed it, &#8220;it was too late,&#8221; they wrote in their
report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Ina Drew, who was forced to leave JPMorgan Chase  Co. amid a record trading loss last year, said she relied on other executives to manage a complex book of credit derivatives and didn&#8217;t learn of their &#8220;deceptive conduct&#8221; until after she left the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I was, and remain, deeply disappointed and saddened to learn of such conduct and the extent to which the London team let me, and the company, down,&#8221; Drew said in testimony prepared for delivery in the Senate today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Drew, 56, is testifying before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which yesterday released a report saying the bank hid losses and dodged regulators last year as it made derivative bets that eventually cost the bank more than $6 billion. Drew ran the chief investment office, which made the faulty trades. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some members of the London team failed to value positions properly and in good faith,&#8221; Drew told the panel. They &#8220;hid from me important information regarding the truth of the book.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Drew was among Wall Street&#8217;s most powerful women until she resigned in May four days after the initial trading loss. Today is her first public appearance since leaving the New York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Dawn Kopecki in New York at dkopecki@bloomberg.net; Clea Benson in Washington at cbenson20@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Dan Kraut at dkraut2@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) (JPM), the biggest U.S. bank by assets, compensated chief investment office traders in a way that encouraged risk-taking before the unit amassed losses exceeding $6.2 billion, a Senate committee said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pay that rewarded &#8220;effective risk management&#8221; would have suggested the synthetic credit portfolio functioned as a hedge, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations said yesterday in a report on the New York-based bank&#8217;s so-called London Whale loss. Instead, compensation practices suggest the bets &#8220;functioned more as a proprietary-trading operation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Executives including Ina Drew, 56, former head of the CIO, are scheduled to testify today at a subcommittee hearing on the London Whale. The bank endured 41 days of trading losses last year as it worked to stabilize bets tied to credit derivatives. The board cut Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon&#8217;s 2012 pay by 50 percent to $11.5 million, saying he &#8220;bears ultimate responsibility for the failures that led to the losses.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lender awarded Achilles Macris, 51, the trader behind the expansion into credit trading, $31.8 million in the two years before the firm racked up the CIO losses, making him among the highest-paid employees at the firm, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. economic growth will have to accelerate to &#8220;ridiculously strong levels&#8221; to justify any advance for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index (SPX) above 1,600, said Jim O&#8217;Neill, chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After gaining 9.6 percent this year, the SP 500 is trading at 1,563.23, less than 2 points from a record and within 3 percent of 1,600. O&#8217;Neill, who coined the term BRIC in describing the rise of Brazil, Russia, India and China, has an estimate of 1,575 for the U.S. equity benchmark this year. The world&#8217;s biggest economy is forecast to grow 1.9 percent in 2013 and 2.7 percent next year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;In order to justify the SP above 1,600, we&#8217;d have to see growth expectations go to something like 4 percent and beyond,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said in a Bloomberg Television interview in Singapore. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see persistent upside from those kind of levels without some more evidence that the economy would be growing by ridiculously strong levels.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The SP 500, which has more than doubled from its bottom in 2009, will trade in a range between 1,500 and 1,600, O&#8217;Neill said, without specifying a time period. The 55-year-old economist is stepping down this year after about 18 years at the New York-based investment bank. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) paid Achilles Macris $31.8 million in the two years before the firm racked up at least $6.2 billion of losses on a portfolio he oversaw, more than his boss Ina Drew and among the most at the bank. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Macris&#8217;s total compensation was $14.5 million for 2011 and about $17.3 million for 2010, according to a presentation in the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations report released yesterday. Drew, the former chief investment officer who lost her job because of the bad trades, forfeited her pay for those two years, a total of $29 million. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Macris, a Greek national and U.S. citizen, was behind the expansion into credit trading at the chief investment office, which approved his &#8220;new business initiative&#8221; in May 2006, according to the report. That led to the creation of a &#8220;synthetic credit portfolio&#8221; that caused last year&#8217;s losses tied to Bruno Iksil, the derivatives trader dubbed the London Whale for the size of his position in the market. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Drew, 56, is scheduled to testify today before the Senate panel, discussing the loss in her first public appearance since her May 14 exit. JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, has said that it recovered about two years of pay from the traders who oversaw the money-losing bets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) agreed to buy

Petroleum Inc. (BKX) for $147.5 million, expanding shale exploration
in the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil&#8217;s XTO Energy unit will acquire BNK&#8217;s Woodford
shale fields in a transaction expected to close in late April,
Camarillo, California-based BNK said today in a statement. BNK
will keep its rights in the Caney and upper Sycamore formations
in the field, the company said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil spokesman Alan Jeffers confirmed the sale in an
e-mail statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNK will use the funds from the sale to increase drilling
of wells in the Caney Field and to pursue exploration in Europe
on its own or with partners, the company said in the statement.
The proceeds will also be used to repay a credit facility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNK is setting up another drilling rig for its next planned
Caney well and has contracted the rig for two wells with the
option for an additional two wells, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bruno Iksil, the trader whose wagers cost JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) $6.2 billion and led to his ouster, may have unwittingly helped pick his replacement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Henry Kim, then trading high-yield indexes for the market- making desk at the firm&#8217;s investment bank, is &#8220;very young and very talented&#8221; and should be considered for a post in the chief investment office, Iksil said in a Jan. 30, 2012, e-mail to supervisor Javier Martin-Artajo, according to documents accompanying a report last week by the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kim &#8220;would like to know whether there is some opportunity for him here at CIO be it New York or London,&#8221; Iksil wrote. &#8220;I thought maybe he could try to meet with you while you are in New York even informally.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Iksil wrote the message months before his souring bets spiraled into a public spectacle that Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 57, attributed to &#8220;egregious,&#8221; self-inflicted mistakes. The e-mail, included among 598 pages of documents accompanying the Senate report, shows Iksil&#8217;s interest in taking talent from the company&#8217;s investment bank -- a division that CIO employees came to suspect of undermining the trades. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the losses mounted, CIO traders started deviating from their traditional practice of pricing their positions &#8220;at or near&#8221; market midpoints, the Senate report shows. The CIO &#8220;began to suspect and then blame&#8221; the market-making desk for assigning prices that hurt the CIO&#8217;s trades and leaking information to the market, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The premium for spot gasoline in
Los Angeles gained against futures as Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s

said to shut equipment to fix a leak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s 150,000-barrel-a-day Torrance refinery in Southern
California is scheduled to flare gases through March 20 related
to unit maintenance after a mechanical upset last week, Gesuina Paras, a company spokeswoman in Torrance, said by e-mail today.
The work isn&#8217;t expected to affect production, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phillips 66&#8217;s 139,000-barrel-a-day Los Angeles plant was
said to shut an isomerization unit today after discovering a
leak, a person with direct knowledge of the work said. The unit,
which makes unleaded gasoline components, may remain down until
tomorrow for line repairs, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;

strengthened 1.5 cents to 10.5 cents a gallon under futures
traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 4:08 p.m. East
Coast time, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Prompt delivery of
the fuel dropped 1.99 cents to $3.0239 a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same fuel in San Francisco gained 3.5 cents against
Nymex gasoline futures to a discount of 11 cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) said last week that the crude unit at its
Richmond refinery, Northern California&#8217;s largest, is expected to
be back in operation in the second quarter. The 240,000-barrel-

since March 10 for repairs on a hydrogen plant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spread between San Francisco and Los Angeles Carbob
narrowed 2 cents to 0.5 cent a gallon. San Francisco
strengthened to a premium against Los Angeles last week for the
first time in more than five months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend, or CARB, diesel in Los Angeles rose a
second day against Nymex heating oil futures, increasing 1 cent
to a premium of 8 cents a gallon, a one-week high. In San
Francisco, the fuel gained a third day against futures,
advancing 0.5 cent to a premium of 13.5 cents a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Portland, Oregon, low-sulfur diesel fell by 0.5 cent to
premium of 9.5 cents a gallon against futures, the fourth
straight decline. Conventional, 84-octane gasoline in Portland
strengthened 0.5 cent versus gasoline futures to a discount of
19 cents a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3-2-1 crack spread of Alaska North Slope crude, Carbob
in Los Angeles and CARB diesel in Los Angeles dropped $1.081 to
$16.123 a barrel at 4:10 p.m. New York time. The spread, a
measure of refining profitability, hit a one-year low of $3.86 a
barrel in December. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two biggest U.S. equity bears
in 2012 see the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index rising more than 12
percent this year to at least 1,600, as strong economic data
point to higher corporate earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s chief U.S. equity strategist,
David Kostin, raised his target today for the benchmark stocks
gauge by 3.2 percent to 1,625 from 1,575. Adam Parker of Morgan
Stanley (MS) boosted his 2013 estimate by 12 percent to 1,600 from
1,434. They join strategists at Deutsche Bank AG, Credit Suisse
Group AG (CSGN) and Jefferies Group LLC in increasing their targets for
U.S stocks in the last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The 2013 U.S. equity market story is becoming one of
improving business activity accompanied by increased CEO
confidence,&#8221; Kostin wrote in a report. &#8220;Recent economic data
has been strong as employment growth, ISM surveys and retail
sales have all posted positive surprises. The &#8216;sequester&#8217; has
begun, and the federal government is still functioning.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rally in U.S. equities has pushed bearish strategists
to capitulate in 2013 after being conservative last year, when
stock seers forecast the smallest gain in seven years for the
SP 500. (SPX) Kostin and Parker estimated the SP 500 would fall in
2012 to 1,250 and 1,167, respectively, making them the two most
bearish strategists among the 14 surveyed by Bloomberg. The
equity index surged 13 percent to 1,426.19 in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 closed within two points of its all-time record
of 1,565.15 on March 14, as better-than-estimated retail sales
and jobless claims data boosted optimism in the world&#8217;s largest
economy. The data helped offset concerns over automatic federal
spending cuts that started March 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Manufacturing Data &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 5, the Institute for Supply Management&#8217;s non-
manufacturing index reading for February unexpectedly increased.
A week earlier, ISM factory data showed the fastest pace of
manufacturing since June 2011, as orders climbed the most in
almost two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 has surged 21 percent since its low last year
in June amid corporate earnings that have exceeded analysts&#8217;
estimates and stimulus measures by global central banks. The
gauge has added 8.8 percent this year. It slid 0.6 percent to
1,552.10 in New York today and would need to add 3.1 percent to
reach 1,600. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the latest upward revisions, the average
strategist forecast for the SP 500 at the end of 2013 is 1,571,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. The figure has risen 2.3
percent since starting the year at 1,534. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Faster Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kostin, the New York-based chief U.S. equity strategist at
Goldman, lifted his estimate for combined earnings by companies
in the SP 500 this year by $1 to $108 a share. Goldman expects
U.S. economic growth to reach 3 percent in the first quarter and
2 percent in the second three months of the year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also said financials stocks should outperform those from
other industries in 2013, citing faster economic growth, rising
interest rates and higher dividends and share buybacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan&#8217;s Parker, who is based in New York, increased his
projection for SP 500 profit to $103.20 from $98.71. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see improving fundamentals in the second half of the
year and into next year,&#8221; Parker said in today&#8217;s note. &#8220;A
number of things have been responsible for the recent multiple
expansion, but perhaps a major contributor was quantitative
easing, which encompasses Fed and ECB policy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferies&#8217; Sean Darby increased his target by 6.9 percent
to 1,673 on March 12, making him the most bullish strategist in
Bloomberg&#8217;s survey. The Hong Kong-based chief global equity
strategist said earnings will continue to surpass estimates and
investors will shift money to stocks from bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Equity Strategists &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse&#8217;s Andrew Garthwaite raised his target to
1,640 from 1,550, the second-highest in the survey. More
aggressive central bank actions and inflows into equities were
among the reasons the SP 500 warranted a higher forecast, he
said in a March 15 note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Bianco, Deutsche Bank&#8217;s New York-based chief U.S.
equity strategist, raised his 2013 target to 1,625 from 1,600,
citing positive economic data in a March 16 note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co.&#8217;s Gina Martin Adams is the most bearish
strategist, projecting the SP 500 will fall to 1,390. That
would require a 10 percent drop from today&#8217;s level. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desarrolladora Homex (HXM), Mexico&#8217;s
largest publicly-traded homebuilder by market value, tumbled to
a four-year low in New York after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Credit Suisse Group AG recommended selling the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American depositary receipts of Homex dropped 5.6 percent
to $11.20 at the close of trading, the lowest since March 2009.
The Mexican stock exchange was closed today for a holiday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs analysts led by Jason Mollin reduced the
rating on Culiacan-based Homex to sell from neutral. The company
faces &#8220;poor expected near-term results, possible debt covenant
renegotiation, and lack of positive catalysts,&#8221; they wrote in a
report dated today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect the disappointing cash burn to continue in the
near term, possibly forcing a debt covenant renegotiation or
waiver,&#8221; the Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse reiterated a rating equivalent to sell. Homex
will continue to post negative free cash flow in the next two
years, Credit Suisse analysts Eugenio Amador, Julian Bravo
Lozano and Vanessa Quiroga wrote in a report dated today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BNK Petroleum Inc. (BKX), the oil
explorer whose biggest holder is George Soros, climbed the most
in more than three years a day after Exxon Mobil Corp. agreed to
buy an Oklahoma oilfield. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNK increased 43 percent to 80 Canadian cents at the close
in Toronto. Earlier, the shares rose 46 percent, the largest
intraday advance since May 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the world&#8217;s biggest energy company by market value,
agreed yesterday to acquire most of the Tishomingo Field from
Camarillo, California-based BNK for $147.5 million. BNK plans to
spend proceeds from the sale on drilling in the U.S. and Europe,
and to repay a credit facility, the company said in a statement
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNK lost 71 percent of its market value since Soros
purchased his initial stake for C$2.54 a share in October 2010. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc (BARC) and JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) topped a poll of providers of structured products to
individual investors, according to a survey by Greenwich
Associates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stamford, Connecticut-based research company asked 369
distributors of the securities -- which can include advisers,
brokers and private banks -- who they thought were the most
important sellers of retail structured products in 2012. Forty-
four percent named London-based Barclays and JPMorgan in New
York as the top firms globally, Greenwich said in a report,
which was based on the opinions of the respondents rather than
actual transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said the two banks dominated the global retail
structured products business because their platforms extend
across all major regions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Barclays and JPMorgan lead this market due to the breadth
of their capabilities and franchises,&#8221; Andrew Awad, a
consultant at Greenwich, said in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) was cited as having the next biggest
&#8220;market penetration,&#8221; followed by UBS AG, Credit Suisse Group
AG (CSGN) and BNP Paribas SA (BNP), according to the poll. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenwich also recognized HSBC as a &#8220;global quality
leader&#8221; for providing the best service to distributors,
according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. investors have bought $7.84 billion of structured
notes this year, just below the $8.92 billion purchased during
the same period last year. European and Asian investors have
sunk $18.7 billion into the securities, 13 percent less than the
year before, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to investors, while earning
fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose value is
derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bruno Iksil, the JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) trader known as the London Whale, had an e-mail sent to
about 20 colleagues last year estimating almost double the daily
losses his book had shown thus far. Then the phone rang. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Why did you do that?&#8221; his supervisor, Javier Martin- Artajo, said at the start of the March 20 call. The position was
failing to recover, Iksil explained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Okay, Okay, listen you&#8217;ve done it,&#8221; Martin-Artajo said,
according to a transcript. &#8220;You think that this is right. This
is not what I would have done but you&#8217;ve done it so I&#8217;m okay
with this.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exchange is among numerous snapshots of life inside
JPMorgan as the London Whale trades unraveled, resulting in more
than $6.2 billion in losses for the biggest U.S. bank. The
conversations were revealed last week as the U.S. Senate
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations released a 301-page
report on the botched derivatives bets, as well as almost 600
pages of e-mails, phone-call transcripts and other records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While lawmakers used the documents to bolster their
findings that the New York-based company and its executives
misled investors and regulators, the tome also provides a rare
look at how traders and their bosses grappled with stress and a
growing sense that they wouldn&#8217;t be able to contain the damage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argentines are buying more gold
than ever to protect their savings from the Western Hemisphere&#8217;s
fastest inflation as the country&#8217;s bonds suffer the worst
returns in developing nations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Goldman Sachs Group Inc. called for gold prices to
peak last month and billionaire George Soros cut his stake by
more than half, Banco de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Argentina&#8217;s
only gold trader, is talking with mining companies to buy the
metal directly as surging demand exhausts its supply of scrap.
The bank began marketing gold to individuals after the nation
tightened currency controls in October 2011, selling 280 kilos
in its first year for 102.6 million pesos ($20 million). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argentines are turning to the precious metal to preserve
the value of their savings as economists forecast the peso will
lose more value than any currency in the world and President
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner bans most dollar purchases. The
nation&#8217;s estimated inflation rate of 26 percent is also eroding
the value of fixed-income securities, causing Argentina&#8217;s peso-
denominated bonds to lose 5.5 percent this year versus a 2.2
percent gain in emerging markets, according Barclays Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m buying gold every chance I get,&#8221; Guillermo Acosta, a
27-year-old security guard, said inside a branch of Banco Ciudad
in downtown Buenos Aires. &#8220;With this inflation, I feel like my
savings will evaporate if I keep them in pesos.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dollar Bonds &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acosta&#8217;s initial investment of 10 grams of gold in February
last year has returned 47 percent as the price per gram rose to
381.5 pesos from 260 pesos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argentina&#8217;s government dollar-denominated bonds fell an
average 14.3 percent in that span, according to JPMorgan Chase 
Co.&#8217;s EMBI global index, and the peso weakened 15 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nation hasn&#8217;t borrowed money from overseas debt markets
since its $95 billion default in 2001 and Fernandez&#8217;s increasing
influence over the economy since her re-election in 2011 has
pushed up the interest that bond investors demand to 13.9
percent, or three times the average in emerging markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Argentina printing pesos to finance itself, the amount
of pesos in the economy has increased 38 percent in the past
year, leading analysts to anticipate that the currency will
depreciate 12.9 percent through year-end, the most among
currencies tracked by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banco Ciudad is the only bank left that trades the metal
after Fernandez in July banned the purchase of certified 99.99
percent pure gold for savings. The bank sells it at 99.96
percent purity, according to Carlos Leiza, who oversees the
lender&#8217;s gold trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Keep Up&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The boom goes in hand with the inability to buy
dollars,&#8221; he said in an interview at his office in Buenos
Aires. &#8220;People are looking for alternatives that at least
implicitly hold the value of the dollar. The demand has been
strong for over a year now. We can barely keep up.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield that investors demand to hold Argentine
government dollar-denominated debt instead of Treasuries widened
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1,185 basis
points at 9:55 a.m. in New York, according to JPMorgan&#8217;s EMBI
Global index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of protecting $10 million of Argentine government
debt against default for five years with credit-default swaps
rose 88 basis points to 3,121 basis points, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, Banco Ciudad limited purchases to 100 grams per
person per day in direct sales to individuals. Investors who
want to speculate on the price of gold without actually owning
the metal are also buying record amounts of futures contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Good Option&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of open futures contracts due in June in the
Rosario Futures Exchange, where they are traded locally, climbed
183 percent in the past year to 14,508, and reached an all-time
high of 15,276 on Jan. 29. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Faced with the inability to buy foreign currency,
investors are seeing gold futures as a good option to dollarize
their portfolios,&#8221; said Sebastian Porcel, director of Buenos
Aires-based futures brokerage Global Agro. &#8220;The fact that
people are going through the burden of owning actual gold bars
shows the huge need they have to protect savings.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While demand for gold is rising in Argentina, Goldman Sachs
last month cut its three-month target to $1,615 an ounce from
$1,825, and also chopped its six- and 12-month forecasts. The
bank said the cycle for gold prices, which has climbed for 12
straight years, has probably turned as the recovery in the U.S.
economy gathers momentum and investments decrease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soros reduced his stake in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest
gold exchange-traded fund, by 55 percent in the fourth quarter,
filings showed last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prices Drop &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold futures traded in New York have fallen 11 percent in
the past six months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between the prices to buy and sell gold is
greater than the gap when trading futures, meaning investors are
more at risk of losing money when they need to sell, according
to Claudio Burelli, the head of the currency trading desk at
Buenos Aires-based brokerage Puente Hermanos Sociedad de Bolsa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a 35 percent difference between the prices to buy
and sell gold at Banco Ciudad, while there&#8217;s no premium to sell
the country&#8217;s benchmark 2017 dollar bond in the local market,
according to the Buenos Aires-based Open Electronic Market,
known as MAE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a big spread in prices, so to make money, not
only does the price of gold have to rise, you have to beat that
gap,&#8221; said Burelli, who sold gold before it was restricted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exchange Rate &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold sold by Banco Ciudad also isn&#8217;t recognized
internationally, making it more difficult to determine its
value, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of 100 grams of gold in Argentina as of last week
was 36,646 pesos. In New York, the same amount based on the
benchmark troy ounce (31 grams) sold for about $5,126. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank multiplies that price by 0.95 to account for the
lower quality of the gold to get a dollar price of $4,870. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the implied exchange rate of 7.5 pesos per dollar is
higher than the official rate of 5.09, it&#8217;s still better than
the rate of 8 pesos per dollar in the black market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Historically, gold has been seen as a store of value, so
as long as options for doing that in Argentina are limited,
people are going to keep buying it,&#8221; Banco Ciudad&#8217;s Leiza said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court turned away
an appeal by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) in an investor lawsuit
over mortgage-backed securities whose value plummeted during the
2008 financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices today left intact a federal appeals court
ruling that partially backed the NECA-IBEW Health and Welfare
Fund, which is pressing the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At issue was whether NECA, which bought certificates from
two of 17 disputed Goldman Sachs trusts, had legal &#8220;standing&#8221;
to sue on behalf of investors in the other 15 offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said
NECA&#8217;s claims were similar to those stemming from five other
offerings, all of which contained loans made by a Wells Fargo 
Co. (WFC) unit and GreenPoint Mortgage Funding Inc. The appeals court
said NECA had standing to press those claims, though not any
claims concerning the other 10 trusts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standing issue is separate from the question of class
action status, which the lower courts haven&#8217;t yet considered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Goldman Sachs v. NECA-IBEW Health and Welfare
Fund, 12-528. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission lacks authority over futures contracts, a U.S.
appeals court ruled, handing a victory to the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission and an ex-Amaranth Advisors LLC trader fined
$30 million by FERC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress intended to centralize oversight of futures
contracts in the CFTC, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington
said March 15. It brushed aside FERC&#8217;s contention that the two
agencies share jurisdiction over aspects of energy markets that
allowed FERC to fine trader Brian Hunter for alleged market
manipulation, ruling the Commodity Exchange Act gives the CFTC
&#8220;exclusive jurisdiction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case highlights a turf battle between the two agencies

granted to FERC in 2005 to regulate energy trading in the wake
of blackouts in California triggered by Enron Corp. traders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FERC had argued that the CFTC&#8217;s exclusive jurisdiction over
regulating futures contracts and futures markets doesn&#8217;t extend
to manipulation, because such activity can involve conduct in
several markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Adamske, a spokesman for the CFTC, and Tamara Young
Allen, spokeswoman for FERC, declined to comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hunter&#8217;s attorney, Michael Kim, of Kobre  Kim LLP, said in
a statement that &#8220;FERC unjustly vilified Mr. Hunter for years,
but in fact it was the FERC which had acted outside the law.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hunter dumped large numbers of contracts within the last 30
minutes of trading in an effort to drive down the closing price
of the futures, according to court documents. The move benefited
Amaranth&#8217;s larger opposing positions in off-exchange
derivatives, regulators said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amaranth lost $6.6 billion betting on the price of natural
gas. The hedge fund collapsed in 2006. In August 2009, the
company agreed to pay $7.5 million to end U.S. cases brought by
FERC and the CFTC over price manipulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 11, a federal judge in Manhattan gave final
approval to a $77.1 million settlement by Amaranth to resolve a
class action brought by traders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FERC filed an administrative case against Hunter the day
after the CFTC brought a civil enforcement action against him in
federal court in Manhattan over the same trading. The commission
ordered him to pay $30 million in penalties, ruling he
manipulated the price of contracts on the New York Mercantile
Exchange in 2006 while boosting the value of financial
derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CFTC&#8217;s case against Hunter was put on hold in January
2012 after Hunter sued to challenge FERC&#8217;s authority in the
matter, according to court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Hunter v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,
11-1477, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
(Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special Section: JPMorgan Hearings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Braunstein Repeats &#8216;I Don&#8217;t Recall&#8217; at Senate Grilling on Dimon &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s Douglas Braunstein was grilled March
15 by U.S. senators after saying he couldn&#8217;t remember how Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon reacted when the bank resumed
sending reports to a regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democrat Carl Levin of Michigan, the head of the Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations, asked about Dimon&#8217;s reaction
after a panel report March 14 saying the CEO told executives
last year to stop sending the investment bank&#8217;s daily results to
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Dimon believed
&#8220;it was too much information,&#8221; the report said, citing an
interview with an OCC examiner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin pressed about an account in the report that Dimon
&#8220;reportedly raised his voice in anger&#8221; after learning that
Braunstein, then the chief financial officer, began to provide
the data again to the OCC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t recall the specifics of his reaction,&#8221; answered
Braunstein, who is now vice chairman. Braunstein told the
senator at least two other times that he couldn&#8217;t remember
specifics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Braunstein and Dimon were named in the report as executives
who misled investors in April of last year when they discussed a
portfolio of credit derivatives at the chief investment office,
or CIO, that eventually posted more than $6.2 billion in losses.
The former CFO said March 15 that Dimon was concerned about the
confidentiality of the reports when the bank stopped supplying
information to the OCC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Comptroller of the Currency Thomas Curry, in prepared
testimony for hearing, said &#8220;there were red flags that we
should have noticed and acted upon.&#8221; The OCC, the primary
federal-bank regulator, has taken actions to bolster its
supervision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The failure of federal regulators to act sooner &#8220;can&#8217;t be
excused,&#8221; Levin said during his opening remarks. The panel&#8217;s
top Republican, Senator John McCain, said financial regulators
were &#8220;asleep at the switch.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Do we live in a world, Mr. Braunstein, that government
regulations of our businesses and our lives, we just decide,
well, because we&#8217;re concerned about something, we&#8217;re not going
to comply with the regulations,&#8221; asked McCain. &#8220;Is that how
JPMorgan works?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No sir, it does not,&#8221; Braunstein replied. Dimon wasn&#8217;t a
witness at the March 15 hearing after being questioned last year
by panels in the Senate and House of Representatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Ina Drew, former head of JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s
chief investment officer, Ashley Bacon, JPMorgan&#8217;s acting chief
risk officer, and Peter Weiland, former head of market risk in
the CIO, also testified before the Subcommittee about the
&#8220;London Whale&#8221; loss last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the video, click here, and click here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Cavanagh, co-chief executive officer of JPMorgan
Chase  Co.&#8217;s corporate and investment bank, also testified
before the Subcommittee. Cavanagh led JPMorgan&#8217;s internal review
of the &#8220;London Whale&#8221; loss. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Markets &#8216;Too Complex&#8217; for Bank Risk Control, Trone Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Trone, an analyst at JMP Securities LLC, talked about
the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations hearing
March 15 on the trading loss at JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s chief
investment office last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He spoke with Erik Schatzker, Christine Harper and
Stephanie Ruhle on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;Market Makers.&#8221;
Stanley Crouch, chief investment officer at Aegis Capital Corp.,
also spoke. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;High-Frequency Equities Trading Worry Overstated, ASIC Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concern about high-frequency trading in Australian equity
markets is &#8220;overstated,&#8221; the country&#8217;s securities regulator
said after concluding a study that found no systematic
manipulation of markets by traders using these strategies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Australian Securities and Investments Commission saw a
&#8220;marked change&#8221; in the behavior of traders using high-
frequency trading strategies during the course of its study,
which began last year, the regulator said in a statement on its
website. A separate study examining so-called dark pools showed
there are now more systems that account for 25 percent to 30
percent of the Australian equity market volume. Dark pools are
private trading venues that don&#8217;t display prices until after
trades take place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore have considered the
extent to which trading strategies that rely on speedy placement
of bids and offers should be regulated amid concern that they
can be used to manipulate prices. ASIC proposed a new rule for
minimum resting periods for &#8220;small and fleeting&#8221; orders and
another for the guidance on trading practices that may
illustrate manipulative activity. The regulator said it will
consult with market participants following today&#8217;s release.
Comments need to be submitted by May 10 and a guide on rules is
scheduled to be released in July or August. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;EU Parliament to Seek Views on Financial Regulation Priorities &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Union lawmakers said they are seeking views on
&#8220;future priorities&#8221; for financial regulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Parliament&#8217;s economic and monetary affairs
committee said it would seek written comments from industry and
other interested parties on the &#8220;coherence&#8221; of EU legislation,
and on work plans for the remainder of this parliamentary term.
The deadline for submissions is June 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IMF Urges More Forceful Action to Repair EU Banking System &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union needs to take &#8220;more forceful action&#8221;
to shore up its damaged financial sector, including targeted
asset-quality reviews to make sure banks aren&#8217;t hiding further
problems, International Monetary Fund staff said in a report
March 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From French banks with big cross-border exposures to
vulnerable German savings banks, Europe&#8217;s banking industry faces
risks that mean it should press ahead with efforts to build a
banking union, the Washington-based IMF said in its first
assessment of financial regulation across the 27-nation bloc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU leaders decided last year to create a common euro-area
bank supervisor at the European Central Bank as part of efforts
to contain the sovereign debt crisis. The IMF urged the EU to
meet June targets for designing rules for the ECB supervisor and
on how banks can apply for direct aid. EU leaders also have set
a June deadline for governments and the European Parliament to
agree on legislation that sets out how authorities should handle
bank failures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lamprell Fined $3.6 Million for Not Alerting Market to Finances &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lamprell Plc (LAM), an oil-rig manufacturer, was fined 2.4
million pounds ($3.6 million) for not telling the market quickly
enough about its faltering finances in early 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failures in Lamprell&#8217;s systems and controls caused it to
omit negative information about its financial performance in
statements to the market, the U.K. Financial Services Authority,
which levied the fine, said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it made the situation clear to the market in May,
Lamprell&#8217;s share price fell 57 percent, the FSA said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fine is the first under the FSA&#8217;s new penalty policy,
based on a company&#8217;s market capitalization, which the regulator
said will lead to &#8220;significantly higher penalties than in the
past.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lamprell received the regulator&#8217;s standard 30 percent
discount for settling early. The company &#8220;provided significant
and extensive cooperation&#8221; with the FSA and didn&#8217;t act
deliberately or recklessly in its failings, the company said in
a separate statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It agreed to settle &#8220;to avoid incurring significant
additional expenses and expending the further time that would be
required to pursue the matter,&#8221; said John Kennedy, Lamprell&#8217;s
non-executive chairman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goldman, JPMorgan Ordered to Fix Capital Planning in Stress Test &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and JPMorgan Chase  Co., the
world&#8217;s biggest trading firms, must submit new capital plans to
regulators to address weaknesses the Federal Reserve found in
their planning processes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank didn&#8217;t object to the capital plans of the
two New York-based companies, and approved proposals from 14
other banks, the Fed said March 14 in a report. Capital plans
submitted by Ally Financial Inc. and BBT Corp. were rejected,
while American Express Co. (AXP), the biggest U.S. credit-card issuer
by customer spending, revised its submission to win approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deficiencies found at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan
related to projections of losses and revenue, according to a Fed
official. While the two firms can immediately implement dividend
and buyback plans, they must fix the weaknesses and resubmit
their proposals by the end of the third quarter, the official
said. Regulators, intent on preventing a repeat of the 2008
financial crisis, have run annual stress tests to see how the
largest lenders would fare in a recession or economic shock to
ensure that banks don&#8217;t jeopardize the financial system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;SAC Capital to Pay Record $614 Million Over Insider Trading &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAC Capital Advisors LP, the hedge fund run by billionaire
Steven A. Cohen, will pay a record $614 million to settle U.S.
regulatory claims that two of its affiliates made illegal trades
using nonpublic information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CR Intrinsic Investors agreed to pay more than $600 million
-- the most ever in an insider-trading case -- and Sigma Capital
will forfeit about $14 million, the Securities and Exchange
Commission said in a statement March 15. Cohen hasn&#8217;t been
accused of wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohen&#8217;s SAC Capital will pay the entire settlement
expenses, according to a person familiar with the firm who asked
not to be named because the information is private. SAC has said
before that it would indemnify clients against disgorgement of
illegal profits and legal fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This settlement is a substantial step toward resolving
all outstanding regulatory matters and allows the firm to move
forward with confidence,&#8221; Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for
SAC Capital, said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We are committed
to continuing to maintain a first-rate compliance effort woven
into the fabric of the firm.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SAC affiliates settled the SEC&#8217;s claims without
admitting or denying wrongdoing. The settlement doesn&#8217;t preclude
a case against Cohen, according to a person familiar with the
matter who asked not to be identified because the matter isn&#8217;t
public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Steve Cohen has not been charged with any wrongdoing and
has done nothing wrong,&#8221; Gasthalter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC said its investigation is continuing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ex-Altium Banker to Be Charged in FSA Insider-Trading Probe &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former managing director at Altium Capital Ltd. will be
charged in an insider-trading investigation and face trial next
year along with a former Deutsche Bank AG broker and four
others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grant Harrison was sent a summons March 14 and told to
appear in court in April to be charged, a lawyer for the U.K.
Financial Services Authority, Neil Saunders, said at a London
court hearing March 15. Harrison will be added as a defendant in
the case against Martyn Dodgson, a former managing director at
Deutsche Bank, Saunders said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is scheduled to go to trial in September 2014 and
last as long as three months, according to information from the
March 15 hearing. Contact information for Harrison couldn&#8217;t
immediately be found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The FSA has informed us that the allegations relate
entirely to this individual&#8217;s personal actions while with a
previous employer,&#8221; Altium said in a statement. Harrison no
longer works for the firm and his actions haven&#8217;t had any impact
on Altium&#8217;s clients, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrison, who is listed as &#8220;inactive&#8221; on the FSA&#8217;s
register of people approved to work in the industry, joined
Altium as a managing director and the head of public company
business development in September 2011, according to a statement
on the firm&#8217;s website. He previously worked for Lloyds Banking
Group Plc in its equity capital markets business, and for a
Panmure Gordon  Co. unit, according to Altium. immediately be
found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charges stem from the FSA&#8217;s biggest insider-trading
investigation, known as Operation Tabernula, Latin for little
tavern. The agency alleges the men made more than 3 million
pounds ($4.5 million) on improper trades. Another defendant,
Richard Baldwin, was charged in December. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk A/S (NOVOB) fell the most in
11 days in Copenhagen trading after JPMorgan Chase  Co. said
investors are underestimating the extent to which the world&#8217;s
largest maker of diabetes medicines is losing ground to rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novo fell as much as 1.9 percent, the most since March 7.
The stock retreated 1.5 percent to 984 kroner at 10:56 a.m. in
the Danish capital, with trading volume at 27 percent of the
three-month daily average. The stock underperformed the Stoxx
Health Care index of 35 companies, which lost 0.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, U.S. regulators rejected Novo&#8217;s Tresiba
insulin, marking a set setback for the Bagsvaerd, Denmark-based
company&#8217;s contest with Sanofi to dominate the diabetes market.
JPMorgan today cut its recommendation on Novo shares to
underweight from neutral, citing the rejection as well as
&#8220;limited commercial upside&#8221; for the use of Novo&#8217;s liraglutide
product as a treatment against obesity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Both these factors seem to be under-appreciated by the
market,&#8221; Richard Vosser, a JPMorgan analyst, said in a note.
&#8220;In fact, Novo&#8217;s recent share price rally suggests investors
remain in denial that Novo&#8217;s fundamentals have deteriorated.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novo&#8217;s share fell 13 percent on Feb. 11, the day after the
Tresiba rejection. Since then, the stock gained 7.6 percent
through last week&#8217;s close. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The share will probably drop by the third quarter, when
Novo will have released obesity data for its liraglutide
product, according to the JPMorgan analyst. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect investors to reassess the risk reward of owning
Novo shares, with the likely conclusion, in our view, that they
should take profits,&#8221; Vosser said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve already reached that
conclusion and, hence downgrade to underweight.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. advised
cutting Chinese stock holdings and betting against the nation&#8217;s
biggest banks as economic growth slows and inflation quickens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. lender by assets downgraded China to
underweight and recommended bearish derivatives tied to the
country&#8217;s four biggest banks, Adrian Mowat, JPMorgan&#8217;s chief
Asia and emerging-market strategist, wrote in a report today.
Mowat had a neutral position on China in a Feb. 20 note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Growth momentum is now slowing with policy response
constrained; a nasty combination,&#8221; Mowat wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s industrial output had the weakest start to a year
since 2009, retail sales growth slowed and inflation exceeded
projections. A government report today showed new home prices
posted the broadest advance since December 2011, challenging
Premier Li Keqiang&#8217;s efforts to prevent a real estate bubble.
Rapid credit growth, elevated property prices and a decline in
potential growth have increased risks of a financial crisis in
China, Nomura Holdings Inc. said in a March 15 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI), the benchmark gauge
for mainland companies listed in Hong Kong, tumbled 2.3 percent
at the mid-day trading break for the biggest drop among Asian
equity indexes. Industrial  Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the
country&#8217;s biggest lender by market value, dropped 3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese policy makers will probably tighten liquidity this
year to curb inflation, Katherine Lei, an analyst at JPMorgan,
wrote in a separate report dated yesterday. The proliferation of
non-bank financing makes it difficult to determine the scale and
timing of government measures to reign in credit growth,
creating additional &#8220;uncertainty,&#8221; Lei wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Put Options &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan recommended put options or short positions in
total return swaps linked to Chinese banks for investors who
share the firm&#8217;s pessimistic view on the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bearish outlook contrasts with that of HSBC Holdings
Plc, which said on March 10 that China&#8217;s central bank will
probably keep monetary policy &#8220;relatively accommodative&#8221; in
coming quarters as &#8220;modest&#8221; inflation pressure helps support
the economic recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s industrial production increased 9.9 percent in the
first two months of 2013 and retail sales rose 12.3 percent,
government data showed March 9, trailing economists&#8217; estimates.
New local-currency loans in February fell to 620 billion yuan
($99.6 billion), the People&#8217;s Bank of China said, lower than the
estimates of 27 out of 28 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer prices climbed 3.2 percent in February from a year
earlier, topping the median economist estimate of 3 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey. New home prices rose in 62 cities of the
70 the government tracks in February from a year earlier, the
National Bureau of Statistics said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stocks Correction &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zhou Xiaochuan, who was reappointed governor of China&#8217;s
central bank on March 16, said at a March 13 press conference
that policy makers should be on &#8220;high alert&#8221; over inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng China index is poised to enter a so-called
correction after declining more than 10 percent from this year&#8217;s
closing high on Feb. 1. The gauge has retreated 5.8 percent this
year, compared with a 2.2 percent drop in the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mowat said in a Feb. 20 report that developing-nation
shares may enter a &#8220;significant correction.&#8221; The MSCI emerging
markets gauge has dropped 3.4 percent since then, versus a 2
percent gain in the MSCI World Index of developed-nation shares. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of Canada Senior Deputy
Governor Tiff Macklem&#8217;s chances of replacing Mark Carney as the
central bank&#8217;s top official are between 50 percent and 60
percent, according to analysts at JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second-most likely candidate is Stephen Poloz, chief
executive at Export Development Canada, according to a report
today by Kevin Hebner and Sandy Batten in New York. Macklem&#8217;s
promotion isn&#8217;t certain because the last two selections skipped
over the top deputy while Finance Minister Jim Flaherty has
suggested he wants someone with deep financial market
experience, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market may be underestimating the possibility of a
surprise,&#8221; wrote Hebner, a foreign-exchange strategist and
Batten, a senior economist. &#8220;Choosing Macklem would represent
an endorsement of existing BoC policy, which has been to
maintain a tightening bias in the face of deteriorating economic
conditions, even as central bank policy makers in other G-7
countries add stimulus. However, we think a surprise
announcement would likely be interpreted dovishly&#8221; and may
weaken the Canadian dollar, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada&#8217;s benchmark interest rate has been 1 percent for
more than two years. Policy makers in the world&#8217;s 11th largest
economy are grappling with a strong currency and sluggish global
demand that&#8217;s hampering exports, record consumer-debt loads
impinging spending and inflation averaging below the Bank of
Canada&#8217;s 2 percent target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governor Carney is leaving the Ottawa-based central bank on
June 1 to take over the Bank of England a month later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Front-runner Macklem is well-liked and supported within
the Bank, and we think he certainly has the qualifications to be
Governor,&#8221; Hebner and Batten wrote in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other candidates to replace Carney include deputy governors
Timothy Lane and Agathe Cote along with former deputy governor
Jean Boivin who now works at the finance department, the report
said. The job could also go to Bank of Montreal (BMO) Vice Chairman

&lt;p&gt;Vale SA (VALE5), the world&#8217;s biggest iron-
ore producer, fell to a six-month low as Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. lowered its estimate for the value of the material and cut
the price target on the company&#8217;s American depositary receipts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vale slumped 3.9 percent to 32.39 reais at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo, the lowest since Sept. 4. The stock
contributed the most to the benchmark Bovespa index&#8217;s 1.1
percent drop today. Vale&#8217;s ADRs sank 2.6 percent to $16.98 in
New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices for iron ore, the main ingredient used to make
steel, will probably average $139 a metric ton this year, down
from a previous estimate of $144, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote
in a research report today. Analysts from Morgan Stanley and
Deutsche Bank AG also have forecast lower prices this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The two key drivers of this more subdued outlook are the
growing role of scrap in Chinese steel production, and ongoing
investment in Chinese domestic iron-ore production,&#8221; the
Goldman Sachs analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China, the world&#8217;s largest iron-ore buyer, accounts for 34
percent of Rio de Janeiro-based Vale&#8217;s revenue, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman analysts Marcelo Aguiar and Diogo Miura cut the
target price for Vale&#8217;s ADRs to $26 from $29.30, according to a
separate research note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vale&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer Murilo Ferreira said March
18 he expects iron-ore prices to average $110 to $145 a metric
ton this year. Prices &#8220;may suffer a bit&#8221; in the second half
because of supply increases, Jose Carlos Martins, Vale&#8217;s head of
ferrous minerals and strategy, said on a Feb. 28 conference
call. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR), the No. 2
maker of networking gear, dropped the most in five months after
a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst downgraded the stock, citing
competition from Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) and Alcatel-Lucent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of the Sunnyvale, California-based company slid 5.3
percent to $19.14 at the close in New York, the biggest decline
since Oct. 24. The stock has fallen 12 percent in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juniper&#8217;s sales and profitability are being threatened by
Alcatel-Lucent&#8217;s entry into the market for routers that sit at
the center of Internet providers&#8217; networks, as well as Cisco&#8217;s
new Nexus 6000 switches and Palo Alto Networks Inc. (PANW)&#8217;s momentum
in security firewalls, Simona Jankowski at Goldman Sachs wrote
in a research note today. She cut her rating on Juniper stock to
sell from neutral, and lowered the price target to $17 from $21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have greater concerns about Juniper&#8217;s ability to
execute in an environment marked by more rapid disruptive change
and heightened competition,&#8221; Jankowski wrote. The challenges
&#8220;include the potentially disruptive nature of the move to a
more software-oriented model, the impact on the balance sheet
from the accelerated pace of recent acquisitions, and higher
than average senior management turnover over the last three
years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juniper&#8217;s primary business is selling networking equipment
to telecommunications-service providers, whose capital spending
has been inconsistent. While there are positive signs in that
area, spending on core Internet-routing gear may remain
sluggish, Jankowski wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News reported in October that Juniper planned to
eliminate 500 jobs, or 5 percent of its workforce, to cut
expenses amid rising competition, citing people familiar with
the matter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its
estimate for iron-ore prices this year on expectations demand
will moderate and steel production will slow in China, the
world&#8217;s largest buyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron ore may average $139 a metric ton, compared with a
previous estimate of $144, analysts Christian Lelong and Jeffrey Currie wrote in a report today. The bank has a neutral outlook
on the commodity and prices may be supported at about $140 by
the need for high-cost Chinese mine production to balance the
market in 2013, the report showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices have dropped 7.2 percent in 2013 as China&#8217;s
industrial output had the weakest start to a year since 2009 and
concern rose that curbs on construction in the country will
reduce demand for the steelmaking material. Iron ore has peaked
and will decline over the rest of the year, Morgan Stanley said
March 7, joining analysts from Deutsche Bank AG to Credit Suisse
Group AG in forecasting lower prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect global seaborne iron-ore demand to revert back
to its historical growth rate of 2 percent per annum,&#8221; Goldman
Sachs said. &#8220;Steel production growth has slowed in China and we
expect it will remain below GDP growth rates in the future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rio, BHP &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rio Tinto Group, the world&#8217;s second-largest iron-ore
exporter, fell the most in 16 months in London trading after
Goldman cut the stock to conviction sell from neutral. London-
based Rio slumped 5.2 percent to close at 3,107 pence. BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP) dropped 3.5 percent after Goldman lowered its
rating to neutral from buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron ore with 62 percent content delivered to the Chinese
port of Tianjin slipped 0.2 percent to $134.40 a dry ton today,
according to the Steel Index Ltd. Swaps are trading at $132 a
ton for April, $127.50 for the second quarter and $121.25 for
the third, according to SSY Futures Ltd., a broker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China will expand 8.1 percent this year and 8 percent in
2014 after the weakest annual growth in 13 years in 2012,
according to the median estimate of analysts compiled by
Bloomberg. The nation&#8217;s new leadership is focusing on building a
consumer-led economy as a construction boom wanes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New iron-ore supplies and slower growth in steel demand
will weigh on prices during the second half, Greg Lilleyman, Rio
Tinto (RIO)&#8217;s president of Pilbara operations, said today. Steel
demand growth in China slowed to 2.1 percent last year from 20
percent in 2010, according to Citigroup Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chinese Measures &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steel production is exceeding China&#8217;s domestic consumption
and will probably decline in the near term, Commodore Research 
Consultancy said in a report today. China&#8217;s cabinet on March 1
introduced measures to ease house prices and ordered stricter
enforcement of taxes on sales as authorities step up a three-
year campaign to cool the real-estate market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s domestic iron-ore production may also be more
resilient than expected, Goldman Sachs said. Continued
investment in large-scale mines is likely to offset the loss of
marginal mines and moderate future demand for imports, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country imported 56.4 million tons of ore in February,
compared with 65.5 million tons a month earlier, according to
the customs administration. Idled Chinese mines with capacity of
100 million tons a year will return to the market from March
after the winter ends, Macquarie Research said in a Feb. 22
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron ore is measured in dry tons, or metric tons less
moisture. At Tianjin port, moisture can account for 8 percent to
10 percent of the ore&#8217;s weight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dodd-Frank Act derivatives rules
are failing to give regulators a full picture of the swaps
market and wouldn&#8217;t help them detect a loss similar to JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s London Whale trades, according to Commodity
Futures Trading Commission member Scott O&#8217;Malia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swap-trade data the agency has been receiving since the end
of last year from repositories including the Depository Trust
and Clearing Corp. is inadequate to identify large positions and
have overwhelmed government computer systems, O&#8217;Malia said in a
speech prepared for a Securities Industry and Financial Markets
Association conference in Phoenix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data &#8220;is not usable in its current form,&#8221; said
O&#8217;Malia, 45, one of the agency&#8217;s five commissioners. &#8220;The
problem is so bad that staff have indicated that they currently
cannot find the London Whale in the current data files.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, regarded on Wall Street as one of the best-
managed banks in the world, lost more than $6.2 billion last
year in a derivatives bet on companies&#8217; creditworthiness that
reached a net notional value of $157 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dodd-Frank was enacted in part to give regulators better
oversight of the $639 trillion global swaps market after largely
unregulated trades help fuel the 2008 credit crisis. The CFTC
and Securities and Exchange Commission were granted authority to
write rules requiring trade information to be reported to so-
called swap data repositories that function as central
recordkeepers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Swaps Databases &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of pages of rules governing the databases were
among the first regulations completed by the five-member
commission and began to take effect at the end of 2012. Swap
dealers including JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) had to
begin reporting price and other data on interest rate and credit
swaps by the end of last year; the London Whale trades came to
light after steep losses in the first quarter of 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different swap dealers and trading counter-parties are
using their own reporting formats because the government failed
to specify standards, O&#8217;Malia said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It means that for each category of swap identified by the
70-plus reporting swap dealers, those swaps will be reported in
70-plus different data formats because each swap dealer has its
own proprietary data format it uses in its internal systems,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;The permutations of data language are staggering.
Doesn&#8217;t that sound like a reporting nightmare?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CFTC&#8217;s computer systems are failing to handle the
incoming data. &#8220;None of our computer programs load this data
without crashing,&#8221; O&#8217;Malia said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) named Andy Fisher head of technology equity capital markets, effective
immediately, according to a memo to employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fisher will report to David Ludwig, who leads technology,
media and telecom equity capital markets, the firm&#8217;s executives
wrote in the memo today, a copy of which was obtained by
Bloomberg News. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the New York-
based bank, confirmed the memo&#8217;s contents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs earned $987 million in equity underwriting
revenue last year, a 9 percent decline from 2011, the firm said
in January. For the fourth quarter of 2012, that revenue surged
59 percent to $304 million from a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman Sachs has enjoyed significant momentum in
technology equity,&#8221; the bank said in the memo. &#8220;Andy was a key
part of that success, having led many of our most important and
meaningful transactions for the firm.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fisher, based in San Francisco, joined Goldman Sachs in
2005, according to Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
records. He previously worked at Credit Suisse Group AG, the

&lt;p&gt;EverBank Financial Corp. (EVER) and
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) are planning to sell securities backed by
$924 million of new U.S. home loans without government backing
in deals that would double the number of issuers in the so-
called non-agency market since the debt caused a global crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EverBank, whose home-loan unit is run by Tom Wind, the
former head of residential lending at Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc., is issuing bonds backed by $308 million of loans, Fitch
Ratings said in a report. JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, is
planning a $616 million transaction, the credit grader said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both sets of bonds are tied to large, &#8220;high quality&#8221;
loans to borrowers with more than 30 percent equity in their
homes on average, according to separate presale reports by
Fitch, which said the deals had other risky features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issuance in the non-agency market is rising after the size
of mortgages that government-supported Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac can finance fell and their bond-guarantee fees increased,
while investors flock to assets with potentially higher returns
as the Federal Reserve suppresses yields on notes with less
default risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) last year joined Redwood Trust Inc. (RWT)
as the only issuers since the market revived in 2010. They have
completed deals backed by about $2.1 billion of new mortgages
this year, compared with $3.5 billion in all of last year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales peaked at $1.2
trillion in both 2005 and 2006 before collapsing as prices
tumbled amid soaring foreclosures and plunging real-estate
values, sparking a global financial crisis in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Potential Liabilities &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Cosgrove, a spokesman for Jacksonville, Florida-
based EverBank, declined to comment. Jennifer Zuccarelli, a
spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan, didn&#8217;t return a
telephone message seeking comment on its transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s bonds are made riskier by the bank and other
originators of the mortgages offering weaker promises to
repurchase misrepresented loans than those on similar deals,
Fitch said yesterday in an e-mailed report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders and bond sponsors have been seeking to trim
potential liabilities in such deals as the market revives after
suffering billions of dollars of losses from debt sold before
the housing collapse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of the so-called representations and warranties
in the JPMorgan transaction is &#8220;significantly diluted by
qualifying and conditional language that substantially reduces
lender loan-breach liability and the inclusion of sunsets for a
number of provisions including fraud,&#8221; New York-based Fitch
analysts including Roelof Slump wrote in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Loss Buffers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classes of the deal expected to receive top credit
ratings carried loss buffers of 7.4 percent as Fitch said it
adjusted its analysis to reflect the greater investor dangers
created by the weaker contracts, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That compares with so-called credit enhancement, created by
items such as other bonds being first in line to absorb losses
from the underlying loans, of 7.05 percent in a Credit Suisse
deal in February and 6.5 percent in a transaction last month by
Redwood, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EverBank&#8217;s securities that may get AAA ratings from Fitch
carry 8.2 percent credit enhancement, according to a separate
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ratings firm said it took into account the risks posed
by the lender not being strong enough financially to count on
for repurchases. EverBank also has a &#8220;limited track record&#8221; in
the market, and approximately 37 percent of the underlying
borrowers have mortgages on two or more properties, Fitch said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kroll Grades &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan securities are backed by loans with average
balances of $819,495, while the EverBank bonds are tied to
mortgages averaging $805,302, according to Fitch. That suggests
that the loans are so-called jumbo mortgages as such big debts
dominate the revival in the non-agency bond market led by
Redwood and Credit Suisse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jumbo home loans are larger than allowed in government-
supported programs, currently as much as $729,750 for single-
family properties in some areas. For Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
loans with the lowest costs for borrowers using 20 percent down
payments, limits range from $417,000 to $625,500, down from as
much $729,750 in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kroll Bond Rating Agency plans to assign similar grades to
the JPMorgan bonds as Fitch, according to a report yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it also saw the representation and warranty
provisions as a &#8220;credit negative,&#8221; those features were
mitigated by the debt&#8217;s high quality and reviews of all of their
files by a third-party firm, Kroll said in its presale report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If similar provisions were present in a transaction that
had lower-quality collateral, was subjected to less robust
third-party diligence review or had a higher proportion of
originators that were potentially financially weaker, Kroll Bond
Rating Agency might forecast higher expected loss levels or
consider a downward adjustment of its ratings,&#8221; the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jumbo home loans are larger than allowed in government-
supported programs, currently as much as $729,750 for single-
family properties in some areas. For Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
loans with the lowest costs for borrowers using 20 percent down
payments, limits range from $417,000 to $625,500. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kroll Bond Rating Agency plans to assign similar grades to
the JPMorgan bonds as Fitch, according to a report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it also saw the representation and warranty
provisions as a &#8220;credit negative,&#8221; those features were
mitigated by the debt&#8217;s high quality and reviews of all of their
files by a third-party firm, Kroll said in its presale report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If similar provisions were present in a transaction that
had lower quality collateral, was subjected to less robust third
party diligence review or had a higher proportion of originators
that were potentially financially weaker, Kroll Bond Rating
Agency might forecast higher expected loss levels or consider a
downward adjustment of its ratings,&#8221; the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) plans to shut a
hydrotreater at its Pascagoula refinery in Mississippi in the
first week of April for six weeks of maintenance, according to a
person familiar with the work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery&#8217;s coker is still shut following about six
weeks of maintenance and may restart next week, said the person,
who asked not to be identified because the information isn&#8217;t
public. Recent turnaround work also took place on a crude
distillation unit and vacuum distillation unit, another person
familiar with the work said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pascagoula plant has the capacity to process 330,000
barrels of crude a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It produces 39 percent gasoline, 23 percent diesel and 15
percent jet fuel, according to Chevron&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hydrotreater removes sulfur, metal and other impurities
from refined products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sean Comey, a San Ramon, California-based spokesman for
Chevron, said the company doesn&#8217;t comment on routine maintenance
and will continue to supply customers with products without
interruption. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) joined natural gas
producers and environmental groups to form an independent center
that will set standards for drilling by hydraulic fracturing in
the U.S. Appalachian region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas output in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia is
booming as drillers unlock shale deposits using the process,
also called fracking, that shoots water, sand and chemicals
underground to crack rock and free trapped gas. The process has
spurred complaints from landowners and environmental groups
about increased air pollution and water contamination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Shale gas has transformed our nation&#8217;s energy mix, while
both offering environmental benefits and posing serious
environmental challenges,&#8221; Fred Krupp, president of the
Environmental Defense Fund, a group that's part of the venture,
said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Center for Sustainable Shale Development, being formed
today in Pittsburgh, will provide independent evaluations of gas
producers that join the effort. The center&#8217;s standards will
limit flaring, encourage maximum water recycling and reduce the
toxicity of the fracking fluid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domestic production of natural gas has boosted the U.S.
economy by lowering the cost of the fuel used in manufacturing.
The Marcellus Shale, which runs along the Appalachian Mountains
from New York to Virginia, is the nation&#8217;s largest-producing gas
field, according to energy company Range Resources Corp. (RRC) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industry groups for chemical, fertilizer and steel
companies are touting economic gains as natural gas supplies
become more accessible. Low-cost natural gas could generate $72
billion in capital investment as petrochemical companies
relocate or boost investments in the U.S., according to the
American Chemistry Council. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) hired Nick Jordan from UBS AG (UBSN) as co-head of its operations in Moscow in the
fourth overhaul of its leadership in the country in as many
years, according to two people with knowledge of the move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jordan, a 53-year-old, Russian-speaking American, will work
alongside Paolo Zannoni, who was named country chief last year,
said the people, who asked not to be identified as the move
hasn&#8217;t been made public. Jordan, the former chief of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.&#8217;s Russian unit, was named head of UBS&#8217;s
local operations in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;UBS was too small for Nick taking into account its
limited commitment to Russia,&#8221; Ilya Scherbovich, founder of
investment firm United Capital Partners, who worked with him at
Deutsche UFG, said in an e-mail today. &#8220;Nick is the most
experienced banker on the Russian market by far and he was
involved in dozens of very important transactions in Russia.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is adding staff after the government hired it
last month to advise it on attracting more institutional
investors. The Wall Street firm is also one of 23 foreign and
domestic banks selected to advise Russia on its 1 trillion-ruble
($33 billion) privatization program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Job Cuts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monika Schaller, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman in Frankfurt,
and Dominik Von Arx, a UBS spokesman in London, declined to
comment. UBS, Switzerland&#8217;s biggest bank based in Zurich, has
been scaling back its investment bank, cutting 10,000 jobs over
three years and exiting most debt-trading businesses to focus on
money management and boost its return on equity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) unit reached
a $100 million settlement with MF Global Inc. (MFGLQ) liquidators over
the bank&#8217;s conduct in the days before and after the brokerage&#8217;s
collapse, paving the way for the return of money to its former
customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement follows a year of negotiations and the review
of more than 100,000 documents, according to papers filed
yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. It resolves
claims against JPMorgan arising from transfers of customer
property in the days leading up to MF Global&#8217;s bankruptcy and
the company&#8217;s actions as one of the brokerage&#8217;s primary banks
and repository for customer property. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James W. Giddens, a trustee for the liquidating brokerage,
seeks to return an additional $200 million to customers as a
result of the settlement, which also recoups $29 million in MF
Global funds held at the bank and completes a previous return of
$417 million by JPMorgan, according to a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a favorable and economically sound agreement
ending what would have been a costly, protracted, and uncertain
legal battle,&#8221; Giddens said in yesterday&#8217;s statement. &#8220;Without
the agreement, additional substantial distributions would have
been delayed for at least two or three years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V), the world&#8217;s biggest
payment network, would benefit from buying Visa Europe Ltd.
because creating a single global business would outweigh
regulatory risk, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe, a London-based network owned by banks, has a
put option giving it the right to require Foster City,
California-based Visa to purchase its shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our longstanding view on the put being exercised is
positive, as we believe a consolidated global network is
stronger than a split network,&#8221; Tien-tsin Huang, a JPMorgan
analyst who has an overweight rating on Visa shares, said in a
note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders that own Visa Europe are considering requiring Visa
to make the purchase, the Wall Street Journal reported
yesterday. Visa Chief Executive Officer Charles Scharf is vying
with competitors MasterCard Inc. (MA) and China UnionPay for a share
of the payment-processing market amid a global shift from cash
to plastic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe split from Visa prior to its initial public
offering in 2008. While purchasing the company could introduce
new risks tied to European Union regulations, it would add about
$1.2 billion to Visa&#8217;s annual revenue, Huang wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa gained 1 percent to $1.58 at 10:12 a.m. in New York.
The shares are up 4 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal could cost Visa between $3 billion and $11
billion, according to the Wall Street Journal, which attributed
the information to people familiar with the matter and analysts&#8217;
projections. Huang said the deal might cost more than $4.6
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have a strong and productive relationship with Visa
Europe,&#8221; Will Valentine, a Visa spokesman, said in a phone
interview. He declined to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will stop processing multiple requests for payment
on checks that have already been returned due to insufficient
funds when payday lenders and other billers are suspected of
seeking &#8220;inappropriate payments,&#8221; the New York-based company

&lt;p&gt;The change, which takes effect in May, &#8220;is intended to
address payday lenders and others who present repeated payments

&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) are among a group of banks that lost out on about 100
million euros ($129 million) in fees after Germany&#8217;s Evonik
Industries AG ditched an initial public offering in favor of a
private placement, said people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision by owners CVC Capital Partners Ltd. and RAG
Stiftung to sell shares directly to institutional investors last
week with the help of local brokerage MainFirst Bank AG came
after three failed IPOs in five years. Evonik had sought to
raise as much as 4 billion euros in last year&#8217;s attempt, led by
Deutsche Bank and Goldman, according to one of the people, who
declined to be identified because the talks were private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evonik&#8217;s move was an unexpected blow to the IPO advisers,
which had counted on the sale being revived and ultimately
getting paid for the work they had done preparing for the last
offering, these people said. It also highlights a new threat to
bulge-bracket banks struggling to boost fees in an IPO market
coming off its worst year since 2009. The Evonik sale would have
been Germany&#8217;s biggest IPO in more than a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is something investment banks may be concerned about
because other intermediaries are competing with their
business,&#8221; said Martin Steinbach, the Frankfurt-based IPO
leader for Europe, Middle East, India, Africa, at Ernst  Young. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evonik announced on March 12 that its owners sold a 12
percent stake to institutional investors. The deal may value the
company at about 14 billion euros, a person familiar with the
matter said. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher  Flom LLP advised
the institutions buying the shares. None of the IPO advisers
were involved in the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Painful Lesson&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have learned a painful lesson on the topic of IPOs,&#8221;
Evonik Chief Executive Officer Klaus Engel told reporters last
week in Essen, Germany, where the company is based. Engel cited
the four-to-six month IPO preparation process as one of the
reasons why its three attempts were derailed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MainFirst, a Frankfurt-based brokerage with 200 employees
that specializes in selling European equities to institutional
investors, reached out to Evonik&#8217;s owners soon after they
abandoned the last IPO attempt in June, according to a person
familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank suggested a private placement that would allow the
owners more control over pricing and reduce risk, the person
said. By the end of February it had lined up a first group of
investors and had a second group less than a month later,
according to the person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The share placement will probably pave the way for a public
listing on the Frankfurt stock exchange at the end of April,
according to two people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fee Fall &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Evonik&#8217;s owners, using MainFirst was not only more
efficient, it was cheaper. The firm will earn a fraction of the
estimated 100 million euros, or 2.5 percent of the IPO proceeds,
that Evonik would have paid to Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs,
Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse Group AG and
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), according to people familiar with the
matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen at Goldman, JPMorgan, Bank of America, Credit
Suisse, Deutsche Bank and MainFirst declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IPO fees in Europe fell by almost two-thirds to $351
million in 2012, mirroring a similar decline in volumes as
concern about the region&#8217;s sovereign debt crisis curbed investor
appetite for new shares. IPOs are among the most lucrative
advisory businesses for banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evonik&#8217;s route to the stock market could be an alternative
for large companies like Evonik that are already known to
investors, Ernst  Young&#8217;s Steinbach said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This clearly adds to the arsenal of alternatives for
companies that want to list,&#8221; said Stephan Hutter, a partner at
Skadden who led the transaction. &#8220;The uniqueness of the
transaction is also that the owners didn&#8217;t retain the services
of the traditional investment banks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), which makes most of its money from high-end technology
contracts, is betting that some of its growth will come from
customers who don&#8217;t pay anything -- yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has developed an application to track the water
system in Tshwane, South Africa, where more than half the
population lives in slums that often aren&#8217;t connected to
plumbing. IBM is letting the community use the app for free,
after it sent a team of executives to evaluate the system as
part of a corporate service project in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefit to IBM is it can use the city as a testing
ground for the application, while gaining favor with the local
government. It also may catch the attention of other cities with
similar problems. Relationships are key to building the
company&#8217;s business in Africa, where it now has offices in more
than 20 countries, compared with just four in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re not just walking in and saying, &#8216;Throw us our
money,&#8217;&#8221; said Perry Hartswick, an architect of IBM&#8217;s Smarter
Planet program, which tries to fix civic problems with tracking
technology. &#8220;We&#8217;re walking in to say we&#8217;re here to be a part of
Africa. That&#8217;s a very important part of the way we approach any
new geography.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Group AG and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. are selling to investors through pass-through notes
a $1.27 billion loan made to the Brazilian state of Minas
Gerais, according to people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse made the original 10-year loan in November
with an interest rate of 5.33 percent to help repay debt owed to
Cia. Energetica de Minas Gerais, or Cemig, as the utility
company is known. The loan will be sold to a special-purpose
entity that will issue the pass-through notes to investors,
according to the people, who asked not to be identified because
they aren&#8217;t authorized to comment publicly. The state of Minas
Gerais declined to comment on the offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are taking advantage of federal guarantees to make
more loans to Brazilian states seeking to refinance debt as
benchmark interest rates have fallen to record lows. Brazil
authorized 21 states in August to borrow 60 billion reais ($30
billion) through 2014 with government guarantees to compensate
for lower tax transfers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This type of borrowing is OK as long as constraints are
in place,&#8221; John Welch, a strategist at CIBC World Markets, said
by phone from Toronto. &#8220;Minas Gerais looks pretty good
fiscally. They got themselves in good shape.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian states and cities haven&#8217;t been able to take
advantage of the unprecedented decline in borrowing costs
because they have been restricted from selling bonds since a
1997 bailout, leaving the country without a municipal bond
market. States faced financial turmoil in the 1990s after years
of mismanagement and hyperinflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1999 Crisis &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minas Gerais threatened to halt payments of debt owed to
the federal government in 1999 in a challenge to then President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso&#8217;s bid to restore investor confidence.
The crisis helped lead to the devaluation of the real. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The idea is to keep the purse strings very tight on the
states because historically they tend to overdo it and expect a
bailout,&#8221; Welch of CIBC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leonardo Colombini, the state finance secretary, told
Bloomberg News in October that Minas Gerais also planned to
borrow $450 million from the World Bank and 300 million euros
($387 million) from the French Development Agency to pay off
debt to Cemig. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank of Canada (RY) Chief
Executive Officer Gordon Nixon was paid more than his
counterparts at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and
Citigroup Inc. (C) as record earnings last year helped most Canadian
bank CEOs narrow the pay gap with the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nixon was awarded C$12.6 million ($12.3 million) in salary,
stock and bonuses for fiscal 2012, his biggest pay raise since
2006, making him the highest-paid bank CEO in Canada. Bank of
America CEO Brian T. Moynihan, 53, was awarded $12 million,
while Jamie Dimon, 57, at JPMorgan saw his pay halved to $11.5
million. Citigroup paid its new CEO, 52-year-old Michael Corbat,
$11.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s probably one of the first examples ever of a
Canadian bank CEO being abreast of a mighty U.S. bank,&#8221; said
Michael Smedley, who helps manage C$1 billion at Morgan Meighen
 Associates in Toronto. &#8220;There seems to be some justification
for seeing a parallel.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canadian bank CEO pay is moving closer to U.S. rivals --
and in some cases surpassing them -- after the world&#8217;s soundest
banks withstood the global financial crisis and several posted
record earnings in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Royal Bank, in particular, has done an extremely good job
at aligning the movement of CEO pay with the movement of
shareholder performance over the past eight years,&#8221; said Matt
Fullbrook, research manager at the Clarkson Centre for Business
Ethics and Board Effectiveness, part of the Rotman School of
Management at the University of Toronto. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Aligning Pay &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks have been better than most Canadian companies at
aligning CEO pay to shareholder returns, said Fullbrook, who
published a report in January examining CEO pay and performance
for 52 companies between 2004 and 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank was the top performing stock among Canada&#8217;s
largest lenders last year, surging 15 percent to lead the eight-
company Standard  Poor&#8217;s/TSX Commercial Banks Industry Index. (STCBNK)
The banks index (SPTSX) rose 11 percent in 2012, outpacing the 4 percent
return of Canada&#8217;s benchmark SP/TSX Composite Index. Royal Bank
reached a record high of C$64.49 on Feb. 20, before declining to
C$60.74 at 4 p.m. in Toronto. During the past five years, Royal
Bank has returned 60 percent, including dividends, compared with
a 17 percent gain for JPMorgan and a 68 percent drop at Bank of
America. Citigroup fell 79 percent over the period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Canadian Laggards &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Royal Bank and other Canadian lenders are laggards
compared with large U.S. banks in the past year. The 24-company
KBW Bank Index (BKX) rose 30 percent last year. Royal Bank&#8217;s 1.4
percent stock rise since January has trailed Citigroup&#8217;s 14
percent gain, JPMorgan&#8217;s 10 percent advance and the 8.3 percent
increase of Bank of America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nixon, 56, was given a 25 percent increase in total
compensation from a year earlier, according to a filing to
Canadian securities regulators last month. The figures exclude
costs to service his pension. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country&#8217;s largest bank posted record net income of
C$7.54 billion in the year ended Oct. 31 and reached internal
targets after selling its unprofitable U.S. retail lender RBC
Bank to PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (PNC) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of Nova Scotia, Canada&#8217;s third-largest bank, awarded
CEO Richard Waugh C$11.1 million, a 4.6 percent increase. The
top executives at Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD), Bank of Montreal and
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce weren&#8217;t far behind even after
having their pay cut. Combined, the five bank heads were awarded
about C$53 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Massive Profits&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the context of the size of the operations and the
massive profits the banks make, it would not seem to be
overpayment,&#8221; Morgan Meighen&#8217;s Smedley said. &#8220;In terms of what
human beings should actually be paid, whatever they do, it
probably is.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Nixon&#8217;s pay exceeded domestic peers, it still lags
behind some larger U.S. banks. Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) awarded 59-
year-old CEO John Stumpf $19.3 million for 2012, a 7.8 percent
increase from the previous year. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
awarded $21 million to CEO Lloyd Blankfein, 58, a person with
knowledge of the matter said in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At JPMorgan, Dimon&#8217;s pay was cut 50 percent as a penalty
for his role in the so-called London Whale episode that led to a
trading loss of more than $6.2 billion at his New York-based
company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Excessive&#8217; Pay &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canadian bank CEO compensation is &#8220;excessive&#8221; and should
be limited to no more than 30 times the median pay of non-
management employees, said Mouvement d&#8217;education et de defense
des actionnaires, a shareholder advocacy group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The comparison of a CEO salary with American or England
or other bankers in the world is not correct,&#8221; Daniel Thouin, a
board member of the Montreal-based organization, said in an
interview. &#8220;There&#8217;s no real obligation to give this kind of
salary in Canada.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank met or exceeded its financial targets for 2012,
including diluted earnings per-share growth of at least 7
percent and a return on equity of more than 18 percent. The bank
said it also took steps to &#8220;de-risk&#8221; its balance sheet and
extended its leadership position in Canada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Through consistent execution of our diversified business
strategy, and a balanced focus on the interests of all
stakeholders including shareholders, clients, employees and
communities, Mr. Nixon has continued to position RBC to deliver
our long-term strategy and generate sustainable value,&#8221; the
bank wrote in its management proxy circular. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nixon has led the bank since 2001. While his compensation
has increased since then, the bank cut his pay for 2004 after
annual profit that year declined for the first time in five
years. After profit fell again in 2008, Nixon chose to forfeit a
C$4.95 million bonus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the biggest U.S.
oil producer, said efforts by Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) to limit the
country&#8217;s natural gas exports would create a price cap for the
commodity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dow is a member of America&#8217;s Energy Advantage, a group of
manufacturers and gas distributors that says unfettered exports
of liquefied natural gas may undermine the benefits of rising
output from shale rock. Companies such as Dow want a return to
government controls on gas prices that ended in the 1980s, said
Stephen Pryor, president of Irving, Texas-based Exxon&#8217;s chemical
business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s what they are calling for,&#8221; Pryor said yesterday
in an interview in Houston. &#8220;It&#8217;s basically a price cap.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dow isn&#8217;t seeking a cap, said Kevin Kolevar, the Midland,
Michigan-based company&#8217;s vice president for government affairs
and public policy. The Department of Energy needs to consider
effects on manufacturing, consumers and energy security before
approving LNG exports, he said by telephone today. Dow isn&#8217;t
calling for gas prices to be a trigger in the decision-making
process, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon is considering exporting U.S. gas from LNG terminals
in Alaska and Texas. Pryor said most studies forecast exports
equal to 5 percent to 15 percent of U.S. gas demand, consistent
with Exxon&#8217;s outlook. Production will rise with exports to keep
price increases &#8220;moderate,&#8221; he said. He declined to provide a
specific price forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Public Interest &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We must oppose protectionism in our home countries,&#8221;
Pryor said yesterday at the IHS World Petrochemical Conference
in Houston. &#8220;These proposals to block LNG investments,
justified by artificial price caps, represent a selective and
harmful departure from free-market and free-trade principles.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LNG exports may contribute to a gas shortage by 2030 that
would triple prices, according to a study by Charles River
Associates posted on the America&#8217;s Energy Advantage website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Export applications before the DOE would, if approved,
collectively export gas equal to more than half of current U.S.
consumption, Dow&#8217;s Kolevar said. While not all those projects
will ultimately proceed, gas demand may still exceed production
later this decade if some are approved without considering the
&#8220;public interest,&#8221; something the government is legally bound
to do, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We do have concerns that there is a tipping point at
which LNG exports turn from a net positive for this nation to a
net negative,&#8221; Kolevar said. &#8220;The problem is, once you hit
that point, it&#8217;s too late to go back.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dow, which plans to spend $4 billion on new chemical plants
on the Texas coast, uses gas to run its factories and as a raw
material for making plastics and other materials. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world&#8217;s largest
soft drink maker, plans to fire 750 employees in its U.S.
division following a February decision to pare its distribution
regions from seven to three. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cuts in the coming months will represent about 1
percent of jobs in Coca-Cola&#8217;s North American unit, which covers
the U.S. and Canada, Scott Williamson, a spokesman, said today
in an interview. A quarter of the job losses will be in Atlanta,
where Coca-Cola is headquartered, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent has worked to
restructure distribution in the U.S. since buying the North
American operations of Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (CCE) in 2010. Coca-
Cola, which now bottles about 80 percent of its drinks volume
sold in the U.S., said in February it was paring the
distribution regions to improve efficiency and cut costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Coca-Cola Refreshments bottling unit now includes East,
Central and West divisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares rose 1.3 percent to $40.37 at 11:45 a.m. in New
York. Coca-Cola had gained 10 percent this year through
yesterday compared with a 9.3 percent increase for the Standard
 Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The job cuts were reported earlier by the Atlanta Journal-
Constitution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esso SAF, the French refinery
operator owned by Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), cut its 2012 dividend in
half because of a tax on oil inventories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esso will propose a payout of 2 euros a share compared with
4 euros a share for 2011, according to a statement. The dividend
has dropped steadily from 8.5 euros a share in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;France imposed a one-time 4 percent levy on the value of
fuel inventories held by refiners, distributors and other
businesses last year to raise about 550 million euros ($710
million). The move, part of President Francois Hollande&#8217;s bid to
lower the deficit, was criticized by industry lobby Union
Francaise des Industries Petrolieres for hurting the
competitiveness of local refineries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The tax is unfair and aberrant,&#8221; Francis Duseux, chief
executive officer of Esso SAF (ES), said today at a press conference
in Paris. &#8220;We would probably have kept the dividend at the same
level as 2011 if it hadn&#8217;t been for the tax.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tax cost Esso, which operates two refineries in France
as well as a service-station network, 33 million euros last year
while dividend payments for 2012 will amount to 26 million
euros, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Port-Jerome-Gravenchon refinery halted units with total
capacity of about 70,000 barrels a day, or about a third of the
plant, at the end of February for six or seven weeks of
maintenance, Duseux said. The site had a utilization rate of 74
percent last year, compared with 90 percent at Fos-sur-Mer,
because of maintenance work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esso reported a net profit of 63 million euros last year
compared with 46 million euros in 2011, according to the
company. Refining margins averaged 34 euros a metric ton,
ranging from 14 to 63 euros a ton in the period, according to
French environment ministry data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esso is seeking to sell its service stations to &#8220;more
agile&#8221; operators through a type of franchise system, retaining
supply contracts for 10 years, Duseux said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lithuania will wait to sign a
shale-gas exploration agreement with Chevron Corp. (CVX) until
Parliament amends laws to strengthen environmental regulations,
Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevicius said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ll sign the agreement after Parliament adopts the
legislation, which in the best case could be three weeks after
Easter,&#8221; Butkevicius told reporters today in Vilnius, the
capital. &#8220;Hopefully in early May we can start getting ready for
actual exploration.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, a U.S. energy company, last year bought half of
the Lithuanian oil and gas recovery company LL Investicijos and
in January submitted the only bid in a tender for shale-gas
exploration rights in the Baltic nation. Two parliamentary
committees this week urged the government to ban exploration
until laws regulating such activity are strengthened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Butkevicius said he subsequently agreed with lawmakers that
the government will rush to prepare draft legislation and
parliament will give the matter fast-track treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main change would be a new requirement for an
environmental impact study of exploration, separate from the
study required for potential later production of any shale gas
that is found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The delay will let political passions subside and will
give us more time to assuage concerns&#8221; of residents of the
areas where exploration is planned, he said. &#8220;In any case, we
have to find out what resources lay beneath our land.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prime minister said shale gas should get a chapter of
its own in a national energy strategy that the government is
preparing, since it may help reduce dependence on imports of
natural gas from Russia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) won a U.S.
appeals court decision compelling a female former managing
director who sued the firm for gender discrimination to pursue
her case through arbitration rather than in court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based panel yesterday ruled that Lisa Parisi,
one of three women who sued the firm in 2010 claiming they were
subjected to pay and promotion discrimination, can&#8217;t maintain
her case in U.S. court. Her employment contract contained a
clause requiring disputes to be resolved through arbitration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parisi&#8217;s lawyers argued their client had a right under
federal law to press her claim Goldman Sachs has a pattern and
practice of discriminating against managing directors who are
women, and that such claims can only be litigated in the context
of a class action, or group, case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lower court judge agreed, denying Goldman Sach&#8217;s request
he order Parisi&#8217;s case to arbitration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Because we disagree that a substantive statutory right to
pursue a pattern-or-practice claim exists, we reverse,&#8221; U.S.
Circuit Judge Barrington Parker wrote for a unanimous three-
judge panel. Joining him were Judges Gerard Lynch and Reena Raggi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enforcing Agreements &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citing U.S. Supreme Court precedent, the panel said the
high court has consistently interpreted the Federal Arbitration
Act as favoring the enforcement of such agreements, &#8220;even when
the claims at issue are federal statutory claims,&#8221; absent some
contrary congressional command. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court said Parisi may present to the
arbitrators any evidence of discriminatory practices or policies
at Goldman Sachs that affected her employment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, in an
e-mail message said the firm is pleased with the court&#8217;s
decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s an unfortunate decision, obviously, from our
perspective,&#8221; Adam Klein, an attorney for Parisi, said today in
a phone interview. &#8220;We thought the district court got it
right.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The net effect on the case may be limited, Klein said,
because the proposed class is primarily comprised of associates
and vice presidents, not managing directors like Parisi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Managing directors are going to have to file individual
arbitrations,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Harder&#8217; Win &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel decision was a victory for employers, two
attorneys who weren&#8217;t involved in the litigation said today in
separate interviews. It also made it more difficult for Parisi
to prevail, a University of California, Los Angeles, law
professor said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The court&#8217;s ruling made her case harder to win,&#8221; the
UCLA law professor, Katherine Stone, said by phone today. It is
more difficult to prove discrimination against one person than
it is to show a pattern and practice of discrimination against a
group of similar people, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s what was at stake here,&#8221; Stone said. Had Parisi
been allowed to pursue her claim in court as part of a class,
the burden to prove there was no such pattern would have shifted
to the investment firm, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Big Win&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parisi&#8217;s lawyer, Klein, said it seems &#8220;improbable&#8221; that
an arbitrator would extend the scope of the evidence disclosure
process to include employees beyond those who are immediately
comparable to an individual plaintiff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think anyone knows the answer,&#8221; he said. Klein
is a partner in New York-based Outten  Golden LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s fair to call it a big win for employers,&#8221; said
Michael P. Roche, a partner in the Chicago-based law firm
Winston  Strawn LLP. &#8220;This decision definitely strengthens the
ability of employers to ensure that claims can be arbitrated,&#8221;
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employers prefer arbitration over courthouse litigation
because it allows them to more easily control the cost of such
conflicts, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also allows them to avoid costly class actions and fight
in a forum of their own choosing, said Jeffrey Bernick, a
partner in the Phoenix office of the New York-based employment
law firm Jackson Lewis LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Parisi v. Goldman Sachs  Co., U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Senate Republicans and
Democrats moving closer to an agreement to grant a chance at
U.S. citizenship to 11 million undocumented immigrants, a long-
simmering dispute between organized labor and the business lobby
risks sapping the measure&#8217;s momentum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two constituencies are at odds over a new program to
provide U.S. work visas to low-skilled foreign workers, placing
pressure on lawmakers poised for a compromise. Unions are
pressing for a limited visa system that guarantees better wages
for future immigrant workers, while businesses seek a broader
program more responsive to their hiring needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s the thornier side of what is otherwise a broadening
consensus in both parties around an immigration plan, whose
centerpiece is a path to U.S. citizenship for undocumented
immigrants. A bipartisan group of eight senators is nearing a
deal to bolster border security and workplace verification while
revamping the legal immigration system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a member of the
group, called the guest-worker issue &#8220;one of the more difficult
parts&#8221; of the negotiations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to be part of a bill that doesn&#8217;t create a
process whereby people can come to this country temporarily in
the future if we need them,&#8221; Rubio said yesterday. &#8220;There&#8217;s no
secret that the broader labor movement, with some exceptions,
would rather not even have an immigration bill.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Political Consequences &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disagreement carries significant political consequences
for Republicans and Democrats alike, essentially making them
choose between their strongest constituencies -- organized labor
for Democrats and big business for Republicans -- and
achievement of an overriding policy goal that both parties
increasingly see as an electoral imperative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hispanics accounted for 10 percent of voters in the 2012
presidential election. President Barack Obama won 71 percent of
their votes, and just 27 percent backed Republican nominee Mitt Romney, who had proposed &#8220;self-deportation&#8221; for undocumented
immigrants. Since then, a growing chorus of Republicans has
publicly backed legal status for undocumented immigrants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a group of Republican officials who unveiled a
top-to-bottom review this week called for the party to back
&#8220;comprehensive immigration reform&#8221; or see its appeal shrink. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is in neither party&#8217;s interest for one group within a
party to stop this, because it is bad for the economy if we
don&#8217;t have immigration reform,&#8221; former Mississippi Governor and
Republican National Committee Chairman Haley Barbour said this
week, referring to labor unions&#8217; objections to a guest-worker
program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Worker Program &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, a Democrat co-
chairing an immigration task force with Barbour at the
Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington, said it is ultimately up
to Obama to persuade Democrats not to abandon the bill if the
immigrant-worker program doesn&#8217;t match the unions&#8217; agenda. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If we don&#8217;t get guest-worker provisions that are exactly
in line with what labor wants, we can&#8217;t hold up the bill because
of that,&#8221; Rendell said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to do the best we can to
preserve and protect the interests of organized labor, but in
the end you can&#8217;t always get what you want.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Obama, he added, has &#8220;his work cut out for him.&#8221; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bipartisan plan, expected to be unveiled next month
following a two-week congressional break, also faces a
potentially rough road in the Senate and uncertain fate in the
House, where Republican opposition to granting citizenship to
undocumented immigrants is more prevalent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closed-Door Negotiations &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At issue, for now, is a proposed new program that would
allow immigrants to work temporarily in the U.S. while allowing
them the option of seeking permanent residency. In closed-door
talks, labor unions and Democratic negotiators are proposing to
allocate 10,000 such visas initially and cap the program at
200,000 visas, according to people close to the negotiations who
requested anonymity to describe them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That number would increase or contract through a formula
that factored in U.S. economic and employment data and the
recommendations of a government panel. Businesses would have to
pay immigrant workers hired through the program a certain wage,
in some cases much higher than would otherwise be required. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many in the business community regard the proposal as
unworkable and tantamount to not having a guest-worker program.
They say the idea is costly, cumbersome and too slow to meet
their employment needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Will Not Work&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Watching the negotiations unfold, I&#8217;m beginning to
believe that the only guest-worker program that unions are
willing to support is a guest-worker program that will not
work,&#8221; said Tamar Jacoby of ImmigrationWorks USA, a nationwide
federation of state-based business groups advocating for
rewriting immigration laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republicans have instead proposed starting the program with
more visas -- 25,000 or 35,000 -- and basing the decision to
raise or lower the amount more heavily on employers&#8217; needs and
recruiting efforts than on government recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Republicans are going to have to make a decision if
they&#8217;re willing to accept a completely unworkable guest-worker
program as the price of getting comprehensive immigration
reform,&#8221; said Geoff Burr, vice president of federal affairs for
Associated Builders and Contractors. &#8220;They&#8217;re coming
dangerously close to attaching themselves to something they will
regret.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labor unions say U.S. businesses are trying to create a
program that would let them import workers who could be easily
exploited and paid low wages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lower Wages &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What business is trying to do is to rewrite the rules of
future flow to undermine the wages of local workers,&#8221; said Ana
Avendano, director of immigration and community action at the
AFL-CIO. &#8220;It will be difficult, we think, for Senator Rubio to
go back to Florida and explain to his constituents why he held
up a path to citizenship for 11 million people simply because
his donors wanted to pay lower and lower wages.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labor leaders aren&#8217;t working to undermine a deal, Avendano
said. They are &#8220;committed to advancing a bill that guarantees a
path to citizenship for millions of people,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arizona Senator John McCain, a Republican member of the
Senate group, said he doesn&#8217;t anticipate that union-business
tension over the work-visa program will derail the talks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; McCain said in an interview
yesterday. &#8220;I will do everything I can to keep it from going
off the rails.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Not Dictated&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While senators are willing to listen to concerns raised by
business and labor groups, &#8220;we&#8217;re not dictated by them,&#8221;
McCain said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our hope is that we have an agreement that nobody will be
entirely happy with, but they will understand that this is a
product of compromise,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCain said Obama called him before leaving on a trip to
Israel to thank him for his work on the immigration issue and to
offer his support for the effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate group is considering a measure under which it
would take 13 years for undocumented immigrants to gain U.S.
citizenship, according to people close to the discussions. They
would receive probationary legal status during a 10-year wait
for a green card for permanent residency, and would have another
three-year wait before applying for citizenship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Fallon, a spokesman for New York Senator Charles Schumer, a Democratic member of the group, said in an e-mail
yesterday that the group was &#8220;very, very close to a final
agreement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two-Week Break &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCain said he hoped senators could reach agreement on most
of the major issues before all depart for their two-week break. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Obviously there are concerns on our side about the
influence of the unions, and on their side there&#8217;s concerns
about the influence of business,&#8221; McCain said. &#8220;That&#8217;s why
we&#8217;ve got to continue these negotiations, recognizing that
sometimes both sides are not going to be happy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republican opposition to a citizenship plan scuttled a 2007
effort to overhaul immigration policy, as opponents slammed the
bill as &#8220;amnesty&#8221; and flooded Senate telephone lines, e-
mailboxes and fax machines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AFL-CIO opposed that measure because it included a
guest-worker proposal and had the support of many Democratic
senators -- including then-presidential candidate Obama -- for
amendments designed to kill that part of the bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another issue the Senate group is trying to resolve is how
to grant permanent legal status to immigrants who have received
a graduate degree in a science or technology field from a U.S.
university. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;H-1B Visas &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology companies in Silicon Valley have been pushing
for a provision that would almost double the number of visas for
higher-skilled workers, or so-called H-1B visas, to 115,000 from
the current 65,000 cap. Rubio is a co-sponsor of a bill
introduced in January that pairs the cap increase with an
escalator clause based on company demand for such workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is by far the most optimistic we have been that
something meaningful is actually going to happen, and happen
this year,&#8221; Carl Guardino, president of the Silicon Valley
Leadership Group, said yesterday in an interview. The group
represents about 300 companies including software-makers
Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and San Jose,
California-based Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Senate Republicans and
Democrats moving closer to an agreement to grant a chance at
U.S. citizenship to 11 million undocumented immigrants, a long-
simmering dispute between organized labor and the business lobby
risks sapping the measure&#8217;s momentum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two constituencies are at odds over a new program to
provide U.S. work visas to low-skilled foreign workers, placing
pressure on lawmakers poised for a compromise. Unions are
pressing for a limited visa system that guarantees better wages
for future immigrant workers, while businesses seek a broader
program more responsive to their hiring needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s the thornier side of what is otherwise a broadening
consensus in both parties around an immigration plan, whose
centerpiece is a path to U.S. citizenship for undocumented
immigrants. A bipartisan group of eight senators is nearing a
deal to bolster border security and workplace verification while
revamping the legal immigration system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a member of the
group, called the guest-worker issue &#8220;one of the more difficult
parts&#8221; of the negotiations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to be part of a bill that doesn&#8217;t create a
process whereby people can come to this country temporarily in
the future if we need them,&#8221; Rubio said yesterday. &#8220;There&#8217;s no
secret that the broader labor movement, with some exceptions,
would rather not even have an immigration bill.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Political Consequences &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disagreement carries significant political consequences
for Republicans and Democrats alike, essentially making them
choose between their strongest constituencies -- organized labor
for Democrats and big business for Republicans -- and
achievement of an overriding policy goal that both parties
increasingly see as an electoral imperative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hispanics accounted for 10 percent of voters in the 2012
presidential election. President Barack Obama won 71 percent of
their votes, and just 27 percent backed Republican nominee Mitt Romney, who had proposed &#8220;self-deportation&#8221; for undocumented
immigrants. Since then, a growing chorus of Republicans has
publicly backed legal status for undocumented immigrants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a group of Republican officials who unveiled a
top-to-bottom review this week called for the party to back
&#8220;comprehensive immigration reform&#8221; or see its appeal shrink. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is in neither party&#8217;s interest for one group within a
party to stop this, because it is bad for the economy if we
don&#8217;t have immigration reform,&#8221; former Mississippi Governor and
Republican National Committee Chairman Haley Barbour said this
week, referring to labor unions&#8217; objections to a guest-worker
program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Worker Program &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, a Democrat co-
chairing an immigration task force with Barbour at the
Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington, said it is ultimately up
to Obama to persuade Democrats not to abandon the bill if the
immigrant-worker program doesn&#8217;t match the unions&#8217; agenda. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If we don&#8217;t get guest-worker provisions that are exactly
in line with what labor wants, we can&#8217;t hold up the bill because
of that,&#8221; Rendell said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to do the best we can to
preserve and protect the interests of organized labor, but in
the end you can&#8217;t always get what you want.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Obama, he added, has &#8220;his work cut out for him.&#8221; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bipartisan plan, expected to be unveiled next month
following a two-week congressional break, also faces a
potentially rough road in the Senate and uncertain fate in the
House, where Republican opposition to granting citizenship to
undocumented immigrants is more prevalent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closed-Door Negotiations &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At issue, for now, is a proposed new program that would
allow immigrants to work temporarily in the U.S. while allowing
them the option of seeking permanent residency. In closed-door
talks, labor unions and Democratic negotiators are proposing to
allocate 10,000 such visas initially and cap the program at
200,000 visas, according to people close to the negotiations who
requested anonymity to describe them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That number would increase or contract through a formula
that factored in U.S. economic and employment data and the
recommendations of a government panel. Businesses would have to

in some cases much higher than would otherwise be required. &lt;/p&gt;

They say the idea is costly, cumbersome and too slow to meet

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) won
approval from the City of London borough council for a plan to
develop an office building that may become its new European
headquarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217; affiliates Farringdon Street Partners Ltd.
and Farringdon Street (Nominee) Ltd. plan to demolish the
existing properties and develop a new Kohn Pedersen Fox-designed
glass-fronted and curved building on the site. Goldman didn&#8217;t
immediately return phone calls and an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The building at 70 Farringdon Street and Shoe Lane will
have about 111,300 square meters (1.2 million square feet) of
internal office space, according to the application letter. It&#8217;s
about a minute&#8217;s walk from Goldman&#8217;s current headquarters
buildings on Fleet Street and construction work is set to
begin &#8220;almost immediately,&#8221; City of London planning officer
Peter Rees said at today&#8217;s meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a banking factory. Let&#8217;s make no bones about it,&#8221;
Rees told the borough&#8217;s members. &#8220;If there&#8217;s an area where
we&#8217;re going to accommodate groundscrapers this is probably the
best&#8221; place, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, was
given permission in September to move a set of protected murals
from the building, helping to clear the way for the
redevelopment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based investment bank&#8217;s London Property unit
had assets of 73.7 million pounds ($112 million) through
December 2011 and paid 103.4 million pounds for a development
site last year, according to a filing with Companies House in
August. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OAO Rosneft (ROSN)&#8217;s $55 billion takeover
of TNK-BP creates an empire stretching from Russia&#8217;s Far East to
Venezuela that pumps almost 5 percent of the world&#8217;s crude. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Chief Executive Officer Igor Sechin integrates Russia&#8217;s
largest and No. 3 oil companies, he will steer an upgrade of
Soviet-era refineries, a drilling program in uncharted Arctic
waters, the creation of a natural gas business and a global
alliance with Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new company, created yesterday, will be about 70
percent-owned by the Russian state and will employ 218,000
people, more than Exxon and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) combined.
Rosneft sales per employee will be $729,000 this year, compared
with more than $5 million at Shell, representing the scale of
potential cost savings. Sechin plans to find $10 billion of
efficiencies through the TNK-BP deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is the biggest acquisition in history in terms of
production and reserves,&#8221; said Daniel Yergin, author of &#8220;The
Prize,&#8221; a history of the oil industry, who will sit on an
integration committee overseeing the takeover. The companies
&#8220;recognize the scale and complexity, but they also see the
scale of opportunity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ambitious Plans &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying TNK-BP stretched Rosneft&#8217;s finances, racking up $31
billion in loans, and the company is funding part of the deal by
selling oil in advance for as much as $10 billion to Glencore
International Plc (GLEN) and Vitol SA, the world&#8217;s two biggest
independent oil traders. Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and Fitch
Rating Ltd. both put a negative watch on Rosneft&#8217;s credit after
they announced the deal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAC Capital Advisors LP, the
investment company owned by Steven Cohen, more than doubled its
stake in Walter Energy Inc. (WLT) as the company&#8217;s shares traded at
the lowest in more than three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAC reported owning 3.33 million shares, or 5.3 percent, of
Walter Energy, according to a filing today with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. SAC is now the second-
largest shareholder in Birmingham, Alabama-based Walter,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Walter, which mines
coal used in steelmaking, is facing calls from an activist
investor to replace board members. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares have fallen 55 percent in the past year as the
price of metallurgical coal, a steelmaking ingredient, has
tumbled amid stagnating steel production. Walter fell 4.6
percent to $28.10 at the close in New York, the lowest since May
1, 2009. Walter said on on Feb. 20 its average sales price fell
39 percent to $149 a metric ton in the quarter compared with a
year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audley Capital Advisors LLP, an investment advising firm,
has proposed five board members to replace a majority of
Walter&#8217;s independent directors and promote changes in the
company&#8217;s operations and capital structure. Walter shareholders
will vote on directors at the April 25 annual meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for SAC Capital, declined
to comment on the share purchase. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V) climbed to a record high
after Nomura Holdings Inc. said a long-term global shift away
from cash would help the bank-card network at Western Union
Co.&#8217;s expense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa advanced $3.91, or 2.4 percent, to $164 in New York,
the highest since the Foster City, California-based company&#8217;s
March 2008 initial public offering. Western Union, the world&#8217;s
largest money-transfer business, climbed 2 cents to $14.66 and
has dropped 18 percent in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Visa continues to thrive in a world of electronic
payments,&#8221; Bill Carcache and Tulu Yunus, Nomura analysts, said
today in a research note. Threats from Visa and other
established competitors, and new ones such as Xoom Corp. (XOOM), an
online money-transfer firm, will pressure Western Union&#8217;s
revenue as demand erodes for its primary business of helping
people send money from agent locations, they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide purchases with credit and debit cards are
projected to surpass $21.3 trillion in 2016, a 73 percent
increase from 2011, according to the Nilson Report, an industry
newsletter. Visa, the world&#8217;s biggest payments network, posted a
$1.29 billion profit in the fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 31,
a 26 percent increase from a year earlier, as card spending
climbed 8.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Apache Corp. (APA),
and other U.S. companies are looking to acquire offshore blocks
in Peru this year in the country&#8217;s first bidding round since
2010, a government official said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government will also auction Argentine firm Pluspetrol
SA&#8217;s Block 1-AB, Peru&#8217;s largest oilfield, as it&#8217;s due to expire
in 2015, said Luis Ortigas, president of state oil-contracting
agency Perupetro. State oil company Petroperu will take an
approximate 25 percent stake in all blocks, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Companies have shown increasing interest following
offshore discoveries by BPZ and Savia,&#8221; Ortigas told reporters
in Lima. &#8220;We need to increase the number of exploration wells
being drilled to 40 or 50 a year from about six now.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peru, which produced 173,600 barrels of oil and gas liquids
a day through February, has lined up $20 billion in energy
projects through 2018 in a bid to double oil and gas output,
according to the Energy Ministry. Crude oil output has dropped
20 percent over the past decade as oilfields are depleted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Jeffers, an Exxon Mobil spokesman, didn&#8217;t immediately
repond to telephone calls and e-mails seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Apache is always scrutinizing exploration possibilities
worldwide,&#8221; John Roper, an Apache spokesman, wrote in an e-
mailed response to questions. &#8220;We don&#8217;t publicly discuss what
prospects we are considering or their locations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peru plans to put up for bids 36 new oil and gas blocks
after the government completes consultations with indigenous
groups in the highlands and Amazon jungle, Ortigas said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government may extend for another 10 years as many as
seven expiring contracts with companies including Interoil
Exploration and Production ASA and China National Petroleum
Corp. in exchange for higher investment, minimum 20 percent
royalties and taking on Petroperu as a partner, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil for May delivery rose 89 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
$94.60 a barrel at 12:50 p.m. on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
investment bank nicknamed &#8220;Government Sachs&#8221; because of senior
executives who have moved into public posts, won&#8217;t be entering
politics itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A shareholder proposal that the New York-based company run
for office instead of funding political campaigns was discarded,
according to a letter last month from the Securities and
Exchange Commission, which agreed the firm can exclude the
measure from its annual meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrington Investments Inc. President John Harrington
submitted the proposal last year, saying the $6.39 million in
2012 political contributions from the firm&#8217;s employees risks
doing more harm to its reputation. He said the bank should
explore running for office, using a U.S. Supreme Court ruling
that corporations have similar political rights to individuals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It would be less damaging to the integrity of our
political system and our company, for our corporation to
directly run for office as a person under federal or state law,
than to continue in the current form of political
participation,&#8221; Harrington wrote in the proposal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said in a letter to the SEC that it
&#8220;currently has no involvement, never has had any involvement,
and has no plans to become involved in the business of running
for political office.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A) is poised to become one of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s
largest shareholders without paying anything after the companies
agreed on a plan to settle warrants granted at the height of the
2008 financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire had the right to buy 43.5 million Goldman Sachs
common shares for $115 apiece until Oct. 1. Under a deal
announced by the companies today, Buffett&#8217;s firm will get
Goldman Sachs stock equal to the difference between the average
closing price during the 10 trading days before Oct. 1 and the
exercise price, multiplied by 43.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new deal reduces some of the risk for Berkshire, which
would have had to spend about $5 billion to exercise the
warrants and then sell the shares -- about 9 percent of the
bank&#8217;s outstanding stock -- to cement a profit. For Goldman
Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, the plan seals
Berkshire&#8217;s participation as a shareholder in the company and
reduces the dilution for other investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To buy the 43 million and sell them to reap the profit
would have substantial transactional cost,&#8221; said Richard Cook,
co-founder of Cook  Bynum Capital Management LLC in Birmingham,
Alabama, which oversees Berkshire shares. &#8220;Goldman has avoided
the dilution.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EverBank Financial Corp. (EVER) sold
securities tied to $307 million of new U.S. home loans without
government backing, a day after a deal by JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM),
as issuance in the so-called non-agency market accelerates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction by EverBank included $207.6 million of top-
rated securities with 2.5 percent coupons that priced at 100.6
cents on the dollar, said a person familiar with the offering,
who asked not to be identified because they weren&#8217;t authorized.
The bonds are backed mainly by 30-year fixed-rate mortgages,
according to a report today by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-agency issuance so far this year is now tied to almost
$3.2 billion of new loans, compared with $3.5 billion in all of
2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investors have
paid too much in many of the deals, sometimes accepting lower
yields than available on government-backed bonds while buying
notes with more volatile prepayments, said Scott Simon, Pacific
Investment Management Co.&#8217;s mortgage-bond head. Fannie Mae&#8217;s 30-
year, 2.5 percent securities trade at less than 99 cents on the
dollar, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If a meaningful amount were attempted to be originated
this way, the yields would be massively higher,&#8221; said Simon,
whose Newport Beach, California-based firm manages the world&#8217;s
largest bond fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EverBank, which is based in Jacksonville, Florida, offered
&#8220;unambiguous&#8221; contractual protections to investors against
misrepresented loans, according to Moody&#8217;s. The ratings firm
said in a March 22 report that the top grades granted by rivals
to portions of the deal from New York-based JPMorgan weren&#8217;t
appropriate because the covenants could prevent repurchases of
bad loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rising Issuance &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issuance is rising after the size of mortgages that
government-supported Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can finance fell
and their bond-guarantee fees increased as policy makers seek to
scale back their roles, while investors flock to assets with
potentially higher returns as the Federal Reserve suppresses
yields on notes with less default risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) and Redwood Trust Inc. (RWT) had been the
only issuers since the market revived in 2010. Sales peaked at
$1.2 trillion in both 2005 and 2006 before collapsing as prices
tumbled amid soaring foreclosures and plunging real-estate
values, sparking a global financial crisis in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s sale yesterday included $326.3 million of top-
rated securities with 2.5 percent coupons that priced at about
101.7 cents on the dollar, said a person familiar with that
offering who declined to be identified because they weren&#8217;t
authorized to speak about the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those bonds were backed by a mix of fixed- and adjustable-
rate mortgages with varying lengths, according to a report last
week by Fitch Ratings, which gave them AAA ratings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.K. Border Agency will be
split into a visa-issuing body and an immigration-policing
organization after it struggled to deal with arrival lines at
airports and caused long waits for visas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement to Parliament in London today, Home
Secretary Theresa May said both the new bodies will be moved
back into the Home Office, to be under her direct
responsibility, rather than being managed at arm&#8217;s length, as
UKBA was. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What we have been doing is sorting out a chaotic
immigration system,&#8221; May told lawmakers. &#8220;It&#8217;s the approach
that&#8217;s going to deal with the problem that was caused by the
creation of this body by the last government.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visa service will focus on making it easier for people
to visit the U.K., taking quick decisions, May said. UKBA had a
backlog of 312,726 immigration cases in the three-month period
ending in September 2012, according to a report published
yesterday by Parliament&#8217;s Home Affairs Committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keith Vaz, the Labour Party chairman of that committee,
praised May for a decision to put &#8220;the U.K. Backlogs Agency out
of its misery.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) consultant
questioned the impartiality of Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s search results as
European Union regulators are trying to end an antitrust probe
of the operator of the world&#8217;s biggest search engine that is
in its third year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet traffic can be diverted by manipulating the order
of search results, said Susan Athey, a professor of economics at
Stanford University&#8217;s Graduate School of Business and a Microsoft
consultant, in a blog post on Microsoft&#8217;s website. When a site is
moved from the first position to the 10th position in a series
of search results, it typically will lose about 85 percent of its
traffic, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Impartiality of search results will become all the more
important in the years to come, given that screen sizes on
smartphones and tablets are smaller than on traditional PCs,&#8221;
Athey said. &#8220;Smaller screens mean there is even less room for
competing services to appear in Google&#8217;s mobile search.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia has sought a
deal with Google to end the antitrust probe without imposing
fines, while competitors such as Microsoft and TripAdvisor Inc. (TRIP)
have tried to pressure regulators to force Mountain View,
California-based Google to change its business practices. The
U.S. ended an investigation into Google in January, saying there
was no evidence the company&#8217;s actions harmed consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to work cooperatively with the European
Commission,&#8221; Al Verney, a Brussels-based Google spokesman, said
in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU in 2010 began investigating claims Google
discriminated against other services in its search results and
stopped some websites from accepting competitors&#8217; ads after
receiving complaints from Microsoft and others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft and partner Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) have about a
quarter of the U.S. Web-search market, Google has almost 95
percent of the traffic in Europe, Microsoft said in a blog post
in 2011, citing data from regulators. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), still shaken
by the fallout from last year&#8217;s record trading loss, was
upgraded to stable from negative by Standard  Poor&#8217;s as the
credit firm&#8217;s doubts about the &#8220;London Whale&#8221; episode eased. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank &#8220;has successfully addressed our concerns
regarding risk-management missteps in its chief investment
office portfolio,&#8221; SP said in a statement today about
JPMorgan&#8217;s credit outlook. &#8220;Corrective actions should prevent
additional issues from arising.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon and other
top executives misled investors and dodged regulators as losses
escalated on a &#8220;monstrous&#8221; derivatives bet, according to a
301-page report released this month by the Senate Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations. Bruno Iksil, the U.K. trader
behind the bets, was nicknamed the London Whale because his
positions were so huge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. bank &#8220;mischaracterized high-risk trading
as hedging,&#8221; and withheld key information from its primary
regulator, sometimes at Dimon&#8217;s behest, investigators found.
Managers manipulated risk models and pressured traders to
overvalue positions to hide growing losses, the panel said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate probe could help regulators make a case that
JPMorgan executives broke the law, drawing on the report, more
than 90,000 e-mails and documents, 200 transcribed telephone
calls and 25 interviews with bank officials. The report may also
ratchet up pressure on Dimon, 57, to surrender his role as
chairman of the New York-based company to improve governance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ericsson AB (ERICB) is in talks to buy
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s IPTV business, which makes software used by
phone companies such as ATT Inc. (T) to deliver television over the
Internet, people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal could be announced in a few weeks, said one of the
people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions
are private. Annual sales at Microsoft&#8217;s IPTV business, called
MediaRoom, have stayed near $350 million for the past three
years, according to Raymond James  Associates, and the unit
could fetch more than $1 billion, Cross Research says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ericsson, the largest maker of wireless networks, is
seeking to cater to carriers that are competing with cable,
satellite and Web-based providers. The move will also help
Ericsson step up its emphasis on software and services amid
accelerating competition in hardware. Microsoft, the biggest
software maker, intends to focus on delivering TV through its
Xbox game console, a person familiar with its plans said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This would make sense for Ericsson as it provides for a
more complete offering,&#8221; said Alexander Peterc, an analyst at
Exane BNP Paribas. &#8220;Still, the technology started to get hyped
about 10 years ago and may have reached its peak already, so I
don&#8217;t see this as a growth market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In trying to get sophisticated
medicines to its neediest citizens, India is increasingly
pitting its generic-pharmaceutical industry against
international drugmakers, threatening their growth in emerging
markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Indian regulatory board this month upheld a ruling that
allows Natco Pharma Ltd. (NTCPH) to make a low-priced copy of Bayer AG (BAYN)&#8217;s
Nexavar cancer treatment. The drug is one of at least four that
have had their patents weakened, revoked or rejected in India in
the past year. The country also has refused a patent for
Novartis AG&#8217;s (NOVN) Gleevec leukemia medicine, and the Supreme Court
will rule April 1 on the company&#8217;s appeal of the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those steps are needed to put modern medicines into the
hands of Indians, according to aid groups and doctors. Western
drugmakers including New York-based Pfizer Inc. (PFE) say the country,
which has a $30 billion drug market that&#8217;s growing 13 percent a
year, is abusing international law and allowing domestic
companies to profit from products discovered at Big Pharma&#8217;s
expense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute illustrates how emerging markets are turning
out be less lucrative than drugmakers expected. London-based
GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) has warned that so-called compulsory
licensing of patented products may hurt profit growth. One
advocacy group now is pushing stricken Western countries such as
Greece to follow India&#8217;s lead, raising the prospect of further
pressure on drug prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WTO Standards &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Emerging markets are extremely important for drugmakers
because they can&#8217;t grow in Europe, plain and simple,&#8221; Michael Leuchten, an analyst at Barclays Plc in London, said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;The effect isn&#8217;t quantifiable, but it is
a stumbling block and companies will suffer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India in 1995 agreed to meet intellectual-property
standards set out by the World Trade Organization. The country
says those standards allow it to invalidate patents and issue
compulsory licenses to local generics companies to ensure its
citizens have access to medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian officials also may be motivated by boosting the
domestic drug industry, said Wim Leereveld, who heads the Access
to Medicines Foundation, a non-profit group that ranks drug
companies on how well they make products available to poor and
middle-income countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is not only about access to medicines; they are also
protecting their own businesses,&#8221; said Leereveld, whose group
doesn&#8217;t take funding from drug companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Iressa Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An e-mail requesting comment sent to 12 officials at
India&#8217;s Department of Pharmaceuticals wasn&#8217;t answered. Three
phone calls to the office of the department secretary, Dilsher
Singh Kalha, weren&#8217;t answered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generic-drug companies Natco and GM Pharma Ltd. won their
2006 effort to contest AstraZeneca Plc&#8217;s patent protection in
India for its lung-cancer drug Iressa, a decision upheld in
November 2012 by the country&#8217;s Intellectual Property Appellate
Board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same month, the board also revoked protection for Roche
Holding AG&#8217;s (ROG) Pegasys, a drug to treat hepatitis C, on an appeal
by the Sankalp Rehabilitation Trust, a charity that helps
injecting drug abusers, and the generics maker Wockhardt Ltd. (WPL)
Pfizer&#8217;s Sutent cancer drug, which it had been selling in India
since 2007, was stripped of protection last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;From the perspective of companies, I can&#8217;t think of
anything more incredible than to have the government expropriate
your intellectual property and have domestic companies exploit
it,&#8221; said Chris Israel, the U.S. coordinator for international
intellectual property enforcement under President George W. Bush
who now works for the American Continental Group Inc. lobbying
firm in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;India&#8217;s Right &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither the U.S. nor the European Union have sought help
from the WTO to stop compulsory licenses. The EU recognizes
India&#8217;s right to issue compulsory licenses, Helene Banner, a
spokeswoman for EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht, said in an
e-mailed statement. American Continental&#8217;s Israel said such
licenses are intended for use in health emergencies such as
pandemics, not because prices are too high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors welcome India&#8217;s efforts to make drugs more
affordable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Indian drug is so important for 90 percent of my
patients, because otherwise they&#8217;ll get nothing,&#8221; said Bhawna
Sirohi, an oncologist at Mumbai&#8217;s 900-bed Tata Memorial Centre,
which mainly treats poor patients. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s fantastic.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pharmaceutical company executives say patent-sharing bodies
known as patent pools and voluntary licenses can make drugs
available to the poor. Patents won&#8217;t stop medicines from
reaching those who need them, Paul Herrling, who heads
Novartis&#8217;s Institute for Tropical Diseases in Singapore, said in
an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Markets &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have a very clear policy not to make the patent a
barrier,&#8221; Herrling said. The patent situation has led Novartis
to re-allocate investments to other emerging markets such as
China, Herrling said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, without compulsory licensing, many Indians may not
have access to some medicines. About a third of the population
lives in poverty, and the income per capita is $1,410 a year,
according to the World Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even if a month of therapy costs $12, one or two
concurrent illnesses are too expensive for a family like that,&#8221;
said Michael Kleinrock, director of research development at the
IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics, said in a telephone
interview. The institute is a unit of IMS Health, which tracks
pharmaceutical sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roy Waldron, Pfizer&#8217;s chief intellectual property counsel,
called on the U.S. government this month to work harder to
protect patents in India. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Fair Game&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe that Indian generic companies now see any
innovative product as fair game for compulsory license,&#8221;
Waldron said in testimony March 13 to the House Ways and Means
Committee&#8217;s subcommittee on trade. Pfizer didn&#8217;t respond to a
request for further comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides issuing compulsory licenses, India has refused to
grant patents in some cases. At the request of a cancer aid
society and several generics makers, the government in 2006
denied a patent for Novartis&#8217;s Gleevec, a drug that is credited
with turning a deadly blood cancer into a chronic disease,
saying it wasn&#8217;t sufficiently innovative. The Basel,
Switzerland-based company appealed, and the case wound up at the
Supreme Court, with a decision to be published April 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Thumping&#8217; Profit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are concerned about the current situation in India
with respect to the recent decisions by the government that
concern not only compulsory licensing, but also the patent
status for certain products of some of our competitors,&#8221; Eli
Lilly  Co. (LLY) Chief Executive Officer John Lechleiter told
reporters at a March 26 briefing in Beijing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is something we&#8217;ll continue to try to address with
individual governments&#8221; and through multinational
organizations, said Lechleiter, who&#8217;s chairman of Pharmaceutical
Research and Manufacturers of America, a U.S. lobbying group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case involving Bayer&#8217;s Nexavar, the Indian appellate
board said that while Bayer had made &#8220;thumping&#8221; profits on the
drug internationally, it failed to make the treatment affordable
to at least 80 percent of Indian patients with liver or kidney
cancer. The compulsory license allows Natco to sell a copy for
as much as 8,880 rupees ($163) a month, 3 percent of the
original price of more than $5,000. Bayer receives a small
royalty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Roche&#8217;s Rebranding &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roche last year said it would rebrand and cut the price of
two patented cancer drugs in India, MabThera and Herceptin.
Still, India&#8217;s Department of Pharmaceuticals in January started
the process of issuing compulsory licenses for three cancer
treatments including Herceptin, according to the newspaper
Indian Express. A Roche spokesman declined to comment on the
reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s efforts may embolden other countries. China last
year overhauled parts of its intellectual property law to allow
domestic companies to make low-cost versions of medicines under
patent protection. In September, the Indonesian government
expanded access to HIV drugs and a hepatitis B treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drug companies are looking to India and other emerging
markets for growth because prices are under pressure in Europe.
Emerging markets are set to make up 38 percent of revenue by
2020, according to Barclays&#8217; Leuchten. IMS forecasts drug sales
on the Indian subcontinent will grow 13 percent a year through
2016. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Greece, Spain &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A non-profit group called Essential Inventions Inc. this
month asked the Greek government to use compulsory licenses to
supply cancer and HIV drugs to its citizens, David Hammerstein,
a member of the group&#8217;s board, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Hundreds of people in Greece are dying because they are
not getting the medicines, tens of thousands can&#8217;t afford the
medicines,&#8221; he said. Hammerstein said his group is also
thinking of asking the Spanish government to import generics
under a compulsory license. He expects a response from Greek
officials in a couple of weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a danger it will pick up steam,&#8221; said IMS&#8217;s
Kleinrock. &#8220;Companies have to take it seriously.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EON SE (EOAN), Germany&#8217;s largest utility,
sold a stake in a 200-megawatt wind farm in Indiana to an
investor group that includes JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Wells
Fargo  Co. (WFC) for $174.9 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wildcat I project is EON&#8217;s first wind farm in Indiana
and was completed in December, EON&#8217;s Chicago-based North America
unit said today in a statement. The tax-equity financing give

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s sales growth to
Ukrainian companies this year will slow along with the economy,
said Dmitry Shymkiv, the U.S. company&#8217;s Ukrainian general
manager,. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sales in the corporate sector increased by more than 30
percent in 2012,&#8221; Shymkiv said in an interview in his Kiev
office. &#8220;It is going to be slower this year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft expects sales of hosting services for businesses
to increase by more than 50 percent this year, according to
Shymkiv. There are around 2,000 corporate clients in Ukraine who
are actively using cloud-computing service, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ukraine&#8217;s economy slipped into recession last year as
demand for chemistry and steel fell on global markets. Goldman
Sacks Group Inc. (GS) expects the economy to contract 1.8 percent
this year. Gross domestic product slipped 0.5 percent in
January, according to the central bank, while Prime Minister
Mykola Azarov wants 2013 growth of between 3 and 4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales potential for the Redmond, Washington-based company
is highest in the public sector, where more than 74 percent of
software used is unlicensed, Shymkiv said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For Microsoft, Ukraine remains a country of high
potential for growth,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piracy remains a problem in Ukraine and has not been
properly addressed, he said. Between 2 percent and 5 percent of
unlicensed software is used in the telecommunications industry,
while copyright compliance in the banking industry is between 65
percent and 70 percent and overall corporate compliance is
between 60 percent and 70 percent, he estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows phone sales in Ukraine is also a &#8220;very dynamic&#8221;
market, with sales of Windows phone and Windows 8 software
expected to be boosted by a higher supply of touch-screen
devices on the market, Shymkiv said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monsanto Co. and DuPont Co. (DD), the
world&#8217;s largest seed companies, agreed to drop their respective
antitrust and soybean patent lawsuits and enter into licensing
agreements for making genetically modified crops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monsanto will ask the St. Louis federal court to dismiss
its claim that DuPont infringed patents for Roundup Ready
soybeans, setting aside a $1 billion jury award, the companies
said yesterday in a joint statement. DuPont will ask the court
to dismiss its claim that Monsanto uses monopoly power to stifle
innovation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement follows recent legal victories by St. Louis-
based Monsanto over its smaller rival in the $34 billion seed
market. A U.S. jury in August ordered DuPont to pay Monsanto for
infringing seed patents, and the U.S. Justice Department and
state attorneys general dropped probes late last year into
industry antitrust concerns raised by DuPont. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have spent a lot of time and a lot of energy fighting
each other,&#8221; Scott Partridge, a Monsanto vice president, said
in a telephone interview yesterday. &#8220;There came a point after a
bunch of confrontations where their interests and our interests
aligned.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the agreements announced yesterday, DuPont&#8217;s Pioneer
seed unit will license the newest versions of Monsanto soybeans
engineered to tolerate Roundup and another weed killer and make
a series of royalty payments to Monsanto totaling $1.75 billion
through 2023, the companies said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monsanto gains access to DuPont patents for crop-disease
resistance and a corn-defoliation technique. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royalty payments to Monsanto will be $346 million from 2014
to 2015, $456 million in the next two years, and per-unit
payments starting in 2018 that will total at least $950 million,
DuPont said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Monsanto Co. (MON) v. E.I. duPont de Nemours  Co.,
09-cv-686, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Missouri
(St. Louis) and Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc. v. Monsanto
Co., 11-cv-497, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Iowa
(Des Moines). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overland Loses Ruling in Library Patent Case Against BDT &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overland Storage Inc. (OVRL), a maker of data-protection systems,
lost a patent-infringement ruling against BDT-Solutions GmbH
over storage systems that archive a company&#8217;s electronic
records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BDT didn&#8217;t violate Overland&#8217;s patent rights, U.S.
International Trade Commission Judge Charles Bullock said in a
notice posted on the Washington agency&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case targets closely held BDT&#8217;s FlexStor II product
line of automated tape libraries, which it makes overseas and
then lets companies sell in the U.S. under their own brand
names. Automated libraries backup or archive data on tape drives
in a central location and then retrieve that data from networked
computers, often using robotic arms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Overland patents, covering technology it uses for its
NEO systems for small- and medium-sized companies, are for the
apparatus and methods of storing or retrieving the data. The Neo
series accounted for about 31 percent of the company&#8217;s $59.6
million in revenue in fiscal 2012, the company said in its
annual report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullock in June said neither of the two patents had been
infringed, and one aspect of one of the patents was invalid. The
six-member commission in January ordered the judge to review
those findings, particularly as it pertained to the validity
issue of patent 6,328,766, and infringement of patent 6,353,581,
which relates to a mail slot in the devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Diego-based Overland named International Business
Machines Corp. and Dell Inc. (DELL) in the original complaint; it later
settled with those companies. Overland also has filed patent-
infringement lawsuits against other competitors, including
Quantum Corp. (QTM) and Qualstar Corp. (QBAK) Those cases are pending in
federal court in San Diego. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In the Matter of Automated Media Library
Devices, 337-746, U.S. International Trade Commission
(Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BitTorrent Founder Seeks U.S. Patent on Live Video Streaming &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new application published in the database of the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office covers a technology enabling live
video streaming anyone can perform without elaborate equipment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Application 20130066969, published in the database March
14, lists Bram Cohen of Mill Valley, California, as the
inventor. He is best known as the author of the BitTorrent
protocol that is used for peer-to-peer file sharing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the application, the technology will divide
content into multiple data blocks that are transmitted to what
the inventor says are &#8220;clubs.&#8221; Each person involved in the
transaction will belong to at least two of these clubs. When the
content comes to one person, that person will distribute the
data block to others in the club, and also to people in others&#8217;
clubs. That person will also receive data blocks assigned to
other clubs from members of those clubs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protocol covered by this application is now being made
available on the BitTorrent website, where it&#8217;s called
BitTorrent Live. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Royal Caribbean&#8217;s Passenger-ID System Accused of Infringement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL), the Miami-based cruise line,
was sued by a Michigan company for infringing a patent that
covers a method for verifying the identity of a passenger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cruise line infringed patent 7,239,723, according to
the complaint filed March 25 in federal court in Miami. The
patent is allegedly infringed by a system that the cruise line
uses to identify its passengers, both upon initial boarding and
on subsequent entries to the ship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travel Photo LLC of Troy, Michigan, claims it is injured by
the cruise line&#8217;s actions and seeks awards of money damages,
litigation costs and attorney fees. It also asked the court to
order Royal Caribbean to halt activities that Travel Photo
claims infringe the patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Travel Photo LLC v. Royal Caribbean Cruises
Ltd., 13-cv-21053, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
Florida (Miami). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Microsoft Sends EU Report Questioning Google Search Presentation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) consultant questioned the impartiality of
Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s search results as European Union regulators try to
end an antitrust probe of the operator of the world&#8217;s biggest
search engine that is in its third year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet traffic can be diverted by manipulating the order
of search results, said Susan Athey, a professor of economics at
Stanford University&#8217;s Graduate School of Business and a
Microsoft consultant, in a blog post on Microsoft&#8217;s website.
When a site is moved from the first position to the 10th
position in a series of search results, it typically will lose
about 85 percent of its traffic, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Impartiality of search results will become all the more
important in the years to come, given that screen sizes on
smartphones and tablets are smaller than on traditional PCs,&#8221;
Athey said. &#8220;Smaller screens mean there is even less room for
competing services to appear in Google&#8217;s mobile search.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia has sought a
deal with Google to end the antitrust probe without imposing
fines, while competitors such as Microsoft and TripAdvisor Inc. (TRIP)
have tried to pressure regulators to force Mountain View,
California-based Google to change its business practices. The
U.S. ended an investigation into Google in January, saying there
was no evidence the company&#8217;s actions harmed consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to work cooperatively with the European
Commission,&#8221; Al Verney, a Brussels-based Google spokesman, said
in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU in 2010 began investigating claims Google
discriminated against other services in its search results and
stopped some websites from accepting competitors&#8217; ads after
receiving complaints from Microsoft and others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft and partner Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) have about a
quarter of the U.S. Web-search market, Google has almost 95
percent of the traffic in Europe, Microsoft said in a blog post
in 2011, citing data from regulators. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Three Californians Indicted for Selling Counterfeit CDs, DVDs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three California residents were indicted by a federal grand
jury for criminal copyright infringement, according to a
statement from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charges are related to the sale of counterfeit DVDs and
CDs containing unauthorized copies of music and films. There is
also one count of trafficking in goods bearing counterfeit
trademarks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The counterfeit goods were sold in rural Glenn and Yuba
counties, according to the government statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If convicted on all counts, the alleged sellers of
counterfeit goods face fines of as much as $2.25 million and
maximum prison terms of 15 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indictment followed an investigation by the FBI and the
Sacramento High Tech Crimes Task Force. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the case docket, presently only one of the
three defendants is represented by counsel. Otto Godinez-Sales,
21, of San Jose, is represented by Timothy Zindel from the
Office of the Federal Defender in Sacramento. He didn&#8217;t respond
immediately to an e-mail seeking comment on the indictment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Godinez-Sales, 13-cr-00088, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of California (Sacramento). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;IP Talk &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Creation of IP Negotiator Post Suggested in Hatch&#8217;s Senate Bill &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican, introduced a
bill that would create a new ambassador-rank position in the
Office of the U.S. Trade Representative that would have IP-
related responsibilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the Innovation Through Trade Act, S. 660, there would
be a &#8220;Chief Innovation and Intellectual Property Negotiator&#8221;
within the USTR office. This position would be a presidential
appointment subject to confirmation by the U.S. Senate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IP negotiator would conduct trade negotiations and
enforce trade agreements related to U.S. intellectual property
and would &#8220;take appropriate actions to address acts, policies
and practices of foreign governments&#8221; negatively affecting U.S.
innovation, according to a statement from the Senate Finance
Committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill also provides for a new statutory report to be
made to both the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and
Means Committee on actions taken by the USTR to advance U.S.
innovation and IP rights, and enforcement action taken to
protect those rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IP and innovation are &#8220;all too often relegated to second-
tier status in our trade policy,&#8221; Hatch said in the statement.
Negotiating strong IP agreements and enforcing them is a
&#8220;necessity, not an option,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank, shouldn&#8217;t re-nominate three risk committee members
after disclosing more than $6.2 billion in losses on derivatives
trades last year, CtW Investment Group said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CtW will oppose the re-election of David Cote, Ellen Futter
and committee Chairman James Crown because they &#8220;lack
professional experience relevant to overseeing risk management
at a large financial institution that undertakes significant
trading activity,&#8221; the investment firm said today in a letter
to New York-based JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called London Whale trades were the subject of a
report this month by the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations, which found that Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 57, misled investors and dodged regulators as the losses
mounted. The bank &#8220;piled on risk&#8221; and &#8220;ignored limits on
risk-taking,&#8221; said committee Chairman Carl Levin, a Michigan
Democrat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Both regulators and JPMorgan Chase senior executives
recognize that serious deficiencies in risk-management practices
and internal controls have existed for some time and require
prompt corrective action,&#8221; CtW wrote in the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cote, 60, is chairman and CEO of Honeywell International
Inc. (HON), and Crown, 59, is president of Chicago-based Henry Crown 
Co. and lead director of defense contractor General Dynamics
Corp. (GD) Futter, 63, a former president of Barnard College in New
York, joined JPMorgan&#8217;s board in 1997. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment
on the letter. Rob Ferris, a spokesman for Cote at Honeywell,
didn&#8217;t immediately comment. Futter and Crown didn&#8217;t immediately
return messages seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, JPMorgan assigned former KPMG International
Chairman Timothy Flynn to its risk committee after an internal
probe blamed lax controls for the trading loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported on CtW&#8217;s letter earlier
today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial public offerings raised almost $20 billion globally in the first quarter, as companies from Pfizer Inc. (PFE) to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. took advantage of a rally in stock markets to sell businesses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IPOs generated 18 percent more than in the year-ago period, led by Pfizer&#8217;s $2.6 billion sale of its animal-health unit Zoetis Inc. (ZTS) and Goldman Sachs&#8217;s offering of shares in German apartment landlord LEG Immobilien AG, according to data compiled by Bloomberg as of March 27. Initial offerings declined to about half the level of the fourth quarter, when companies raised about $37 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re in a world where investors believe in repair and global recovery,&#8221; said Evan Damast, global head of equity syndicate at Morgan Stanley in New York. &#8220;While there are still a handful of skeptics proceeding with caution, the global investor base is very receptive to growth stories.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed to a record this month and the MSCI World Index rose to its highest in almost five years. Sustained gains may help ease the biggest global backlog of IPOs since at least 2007, encouraging companies including Bausch  Lomb Holdings Inc. and China&#8217;s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to pursue offerings as soon as this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cristina Martinez Mortola has a lot
riding on her application for a temporary skilled-worker visa.
So does her boss, SendHub co-founder Garrett Johnson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martinez Mortola is competing for one of 85,000 H-1B visas
that make up the U.S. government limit for this year, and demand
is so high that 65,000 of those may be awarded through a
lottery. Random selection means more risk for the technology
companies that dominate these visas, and also may leave them
waiting for months to find out if their employees are chosen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Every company lives and dies by the talent it has access
to,&#8221; Johnson said. And Martinez Mortola, who manages customer
support for his web-and-mobile-communication startup&#8217;s 100,000
clients, is &#8221;invaluable,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martinez Mortola, 28, a Panamanian with a master&#8217;s degree
in engineering management from the University of Southern
California in Los Angeles, has worked at the Menlo Park,
California-based company since August. Her current visa expires
in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While she can apply for an extension of her visa if
SendHub&#8217;s petition for an H-1B is denied, she says if both fail
she&#8217;ll have to leave her husband and job in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government and company officials say the cap on the H-1B
visas could be reached within five days after the application
period opens April 1. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A transaction involving Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer of Facebook Inc. (FB), and
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s advertising business won approval from U.S.
antitrust authorities &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook said on Feb. 28 it would acquire Atlas Advertiser
Suite, adding measurement tools that help it step up competition
with Google Inc. for online-display advertisements. All
transactions of more than $70.9 million by law must be reported
to antitrust regulators for review. The U.S. Federal Trade
Commission today announced the deal was approved without
identifying the nature of the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook, owner of the world&#8217;s largest social-networking
service, is seeking to accelerate revenue, which is projected by
analysts to slow for a fourth straight year in 2013. Atlas will
help in challenging Google, which gained ad-serving technology
in its $3.24 billion purchase of DoubleClick in 2008. Google (GOOG)
will have 18 percent of the U.S. display-ad market in 2013,
compared with Facebook&#8217;s 15 percent, according to EMarketer Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team from Atlas will remain in Seattle, where the
business is based, Menlo Park, California-based Facebook said
when it announced the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atlas tools help companies choose and place ads on websites
and monitor their effectiveness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ad Campaign &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Atlas, Facebook will be able to gauge how an ad
campaign is performing on its own service and on other sites
around the Web, Brian Boland, director of monetization product
marketing, said in an interview at the time. Using that data,
the company can help advertisers craft better marketing
campaigns, including on its own service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal is part of Microsoft&#8217;s effort to unwind the
unsuccessful $6.3 billion 2007 purchase of AQuantive Inc., which
developed Atlas. Microsoft wrote down almost the entire value of
the deal last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has focused more attention on building search-
based advertising, at the expense of the graphical-display ad
business that includes Atlas and the AQuantive assets. Still,
Microsoft wants to ensure that Mountain View, California-based
Google has competition. That made Facebook, a Google rival and
Microsoft partner, an attractive choice for a buyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the deal, Microsoft will remain a user of Atlas,
said Dave O&#8217;Hara, chief financial officer for the Redmond,
Washington-based company&#8217;s online services division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We thought they had a good vision of where they want to
go,&#8221; O&#8217;Hara said. &#8220;We&#8217;re still a very large presence in the
online advertising business and will be for many, many years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Freeland, previously a copper
trader at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., is joining Noble Group Ltd. (NOBL),
Asia&#8217;s biggest commodity trader by sales, according to two
people with direct knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freeland will be a copper trader based in London and will
join in April, said the people, who asked not to be identified
because the information hasn&#8217;t been made public. He will be
responsible for building up the company&#8217;s physical copper
business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Freeland worked
for Trafigura Beheer BV before joining Goldman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls to Stephen Brown, Noble&#8217;s director of corporate
affairs, and his two deputies weren&#8217;t answered, and he didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment. The company&#8217;s
office in Hong Kong was closed for a public holiday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noble&#8217;s physical and derivatives metals trading are managed
by Mark Hansen, who joined in June. The company hired Paul
Wilkes, formerly the head of industrial metals at Macquarie
Group Ltd., last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s Pegasus crude
oil pipeline, which was shut on March 29 after a leak was
detected in Arkansas, will need to be excavated as the company
looks to determine what caused the breach, a spokeswoman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I can&#8217;t speculate on when excavation will happen,&#8221;
Kimberly Brasington, a spokeswoman for the company, said in an
e-mail. &#8220;Excavation is necessary as part of an investigation to
determine the cause of the incident.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 20-inch pipeline, which originates in Patoka, Illinois,
and carries crude oil to the Texas Gulf Coast, was carrying
Wabasca Heavy Crude from Western Canada, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 12,000 barrels of oil and water have been collected
so far near Mayflower, Arkansas, after &#8220;a few thousand barrels
were observed in the area,&#8221; the Mayflower Incident Unified
Command Joint Information Center, which includes Exxon, Faulkner
County and the city of Mayflower, said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency classifies any
spill of more than 250 barrels as a &#8220;major spill,&#8221; the command
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Crews are steam-cleaning oil from property,&#8221; according
to the joint statement. No oil has reached Lake Conway, and
clean-up crews have deployed 3,600 feet of boom as a precaution,
the command said. &lt;/p&gt;
