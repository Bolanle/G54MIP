&lt;p&gt; Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s decision to close a
U.K. research office will damage the country&#8217;s standing in
research, the Sunday Times reported, citing an interview with
Simon Campbell, a retired scientist who helped Pfizer develop
the impotence drug Viagra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists employed at the office in Sandwich, England,
will struggle to find new jobs, Campbell said, according to
Times. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Chevron Corp., the second-largest
U.S. oil company, will pay holders of Atlas Energy Inc. an
additional 10 cents a share to settle litigation when its $3.59
billion purchase of the natural-gas producer is completed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement follows Atlas shareholder lawsuits that
alleged company directors breached fiduciary duties by agreeing
to an inadequate merger price and using an unfair process,
according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission today. The defendants denied any violations of their
duties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Reliance Industries Ltd., which has a joint venture with
Atlas, has said it should&#8217;ve been given a chance to top
Chevron&#8217;s Nov. 9 offer. The company, based in Mumbai, sent a
Jan. 10 letter to the board calling itself the &#8220;most natural
and obvious&#8221; partner to buy Atlas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The additional 10 cents a share &#8220;doesn&#8217;t really move the
needle too much,&#8221; said Fadel Gheit, an analyst at Oppenheimer 
Co. in New York who has a &#8220;market perform&#8221; on Chevron and owns
shares of the company. &#8220;There will be no white knight. It&#8217;s a
done deal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s cash-and-stock bid valued the company at $43.34 a
share, a 37 percent premium to the closing price a day before it
was announced. The additional 10 cents would add about $7.8
million to the overall deal value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain shareholders are excluded from the 10 cents,
including Vice Chairman Jonathan Cohen and Chief Executive
Officer Edward Cohen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atlas rose 4 cents to $45.86 at 4 p.m. on the Nasdaq Stock
Market. Chevron rose 55 cents to $97.66 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Events in Egypt have journalists
around the world asking: Hmmm, could that happen here? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Tokyo, the answer is no. The student riots of 1968
remind us never to say never. The thought of today&#8217;s youths
congregating at Shibuya Crossing, tossing Molotov cocktails and
demanding the ouster of Prime Minister Naoto Kan, though, is a
colossal reach. Mass protests in Japan are a rare, rare thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet there are fresh signs that the nation&#8217;s 126 million
people are hankering for change. Even if Japanese aren&#8217;t about
to join Tunisians and Egyptians on revolutionary road, a brewing
backlash against these three long-tolerated elements of society
offers a whiff of hope: The yakuza, politics and sumo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the surface, Japan is undergoing an historic identity
crisis as living standards slide and the privileged class acts
as if it&#8217;s business as usual. It&#8217;s driving a desire for change
and greater accountability that could alter Japan&#8217;s trajectory.
It could mean more growth and less deflation and debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strong sense of entitlement has long prevailed at the
upper levels of Japanese society. Politicians thought they were
above the law and answered to no one. Gangsters operated in
plain view, handing out business cards and branching out into
legitimate businesses like banking. The fabled national sport of
sumo swatted away allegations of match-fixing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was all fine when Japan was rising, markets were
lively and the future was bright. Tolerance is dwindling with
monthly consumer-price-index readings. Japanese are becoming
less accepting of the lavish lives of the powerful, the famous
and the crooked now that times are tough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yakuza Crackdown &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One sign patience is evaporating is the crackdown on the
yakuza, Japan&#8217;s organized crime families. As police clamped down
on sex, drugs and gambling, the yakuza diversified into real
estate, construction and stocks. It&#8217;s the latter focus that 
prompted Jake Adelstein, author of &#8220;Tokyo Vice,&#8221; to dub the 
yakuza &#8220;Goldman Sachs with guns.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s estimated 80,000 gangsters were turned away from
the big construction daddy of them all: the 2,080-foot (634-
meters) Tokyo Sky Tree tower project. The escalating war on the
mob reflects public discontent with the underbelly of Japan Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As to the timing of this push, some motivation is set
within the continually declining economy,&#8221; says Brett Bull, who
runs the Tokyo Reporter website covering Japanese subculture.
&#8220;Dealing with gangsters adds costs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second sign that the winds of change are blowing
involves Ichiro Ozawa. No single politician is responsible for
the widening gap between rich and poor and Japan&#8217;s declining
global stature. Yet for many people, Ozawa will do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Shadow Shogun&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 68-year-old former head of the ruling Democratic Party
of Japan is known as the &#8220;Shadow Shogun&#8221; for his wheeler-
dealer back-room ways. His indictment last month for allegedly
violating campaign finance laws cast a pall over Japan&#8217;s ability
to pass a record budget and allay concerns over soaring debt. If
ever there were a sign times are changing, Standard  Poor&#8217;s
cutting Japan&#8217;s credit rating to the same level as China is it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ozawa, a powerbroker within his party, personifies the
resistance to change that put the nation on a downward
trajectory. He has hung on year after year, refusing to resign
from parliament. The indictment reflects growing disillusionment
with Japan&#8217;s sclerotic politics and its &#8220;silver democracy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s leadership is aging with the population. It
controls the budget and coddles its key constituency: the
elderly. No wonder twenty-something Japanese lack optimism. Far
from working at the real Goldman Sachs Group Inc., many are low-
wage &#8220;freeters&#8221; going from temporary job to temporary job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old Japan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kan created a panel to propose ways to manage the world&#8217;s
latest public debt. Its two most vocal members are economic
bigwigs Hakuo Yanagisawa, 75, and Kaoru Yosano, 72, who want to
double the consumption tax. In other words, two men well above
Japan&#8217;s average retirement age want young consumers to pay more
to support the over-65 set. Hardly a shock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, it&#8217;s always struck me as odd that the two most
outspoken critics of Japan Inc.&#8217;s geriatric ways, Takafumi Horie
and Yoshiaki Murakami, ended up in jail while Ozawa roamed free.
Internet entrepreneur Horie was in his early 30s when he was
locked up for alleged insider trading; shareholder activist
Murakami was in his mid-40s. It&#8217;s an amazing coincidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third change indicator is sumo. Turns out, it is indeed
fixed. Police found mobile-phone messages showing wrestlers were
fixing matches, just as many people -- including Adelstein and
the authors of 2005&#8217;s &#8220;Freakonomics&#8221; -- long suspected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrestling With Sumo &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sumo fascinates me because it&#8217;s a microcosm of the economy.
It&#8217;s completely male dominated and has a broken model, an uneasy
acceptance of foreigners, a rapidly aging fan base and limited
interest in tweaking its franchise for overseas consumption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#8217;s interesting, though, is that this story isn&#8217;t being
swept under the tatami mat. It&#8217;s getting wide and breathless
play, driven by edgier media outlets catering to segments of the
population that are fed up with the status quo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Predicting new dawns in Japan is a fool&#8217;s game. Yet the
typically docile masses are getting antsy and speaking out.
We&#8217;re not talking revolution here, yet for this change-resistant
nation, these are heartening signs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. advised
investors to buy European stocks on any &#8220;weakness,&#8221; saying the
economic cycle and earnings continue to support shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Many are arguing for a correction given that the market
appears overbought and the sentiment is seen as overly
bullish,&#8221; Mislav Matejka, head of European equity strategy,
wrote in a note today. &#8220;We believe risk-reward for stocks
remains compelling.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurers, miners, technology companies, energy producers
and carmakers are JPMorgan&#8217;s &#8220;top picks.&#8221; The firm is
&#8220;cautious&#8221; on defensive shares including utilities,
drugmakers, food producers and telecommunications operators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stoxx 600 Europe Index has surged 24 percent since its
12-month low in May 2010 on optimism that the U.S. economy is
improving and as European governments bailed out Greece and
Ireland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European stocks continue to be valued at less than the
historic average multiple of their earnings for the next 12
months. Central banks will keep interest rates at record lows,
JPMorgan wrote, and investors will allocate more of their assets
to equities, supporting share prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Equities appear attractively valued versus other asset
classes, are underowned and have posted resilient performance
over the past two years, which usually leads to inflows
starting,&#8221; Matejka wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pfizer Inc. must pay more than
$10 million in damages to an Arkansas woman who blamed her
cancer on the company&#8217;s Prempro menopause drug, after an appeals
court reinstated a jury verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Pennsylvania appeals court yesterday overturned a judge&#8217;s
ruling that Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth unit deserved a new trial in
connection with Mary Daniel&#8217;s claim that Prempro caused her
breast cancer. A Philadelphia jury in 2007 awarded Daniel and
her family $1.5 million in compensatory damages and $8.6 million
in punitives on her claim, according to Esther Berezofsky, one
of the family&#8217;s lawyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appellate judges concluded no &#8220;fraud on the court took
place here and a new trial should not have been granted,&#8221;
according to the 55-page decision from the Superior Court of Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials of New York-based Pfizer said they were
disappointed with the decision and considering their legal
options. Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, completed its
$68 billion purchase of Wyeth in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The company disputes the fairness of the previous trial
and the appropriateness of the jury&#8217;s verdict,&#8221; Christopher Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said today in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annual sales of Wyeth&#8217;s hormone-replacement drugs once
topped $2 billion before the Women&#8217;s Health Initiative study,
sponsored by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, suggested
that women on the therapy had a 24 percent higher risk of breast
cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jury Trials &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Premarin,
Wyeth&#8217;s estrogen-based drug, with progestin-laden Provera, made
by Pfizer&#8217;s Upjohn unit, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth
combined the two hormones in its Prempro pill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth and Upjohn units have now lost eight of the
15 Prempro cases decided by juries since trials began in 2006.
The drugmaker got some of those verdicts thrown out after trial
or had the awards reduced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It resolved some of the verdicts through settlements, while
other decisions are on appeal. Wyeth also has won dismissals of
more than 3,000 cases before trial, according to court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence in Daniel&#8217;s case showed that she took Prempro for
about 16 months starting in December 1999 and was diagnosed with breast cancer in July 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Philadelphia Common Pleas Court jury found that Prempro
was a &#8220;factual cause&#8221; of Daniel&#8217;s cancer and awarded her $1
million in compensatory damages. The panel also awarded Daniel&#8217;s
husband, Tom, $500,000 in damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sealed Verdict &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jurors also handed down $8.6 million in punitive damages,
Berezofsky said. The judge in the case sealed that verdict
because another Prempro trial was ongoing in the same
courthouse. Berezofsky made the punitive damage award public
today after the appeals court ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial judge in the case threw out both verdicts and
gave Wyeth a new trial because of questions about the testimony
of one of the plaintiffs&#8217; expert witnesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court found the trial judge erred in
questioning the testimony and ordered the verdicts reinstated.
The ruling means an additional $2.4 million in pre- and post-
judgment interest will be added the award, Berezofsky said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer rose 12 cents to $19.16 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have climbed 9.4

&lt;p&gt; Walt Disney Co., the world&#8217;s biggest
theme-park company, reported first-quarter profit that beat
analysts&#8217; estimates after an increase in attendance at its
resorts and advertising sales growth at ESPN. The shares rose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income rose to $1.3 billion, or 68 cents a share, from
$844 million, or 44 cents, a year earlier, Burbank, California-
based Disney said today in a statement. Profit beat the 56-cent
average of 23 analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales
rose 10 percent to $10.7 billion, also topping estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recovering economy drove attendance gains at Disney
theme parks and advertising growth at cable networks led by
ESPN. Anthony DiClemente, an analyst at Barclays Capital in New
York, predicted 3 percent higher attendance at parks in Orlando,
Florida. Analysts on average projected sales of $10.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Their strength was across the board,&#8221; said Michael Morris, an analyst with Davenport  Co. in Richmond, Virginia,
who recommends the stock. &#8220;They were ahead of my expectations
and that of the Street on nearly every front.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theme-park income increased 25 percent to $468 million as
revenue expanded 8 percent to $2.87 billion. Earnings at
Disney&#8217;s TV operations gained 47 percent to $1.07 billion,
boosted by gains at ESPN, which aired two newly acquired college
bowl games in the quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s cable revenue gained 16 percent to $3.07 billion,
led by higher fees and advertising sales at ESPN and the Disney
Channel. Profit increased 42 percent to $771 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s ABC broadcast unit boosted revenue 4 percent
to $1.58 billion as Disney&#8217;s local TV stations increased
advertising sales. Profit increased 64 percent to $295 million
after ESPN took over the Rose Bowl telecast and ABC reduced its
news and daytime production cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney rose 3.4 percent to $42.60 in extended trading. The
shares added 24 cents to $41.18 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading and have advanced 9.8 percent this

&lt;p&gt;One Equity Partners LLC, the buyout
arm of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), plans to invest $500 million in
Brazilian companies over the next two years, Veronica Allende Serra, a private-equity consultant, said by telephone yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Equity is in talks to invest in eight industrial,
consumer-goods and energy companies, said Allende Serra, a
partner at Pacific Investimentos, which represents One Equity in
the South American country. She declined to name potential
acquisition targets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Brazil was named by the board as one of three priority
investment markets for the firm, alongside Asia and Eastern
Europe,&#8221; Allende Serra said. &#8220;Our focus is on companies with
good management, which need capital to grow organically or by
acquisitions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fastest growth in more than two decades in Brazil last
year helped fuel 482 mergers and acquisitions totaling $146.4
billion, the highest volume of deals in at least 12 years,
according to Bloomberg data. Gross domestic product probably
grew 7.3 percent in 2010, according to the central bank&#8217;s
quarterly inflation report, published Dec. 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mergers and acquisitions in Brazil by foreign and local
companies will reach record volumes this year, Luiz Leonardo Cantidiano, former head of Brazil&#8217;s securities regulator, said
in an interview on Jan 27. Private equity company Advent
International Corp. has $2 billion for acquisitions in Brazil,
partner Patrice Etlin said in a Feb. 1 interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serra, the daughter of former Sao Paulo governor Jose
Serra, said One Equity is looking for deals involving a minimum
investment of $100 million. The private equity fund was created
in 2001 and has $8 billion of liquidity, the executive said. &lt;/p&gt;

infringement, claiming the website facilitates the theft of
motion pictures and television content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News Corp.&#8217;s Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., Universal
City Studios Productions LLLP, Sony Corp.&#8217;s Columbia Pictures
Industries Inc. and Time Warner Inc.&#8217;s Warner Bros.
Entertainment Inc. joined Disney in the suit, according to a
complaint filed today in federal court in Miami. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Hotfile is a commercial online hub for distributing
popular entertainment content without authorization, including
hundreds of thousands of copies of the plaintiffs&#8217; copyrighted
works,&#8221; according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users of Hotfile pay a monthly fee to download content,
including movies playing in theaters, from the company&#8217;s
computer servers, the studios said in their complaint. Hotfile
is operated by Anton Titov, who is also a named defendant,
according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Titov and a Hotfile representative didn&#8217;t immediately
return an e-mail message seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Motion Picture Association of America Inc. today
announced the suit in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Disney Enterprises Inc. v. Hotfile Corp.,
11-20427, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida
(Miami). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wake Forest University baseball coach
Tom Walter donated a kidney to freshman outfielder Kevin Jordan,
a draft pick of the New York Yankees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a procedure performed yesterday at the Emory Transplant
Center in Atlanta, Walter, 42, had a kidney removed and given to
the 19-year-old Jordan, according to the university&#8217;s website.
Both operations were a success and both men should make a full
recovery, the website said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jordan, who was picked by the Yankees in the 19th round of
2010 Major League Baseball Draft, suffers from ANCA vasculitis,
an autoimmune disease that causes the destruction of blood
vessels through inflammation. Jordan was diagnosed in April
2010, after losing 20 pounds during a bout with the flu. Doctors
discovered that his kidney function was 15 percent to 20 percent
normal and said a transplant would be necessary, according to
the university. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, after Jordan&#8217;s family members were deemed
incompatible for donation, Walter decided to undergo testing. On
Jan. 28, the first day of spring practice, he was informed that
he and Jordan were a match, the university said on the website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter is entering his second season as coach of the Demon
Deacons, posting an 18-37 record last year. Prior to his arrival
at the school in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, he spent five
years at the University of New Orleans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil Corp.&#8217;s refinery in Baton
Rouge, Louisiana, is performing maintenance on a fluid catalytic
cracker and associated units that will last several weeks, Kevin Allexon, a company spokesman, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allexon, based in Fairfax, Virginia, said the refinery
began the turnaround on Feb. 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalytic crackers are the main gasoline-making units at a
refinery. The Baton Rouge plant, second-largest in the U.S.
after Exxon&#8217;s refinery in Baytown, Texas, has a fluid catalytic
cracking capacity of 243,000 barrels a day, according to the
U.S. Energy Department&#8217;s Energy Information Administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EIA&#8217;s 2010 refinery capacity report does not say how
many catalytic crackers are at the Baton Rouge plant, and
Allexon said he had &#8220;no further details to share.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Baton Rouge refinery processes domestic crudes from Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi and Alaska, according to the
company&#8217;s website. It also imports crude from Mexico, the North
Sea, West Africa, South America, Central America and the Arabian
Gulf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plant can process 525,000 barrels of oil a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil investors should consider selling
existing bullish positions because prices may decline this week
without fresh political tension in North Africa and the Middle
East, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; New York crude futures surged to the highest since October
2008 on Jan. 31, with London&#8217;s Brent trading above $100 a
barrel, on concern Egyptian unrest would disrupt supplies from
the Middle East and unsettle the region&#8217;s stability. Signs that
protests are easing mean the market may be set for a &#8220;notable
correction,&#8221; the bank said in a report yesterday. Hedge funds
raised bullish bets on oil by the most in eight weeks, according
to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This week will be characterized by a drift down in crude
prices on days where either no new tensions arise or where
political progress is perceived,&#8221; JPMorgan analysts led by New
York-based Lawrence Eagles said in the report. &#8220;Investors
should therefore consider taking profits on all or a portion of
their remaining long positions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil fell to the lowest in more than a week today as China
raised key interest rates for the third time since October,
spurring bets that fuel demand may be curtailed in the
world&#8217;s biggest energy user. Futures for March delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell as much as 1.8 percent to
$85.88 a barrel while Brent crude dropped as low as $97.53. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Egypt &#8216;Progress&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices in New York slid 5 percent in the five days through
yesterday as demonstrations against Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak subsided and the government met with opposition leaders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds and other large speculators boosted net-long
positions on oil, or wagers on rising prices, by 17 percent in
the seven days ended Feb. 1, CFTC data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. President Barack Obama yesterday said Egypt is
&#8220;making progress&#8221; in negotiations with the opposition. About
3.5 percent of global oil output moves through Egypt via the
Suez Canal and the Suez-Mediterranean Pipeline, according to
Bloomberg calculations using data from the Energy Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude may remain volatile because geopolitical risks in
Algeria, Yemen and Jordan haven&#8217;t subsided, JPMorgan said.
Opposition groups in Algeria, a member of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, planned protests in Algiers on
Feb. 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The risks of a more substantive price shock in the months
ahead remain in place,&#8221; the JPMorgan analysts said. &#8220;We would
look to add call option length.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on Jan. 31 said Brent crude is
&#8220;vulnerable&#8221; to a temporary price drop as anti-government
violence won&#8217;t spread to the Middle East. Brent futures in
London reached $100 a barrel that day for the first time since
October 2008 and traded near $99 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Grant Smith" date="Feb 08, 2011  8:07 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-08/crude-oil-near-one-week-low-on-rising-supplies-jpmorgan-sees-correction-.html"><headline>Oil Falls After China Raises Rates; JPMorgan Sees &#8216;Correction&#8217;</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Oil fell to the lowest level in more
than a week as China raised key interest rates for the third 
time since October, spurring bets that fuel demand may be 
curtailed in the world&#8217;s biggest energy user. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures declined as much as 1.8 percent after the People&#8217;s
Bank of China said the benchmark one-year lending rate will 
increase tomorrow to 6.06 percent from 5.81 percent. Futures
also dropped as political tension in Egypt eased and traders bet
a report tomorrow will show U.S. inventories increased for a 
fourth week. Oil may be headed for a ''''notable correction'''' as
the unrest in Egypt abates, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Oil futures in New York are showing a knee-jerk reaction
to the Chinese interest-rate decision,&#8221; said Carsten Fritsch,
an analyst at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t expect
prices to fall lastingly though, as demand in China will likely
remain robust. At some point higher interest rates will bite
into demand, but not yet.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The March contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell
as much as $1.60 to $85.88 a barrel, the lowest price since Jan.
28, and was at $86.17 as of 1:02 p.m. London time. Brent crude
for March settlement was down $1.51, or 1.5 percent, at $97.74
a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London, extending
its 2.5 percent drop of the past two days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China said it will raise borrowing costs after growth 
accelerated and inflation stayed above 4 percent for a third
month. Consumer prices rose 4.6 percent in December and the 
economy expanded 9.8 percent in the fourth quarter, faster than
the pace in the previous three months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fuel Inventories &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. supplies gained 2.25 million barrels from 343.2
million in the seven days ended Feb. 4, a Bloomberg News
survey showed before tomorrow&#8217;s report. The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute will publish its own data today.
Stockpiles at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for West
Texas Intermediate oil, are at the highest since at least 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasoline inventories probably climbed to the highest level
in almost 21 years, the survey showed. Supplies of the motor
fuel increased 3 million barrels, or 1.3 percent, from 236.2
million a week earlier, according to the median of 10 analyst
estimates. The projected advance would leave stockpiles at the
highest since March 1990. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil in New York surged to $92.19 on Jan. 31, the highest
settlement since Oct. 3, 2008, on concern Egyptian unrest would
disrupt shipments from the Middle East. Brent futures climbed
above $100 a barrel, reaching $102.34 on Feb. 2, the highest
since Sept. 26, 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Consider Taking Profits&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan recommended investors consider selling long
positions because prices may decline this week without fresh
political tension in North Africa and the Middle East. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This week will be characterized by a drift down in crude
prices on days where either no new tensions arise or where
political progress is perceived,&#8221; analysts led by New
York-based Lawrence Eagles said in a report dated yesterday.
&#8220;Investors should therefore consider taking profits on all or a
portion of their remaining long positions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York oil&#8217;s slump has widened the discount to London&#8217;s
Brent futures. The spread reached $12.40 a barrel today, the
widest on record, based on closing prices. It was at $10.97 a
week ago and averaged 76 cents last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Hedge funds raised bullish bets on oil by the most in eight
weeks in the seven days ended Feb. 1 amid escalating violence in
Egypt. About 3.5 percent of global oil production moves through
Egypt via the Suez Canal and the Suez-Mediterranean Pipeline,
based on data from the Energy Department. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SA is still seeking a

it didn&#8217;t identify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa Chairman Emilio Azcarraga Jean sent Rafael
Carabias, a former financial director for Spain&#8217;s La Sexta, to Madrid in order to monitor plans for the sale, the financial
news website said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Gavin Finch, Bryan Keogh and Charles Penty" date="Feb 08, 2011  5:51 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-08/goldman-sachs-turns-bullish-on-stocks-in-european-banks-bond-market-shuns.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Turns Bullish on Stocks in European Banks Bond Market Shuns</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is telling
investors to buy European bank stocks for the first time in more
than 16 months. Bond buyers are taking the opposite view on
concern that policy makers will fail to staunch the debt crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks in Spain, Italy and Greece have led the Bloomberg
Europe Banks and Financial Services Index 16 percent higher
since November. While shares of Spain&#8217;s Banco Santander SA
rallied 23 percent and Italy&#8217;s UniCredit SpA jumped 25 percent,
both lenders had to offer investors record premiums over
government debt when they sold covered bonds in the same period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity investors are betting political leaders will bridge
their differences over the mandate of the European Financial
Stability Facility and stop the region&#8217;s debt crisis from
spreading. Bond buyers are skeptical that the talks will succeed
and concerned banks may be forced to accept losses on the more
than $2 trillion of loans and other assets they have in Greece,
Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. Analysts say that while
equity investors may be right in the short term, they risk
ignoring a jump in funding costs that will erode future profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fundamental split here is about whether policy
measures in Spain and the rest of Europe are going to work in
halting the crisis -- or not,&#8221; said Huw van Steenis, a banking
analyst at Morgan Stanley in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Especially Attractive&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs equity strategists, including Peter Oppenheimer and Sharon Bell, turned bullish on European lenders
last week, saying anxiety about the debt crisis will ease,
driving down banks&#8217; funding costs. The analysts, citing a
&#8220;narrowing of sovereign spreads in the peripheral eurozone,&#8221;
said in a Feb. 3 note that bank stocks were among the cheapest
and the &#8220;trade-off between their growth prospects and earnings
in the next few years looks especially attractive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS AG, Switzerland&#8217;s biggest bank, today posted a 7
percent increase in fourth-quarter profit. Deutsche Bank AG last
week reiterated its target to double pretax profit at its
operating units to 10 billion euros ($13.6 billion) this year
from 2009 levels as the Frankfurt-based company posted a gain in
fourth-quarter earnings at its investment bank. Santander,
Spain&#8217;s biggest bank, reported fourth-quarter profit on Feb. 3
that beat analysts&#8217; estimates. Chairman Emilio Botin told
reporters that &#8220;the worst of the crisis is behind us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank stocks are benefiting as investors ride the &#8220;positive
earnings story&#8221; for short-term gains, said Suki Mann, senior
credit strategist at Societe Generale SA in London. &#8220;Funding
levels are still very high for the banks,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Credit&#8217;s
where the smart money is.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;More Uncertainty&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That point was echoed by Alexander Plenk, a Munich-based
analyst at UniCredit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Equity investors are typically more focused on the short
term than credit investors, and the really horrible news seems
to have ended,&#8221; Plenk said. &#8220;Credit investors tend to take
more of a medium to long-term view, where there is much more
uncertainty.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European banks have more at stake in Spain than in Greece
and Ireland combined, with total claims exceeding $716 billion
at the end of September, according to the Bank for International
Settlements. Europe&#8217;s lenders hold more than $902 billion of
loans and other assets in Italy, including sovereign debt, and
$216 billion in Portugal, according to BIS data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial firms in southern Europe are paying some of the
highest costs ever to borrow relative to government debt. An
increase in funding costs erodes bank profit by narrowing the
net interest margin, or the difference between what a bank earns
from lending and pays for funding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covered Bonds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders in Spain and Italy are offering record amounts of
covered bonds because investors are wary of buying unsecured
debt that could be subject to so-called bail-ins being discussed
by regulators that would convert it into equity when triggers
are breached. Investors are forcing banks to pay more in
interest on the securities, which are typically backed by
mortgages or public-sector loans, are getting costlier for banks
to sell as supply outstrips demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santander, which hasn&#8217;t sold a senior unsecured bond this
year, issued 1 billion euros of five-year covered bonds on Jan.
5 at a spread of 287 basis points, almost three times what it
paid in March last year. UniCredit, Italy&#8217;s largest lender, sold
1.25 billion euros of 12-year covered debt on Feb. 1 at a record
spread of 210 basis points. Four months ago, the Milan-based
bank sold seven-year covered notes at 154 basis points. A basis
point is one-hundredth of a percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intesa, BBVA &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Intesa Sanpaolo SpA, Italy&#8217;s second-biggest bank, based in
Turin, paid a record spread of 208 basis points to sell 10-year
covered bonds on Jan. 14, compared with a spread of 148 basis
points at a five-year debt sale less than three months earlier. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, Spain&#8217;s No. 2 lender, sold
1.5 billion euros of three-year covered notes on Jan. 4 at a
record spread of 310 basis points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. banks by contrast are selling debt from three-year
floating-rate notes to 30-year bonds as the cost to protect the
securities from default declines amid signs the economy is
improving. Borrowing costs for U.S. lenders are near the lowest
in nine months relative to the debt of industrial companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No banks in Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece or Spain have
sold debt in dollars since September. German, Swiss and British
lenders, including Deutsche Bank and London-based HSBC Holdings
Plc, aren&#8217;t paying as much to borrow as southern European banks
and are finding overseas investors willing to buy their debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Credit Suisse Group AG, Switzerland&#8217;s second-biggest
lender, raised $2.18 billion this year in the U.S., including a
sale of three-year notes that paid a spread of 128 basis points
over Treasuries. HSBC, Europe&#8217;s biggest bank, sold 750 million
euros of four-year notes at a spread of 127 basis points on Jan.
24, two weeks after a $4 billion offering, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Pretty Dire&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funding costs for Banco Santander, Intesa, UniCredit and
BBVA have declined from record highs this month, helped by a
wider rally in bank bonds. Spreads on senior euro-denominated
bank debt narrowed 32 basis points to 169 basis points last week
since reaching a six-month peak on Jan. 11, Barclays Capital&#8217;s
Euro Aggregate Banking Senior Index shows. BBVA raised 2 billion
euros in a five-year covered note sale on Feb. 2 at a spread of
242 basis points. That&#8217;s still more than three times as much as
the lender paid about a year ago to sell similar securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nothing material has changed over the past two or three
weeks, even though there has been improved sentiment in the
stock markets,&#8221; said John Anderson, who manages about 500
million pounds ($805 million) in European bonds as head of
credit at Gartmore Investment Management Ltd. in London. &#8220;The
macro situation is still pretty dire in countries like Spain,
and if they can&#8217;t grow, they can&#8217;t reduce their deficit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Union officials are trying to bolster confidence
in the 27-nation bloc&#8217;s financial industry by forcing banks to
hold more capital in reserve against future losses and to
undergo stress tests to show they can withstand a recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Group of 20 leaders in November endorsed rules drawn up by
the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision that will more than
triple the highest-quality capital, such as shareholders&#8217;
equity, that lenders must hold to cushion against losses.
European regulators, preparing a second round of stress tests in
the first half of this year, have pledged to toughen the exams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of protecting European senior financial debt from
default has surged 32 percent in the past four months. The
Markit iTraxx Financial Index of 25 banks and insurers increased
39 basis points to 162.5 basis points, which means it costs
162,500 euros annually to insure 10 million euros of the debt
for five years, according to data provider CMA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices for credit-default swaps linked to the bonds of New
York investment banks, including Goldman Sachs and Morgan
Stanley, traded at levels that approached those of junk bonds in
March 2007, before the global financial crisis and as shares in
those firms were rallying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlimited Cash &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European banks are also charging more to lend to each
other. The rate at which European firms say they will lend euros
to other banks for three months, known as Euribor, reached a 19-
month high on Feb. 4 on concern that the European Central Bank
may withdraw emergency cash supplies to lenders in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ECB said in December it would lend unlimited cash at
its weekly, monthly and three-month refinancing operations until
April to alleviate banks&#8217; funding pressures and spur lending.
The ECB offers the unlimited cash at 1 percent, the same as its
benchmark, record-low interest rate. European banks are still
dependent on the emergency funding: 371 lenders sought 213.7
billion euros in seven-day funds on Feb. 2, the most this year,
according to the ECB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Comprehensive&#8217; Package &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU leaders meeting in Brussels Feb. 4 reiterated a March 25
deadline to reach what German Chancellor Angela Merkel called a
&#8220;comprehensive&#8221; package to address the crisis. The measures
may include stiffer sanctions against budget deficits higher
than 3 percent of gross domestic product, lower interest rates
on loans and allowing the 440 billion-euro stability fund to buy
debt directly from member states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merkel, forced into underwriting a 110 billion-euro rescue
of Greece last year, has toned down her insistence that
government bondholders accept losses in future bailouts. In
November, as the EU and International Monetary Fund bailed out
Ireland, she called the euro&#8217;s condition &#8220;exceptionally
serious.&#8221; Two months later, she said she&#8217;d back &#8220;whatever is
needed to support the euro.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s helped Europe&#8217;s benchmark Stoxx 50 index gain 9
percent this year. Credit-default swaps tied to Spanish government bonds fell about 36 percent since Jan. 10, CMA prices
show, indicating an improvement in the perception of credit
quality. The swaps are at 230 basis points. Contracts on Italy
fell about 33 percent to 172 basis points, CMA prices show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some of the frantic activity we have seen in the last few
weeks has died down,&#8221; said Julian Chillingworth, who helps
manage about 15 billion pounds of shares at Rathbone Brothers
Plc in London. &#8220;Whether or not the European debt crisis is over
is debatable. There&#8217;s still a long way to go.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PKO Bank Polski SA, Poland&#8217;s largest
bank, is rebuilding its team of equity analysts to compete with
foreign rivals lured to the country by record share sales and
rising stock volumes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state-controlled bank&#8217;s brokerage hired Grzegorz Zawada
this month as co-head in charge of equity research. Zawada, 37,
returned to Poland after stints as a banking analyst at London-
based units of Nomura Holdings Inc., Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc and HSBC Holdings Plc. He will be the third analyst in
the team, depleted in past months by departures to domestic
competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We plan to at least double the number of analysts this
year,&#8221; Zawada said an interview in Warsaw. &#8220;The level of our
equity research should correspond to the level of the bank -- we
should be one of the leading players.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PKO, with 167 billion zloty ($59 billion) of assets and
more than 1,200 branches across Poland, is facing increased
competition from foreign and domestic rivals. Credit Suisse
Group AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase  Co.
expanded equity coverage in Poland last year as share sales
reached a record $10 billion and trading volumes increased. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Warsaw Stock Exchange was the fastest-growing market in
central Europe in the past 10 years, more than doubling the
number of traded companies and almost tripling daily turnover,
according to its website. The bourse lists companies with total
market capitalization of $199 billion, making it the third-
largest in emerging Europe after markets in Russia and Turkey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadening Coverage &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PKO&#8217;s brokerage is currently covering &#8220;around a dozen&#8221;
Polish companies and plans to increase the number to around 60
by next year, according to Zawada. The brokerage plans to cover
all stocks from Warsaw&#8217;s benchmark WIG20 Index and 40 smaller
companies, out of the bourse&#8217;s total of 397 listed companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to imagine that the largest bank in Poland has
a limited supply of this basic investment-banking product,
equity research,&#8221; said Zawada. &#8220;Our competitive advantage is
the bank&#8217;s firm grounding in the Polish economy, and we will
want to look at smaller companies apart from the WIG20 group.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polish share sales almost doubled in 2010 as the government
cut its stakes in the largest energy, copper, phone and
insurance companies to help finance the budget deficit and limit
borrowing, Bloomberg data showed. The 8.1 billion-zloty initial
public offering of insurer PZU SA in April was the biggest by a
Polish company since the Warsaw Stock Exchange was created in
1991 and the second-largest in Europe in 2010 after Enel Green
Power SpA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year the government plans IPOs of coking coal producer
Jastrzebska Spolka Weglowa SA, agricultural lender Bank
Gospodarki Zywnosciowej SA and a property holding company that
the Treasury Ministry is creating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cancer drugs made by Pfizer Inc. and Novartis AG helped combat a rare form of pancreatic tumor, the
type diagnosed in Apple Inc.&#8217;s Steve Jobs in 2004, reports in a
medical journal confirmed today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s Sutent and Novartis&#8217;s Afinitor, both used to treat
kidney cancer, more than doubled the time that patients lived
without their pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors spreading,
according to company-funded research reported today in the New
England Journal of Medicine. Data from the studies were
previously presented at medical meetings and submitted to
regulators for marketing approval, according to the companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors make up about 1.4 percent
of the 40,000 people a year who are diagnosed with pancreatic
cancer. Patients have few treatment options and die an average
of three years from diagnosis, according to a 2007 study. The
new treatments may prolong survival, while adding side effects,
including diarrhea, vomiting and infections. Jobs, 55, chief
executive officer of Cupertino, California-based Apple, told
employees on Jan. 17 he was taking his third medical leave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These studies provide optimism,&#8221; said Robert T. Jenson
and Gianfranco Delle Fave, doctors at the National Institute of
Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, in Bethesda, Maryland, in an editorial that accompanied the studies. &#8220;Both
drugs are effective at improving disease-free survival, even in
patients in whom other treatments have failed, and thus offer
effective therapies where there were none before.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Clearance &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both companies have applied to regulators in the U.S. and
the European Union. Pfizer won European approval in December to
market Sutent for pancreatic tumors. Pfizer also has clearance
to sell Sutent for gastrointestinal stromal tumors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Sutent study, patients lived without progression of
their advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors for a median
time of 11.4 months compared with 5.5 months for patients taking
a placebo, according to authors led by Eric Raymond of the University of Paris. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those taking Sutent lived longer, and the study was halted
early because it would have been unethical to continue giving
any patients a placebo instead of the medicine, Pfizer said in
March 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afinitor from Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis kept
advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors at bay for 11 months
compared with 4.6 months for patients on a placebo. The study
failed to prove that the drug extended overall survival,
possibly because patients on the placebo were allowed to switch
to Afinitor once their disease progressed, wrote authors led by
J.C. Yao of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in
Houston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unanswered Questions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The studies leave unanswered questions, according to
today&#8217;s editorial. Doctors don&#8217;t know how long patients should
take the medicines. If one drug fails, it&#8217;s unclear whether
switching to the other would help. Doctors also don&#8217;t know
whether it&#8217;s safe or effective to give the drugs in combination
with other treatments, including radiation and surgery, and
whether long-term side effects will limit the usefulness of the
treatments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple CEO Jobs took a leave of absence in 2004 after
saying he had a neuroendocrine tumor. He left again in 2009 for
a liver transplant, sometimes done when the cancer spreads. He
didn&#8217;t say on Jan. 17 why he was taking the third medical leave. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase  Co., sued by the
trustee for Bernard Madoff&#8217;s defunct firm for $6.4 billion for
allegedly aiding the con man&#8217;s fraud, asked a judge to remove
the case from bankruptcy court because it raises &#8220;novel and
unsettled questions&#8221; beyond the court&#8217;s scope and expertise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a lawsuit unsealed last week, Madoff trustee Irving Picard accused JPMorgan of actively assisting Madoff&#8217;s crimes to
protect earnings from his bank accounts, in the process
violating federal banking law. The earnings were &#8220;wholly
immaterial&#8221; and the allegations about law-breaking were &#8220;not
the domain of bankruptcy law,&#8221; JPMorgan said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard was appointed to liquidate the Madoff brokerage
firm, JPMorgan said in a filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. Instead, he is mostly pursuing non-bankruptcy claims
on behalf of Madoff&#8217;s customers, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The trustee is trying to pursue an enormous backdoor
class action to recoup damages incurred by individuals and
entities other than the firm to which he is the appointed
successor,&#8221; said JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing a U.S. District Court in Manhattan, the New
York-based bank said it has a right to a jury trial by law in an
appropriate federal court. Picard &#8220;falsely&#8221; accused the bank
of complicity in the largest securities fraud in U.S. history,
JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff opened accounts with JPMorgan or banks it bought in
1986, depositing customer investments and transferring money out
of the accounts, the bank said in the filling. Its fees were
$597,000 in the six years before Madoff&#8217;s 2008 bankruptcy, it
said, citing Picard. JPMorgan earned less than $3.5 million in
interest by loaning $145 million to Madoff&#8217;s firm in 2005 and
2006, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting in 2006, JPMorgan invested about $338 million in
four Madoff feeder funds, whose assets were managed by Madoff.
The investments were &#8220;a hedge&#8221; for financial products tied to
Madoff&#8217;s reported returns, it said. JPMorgan redeemed
$276 million of its original investments in the funds after
buying Bear Stearns in 2008, losing the rest when the Ponzi
scheme was revealed, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard wants to recoup the money redeemed, the loan
payments, interest and fees, in addition to $5.4 billion in
damages, allegedly the amount lost by Madoff customers in the
four years through December 2008, JPMorgan said. To get the
damages, he used theories of aiding and abetting fraud and
breach of fiduciary duty, as well as a theory of fraud on
regulators, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Madoff trustee&#8217;s suit against JPMorgan is &#8220;very
aggressive,&#8221; bankruptcy lawyer Harvey Miller told Bloomberg
Television today. &#8220;He is pushing the envelope to the limit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Aiding and Abetting&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a statement by Picard last week, JPMorgan had
a &#8220;decades-long role&#8221; as Madoff&#8217;s primary banker, &#8220;aiding and
abetting&#8221; the fraud. While the bank was warned Madoff may have
been running a Ponzi scheme and &#8220;had a palpable concern that
Madoff was a fraud for years,&#8221; it wasn&#8217;t until October 2008
that it reported Madoff to government officials, the trustee&#8217;s
lawyers said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks&#8217; executives didn&#8217;t restrict the Madoff firm&#8217;s
bank account &#8220;even though it was being used to launder money
from the Ponzi scheme,&#8221; they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, JPMorgan said Picard&#8217;s interpretation of
banking law &#8220;would impose broad investigative duties on banks
that do not exist.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While federal banking laws do provide &#8220;broad guidelines&#8221;
for detecting money laundering, the guidelines have rarely been
interpreted by the courts, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard asserted a &#8220;novel claim&#8221; that JPMorgan committed a
fraud on regulators including the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission and the Federal Reserve by not alerting them to
Madoff&#8217;s crimes, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Array&#8217; of Statutes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The bank&#8217;s relationships with its regulators are governed
by an array of federal statutes and regulations, none of which
creates an express private right of action against banks for
fraud on the regulator,&#8221; it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard would have to prove in the correct federal court
that he had a right to pursue a claim of fraud on regulators, it
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin McCue, a Picard spokesman, didn&#8217;t respond to an
e-mail seeking comment on the JPMorgan filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is leading a &#8220;charge in legal maneuver&#8221; to slow
trustees, St. John&#8217;s University business professor Anthony Michael Sabino said in an e-mailed statement. He predicted
JPMorgan and others fighting Picard would lose the fight, saying
Picard had a right under bankruptcy law to bring lawsuits to
recover money for Madoff customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Madoff liquidation case is Securities Investor
Protection Corp. v. Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities
Inc., 08-01789, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). The adversary case is Picard v. JPMorgan Chase
 Co., 10-AP-4932, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy Research in
Motion Ltd. options before the company introduces its PlayBook
tablet because possible volatility around the launch is not
being adequately priced in, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity derivatives strategists John Marshall and Maria Grant recommended buying RIM&#8217;s April $60 puts and April $65
calls, a strategy known as a strangle. Waterloo, Ontario-based
RIM fell less than 0.1 percent to $63.57 today in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Options do not appear to be factoring in the potential
for an increase in volatility around the upcoming tablet
launch,&#8221; the strategists wrote in a note today. &#8220;Success at
the enterprise level will be closely monitored, and we&#8217;d expect
a strong or weak sell through to be stock moving.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIM, whose BlackBerry smartphones are losing market share
to Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPhone, is developing the PlayBook to bring in a
new source of revenue and bolster growth. The tablet is
scheduled to come out this quarter. Research firm IDC predicted
tablet-computer sales will almost triple to 44.6 million units
this year. Apple sold 14.8 million iPads since the tablet was
introduced in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marshall and Grant said RIM&#8217;s earnings report on March 24
should be an &#8220;important catalyst&#8221; for the shares. The
BlackBerry maker moved an average of 9 percent on earnings over
the past eight quarters, the note said. RIM will post a fourth-
quarter profit of $1.75 a share excluding some items, according
to the average of 49 estimates in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade will profit if RIM closes above $70.51 or below
$54.49 at expiration on April 15, the note said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Corp. said Satya Nadella,
an engineering manager in its Internet business, is becoming
president of the server division, part of an effort to put more
people with a technology background in top jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nadella, 43, will oversee strategy, engineering, marketing
and product development for the company&#8217;s server, tools and
cloud-computing efforts, Microsoft said today in a statement. He
replaces Bob Muglia, whose departure was announced last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer is making executive
changes to inject more engineering experience into the senior
levels of product divisions. He&#8217;s contending with criticism from
the board and investors that Microsoft is falling behind in
smartphones and tablet computers. Ballmer also is trying to
capitalize on a shift to cloud software, which is stored online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nadella, a 19-year Microsoft veteran, served as a senior
vice president overseeing engineering and technical strategy for
the Bing search engine, MSN websites and Internet advertising.
Those products run on one of the biggest cloud-based systems in
the world, giving Nadella experience in that field. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another change, Amitabh Srivastava, a server unit senior
vice president who oversaw the company&#8217;s Windows Server and
Windows Azure cloud-computing products, is leaving the company.
He will be replaced by Bill Laing for now, Nadella said in a
message on Microsoft&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Walt Disney Co., the world&#8217;s biggest
theme-park company, rose to a record high in New York after
first-quarter sales and profit topped analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, advanced $2.18, or
5.3 percent, to $43.36 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. The old closing high of $43.05 was set in
April 2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recovering economy drove attendance gains at Disney
theme parks and advertising growth at cable networks led by
ESPN. Anthony DiClemente, an analyst at Barclays Capital in New
York, predicted 3 percent higher attendance at parks in Orlando,
Florida. Analysts on average projected sales of $10.5 billion.
Income from Disney&#8217;s studio and consumer products also rose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The earnings beat was broad-based and resolute as
operating income surpassed estimates in all segments, most
notably at the cable networks,&#8221; Michael Nathanson, an analyst
at Nomura Securities International Inc., said today in a note to
investors. He recommends investors buy the stock &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-quarter net income rose to $1.3 billion, or 68 cents
a share, from $844 million, or 44 cents, a year earlier, Disney
said yesterday in a statement. Profit beat the 56-cent average
of 23 analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 10
percent to $10.7 billion, also topping estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theme-park income increased 25 percent to $468 million as
revenue expanded 8 percent to $2.87 billion. Attendance at
domestic parks rose 2 percent from a year earlier, while per-
capita guest spending increased 8 percent, Chief Financial
Officer Jay Rasulo said yesterday on a call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Park Bookings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bookings for this quarter are running 3 percent ahead of a
year earlier, Rasulo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings at Disney&#8217;s TV operations gained 47 percent to
$1.07 billion, boosted by gains at ESPN, which aired two newly
acquired college bowl games in the quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s cable revenue gained 16 percent to $3.07 billion,
led by higher fees and advertising sales at ESPN and the Disney
Channel. Profit increased 42 percent to $771 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s ABC broadcast unit boosted revenue 4 percent
to $1.58 billion as Disney&#8217;s local TV stations increased
advertising sales. Profit increased 64 percent to $295 million
after ESPN took over the Rose Bowl telecast and ABC reduced its
news and daytime production cost. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola Co., the world&#8217;s largest
soft-drink maker, said fourth-quarter profit more than tripled
after a one-time non-cash gain related to the acquisition of its
North American bottling operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income advanced to $5.77 billion, or $2.46 a share, the
Atlanta-based company said today in a statement. Excluding some
items, profit was 72 cents, matching the average of estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola, led by Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent, now
controls 90 percent of its North America beverage distribution
following a deal last year with its largest bottler. The company
boosted volume sales in the U.S. and Canada by 8 percent for the
quarter, the third consecutive quarterly increase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola advanced 28 cents to $63.15 at 4:01 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have fallen 4
percent this year, compared with a 1.4 percent slide for rival
PepsiCo Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global sales by drink volume grew 6 percent, helped by a 5
percent gain in Latin America and a 2 percent increase in Europe. Volume in the Eurasia  Africa unit jumped 14 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola will put &#8220;a lot of effort&#8221; into dairy drinks in
conjunction with its growing juice business, Chief Executive
Officer Muhtar Kent also said today in an interview. PepsiCo
Inc. recently purchased a controlling stake in Russia-based
Wimm-Bill-Dann to expand more into dairy-based beverages. Coca-
Cola&#8217;s Minute Maid unit already sells a dairy and juice drink in China called Pulpy Super Milky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola recorded a $5 billion one-time, non-cash gain for
the 33 percent stake in Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. it traded in
the purchase of the bottler&#8217;s North American operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales rose 40 percent to $10.5 billion, helped by the new
distribution. Analysts on average estimated $10.2 billion,
according to a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income in the fourth quarter of 2009 was $1.54 billion,
or 66 cents a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purchase, New York-based PepsiCo, the second-biggest soft-
drink company, is scheduled to report earnings tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spot gasoline in the Gulf Coast
strengthened as Citgo Petroleum Corp. and Exxon Mobil Corp.
started work on gasoline-making units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s refinery in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, is performing
maintenance on a fluid catalytic cracker and associated units
that will last several weeks, Kevin Allexon, a company
spokesman, said in an e-mail. Allexon, based in Fairfax,
Virginia, said the refinery began the turnaround on Feb. 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discount for conventional 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast narrowed 0.25 cent to 4.63 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange in New York
at 2:33 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt
delivery of the fuel gained 3.26 cents to $2.4781 a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalytic crackers are the main gasoline-making units at a
refinery. The Baton Rouge plant, second-largest in the U.S.
after Exxon&#8217;s refinery in Baytown, Texas, has a fluid catalytic
cracking capacity of 243,000 barrels a day, according to the
U.S. Energy Department&#8217;s Energy Information Administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citgo shut down fluid catalytic cracking unit 1 at the
Corpus Christi East refinery in Texas Feb. 7 to conduct repairs
on an expansion joint, according to a filing with state
regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional 87-octane gasoline in the Midwest, or Group 3,
narrowed 0.37 cent to 1.88 cents a gallon versus futures. Prompt
delivery of the fuel gained 3.54 cents to $2.5071 a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Marathon Oil Corp. will shut the No. 5 crude unit at its
Catlettsburg refinery in Kentucky from tomorrow through March 2
for planned maintenance, according to a filing with state
regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A naphtha pretreater and high-pressure continuous catalytic
reformer will also be shut during the work, according to the
filing with the Kentucky Division of Air Quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasoline for March delivery added 3.18 cents, or 1.3
percent, to settle at $2.526 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank, purchased too many hard-to-sell assets 
before the financial crisis in 2008, Chief Financial
Officer David A. Viniar said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was &#8220;buying more illiquid assets than we
probably should have,&#8221; Viniar, 55, said today at a conference
in Miami hosted by Credit Suisse Group AG, his eighth
consecutive appearance at the annual event. &#8220;It was a good
lesson learned.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Less liquid assets&#8221; increased at a 39 percent compound
annual growth rate between the start of 2005 and the start of
2008, compared with 24 percent growth in liquid assets,
according to a slide Viniar included in his presentation. Since
the first quarter of 2008, the firm has reduced holdings of such
investments at an 18 percent compound annual rate, while liquid
assets are down 9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assets included mortgage-backed and other asset-backed
securities, loans, high-yield debt, emerging-market stocks and
bonds and investments in funds and private equity, the slide
showed. They totaled $172 billion in the first quarter of 2008,
or 14 percent of the firm&#8217;s balance sheet, up from $65 billion,
or 11 percent, three years earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After posting record profit in 2009, Goldman Sachs reported
a 38 percent drop in net income for 2010 as revenue from
underwriting and trading slumped. Viniar said he expects revenue
to rebound from fixed-income, currencies and commodities
trading, the firm&#8217;s largest division, known as FICC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;ll see FICC start to improve,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Principal Strategies &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs closed a proprietary-trading unit called
Goldman Sachs Principal Strategies last year in response to new
financial regulations, known as the Volcker rule, that puts
limits on banks&#8217; trading for their own account. Viniar has said
the company is waiting to see how the final rules are written to
determine if they will have to close other units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Whatever effects there have been, you&#8217;ve seen already,&#8221;
Viniar said today. &#8220;We don&#8217;t see that big of an effect from the
Volcker rule on our revenues.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs shares, which closed yesterday at $168.55,
fell 0.4 percent in 2010 after doubling in 2009. They reached a
peak of $247.92 in October 2007 and closed as low as $52 in
November 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm, which paid $550 million last year to settle a
U.S. regulator&#8217;s fraud suit, published a set of new business
standards last month after a committee of employees completed an
eight-month review of the company&#8217;s practices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Danisco A/S lost a U.S. court bid to
invalidate a Novozymes A/S patent for an enzyme used in biofuel
production, allowing the case to go to trial this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novozymes is suing Danisco, which is subject to a takeover
offer from DuPont Co., contending its smaller Danish rival
infringes a patent on an alpha amylase enzyme that remains
active in high temperatures. In counteraction, Danisco had asked
the court for a summary judgment that the patent was invalid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In dispute is patent 7,713,723, which was issued May 11,
2010, the same day the case was filed in federal court in
Madison, Wisconsin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I conclude that defendants haven&#8217;t met their burden to
prove by clear and convincing evidence that the &#8216;723 patent is
invalid as a matter of law,&#8221; U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb
wrote in her Feb. 4 decision, adding she still has &#8220;doubts&#8221;
over whether the patent gives an adequate description of
Novozymes&#8217; product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novozymes, based in Bagsvaerd, Denmark, and Copenhagen-
based Danisco are the world&#8217;s biggest makers of enzymes that
break down organic material, such as grain and corn, to form
bioethanol, which is used as an alternative to fossil fuels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case will now go to a full trial in October, Annegrethe
Jakobsen, a Novozymes spokeswoman, said by telephone. She
declined any further comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not unusual that the court doesn&#8217;t grant a motion
such as this in an early phase of a trial,&#8221; Soonhee Jang,
Danisco&#8217;s chief intellectual property counsel, said in an e-
mail. &#8220;We are still confident and will go forward with the
trial. We believe we will prevail.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danisco&#8217;s board last month recommended a $5.8 billion bid
from Wilmington, Delaware-based DuPont. The offer is pending
shareholder approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Novozymes A/S v. Danisco A/S, 10-cv-251, U.S.
District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin (Madison). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Tax Patent Won&#8217;t Have Imitators Under Bill &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has patented a strategy that cuts
taxes on executive pay. Merrill Lynch  Co. holds one for a
computer program maximizing the tax benefits of a medical
savings account. They could be among the last of their kind as
Congress considers outlawing such proprietary claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decade after an appeals court ruled that it is possible
to patent a method of conducting business, the Senate Judiciary
Committee on Feb. 3 voted unanimously to advance legislation
that would stop the U.S. Patent and Trademark office from
awarding exclusive rights to profit from tax-savings methods.
The provision is part of a broad overhaul of patent laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress is acting after the U.S. Supreme Court last year
ruled that business methods are eligible to receive patents.
Lawmakers said that in extreme cases such patents could
encourage tax avoidance and the creation of illegal tax
shelters. They also could raise costs for taxpayers who follow
legal methods of reducing their tax liability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If firms or individuals were able to hold patents for
these strategies, some taxpayers could face fees simply for
complying with the tax code,&#8221; said Iowa Senator Charles
Grassley, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary panel.
&#8220;Tax patents provide windfalls to lawyers and patent holders by
granting them exclusive rights to use tax loopholes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 130 tax-strategy patents have been issued since 1998,
the year the appeals court ruled business methods can be
patented. Another 150 applications are pending, according to
AICPA. The coalition last week warned Grassley and Senate
Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy of Vermont that the
tax patents could increase costs for law-abiding taxpayers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No one should risk facing royalties or lawsuits just for
complying with federal tax law,&#8221; said Mat Young, director of
congressional and political affairs at the AICPA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s the situation that faced John W. Rowe, the former
executive chairman of Aetna Inc., in 2006. The owner of a patent
that funded so-called grantor retained annuity trusts with
executive stock options sued Rowe when he used the strategy.
Rowe settled in 2007, sidestepping a court ruling on the issue.
The terms of the settlement weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, Congress in 2010 changed the law to deny some of the
benefits derived from the Goldman Sachs patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics of such patents had predicted that the Supreme
Court would scale back their use after an appeals court
specializing in patent law ruled that patents must be connected
to a machine or somehow transform an item. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, the high court in June ruled that the test was too
rigid, even as it said business-method patents &#8220;raise special
problems in terms of vagueness and suspect validity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate legislation would block applications for such
strategies from being filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office. Inventions based on publicly available information,
known as &#8220;prior art,&#8221; can&#8217;t be patented; the Senate bill would
designate all tax-avoidance strategies prior art. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internal Revenue Service proposed regulations in 2007
that would provide extra scrutiny to tax filings that used a
patented strategy. That regulation isn&#8217;t yet final. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tax patent issue is a small part of the broader
proposal before Congress, which is considering the biggest
changes to U.S. patent law since 1952. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JetBlue, New York Tourism Begin Co-Branding &#8216;Heart&#8217; Campaign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; JetBlue Airways Corp. rolled out its first aircraft marked
with the co-branded trademark &#8220;I heart Blue York,&#8221; the New
York-based company said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The airline&#8217;s new livery represents a partnership with New
York&#8217;s &#8220;I heart New York&#8221; tourism campaign and logo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logo is placed on the aircraft&#8217;s tailfin and was
created in collaboration with Milton Glaser, who designed the
original New York tourism trademark in 1975, according to the
statement. The joint campaign with JetBlue marks the first time
the mark been co-branded for use with another entity, according
to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the campaign, short films promoting New York
State as a tourism destination will be shown in the airline&#8217;s
in-flight seatback program. The films were created in
cooperation with students at New York University&#8217;s Tisch School
of the Arts Graduate School of Film. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Movie Studios Sue Hotfile.com Over Infringement Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Walt Disney Co. unit and four other movie studios sued
the operators of Hotfile.com for copyright infringement,
claiming the website facilitates the theft of motion pictures
and television content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; News Corp.&#8217;s Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., Universal
City Studios Productions LLLP, Sony Corp.&#8217;s Columbia Pictures

Entertainment Inc. joined Disney in the suit, according to a
complaint filed yesterday in federal court in Miami. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Hotfile is a commercial online hub for distributing
popular entertainment content without authorization, including
hundreds of thousands of copies of the plaintiffs&#8217; copyrighted
works,&#8221; according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users of Hotfile pay a monthly fee to download content,
including movies playing in theaters, from the company&#8217;s
computer servers, the studios said in their complaint. Hotfile
is operated by Florida resident Anton Titov, who is also a named
defendant, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Titov and a Hotfile representative didn&#8217;t immediately
return an e-mail message seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Motion Picture Association of America Inc. announced
the suit in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

(Miami). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Righthaven Seeks Award of Duke&#8217;s WhiteCivilRights.com Domain &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Righthaven LLC, which has filed more than 175 copyright
infringement lawsuits on behalf of Stephens Media Group&#8217;s Las
Vegas Review-Journal, sued David Duke for copyright
infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was filed on behalf of the Denver Post, which
isn&#8217;t a Stephens Media product. Righthaven claims that it owns
the copyright that was infringed. The Post is owned by
Affiliated Media Inc., the closely held holding company of
William Dean Singleton&#8217;s MediaNews Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duke, a former candidate for the governorship of Louisiana,
is accused of posting a photo from the Denver Post on his
website, www.whitecivilrights.com. Co-defendant with Duke is the
European-American Unity and Rights Organization, a group he
founded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint filed Feb. 4 in federal court in
Denver, Duke posted a photo of an airport pat-down searches
conducted by an agent of the Transportation Security
Administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Righthaven, based in Las Vegas, said it will be
&#8220;irreparably harmed&#8221; if the alleged infringement continues. It
asked the court to bar any use of its content by Duke and EURO,
and seeks to be awarded the www.whitecivilrights.com domain
name, in addition to money damages, attorney fees and litigation
costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The copyright holder is represented by in-house counsel
Steven G. Gamin and by Shawn A. Mangano of Shawn A. Mangano Ltd.
of Las Vegas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duke didn&#8217;t respond immediately to an e-mailed request for
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Righthaven LLC v. European-American unit and
Rights Organization, 1:11-cv-00307-LTB, U.S. District Court,
District of Colorado). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mardi Gras Indians Register Copyrights for &#8216;New Suits&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year at Carnival time in New Orleans, each member of
the Mardi Gras Indians makes a new suit to be worn Mardi Gras
Day and later on &#8220;Super Sunday,&#8221; or the Sunday nearest St.
Joseph&#8217;s Day, March 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mardi Gras Indians, who are black members of so-called
tribes with names like the Wild Tchoupitoulas, the Golden Arrows
and the Morning Star Hunters, have a long tradition of creating
fanciful beaded and feathered costumes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The costumes may cost $2,000 and weigh as much as 150
pounds. They are displayed in street parades, and the practice
of costume-making is the subject of a popular Mardi Gras song by
the Wild Magnolias tribe, &#8220;Every Year at Carnival Time We Make
a New Suit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, Ashlye M. Keaton, a lawyer, is working with the
Mardi Gras Indian Council Inc. and the nonprofit Sweet Home New
Orleans to help the Indians register and enforce the copyrights
to their costumes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keaton, also an adjunct professor at Tulane University Law
School, said in an e-mail that the Indians will enforce their
rights against sellers of images that infringe their art. The
Indians seek to encourage photographers and artists to get
written permission to feature the costumes, she said. If no
permission is obtained, and if negotiations and cease-and-desist
notices fail, the Indians can consider litigation, according to
Keaton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands of photos are shot of the Indians every year, and
Keaton says it&#8217;s important &#8220;to distinguish public street scenes
from derivative works.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mardi Gras falls on March 8 this year, and the &#8220;Super
Sunday&#8221; parade is set for March 20, according to the Mardi Gras
Digest website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Billionaire Warren Buffett said his
$5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs Group Inc. at the depths
of the financial crisis was a wager that Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and then-Treasury Department Secretary Henry Paulson would take on debt to prop up the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was a bet essentially on the fact that the government
would not really shirk its responsibility at a time like that to
leverage up at a time when the rest of the world was trying to
deleverage,&#8221; Buffett said in an interview released today by the
Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. bought preferred stock in
New York-based Goldman Sachs in 2008 after the collapse of rival
securities firm Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Paulson had left
the chairmanship of Goldman Sachs in 2006 to join the
administration of President George W. Bush. Bernanke had been an
economist at Princeton University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I made the fundamental decision that we had the right
people, in Bernanke and Paulson, in there with a president that
would back them,&#8221; Buffett said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire gets a 10 percent annual dividend on the
investment and received warrants to buy $5 billion in common
stock with a strike price of $115 per share. Goldman Sachs
traded for more than $165 a share today on the New York Stock
Exchange, compared with $84.39 at the end of 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett had said in 2008, when Omaha, Nebraska-based
Berkshire announced the investment, that he was betting on an
&#8220;exceptional institution.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs &#8220;has an unrivaled global franchise, a proven
and deep management team and the intellectual and financial
capital to continue its track record of outperformance,&#8221; he said
in a Sept. 23, 2008 statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest U.S.
oil company, is seeking partners for four concessions in the
Podlasie natural-gas shale basin in Poland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company owns the concessions and will retain its role
as operator, according to a posting on a Schlumberger Ltd.-
operated website today. A concession is a grant from a
government to allow exploration for petroleum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon said the area covers about 1 million gross acres. An
exploration well in the Minsk Mazowiecki concession scheduled
for this month is intended to help evaluate the gas potential,
the company said. Exxon said a seismic survey has been acquired
on the Wolomin concession. The other sections are known as
Legionowo and Wodynie-Lukow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon and Chevron Corp. are looking to tap Poland&#8217;s
unconventional gas reservoirs, which can require fracturing of
rock formations to help gas flow. Poland last year called on the
European Union to give more weight to shale gas in its energy
policy to reduce the reliance on imports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s posting shows the company is seeking offers to buy
as much as 49 percent of its equity in the areas, with
preference given to offers with full corporate approval. An
online data room is set to open Feb. 16 and close April 13.
Offer submissions are due on April 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company continually reviews assets and their
contributions to operating needs and financial objectives,
Patrick McGinn, an Exxon spokesman, said today in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This does not indicate any shift in Exxon Mobil&#8217;s
interest in Polish shale gas opportunities,&#8221; McGinn said. &#8220;We
are continuing to evaluate the hydrocarbon resource potential in
Poland.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon rose 65 cents to $83.20 as of 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. Exxon is based in Irving, Texas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 15 minutes, 11-year-old Lily Li
stared through a glass panel at hammerhead sharks and bluefin
tuna in Hong Kong&#8217;s newest attraction, Aqua City. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s like a dream,&#8221; said Li, from China&#8217;s Guangdong
province, who crowded with her mother and about 50 others at the
window, the width of a basketball court, on the packed Jan. 27
opening day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The egg-shaped building, with nightly water shows, is part
of a HK$5.5 billion ($707 million) redevelopment by government-
owned Ocean Park to profit from a jump in mainland Chinese
visitors. The revamp adds pressure on Walt Disney Co.&#8217;s Hong
Kong Disneyland, which has trailed Ocean Park since its 2005
opening, has yet to make a profit, and is spending HK$3.6
billion on its own expansion, including &#8220;Toy Story Land.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Home-grown theme parks like Ocean Park have proven that
they can compete with a big global corporation like Disney,&#8221;
said Jonathan Galaviz, managing director of Galaviz  Co., a
tourism industry economist. &#8220;As consumer disposal income
increases in Asia, the first place that Asian consumers will
spend that money on is travel, tourism, and fun experiences.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tussle between Hong Kong Disneyland, which lost $92
million last year, and Ocean Park underscores the importance of
tourism in Asia, with countries and cities including Singapore
and Thailand getting as much as 16 percent of gross domestic
product from visitors, according to an October report by HSBC
Holdings Plc. Hong Kong, known for its dim sum restaurants and
luxury brand shops, tops the list of the 14 places HSBC surveyed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tickets Sold Out &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ocean Park sold all its admission tickets for Feb. 5 to
Feb. 7, with attendances during the Chinese New Year holidays,
started last week, up as much as 50 percent from a year ago,
spokeswoman Una Lau said. Disneyland&#8217;s two hotels were almost
fully-booked and attendances rose almost 10 percent for the
period, spokesman B.C. Lo said, declining to give specific
figures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mainland Chinese tourists, the only group of visitors to
increase spending in Hong Kong between 2008 and 2009, are
expected to more than double global spending to $110 billion by
2015, according to HSBC. The Chinese made about 54 million
outbound visits last year, the official Xinhua News Agency said
on Jan. 11, citing the nation&#8217;s tourism academy. That&#8217;s more
than the number of people living in South Korea or Spain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re doing a lot of pre-arrival promotions&#8221; in China,
Andrew Kam, managing director of Hong Kong Disneyland said in an
interview. &#8220;We need to make sure they must come when they are
in Hong Kong.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrow Losses &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The park, which cut its annual loss to HK$718 million from
HK$1.3 billion a year earlier, is marketing in secondary Chinese
cities including Jiangsu, Ningbo, Wenzhou and Shaoxing, Kam said.
It may soon introduce a HK$450 multi-day pass for Guangdong
visitors, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Walt Disney&#8217;s profit in the three months ended Jan. 1
jumped 54 percent to $1.3 billion on higher theme-park
attendance and advertising sales growth at ESPN. The parks in
Paris and Hong Kong saw higher spending, the company said Feb. 8,
without providing specific numbers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mainland arrivals spend huge sums of money on shopping,
and they are the big drivers for Hong Kong retail sales,&#8221; said
Paul Tang, a Hong Kong-based economist at Bank of East Asia Ltd.,
&#8220;Chinese spending will not come down but keep going up.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese visitors to Hong Kong jumped 26.3 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record Visitors &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendances at Disneyland rose 13 percent to 5.2 million
for the fiscal year ended Oct. 2, with mainland visitors
increasing 32 percent, according to the company. That&#8217;s behind
the record 5.4 million paid visitors last year at 34-year old
Ocean Park, which houses pandas An An and Jia Jia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ocean Park has grown even in the midst of all other
developments,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer Tom Mehrmann said in an
interview. In 2004, there were 15 theme parks in Asia excluding India, and by last year there were 35, he said. He expects
visitors from China to rise as much as 15 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Every city is working hard on promoting their tourism,&#8221;
said Joseph Tung, executive director of Hong Kong&#8217;s Travel
Industry Council. &#8220;Fierce competition is unavoidable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Genting Singapore Plc opened its Universal Studios theme
park last year, with attractions based on the Jurassic Park
movies and science-fiction television series Battlestar
Galactica. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Fifty million Chinese traveled abroad last year, so they
can easily fly to Singapore, the U.S. or other markets that are
fun,&#8221; said Shaun Rein, Shanghai-based managing director of
China Market Research Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Shanghai Competition &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney and state-owned Shanghai Shendi Group Co. plan
to jointly open the first Disneyland Park in China in Shanghai.
The Shanghai government is spending 40 billion yuan on
infrastructure for the park, expected to open in 2015, in the
city&#8217;s Pudong area, according to the Shanghai Daily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ll probably go to Shanghai Disneyland instead of
coming to Hong Kong in the future because the commute from
Beijing is shorter,&#8221; said Zhang Wensheng, 40, who went to the
Hong Kong park for the first time last week with his six-year-
old son. &#8220;I heard the park in Shanghai will be much bigger in
size too.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Disneyland, 47-percent owned by Burbank,
California-based Walt Disney, will fight back later this year
with the unveiling of &#8220;Toy Story Land,&#8221; based on the exploits
of toy spaceman Buzz Lightyear and his cowboy friend Woody. The
latest film in the series was nominated for an Academy Award for
Best Picture. Disney is hiring musician Danny Elfman to compose
music for another attraction &#8220;Mystic Point,&#8221; which along with
&#8220;Grizzly Gulch&#8221; will be ready by 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too Few Rides &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expansion may address tourist complaints that the
smallest of the Disney theme parks needs more rides, said China
Market Research&#8217;s Rein. Hong Kong Disneyland has fewer hotel
rooms than counterparts in Paris and Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Disneyland seems a bit small and it feels like a waste of
time,&#8221; said Ge Lin, 36, a visitor from Guizhou who prefers
Ocean Park because of the pandas and marine attractions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disneyland&#8217;s Kam said the expansions will help. The park is
also planning to lure more visitors from other parts of Asia
with an Indian restaurant and looking at introducing Halal food
to cater to Muslims, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, he&#8217;s relying on Chinese tourists like Susan Liu,
who bought her family of four to Hong Kong from China for the
first time last month. They stayed in Disneyland&#8217;s hotel,
spending 7,000 yuan ($1,063) as the children acquired Mickey
Mouse bags full of princess outfits and toy cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We came here because of Disney,&#8221; said Liu, 33, as she
watched her 8-year old daughter dash around in a Tinkerbell
dress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase  Co., sued by the
trustee for Bernard Madoff&#8217;s defunct firm for $6.4 billion for
allegedly aiding the con man&#8217;s fraud, asked a judge to remove
the case from bankruptcy court because it raises &#8220;novel and
unsettled questions&#8221; beyond the court&#8217;s scope and expertise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a lawsuit unsealed last week, Madoff trustee Irving
Picard accused JPMorgan of actively assisting Madoff&#8217;s crimes to
protect earnings from his bank accounts, in the process
violating federal banking law. The earnings were &#8220;wholly
immaterial&#8221; and the allegations about law-breaking were &#8220;not
the domain of bankruptcy law,&#8221; JPMorgan said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard was appointed to liquidate the Madoff brokerage
firm, JPMorgan said in a filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan. Instead, he is mostly pursuing non-bankruptcy claims
on behalf of Madoff&#8217;s customers, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The trustee is trying to pursue an enormous backdoor
class action to recoup damages incurred by individuals and
entities other than the firm to which he is the appointed
successor,&#8221; said JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard &#8220;falsely&#8221; accused the bank of complicity in the
largest securities fraud in U.S. history, JPMorgan said. The New
York-based bank said it has a right to a jury trial by law in an
appropriate federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Madoff trustee&#8217;s suit against JPMorgan is &#8220;very
aggressive,&#8221; bankruptcy lawyer Harvey Miller told Bloomberg
Television yesterday. &#8220;He is pushing the envelope to the
limit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a statement by Picard last week, JPMorgan had
a &#8220;decades-long role&#8221; as Madoff&#8217;s primary banker, &#8220;aiding and
abetting&#8221; the fraud. While the bank was warned Madoff may have
been running a Ponzi scheme and &#8220;had a palpable concern that
Madoff was a fraud for years,&#8221; it was not until October 2008
that it reported Madoff to government officials, the trustee&#8217;s
lawyers said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks&#8217; executives didn&#8217;t restrict the Madoff firm&#8217;s
bank account, &#8220;even though it was being used to launder money
from the Ponzi scheme,&#8221; they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, JPMorgan said Picard&#8217;s interpretation of
banking law &#8220;would impose broad investigative duties on banks
that do not exist.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While federal banking laws do provide &#8220;broad guidelines&#8221;
for detecting money laundering, the guidelines have rarely been
interpreted by the courts, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard asserted a &#8220;novel claim&#8221; that JPMorgan committed a
fraud on regulators including the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission and the Federal Reserve by not alerting them to
Madoff&#8217;s crimes, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Madoff liquidation case is Securities Investor
Protection Corp. v. Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities
Inc., 08-01789, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). The adversary case is Picard v. JPMorgan Chase
 Co., 10-AP-4932, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. Government, Banks Seal Bonus, Disclosure Accord &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne yesterday
announced an agreement by Britain&#8217;s biggest banks -- Lloyds
Banking Group Plc, Barclays Plc, HSBC Holdings Plc and Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc -- to lower compensation from last
year&#8217;s levels. Under the agreement, the banks will disclose the
remuneration details of their five most-senior employees below
board level, without naming the individuals. The announcement
came a day after the chancellor raised tax on the industry by
800 million pounds ($1.3 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Britain needs to move from retribution to recovery,&#8221;
Osborne told the House of Commons in London. &#8220;The banks will
lend more money, especially to small businesses, pay more taxes
and pay smaller bonuses, be more transparent about bonuses they
do pay and make a greater contribution to our regional
economy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal follows two months of talks during which ministers
have wrangled with bank chiefs over demands for lower bonuses as
the government raises taxes and reduces spending to narrow a
record budget deficit. Barclays Chief Executive Officer Robert
Diamond said Jan. 11 the time for &#8220;apologies and remorse&#8221; from
banks following the financial crisis was over. Britain&#8217;s bankers
learn the size of their bonuses this month and next. Following
the negotiations, known as Project Merlin, Lloyds, HSBC, RBS,
Barclays and Banco Santander U.K. also agreed to make loans of
about 190 billion pounds to companies to help bolster the
economic recovery, Osborne said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The banks are the clear winners here,&#8221; said Ralph Silva,
a strategist at London-based Silva Research Network, which
provides research to financial companies. &#8220;The banks had
already said they were going to increase lending to businesses
and that was to be expected given that the economy is
recovering. Coupled with that the salary disclosures are pretty
pointless as we aren&#8217;t going to know what the star traders
earn.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement was criticized as having no real effect. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative head of Parliament&#8217;s cross-party
Treasury Committee, said little progress had been made on
bonuses in the accord. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Without further transparency on bonuses we will never
know whether banks are fueling risks and mistakes for which one
day we may have to pay as a result of the way they misallocate
risk,&#8221; Tyrie told lawmakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ed Balls, who speaks for the opposition Labour Party on
financial affairs, said the agreement is &#8220;vague, toothless and
not a substitute for proper competition.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement is the latest occasion that RBS and Lloyds
have accepted the need to show restraint on bonuses, with both
banks first making the pledge in 2009. The state has majority
stakes in the two lenders after the previous Labour government
provided about 1 trillion pounds in bailouts and guarantees to
support the financial system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fed Confirms Banks Would Have 2 Years to Adapt to Volcker Rule &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve confirmed yesterday that banks would
generally have two years to comply with the Volcker Rule, which
bars bank holding companies from trading for their own accounts,
once its provisions become effective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed yesterday announced approval of a final rule to
implement the provisions of the Volcker Rule. It said in a
statement that the final rule is &#8220;substantially similar&#8221; to a
proposal published in November. The Volcker Rule hasn&#8217;t yet been
completed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC Seeks Comment on Cutting Credit-Rating References &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is proposing to
replace references to credit ratings in forms used to register
securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC commissioners voted 5-0 yesterday to seek comment on a
rule that would remove credit ratings from a list of criteria
that could qualify issuers for expedited sale of non-convertible
securities. Ratings would be replaced by a new test tied to the
amount of debt an issuer has sold in the preceding three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The global community has continued to express concern
with credit-rating reliance being embedded into regulatory
frameworks,&#8221; SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro said in a statement.
&#8220;We believe that having issued $1 billion of registered non-
convertible securities over the prior three years would
generally correspond with a wide following in the marketplace.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dodd-Frank Act requires federal regulators including
the SEC to replace references to credit ratings in their rules
by July 21. The regulatory overhaul enacted last year calls on
agencies to replace the reference with an &#8220;appropriate&#8221; new
standard for measuring creditworthiness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers took aim at credit-rating companies after firms
including Moody&#8217;s Corp. and McGraw-Hill Cos.&#8217; Standard  Poor&#8217;s
unit gave top rankings to subprime mortgage bonds whose collapse
sparked the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, assigned by
Congress to find the causes of the meltdown, said in its final
report last month that poor performance by credit-rating firms
was a significant contributor to the collapse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC is seeking comment through March 28 on the proposed
rule, which would also remove credit ratings from other agency
documents related to the short-form registrations. The proposal
is the first of a series of steps the SEC is taking under the
Dodd-Frank requirement to remove all references to ratings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC Commissioner Troy Paredes, one of two Republicans on
the panel, said he would be &#8220;keenly interested&#8221; in comments on
the number of firms that might be inconvenienced by the change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules &#8220;could hinder capital formation by making it
more difficult for some public companies to use the streamline
registration form,&#8221; said Bradley J. Bondi, a law partner at
Cadwalader, Wickersham  Taft LLP in Washington, in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It will be important for any affected companies to
comment on the SEC&#8217;s proposed changes,&#8221; said Bondi, who
investigated credit-rating firms for the FCIC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An SEC staff study, however, found that fewer than 5
percent of issuers from 2006 through 2008 would have been
prevented from using short-form registration if the proposed
rule had been in place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC Said to Probe Insider Trading Through Exchange-Traded Funds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is
investigating whether exchange-traded funds are being used to
hide insider trading, a person with knowledge of the probe said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funds, which usually track an index and trade like
stocks, enable buyers to bet on price changes without trading
futures. An investor with non-public information about a company
may be able to hide illegal orders by trading in a fund that
includes that stock instead of buying or selling the equity
directly, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of exchange-traded funds has surged since they
were created in 1993, widening investors&#8217; access to different
assets, including commodities. The SEC has said it is using
data-driven techniques to find patterns of insider trading and
market manipulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probe was previously reported by the Financial Times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of England, Finance Regulator Propose Bank Auditor Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority
proposed rules that would require auditors to share information
with regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules would apply to auditors when they are dealing
with firms regulated by the FSA and require the external
auditors of &#8220;certain firms&#8221; to have formal meetings with the
regulator, the FSA said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This increased coordination will enhance the ability of
the FSA to scrutinize specific accounting practices and related
judgments in order to understand fully their implications and to
highlight emerging problems,&#8221; the FSA said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The London-based regulator said last year that bank
auditors must pay more attention to possible management bias in
the banking industry after accounting firms failed to uncover
problems before the financial crisis. Investors lost confidence
in banks&#8217; financial reporting during the early stages of the
credit crunch because they didn&#8217;t reflect the reality of
emerging problems, the FSA said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSA and the Financial Reporting Council, which
regulates accounting firms, said in a separate statement that
they reached an agreement to share more information to improve
oversight of audits at finance firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are concerns &#8220;some auditors may not be exercising
sufficient professional skepticism in their approach to the
audit of key areas of management judgment,&#8221; said Richard
Thorpe, the FSA&#8217;s accounting and auditing section leader. &#8220;The
FSA relies on audited financial information to meet its
regulatory objectives and it is imperative that we have
confidence in the information provided.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bank of England will oversee prudential regulation by
the end of 2012 in an overhaul of the current regulatory
structure. The FSA will be replaced by an independent Consumer
Protection and Markets Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senators Urge Regulators to Move Cautiously on Derivatives Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bipartisan group of U.S. senators urged regulators
implementing derivatives measures under the Dodd-Frank Act to
move cautiously so the rules can be &#8220;completed without
unintended consequences.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The senators, in a Feb. 8 letter signed by 13 members of
the Senate Banking and Agriculture committees, warned Treasury
Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke and two other top officials against &#8220;overly
prescriptive rules&#8221; that might push market participants abroad.
&#8220;If the major overhaul of our derivatives market is implemented
hastily, agency rulemakings could have negative effects on our
economy at a time when we can least afford it,&#8221; the lawmakers
said in the letter signed by three Democrats and 10 Republicans
including Senator Mike Johanns of Nebraska, who serves on both
the Banking and Agriculture committees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission are leading efforts to regulate the
$583 trillion over-the-counter derivatives market after largely
unregulated trades helped fuel the credit crisis. SEC Chairman
Mary Schapiro and CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler also were sent
copies of the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawmakers urged regulators to exempt &#8220;end-users&#8221; --
non-financial firms that use derivatives to hedge business risk
-- from margin requirements stipulated by Dodd-Frank. Failing to
do so would &#8220;blatantly disregard&#8221; the law&#8217;s intent, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swaps and other derivatives are financial instruments whose
value is based on an underlying security or benchmark, such as a
stock option. Companies may use them to hedge risks and other
investors employ them to bet on markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter was signed by Republican Senators Pat Roberts of
Kansas, Thad Cochran of Mississippi, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin,
David Vitter of Louisiana, Mike Crapo of Idaho, Kay Bailey
Hutchison of Texas, Roger Wicker of Mississippi, John Boozman of
Arkansas and Jerry Moran of Kansas as well as Johanns. Democrats
Max Baucus of Montana, Herb Kohl of Wisconsin and Jon Tester of
Montana also signed the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republican Threat to Cut SEC Funding May Delay Fiduciary Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republicans in the U.S. Congress may withhold funds from
the Securities and Exchange Commission, delaying a new standard
for brokers and registered investment advisers, said
Representative Barney Frank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC&#8217;s potential budget shortfall &#8220;will have the effect
of either delaying or slowing down at best&#8221; fiduciary
rulemaking, Frank of Massachusetts, the senior Democrat on the
Financial Services Committee, said in a telephone interview. The
agency was asked by Congress to look at the effectiveness of
existing rules governing brokers and investment advisers as part
of the Dodd-Frank financial services overhaul law enacted July
21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without money for staff to help implement a common standard
and follow up on complaints, the SEC won&#8217;t be able to enforce
it, said Frank, a coauthor of the legislation. The SEC, which
can make the rules without additional Congressional approval,
recommended in a staff report delivered to Congress Jan. 21 that
brokers and registered investment advisers who give personalized
investment advice follow a uniform fiduciary standard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broker-dealers currently are held to a suitability standard
that calls for advice that meets their clients&#8217; needs when a
product is sold, instead of the fiduciary duty followed by
registered investment advisers to put their clients&#8217; best
interests first. Rulemaking is scheduled for between April and
July, according to the SEC&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A dramatic spending increase to fund the SEC and CFTC, as
envisioned by the authors of the Dodd-Frank legislation, would
further the mindset that our nation&#8217;s problems can be solved
with more spending, not more efficiency,&#8221; Representative Scott Garrett, chairman of the Financial Services subcommittee that
oversees the SEC, said Jan. 25 in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo Says Fiduciary Standard May Narrow Customer Choice &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Wells Fargo  Co.&#8217;s head of brokerage operations said banks
may reduce the number of investment products offered to
customers if regulators impose a fiduciary standard on brokers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s proposal for
a common fiduciary standard for brokers and registered advisers
may increase the need for due diligence from banks and advisers,
Senior Executive Vice President David Carroll said yesterday at
a Miami investor conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC&#8217;s plan would make all brokers and registered
investment advisers who provide personalized investment advice
adhere to a common standard when dealing with clients. Broker-
dealers currently must ensure only that an investment product
and accompanying advice is suitable for their clients&#8217; needs. A
fiduciary duty would mean putting clients&#8217; best interests first,
which might require passing up choices with bigger commissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s going to cause the investment menu to narrow,&#8221;
Carroll said. &#8220;We won&#8217;t have 6,000 mutual funds in our network
probably two years from now like we do today.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo, with $1.2 trillion in client assets and based
in San Francisco, is the third-largest among U.S. brokerages,
behind Morgan Stanley Smith Barney and Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s
Merrill Lynch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of developing the standard is moving along the
way Wells Fargo would like because it&#8217;s being developed by
regulators &#8220;and not by congressional staff,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have been driving our brokerage business toward a
fiduciary model starting back in 2004,&#8221; Carroll said. &#8220;So
we&#8217;re pretty pleased with where this is headed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Courts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freeman Told Judge Inside Tips Came From Taiwan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former SAC Capital Advisors LP portfolio manager Noah
Freeman told a judge this week that his illegal inside tips came
from sources in California, New York, Texas and Taiwan,
according to a court transcript. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freeman, 35, pleaded guilty on Feb. 7 and agreed to
cooperate with Manhattan federal prosecutors in their probe of
insider trading by hedge funds. A transcript of his guilty plea,
which was initially under seal, was made public today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his plea, Freeman said he worked at two hedge funds
between 2005 and 2010, which he didn&#8217;t identify, and on several
occasions paid insiders for &#8220;detailed financial information
including revenues and, on some occasions, gross margins and
earnings per share.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some of the people with whom I -- from whom I received
information were based in other states including California, New
York and Texas, and others were abroad including in Taiwan,&#8221;
Freeman said, according to the transcript. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Barai, 11-mag-00332, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activision Blizzard Loses EU Court Challenge to Antitrust Fine &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Activision Blizzard Inc. unit lost a bid to have the
European Union&#8217;s highest court reduce an antitrust fine levied
on a cartel involving Nintendo Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Court of Justice, the 27-nation EU&#8217;s top
tribunal, today dismissed the appeal, ruling that the documents
EU regulators had relied on &#8220;constituted sufficient evidence of
the existence of an agreement between Activision Blizzard and
Nintendo which was contrary to EU law.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission, the EU antitrust agency, fined
Nintendo and seven distributors 167.8 million euros ($228.9
million) for colluding between 1991 and 1998 to raise prices of
games and consoles. Nintendo won an appeal to the EU&#8217;s second-
highest court in 2009 cutting its fine by 20 percent to 119.2
million euros from 149.1 million euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Belgian unit of Germany&#8217;s CD-Contact Data GmbH, which
has since become Activision Blizzard Germany, was the only
company in the cartel to appeal its fine to the EU&#8217;s top court.
The lower EU court in 2009 halved its 1 million euro-fine to
500,000 euros because of the company&#8217;s &#8220;passive role.&#8221; CD-
Contact became Nintendo&#8217;s importer for Belgium in 1997,
according to the commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is C-260/09 P, Activision Blizzard Germany
(anciennement CD-Contact Data) v European Commission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should maintain bets on
higher prices for soybeans, cotton and corn, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. said after the U.S. Department of Agriculture lowered
stockpile estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s crop outlook is unchanged after the USDA
released new projections yesterday, analyst Damien Courvalin
wrote in an e-mailed report. The USDA cut its forecasts for
inventories before this year&#8217;s harvests and said world supplies
of crops including corn, wheat and soybeans will slump 2.2
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shrinking stockpiles have pushed up food costs, helping to
spark protests and riots across North Africa and the Middle
East. World food prices climbed to a record in January, the United Nations said on Feb. 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. corn planting will likely climb &#8220;to the detriment of
soybeans this year, as corn margins will likely remain most
appealing to U.S. farmers in February,&#8221; Courvalin wrote.
&#8220;Acreage competition will keep crop-price correlation
elevated.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs kept its recommendation to hold long
positions in Chicago March-delivery corn futures and November-
delivery soybeans, as well as New York-traded December-delivery
cotton futures, the report shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soybeans, Cotton &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank forecasts soybean prices will rise to $16 a bushel
in the next three months, while the six- and 12-month target
price is $15.75. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While soybeans may underperform corn in the near term, we
continue to expect further price strength in 2011, as a loss of
U.S. acreage would create high risks of another deficit in 2011-
12,&#8221; Courvalin wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs forecasts cotton prices in three months&#8217; time
at $1.50 a pound, with a six- and 12-month forecast of $1.25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Inventory levels remain critically low,&#8221; the analyst
wrote. &#8220;The large deficit and strong emerging-market demand
require significantly higher new-crop prices to secure
sufficient U.S. acreage.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corn may rise to $7.15 a bushel in the three-month period
before falling to $6.75 later in the year, according to Goldman
Sachs. Wheat prices may drop to $7.75 a bushel within three
months before sliding further to $7.50, the report shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethanol Demand &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to expect further upside in corn prices on
continued strong U.S. ethanol demand,&#8221; Courvalin wrote. &#8220;We
believe wheat inventories remain sufficient to absorb the 2010-
11 supply shortfall and view wheat prices as too elevated
relative to corn and soybeans.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stockpiling in the face of food inflation and social unrest
is likely to continue to support milling-wheat prices, creating
&#8220;upside risk&#8221; to the three-month price forecast, according to
the analyst. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;March-delivery corn last traded at $6.96 a bushel on the
Chicago Board of Trade and November-delivery soybeans were at
$13.97 a bushel. Cotton for December delivery was at $1.27 a
pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Nokia Oyj is close to announcing a
software partnership with Microsoft Corp., a bet that together
the two companies can better challenge Google Inc. and Apple
Inc., according to a person with knowledge of the discussions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia Chief Executive Officer Stephen Elop has held talks
with Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer about putting Microsoft&#8217;s
mobile operating system on Nokia phones, said the person, who
asked not to be identified because the discussions were private.
Elop also held talks with Google CEO Eric Schmidt about using
Google&#8217;s Android software, the person said. Those discussions
are unlikely to lead to an alliance, according to another person
familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elop will unveil a new strategy for Nokia at an event in London tomorrow, laying out his comeback plan for the smartphone
market. The partnership with Microsoft, if clinched, would be
aimed at helping both companies claw back ground lost to Android
and Apple&#8217;s iPhone at the high end of the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 47-year-old former Microsoft executive may also seek
changes in the executive suite and a review of Nokia&#8217;s
smartphone platforms Symbian and MeeGo, and try to squeeze more
out of the company&#8217;s 5.9 billion-euro ($8.1 billion) corporate
research and development budget -- more than four times Apple&#8217;s &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some investors and analysts say the steps may be too
little, too late for the world&#8217;s largest mobile-phone maker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Very few companies regain their leadership once they&#8217;ve
lost it,&#8221; said Hakim Kriout, a fund manager at Grigsby 
Associates in New York, who holds Nokia shares. &#8220;It&#8217;s a very
difficult thing to do because their demise tends to originate
from a combination of problems rather than one or two issues.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strategic Alliance? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laurie Armstrong, a U.S. spokeswoman for Espoo, Finland-
based Nokia, didn&#8217;t respond to requests for comment. Dawn Beauparlant, a spokeswoman for Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft, declined to comment. Mike Nelson, a spokesman for
Google in Mountain View, California, didn&#8217;t immediately respond
to a message seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia would prefer to have a strategic partnership with a software company, rather than just being one of the many
companies that license Android software, one of the people said.
The idea would be to wed Nokia&#8217;s market share, which is
especially high in emerging markets, with Microsoft&#8217;s Internet
and software know-how, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android is licensed to dozens of companies, which use it
for both smartphones and tablets. Samsung Electronics Co. and HTC Corp. are the two biggest makers of devices based on the
software, according to research firm Gartner Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Attitudinal Shift&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elop took the helm at Nokia in September after a stint as
head of Microsoft&#8217;s business-software division. Taking on the
competitive threats may require an overhaul of the mindset at
Nokia, Elop has said. The company currently relies on a
smartphone operating system called Symbian, and it&#8217;s developing
another software platform with Intel Corp. called MeeGo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We need an attitudinal shift,&#8221; Elop said last month.
&#8220;We must improve the quality of our execution, accelerate the
speed at which we execute, and enhance the effectiveness of our
partnerships.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That may mean changing some managers. Nokia has no
executive vice presidents left from Chairman Jorma Ollila&#8217;s
&#8220;dream team&#8221; in the 1990s. Some executives joined the ranks when
Ollila was still in charge in the mid-2000s, including Mary McDowell, who runs low-end phones, Kai Oeistaemoe, now in
corporate development, Tero Ojanperae in services and Niklas Savander in marketing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Burning Platform&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A memo purportedly written by Elop to employees -- which
Nokia neither confirms nor denies -- shows he&#8217;s aware of the
issues that ail Nokia. The company is &#8220;standing on a burning
platform, and we must decide how we are going to change our
behavior,&#8221; he is cited by technology blog Engadget as saying in
the memo. Elop said Jan. 27 that Nokia &#8220;must build, catalyze
and/or join a competitive ecosystem.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late last year, Sun Xuanyu, a

phone brand she&#8217;d been using since she was a teenager. She had
fallen in love with an Android. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nokia used to be really good,&#8221; said Sun, 23, who got her
first mobile phone when she was 12. &#8220;Now they just don&#8217;t make
smartphones that do the kinds of things I want.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sun is among people Nokia Oyj Chief Executive Officer
Stephen Elop needs to woo back as devices based on Google Inc.&#8217;s

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks rose, extending a second
straight weekly advance, as Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak&#8217;s
resignation and a jump in consumer confidence to an eight-month
high bolstered optimism in the global economic recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Caterpillar Inc., JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Bank of America
Corp. climbed at least 1.9 percent to lead the Dow Jones
Industrial Average higher. ConocoPhillips added 2.1 percent on
plans to raise its dividend and buy back as much as $10 billion
in stock. Kraft Foods Inc. dropped 1.5 percent after lowering
its forecast because of rising commodity costs. An exchange-
traded fund tracking Egyptian equities rallied 4.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index advanced 0.6 percent to
1,329.15 at 4 p.m. in New York, its highest level since June
2008. The benchmark gauge rose 1.4 percent this week. The Dow
gained 43.97 points, or 0.4 percent, to 12,273.26. The Chicago
Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, which measures the cost
of using options as insurance against declines in the SP 500,
fell 2.5 percent to 15.69, a four-week low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As some of the uncertainty clears in Egypt, people can
focus on fundamentals,&#8221; said Peter Sorrentino, who helps
oversee $14.4 billion at Huntington Asset Advisors in
Cincinnati. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had a fair amount of pretty good economic
reports, including consumer confidence. Unfortunately, the
optimism was recently disrupted by geopolitical concern. We&#8217;ll
see how that plays out. There&#8217;s enough momentum in the U.S.
economy right now.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Nokia Oyj, the world&#8217;s biggest maker
of mobile phones, tumbled the most in almost 19 months on
investor concern that a partnership with Microsoft Corp. won&#8217;t
be enough in its battle with Google Inc. and Apple Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia, led by Chief Executive Officer Stephen Elop,
unveiled plans today to make Microsoft&#8217;s Windows its primary
software in the competition for smartphone customers against
Apple&#8217;s iOS and Google&#8217;s Android platforms. Nokia&#8217;s shares fell
14 percent, the steepest slide since July 16, 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My first thought is to sell Nokia stock because Nokia has
just given themselves away for free and Google and Apple are
laughing all the way to a duopoly,&#8221; said Neil Campling, an
analyst at Aviate Global LLP in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move may be the biggest strategy shift by Nokia since
the one-time wood pulp company began making mobile phones in the
1980s. Elop, who was hired from Microsoft in September to lead
the Espoo, Finland-based company, is struggling to revive Nokia
after its piece of the fast-growing smartphone market plunged to
27.1 percent in the last quarter from 50.8 percent when Apple
shipped its iPhone in June 2007, according to Gartner Inc. Nokia
has lost more than 60 percent of its market value in that time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia&#8217;s shares fell 1.16 euros, closing in Helsinki at 7
euros. Microsoft slipped 25 cents to $27.25 at 4 p.m. New York
time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When you are facing a fire, you need to move quickly
because it expands fast,&#8221; said Pierre Ferragu, an analyst with
Sanford C. Bernstein in London. &#8220;This partnership will take time
to implement and deliver phones. This is what may kill Nokia.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partnership Plan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, whose Windows Mobile software licenses were
doubling annually before the iPhone hit the market, has likewise
struggled to win acceptance for its revamped Windows Phone 7
software. The Redmond, Washington-based software maker said it
shipped more than 2 million licenses for the new smartphone
system in its first quarter on the market. Nokia shipped 28.3
million smartphones in that period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal gives Microsoft access to one of the world&#8217;s
largest mobile-phone distribution networks. Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said at a press conference in London that companies are
already working on making the first Nokia Windows phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the plan unveiled today, Nokia and Microsoft will
combine assets and jointly develop and market mobile products.
Nokia&#8217;s Maps product will become a core part of Microsoft&#8217;s
services, while Microsoft&#8217;s development tools will create
applications for Nokia Windows phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question Mark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nokia and Microsoft will combine our strengths to deliver
an ecosystem with unrivalled global reach and scale,&#8221; Elop said
at the press conference. &#8220;It&#8217;s now a three-horse race.&#8221; Nokia
has no plans to merge with Microsoft, Elop said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Finnish company said that after the &#8220;transition
years&#8221; of 2011 and 2012, it targets Devices  Services non-IFRS
operating margin of 10 percent or more. Elop declined to provide
a timeline for the first products from the alliance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a clear admission that Nokia&#8217;s own platform strategy
has faltered,&#8221; said Ben Wood, a London-based analyst with CCS
Insight. &#8220;Microsoft is the big winner in this deal, but there
are no silver bullets for either company given strength of
iPhone and Android.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia plans to ship another 150 million phones based on its
current smartphone operating system called Symbian. It will ship
Windows phones in large volumes in 2012, Elop said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Job Cuts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia plans to &#8220;substantially reduce&#8221; it research and
development budget, Elop said. At 5.9 billion euros ($8.1
billion), Nokia&#8217;s corporate RD spending is more than four times
that of Apple&#8217;s. Elop said there will be &#8220;significant
reductions&#8221; in Nokia jobs. He didn&#8217;t elaborate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of Nokia workers walked out in Tampere, Finland,
where about half the about 3,000 employees are Symbian
developers -- the platform Nokia is phasing out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A lot of workers decided to use flexible working hours and
go home to think about what these changes bring,&#8221; said Kalle
Kiili, a union representative at the unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elop, 47, was hired to put Nokia on a comeback plan,
especially for software, the biggest point of difference in
smartphones. He made only small adjustments in his first months
as he reviewed the business. He announced 1,800 job cuts in the
workforce of more than 120,000, changed the development process
for the Symbian smartphone code, and appointed a new marketing
chief, Jerri DeVard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia today said it will have two units: Smart Devices and
Mobile Phones. It named Jo Harlow to head the Smart Devices
unit, while the other will be led by Mary McDowell. In North
America, a weak spot for Nokia, it appointed Chris Weber, a 16-
year Microsoft veteran, as president of its U.S. unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Burning Platform&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Elop became the first non-Finn to head Nokia on Sept.
21, Google&#8217;s Android software has become the biggest smartphone
operating system, passing Nokia&#8217;s Symbian, according to Canalys
and IDC analysis of shipments. The company&#8217;s N8 smartphone with
the revamped Symbian 3 operating system was greeted by analysts
as an improvement, although not enough to reverse the slide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A memo written by Elop to employees recently said Nokia was
&#8220;standing on a burning platform&#8221; and needed to make
significant changes. With the plan unveiled today, Elop is
terminating the company&#8217;s main Symbian platform, a move that
make torpedo sales of existing devices, analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Elop has decided to run the risk of really triggering a
collapse of Symbian phone sales over the next three quarters,&#8221;
said Tero Kuittinen, an analyst with MKM Partners LLC in
Greenwich, Connecticut. &#8220;This is what jumping into the icy sea
looks like; embracing a mobile OS with 3 percent smartphone
market share. I expected a move to Windows, but not one with
this level of religious fervor.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android Option &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia will bring out a device this year on MeeGo, a high-
end operating system it&#8217;s developing with Intel Corp., to gauge
market reaction, Elop said. MeeGo engineers will then be shifted
to work on innovations that can help Nokia leapfrog rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and Standard  Poor&#8217;s put
the company&#8217;s debt on review for a downgrade after fourth-
quarter net income fell 21 percent and it signaled margin
pressure. The ratings companies said the results showed a loss
of competitiveness in the crowded smartphone marketplace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android, which is supported by mobile manufacturers
including Samsung Electronics Co., HTC Corp. and Sony Ericsson
Mobile Communications AB, offers users a slick interface similar
to the iPhone for a lower cost of ownership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elop said while he did explore the Android option,
differentiation would have been difficult. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Biggest Question Mark&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android phones typically have more flexibility in data
plans than the iPhone, and make it easy to use virtual calling
programs like Skype that reduce monthly bills. The system has
proven popular with app developers who have built its Android
Market up to more than 100,000 download items. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Chief Executive Officer Eric Schmidt said last month
that his company is activating more than 300,000 phones a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia started as a wood pulp mill in 1865 and expanded in
papermaking, rubber, cables, and telephone equipment before
helping develop the world&#8217;s current cellular phone systems in
the 1980s. It passed Motorola Corp. to become the world&#8217;s
largest maker of mobile phones in 1999, and was Europe&#8217;s most
valuable company at 203 billion euros in December 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The biggest question mark here is the timetable,&#8221; said Michael Schroeder, an analyst at FIM Bank in Helsinki. &#8220;Nokia
says 2011 and 2012 are transition years, and no one knows how
far along Nokia&#8217;s competitors are by then. Nokia can&#8217;t do
anything to slow its competitors from innovating.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
largest U.S. bank by assets, named Chief Administrative Officer
Frank Bisignano to oversee mortgage lending as home-loan losses
erode the company&#8217;s earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon and Charlie Scharf, the
CEO of Retail Financial Services, told employees in an e-mail
today that David Lowman, the unit&#8217;s CEO who joined JPMorgan from Citigroup Inc. in 2006, will report to Bisignano, effective
immediately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As you know, our home lending business has gone through a
period of enormous challenge and change,&#8221; the e-mail said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bisignano takes over the unit as it struggles with the
worst housing decline since the Great Depression and soured
mortgage investments inherited from the 2008 acquisitions of
Washington Mutual Inc. and Bear Stearns Cos. Bank of America
Corp., the biggest U.S. lender, split its mortgage unit this
month and put Terry Laughlin in charge of cleaning up bad loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bisignano, 51, retains most of his administrative
responsibilities, including overseeing technology, real estate,
procurement and security. He joined JPMorgan in 2005 from
Citigroup where he headed its global transactions services
business and was a member of Citigroup&#8217;s management committee.
The Brooklyn native serves on the boards or is a trustee of New
York-based nonprofit groups including The National September 11
Memorial  Museum and St. Patrick&#8217;s Cathedral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Bisignano received 115,164 shares of restricted
stock worth $5 million and 76,924 stock options for his
performance last year, according to securities filings. His full
compensation wasn&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama&#8217;s consistent
pledge to &#8220;end tax breaks for companies that ship jobs
overseas&#8221; disappeared from his stump speech after Republicans
won the House of Representatives in November and he began
talking with executives about a corporate tax code overhaul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, tax lobbyists are watching Obama&#8217;s next budget, set to
be released Feb. 14, to see if it reflects that shift by scaling
back proposals that restrict companies&#8217; ability to defer taxes
on overseas profits. Those ideas from previous Obama budgets
have drawn criticism from such companies as Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dropping the limits, projected to raise $122 billion over
10 years, would move Obama&#8217;s position closer to those espoused
by business groups and would demonstrate an interest in
rewriting tax laws, said Martin Sullivan, an economist at Tax
Analysts in Falls Church, Virginia, who testified before
Congress last month on the corporate tax code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The deletion of international revenue raisers from the
next budget would signal a major turning point in international
tax policy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Business no longer would have to play
defense against possible tax increases.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The administration won&#8217;t discuss details of the budget
before its release, said Treasury Department spokeswoman Sandra
Salstrom. Jacob Lew, the president&#8217;s budget director, signaled
on Feb. 8 that a corporate tax overhaul will not be detailed in
the budget plan. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner also said
on Feb. 9 that the budget won&#8217;t include a one-time
&#8220;repatriation&#8221; provision that would let businesses bring
overseas profits back to the U.S. at a reduced tax rate. &lt;/p&gt;

steer through the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As a result of the big imbalances we have already lived

&lt;p&gt;John C. Whitehead isn&#8217;t celebrating
the 219-year-old New York Stock Exchange&#8217;s plan to be acquired
by Germany&#8217;s 18-year-old Deutsche Boerse AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a terrible idea and I hope it can be
stopped,&#8221; Whitehead, the 88-year-old former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said in an interview yesterday. &#8220;It
would be an insult to New York City, and New York State, and
indeed to all America.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The erstwhile U.S. deputy secretary of state, NYSE director
and Lower Manhattan Development Corp. chairman said his
experience gives him the credibility to speak out against the
potential takeover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I speak out rarely, and this is one time when I can&#8217;t
hold myself back,&#8221; he said, adding that the exchange is an
&#8220;important symbol&#8221; of American capitalism and of New York
City&#8217;s status as a global financial center. &#8220;I think of it as a
holy institution,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitehead, whose autobiography &#8220;A Life in Leadership&#8221;
chronicles his command of a landing craft at Omaha Beach on D-
Day, said his opposition has nothing to do with his World War II
experiences. &#8220;I&#8217;d be anti- any other country buying the New
York Stock Exchange,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not that it&#8217;s German.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitehead, who joined Goldman Sachs in 1947, said he
remembers visiting the exchange in his early days at the firm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea that banks slowed lending
during the U.S. recession is a &#8220;huge misconception,&#8221; JPMorgan
Chase  Co. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any lending slowdown was a result of reduced demand for
capital from businesses and consumers, Dimon said in a Jan. 27
interview broadcast today on CNN&#8217;s &#8220;Fareed Zakaria GPS.&#8221; Dimon
said his bank loaned $1.4 trillion to corporations and
individuals worldwide in 2010, &#8220;up pretty substantially&#8221; from
2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are lending aggressively to corporate, to middle
market,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you talk to most economists, there is a
demand issue. A lot of people don&#8217;t need the money.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon said the banking industry in the U.S. is &#8220;far less
concentrated&#8221; than in Europe or Asia, and that JPMorgan could
fail without putting the nation&#8217;s financial system at risk. The
nation should create a process Dimon called &#8220;minimally damaging
bankruptcy for big, dumb banks&#8221; to unwind troubled institutions
such as Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon defended his bank&#8217;s lobbying against President Barack Obama&#8217;s financial regulation overhaul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We fought the parts of the reform we thought were
irrational,&#8221; he said. JPMorgan supports &#8220;oversight
committees&#8221; for the financial system, clearing houses for
trading in derivatives, and &#8220;better consumer protection,&#8221; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Nokia Oyj Chief Executive Stephen Elop tried yesterday in Barcelona to defend his decision to join
forces with Microsoft Corp., a move that&#8217;s wiped 5.7 billion
euros ($7.7 billion) off the company&#8217;s market value in two days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making a surprise appearance during a presentation by
Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer at the Mobile World Congress, Elop
sought to portray the challenge of winning back ground lost by
the Finnish company to Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPhone and handsets based on Google Inc.&#8217;s Android software as &#8220;a war of ecosystems.&#8221; Elop
announced on Feb. 11 that Nokia would make Windows Phone 7 its
primary mobile-phone platform, replacing its home-grown Symbian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elop&#8217;s claim on the previous day that the company will get
&#8220;billions &#8221; in benefits from its partnership with Microsoft did
little to stem the slide in Nokia&#8217;s stock. He and Ballmer
yesterday tried to show they would be the &#8220;the most operator-
friendly&#8221; choice. Analysts remain skeptical. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The decision to transition its smartphone portfolio to
Microsoft Windows Phone is a risky one for Nokia,&#8221; said Alex
Spektor, an analyst at Strategy Analytics Inc. &#8220;As Nokia
transitions its smartphone portfolio to an entirely different
platform, there is a risk that previously loyal Nokia consumers
might abandon the vendor, hurting Nokia&#8217;s previously colossal
smartphone volumes in the long term.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia&#8217;s shares, which fell 14 percent on Feb. 11, tumbled
5.3 percent in Helsinki yesterday, closing at 6.63 euros, the
lowest level in seven months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Device &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delivery of &#8220;even a single Windows Phone 7 device&#8221; in
time for the Christmas shopping season will be difficult for
Nokia, JPMorgan Chase  Co. analyst Rod Hall wrote in a report.
&#8220;For a substantial change like this, it&#8217;s imperative that the
first device is declared a success in the marketplace.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elop promised to listen to mobile operators&#8217; concern about
the growing dominance of Apple and Google mobile platforms.
Mobile operators&#8217; discontent with Google and Apple, whose
software accounted for about 53 percent of smartphone sales
worldwide last year, is rising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;France Telecom SA, Telecom Italia SpA, and Telefonica SA
executives have complained that traffic generated by the U.S.
companies is overwhelming their networks, and are looking for
ways to increase revenue with their own applications. Creating
&#8220;the best place for operators to add value&#8221; will be a priority
for the Microsoft-Nokia alliance, Ballmer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Non-Event&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Elop, a former Microsoft executive, took over as CEO
in September, Google&#8217;s Android software has passed Nokia&#8217;s
Symbian as the most popular smartphone operating system,
according to analysis of shipments by research firm IDC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Microsoft software offers many features, selling
the phone frequently means overcoming initial consumer
skepticism, Telstra Corp. Ltd. CEO David Thodey said in an
interview in Barcelona. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows Phone 7 devices have accounted for about 7 to 8
percent of new sales at Australia&#8217;s largest phone company since
they were introduced late last year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows Phone also lags far behind Apple and Google&#8217;s
respective operating systems in the number of mobile
applications available, limiting its exposure to what Booz  Co.
estimates will be a $40 billion market by 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 8,000 apps are currently available for Windows Phone
7, which began sales late last year, Ballmer said yesterday. By
comparison, about 130,000 apps are available for Android and
more than 300,000 for Apple&#8217;s iOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other device-makers, who apart from Apple are
overwhelmingly choosing Google&#8217;s Android for new devices, are
downplaying the significance of the Nokia-Microsoft deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alliance is &#8220;almost a non-event&#8221; for Motorola
Mobility Inc., which is unveiling new devices based on Android,
senior vice-president Alain Mutricy said in an interview. &#8220;It
sends a very strong signal to the market that Nokia doesn&#8217;t
expect to have very competitive products in the short term.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &#8220;Jeopardy!&#8221; champion, more
than any other, helped International Business Machines Corp.
develop a computer capable of playing the television quiz show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is Ken Jennings? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As IBM&#8217;s &#8220;Watson,&#8221; named after company founder Thomas J. Watson, begins a man versus machine battle on Jeopardy tonight,
the computer will square off against the player whose track
record played a central role in shaping it. IBM scientists mined
troves of data from past winners to develop the computer&#8217;s
capabilities, and Jennings, as winner of a record 74 games in
2004, generated more statistics than any other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I felt like I had a target painted on me,&#8221; the 36-year-
old said in a phone interview last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennings and Brad Rutter, another former champion, face
Watson in a three-day competition that runs through Feb. 16,
with a $1 million first-place prize on the line. The shows will
be broadcast from IBM&#8217;s lab in Yorktown Heights, New York, and
air during the regular &#8220;Jeopardy&#8221; time slot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM built Watson, after creating the computer that defeated
champion Gary Kasparov in chess, to tackle another challenge:
make a machine that could understand natural human language, as
opposed to the keyword searches used in the search engines of Google Inc. or Microsoft Corp. IBM wanted the effort to have
real-world applications. &#8220;Jeopardy,&#8221; with its word plays,
innuendos and penalties for inaccuracy, proved a good test. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Dave Ferrucci, IBM&#8217;s lead scientist on the project, and
his team developed Watson, they used Jennings&#8217;s data to create
the &#8220;Jennings Arc,&#8221; according to Stephen Baker, who has
written a book about Watson. The measure tracked how often
Jennings was first to hit the buzzer to answer questions and how
often he answered correctly, Baker said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennings&#8217;s Precision &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Jennings represented the statistical performance of a
&#8216;Jeopardy&#8217; superstar,&#8221; Baker, whose book is &#8220;Final Jeopardy:
Man vs. Machine and the Quest to Know Everything,&#8221; said in an
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennings, a computer science major at Brigham Young
University and former computer programmer, was skeptical at
first that IBM could make a computer to play &#8220;Jeopardy.&#8221; That
changed when he saw tapes of Watson &#8220;demolishing&#8221; championship
level players, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While having Watson compete was one thing for Ferrucci and
his team, playing at Jennings&#8217;s level represented the highest
standard for &#8220;Jeopardy.&#8221; In his stretch of games, Jennings
answered questions correctly about 92 percent of the time and
was first to the buzzer more than half the time, Baker wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Corp. will release the
first Windows Phone 7 update in early March, Chief Executive
Officer Steve Ballmer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operating system, which got a boost last week after Nokia Oyj said the platform would be its primary mobile-phone
software, will get features this year such as Internet Explorer
9, Twitter and multitasking capabilities, Ballmer said today at
the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Increasingly, consumers, developers and mobile operators
won&#8217;t just choose a phone, they&#8217;re really choosing a platform,&#8221;
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is pulling out all the stops to reverse market
share declines in its mobile-phone software as smartphone sales
are estimated by analysts to pass personal computers in the next
two years. The deal with Nokia, the world&#8217;s biggest maker of
handsets, is a bet the two companies together can challenge Apple Inc. and Google Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia Chief Executive Officer Stephen Elop, a former
president of Microsoft&#8217;s business unit, said his company will
get &#8220;billions&#8221; in benefits from the partnership. Andy Lees,
president of Microsoft&#8217;s mobile division, declined to tell
analysts exactly how much Microsoft will pay. The agreement
involves the transfer of revenue from search, advertising,
geographic-location services and royalty payments, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft released a complete overhaul to its mobile
operating system last year. Called Windows Phone 7, 2 million
copies of the program were shipped in its first quarter on the
market, a number analysts termed disappointing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brand Awareness &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said last month that customer satisfaction for
the product is at 93 percent and brand awareness jumped 22
points to 66 percent since the release. The Redmond, Washington-
based company is now trying to add features and get the product
in the hands of as many customers as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s share of the smartphone operating-system market
declined to 2.8 percent in the third quarter, from 7.9 percent a
year earlier, according to Gartner Inc. The share of Google&#8217;s
Android platform rose to 25.5 percent from 3.5 percent, while
Apple&#8217;s iOS share declined to 16.7 percent from 17.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phones with the new Microsoft software went on sale Oct. 21
in Europe and Nov. 8 in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jana Partners LLC bought gold worth
$122.3 million last quarter, joining hedge funds including John
Paulson&#8217;s Paulson  Co. in betting the metal will continue to
gain in value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jana, which is based in New York, acquired 881,844 shares
in the SPDR Gold Trust fund, making it the hedge fund&#8217;s third-
biggest U.S.-listed holding, according to a regulatory filing
today with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Jana also
bought a $130.1 million stake in Detroit-based General Motors
Co., its second-largest position by market value, and a $109.6
million stake in San Francisco-based Visa Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s filing shows Jana sold its stakes in Microsoft
Corp., the world&#8217;s largest software company, RadioShack Corp.
and Hertz Global Holdings Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC requires money managers who oversee more than $100
million in U.S. equities to report their holdings on a Form 13F
within 45 days of the end of each quarter. The filing must
include all holdings in stocks that trade on U.S. exchanges, as
well as options and convertible debt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Egypt&#8217;s transitional government
should exploit its &#8220;Internet savvy&#8221; youth who helped spearhead
the country&#8217;s popular revolution to foster economic and social
reforms, the head of Microsoft Corp. Egypt said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The past couple of weeks showed the power&#8221; of
information and communications technologies, Ayman Abdellatif,
general manager for Microsoft Egypt, said in an interview today.
&#8220;We need to ask how we can leverage ICT to create dialogue
between the government and the people.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pro-democracy groups used social networking sites such as
Facebook and Twitter to help mobilize mass protests, leading to
the toppling of Hosni Mubarak, Egypt&#8217;s president of 30 years, on
Feb. 11. The government had blocked Internet service for almost
a week and mobile-phone services run by local units of Vodafone
Group Plc and France Telecom SA were also temporarily halted in
the early days of the revolt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You have a huge portion of the population that is
Internet savvy,&#8221; said Abdellatif. &#8220;That&#8217;s a powerful force.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abdellatif said there is potential for job creation by
making many government services, including elections, available
online. Egypt plans to enact a &#8220;massive and realistic&#8221;
employment program that will aim to create as many as 700,000
jobs a year, Finance Minister Samir Radwan said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mubarak-appointed government, now running the country
under military oversight pending elections, is forecasting
slower growth and promising a stimulus plan to address the
economic complaints of the demonstrators, such as high
unemployment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowdown &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Egypt doesn&#8217;t expect any layoffs as a result of
the economic slowdown, Abdellatif said. The company employs 250
people at its office in Smart Village, a park outside of Cairo
that&#8217;s dedicated to ICT industries. He expects revenue to take a
hit in the first and second quarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have been negatively impacted as far as revenue goes
in Q1 and we expect to be negatively impacted in Q2,&#8221; he said,
saying the situation is too unclear to provide specific figures.
&#8220;It will take some time for the economy to pick up. It won&#8217;t be
overnight.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bovespa&#8217;s 9.9 percent drop from
a November high is likely a &#8220;correction&#8221; and not a &#8220;crash&#8221;
as Brazilian earnings are growing and flows from emerging to
developed markets have eased, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Brazil&#8217;s benchmark stock index returned an average of 33
percent in a year after declines of 10 percent, said Ben Laidler, head of Latin American strategy at JPMorgan in New
York. Considering 16 slides of at least 10 percent over the past
17 years, the Bovespa still may decline another 9 percent before
rebounding, Laidler wrote in a note to clients today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial and consumer-discretionary shares are &#8220;already
oversold,&#8221; he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Valentine&#8217;s Day, celebrated by
lovers worldwide with candy, flowers and amateur poetry, also is
the biggest time of year for new prescriptions of erection
drugs, led by Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s Viagra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CHART OF THE DAY shows weekly new prescriptions of the
two top-selling impotence drugs, Viagra and Eli Lilly  Co.&#8217;s
Cialis, jump to yearly highs in the days leading to the Feb. 14
holiday. The blue line shows Viagra; the green line Cialis. The
red circles point to prescriptions in the week before
Valentine&#8217;s Day. The data are reported by retail pharmacies in
the U.S. and compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erectile dysfunction affects as many as 30 million men in
the U.S., according to the National Institutes of Health in
Bethesda, Maryland. Stress, guilt and fear of failure can
exacerbate the disorder, especially around the holiday when men
feel their love is being tested, said Gail Wyatt, a certified
sex therapist and psychology professor at the University of
California, Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s almost like: &#8216;This is Valentine&#8217;s Day, so I must
have sex,&#8217;&#8221; Wyatt said in a telephone interview. &#8220;All of this
is media and marketing promoted, and I think we need to get back
to what&#8217;s really important in life, and that&#8217;s really just being
with people we care about.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prescriptions of Viagra, first approved in 1998, declined
in recent years as increasing numbers of patients chose Cialis,
which came to market in 2003. Viagra had $1.9 billion in sales
last year for New York-based Pfizer, compared with $1.7 billion
for Indianapolis-based Lilly&#8217;s Cialis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; BHP Billiton Ltd., Australia&#8217;s
biggest oil and gas producer, said the Turrum and Kipper gas
venture off the southeast coast remains &#8220;immensely valuable,&#8221;
even after the company&#8217;s share of the estimated costs doubled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BHP expects its spending on Turrum and Kipper, operated by Exxon Mobil Corp., to rise to $2.3 billion, the Melbourne-based
company said in January. The companies attributed the increased
budget to rising labor costs, design changes and mercury found
in the reservoir during the Kipper drilling in the Bass Strait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fact that we are proceeding with this supplemental
investment means we believe this is still a value-creating
project for us,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer Marius Kloppers said
on a call with reporters after the company&#8217;s petroleum division
reported a 23 percent increase in underlying profit before
interest and tax, or EBIT, in the six months through Dec. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising labor and raw material expenses are part of
&#8220;industry-wide cost pressures,&#8221; BHP said today. Australian
resources companies face a potential labor shortage that
threatens to drive wages higher as more projects compete for
workers, Energy Minister Martin Ferguson said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BHP fell 1.9 percent to A$46.44 at 1:40 p.m. Sydney time,
compared with a drop of 0.1 percent for the benchmark SP/ASX
200 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising Oil Prices &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BHP&#8217;s petroleum unit plans to drill exploration wells in Malaysia, Brunei, Colombia and Australia during the next six
months while a &#8220;degree of uncertainty is associated with the
new regulatory environment&#8221; after the BP Plc oil spill in the
U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the company said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No production permits were issued in the Gulf of Mexico in
the second half of last year, BHP said. The deferral of drilling
&#8220;was a major constraint on our business&#8221; and the resulting
decline in volumes cut underlying EBIT by $464 million, BHP
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, first-half underlying profit before interest and
tax for the oil and gas division climbed to $2.85 billion from
$2.33 billion, bolstered by a 13 percent increase in oil prices
and a 6 percent gain for gas, BHP said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy contributed more than a fifth of BHP&#8217;s earnings
before interest and tax of $14.8 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil and gas production in the six months was in line with a
year earlier as a cost of delays in the Gulf and flooding in
Pakistan offset gains from the Pyrenees project off Australia,
BHP said. Production for the year ending in June is expected to
be in line with the 2010 financial year, BHP reiterated today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is shutting
down its Global Macro Proprietary Trading desk to comply with
the Dodd-Frank law&#8217;s Volcker rule, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing an unidentified person familiar with the
matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Dawn Kopecki" date="Feb 15, 2011  2:56 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-15/jpmorgan-posts-perfect-trading-record-for-three-quarters-of-2010.html"><headline>JPMorgan Established a Perfect Trading Record for Three Quarters of 2010</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase  Co. racked up a
perfect trading record for the second half of last year, making
money every day after accomplishing the same feat in the first
three months of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traders at the New York-based bank made an average of
$76 million a day last year, down from $84 million in 2009,
according to an investor presentation today at the bank&#8217;s New
York headquarters. The investment bank lost money on eight days
last year, all in the second quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t expect that to be repeated,&#8221; said Jes Staley,
chief executive officer of the investment bank. &#8220;I imagine I&#8217;ll
be up here next year and you&#8217;ll see a number higher than eight,
but I think it underscores how well we&#8217;ve been managing our
business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By comparison, JPMorgan had 42 days of losses in 2009, 97
in 2008, 46 in 2007, 33 in 2006 and 52 in 2005, according to the
presentation. JPMorgan&#8217;s average daily trading revenue was
$21 million in 2008, $39 million in 2007, $47 million in 2006
and $37 million in 2005, according to the data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks have relied on trading profit to make up for weak
earnings or losses tied to consumer banking. Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America Corp., which hasn&#8217;t reported its
fourth-quarter trading results yet, also posted perfect trading
records in the first and third quarters. Traders at Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. also made money every single
day in the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Role &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The perfect trading results are rare and were primarily
driven by the Federal Reserve&#8217;s programs buying mortgage bonds
and U.S. Treasury securities. That&#8217;s driven trading volumes
higher, boosted asset values and provided backup liquidity in
the markets, analysts say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It gives traders a buyer of last resort and confidence
that they have an outlet if some goes wrong,&#8221; said Paul Miller,
a former examiner for the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia
and analyst at FBR Capital Markets in Arlington, Virginia. He
said the strategy keeps bears on the sidelines in the fixed-
income markets. The results are &#8220;driven by the Fed, not really
any expertise of any trading desk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Chevron Corp. said it shut pipelines
at its Henry Hub gas separation station in Texas as a precaution
during a grass fire in the area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas interconnects were &#8220;down for just a little while&#8221; and
restarted after the fire was out, Mickey Driver, a spokesman for
the company, said in an e-mail. The cause of the blaze is under
investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fire did not impact or threaten any CPL equipment and
was extinguished by the Henry Volunteer Fire Department&#8221; at
4:30 p.m. local time yesterday, Driver said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Nokia Oyj executives put only the Microsoft Corp. option for vote at a board meeting on Feb. 10
after having studied three plans, Executive Vice President Mary McDowell said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We had presented three scenarios: continue with the
current plan of record, a Google option and a Microsoft option
but the recommendation that we made to them was the Microsoft
option so that&#8217;s what they approved,&#8221; she said. The executives
first went to the board in November with the options, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Stephen Elop announced on Feb. 11
that Nokia would make Windows Phone 7 its primary mobile-phone
platform, replacing its home-grown Symbian. Since then, Nokia&#8217;s
shares have tumbled 18 percent, wiping out about 5.5 billion
euros ($7.4 billion) off the Finnish company&#8217;s market value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors and analysts remain skeptical that adopting the
Windows Phone 7 platform is going to help Nokia claw back ground
lost to Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPhone and handsets based on Google Inc.&#8217;s
Android software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The decision to transition its smartphone portfolio to
Microsoft Windows Phone is a risky one for Nokia,&#8221; said Alex
Spektor, an analyst at Strategy Analytics Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in an open letter, a group of &#8220;nine young Nokia
shareholders,&#8221; who said they&#8217;d all worked for the company in
the past, said they plan to challenge Elop&#8217;s strategy and
partnership with Microsoft at the next shareholders&#8217; meeting,
slated for May 3. The unidentified shareholders didn&#8217;t respond
to an e-mail sent to them seeking additional comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plan B &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter, entitled &#8220;Nokia Plan B&#8221; said that its authors
would seek Elop&#8217;s ouster, would maintain &#8220;ownership and
control&#8221; of Nokia&#8217;s software and restructure the Microsoft
alliance to focus primarily on the North American market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia spokesman Doug Dawson said the company will stay on
track with its new strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are aware of the anonymous letter, but have not been
directly contacted,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Nokia&#8217;s new strategy has the
full approval of the board of directors and the Nokia leadership
team, and our focus right now is on executing this new
strategy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia&#8217;s McDowell said the company will go forward with the
strategy of using Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Phone 7 as its main
smartphone platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve announced what our strategy is, it was made with a
great deal of thorough analysis so this is our plan,&#8221; McDowell,
who is in charge of the Espoo, Finland-based company&#8217;s low-end
mobile phones, said at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McDowell said there will be more Symbian phones this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Symbian&#8217;s not going to go zero,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We had
growth in Symbian in places like Russia and China and we will
have more attractive products hitting the market this year.
We&#8217;ve got a whole roadmap of new Symbian devices that we&#8217;ll be
bringing to market in 2011.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerging-market stocks fell for the
first day in three after JPMorgan Chase  Co. reduced its
outlook for equity gains and as protests in Bahrain escalated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Emerging Markets Index slipped 0.1 percent to
1,104.09 at 10:54 a.m. in New York. Chinese banks declined after
a measure of inflation quickened to the fastest in at least six
years. Bahrain&#8217;s dollar bonds sank, sending yields to a record
high, after anti-government protests escalated. BMFBovespa SA,
the operator of Latin America&#8217;s largest exchange, declined on
concern it will face stronger competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan strategists led by Adrian Mowat in Hong Kong cut
their year-end target for the MSCI index to 1,300 from 1,500 on
expectations that accelerating inflation in developing nations
will spur tighter monetary policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Developed markets are becoming more attractive on concern
that rising inflation and interest rates could hurt growth in
emerging nations,&#8221; said Jonathan Ravelas, strategist at Banco
de Oro Unibank in Manila. &#8220;Portfolios are getting rebalanced in
favor of developed markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI emerging-market index has dropped 4.1 percent this
year as central banks in China, Brazil and India raised
benchmark interest rates to curb inflation spurred by record
food prices. The MSCI World index has gained 5 percent in 2011
as the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank keep
borrowing costs at record lows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Middle East Protests &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bahrain&#8217;s dollar bonds due 2020 fell for a fifth day,
sending yields up five basis points to 6.13 percent, the highest
level since the debt was issued in March, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protests against the government escalated today as a second
demonstrator was reportedly killed and police used tear gas to
break up the funeral march of an opposition supporter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popular demands for democracy and civil rights, following
mass protests that toppled Egypt&#8217;s Hosni Mubarak, are rattling
rulers of a region that holds about three-fifths of the world&#8217;s
oil reserves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrial  Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the world&#8217;s
largest lender by market value, sank 0.7 percent. Consumer
prices rose 4.9 percent last month from a year earlier, as
prices excluding food surged the most in at least six years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil rallied above $85 a barrel in New York on concern civil
unrest in the Middle East may disrupt supplies. Rosneft,
Russia&#8217;s biggest oil company, climbed 1.2 percent. Petroleo
Brasileiro SA, Brazil&#8217;s state-controlled oil company, rose 1.2
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lira Strengthens &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to own emerging-market
debt over U.S. Treasuries widened one basis point to 266,
according to JPMorgan&#8217;s EMBI+ Index. The Markit iTraxx SOVX
CEEMEA Index of credit-default swaps for emerging Europe, the
Middle East and Africa was little changed at 207, according to
data provider CMA in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkey&#8217;s lira strengthened 0.1 percent against the dollar,
erasing earlier losses, while government bonds rallied and the
ISE National 100 Index of shares rose 0.4 percent after the
central bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged,
following two months of cuts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank in Ankara kept its one-week repo lending rate at a
record low of 6.25 percent, according to an e-mailed statement
today. Six of seven economists surveyed by Bloomberg this week
had predicted no change. Governor Durmus Yilmaz unexpectedly
lowered the rate in December and January, seeking to deter
short-term capital inflows and weaken the lira. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bovespa stock index fluctuated, following three days of
gains, and was little changed. Natura Cosmeticos SA, Brazil&#8217;s
biggest cosmetics maker, led gains for companies that benefit

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s municipal
bond holdings are diversified enough to handle a likely increase
in defaults, according to the firm&#8217;s head of commercial banking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are not worried about our portfolio, despite what I do
think is going to be an increase on a national basis on
defaults,&#8221; said Todd Maclin, chief executive officer of
JPMorgan&#8217;s commercial bank, during a presentation today for
investors in the New York-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the audience was Meredith Whitney, the independent
analyst who stirred controversy by predicting municipal defaults
will total hundreds of billions of dollars. Maclin presented
data on how JPMorgan&#8217;s $9.7 billion municipal portfolio is split
up to allay investor concern. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 26 percent is concentrated in local government bonds,
22 percent is invested in primary and secondary education,
14 percent is in state governments and the rest is split among
higher education, utilities, airports and other investments,
according to Maclin&#8217;s presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I put this chart together for you, girlfriend,&#8221; he told
Whitney, drawing laughter from the audience and the analyst. She
declined to comment in an interview. JPMorgan ranks second by
assets among U.S. lenders after Bank of America Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitney, a banking analyst and chief executive officer of
Meredith Whitney Advisory Group, predicted on Dec. 19 during
CBS Corp.&#8217;s &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; that states&#8217; fiscal stress would
spark 50 to 100 sizable defaults. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her analysis drew criticism from investors and state
officials. California Treasurer Bill Lockyer called the
prediction &#8220;apocalyptic arm-waving.&#8221; The National League of
Cities&#8217; research director cited her &#8220;stunning lack of
understanding.&#8221; William H. Gross, who runs the world&#8217;s
biggest bond fund at Pacific Investment Management Co., said he
doesn&#8217;t subscribe to her theory. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Centrica Plc, the U.K.&#8217;s biggest
energy supplier, is unlikely to be referred to Britain&#8217;s Competition Commission following a review of price increases,
JPMorgan Chase  Co. analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will report 2010 earnings per share around 25.6
pence, a 17 percent increase from 2009, JPMorgan analyst Edmund Reid and Ihor Okhrimenko said in a note to investors today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy regulator Ofgem announced plans in November to
investigate Britain&#8217;s energy retail market to ensure customers
are being fairly charged. Margins on an average dual-tariff
energy bill jumped by about 25 pounds to 90 pounds following
price increases in September, Ofgem said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Ofgem investigation seems to have created a &#8216;Catch
22&#8217; in some investors&#8217; minds,&#8221; the analysts said today. &#8220;The
better Centrica&#8217;s financial performance the greater likelihood
of political intervention.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a company is found to be violating the Competition Act,
Ofgem has the power to impose financial penalties of up to 10
percent of sales. The regulator plans to finish its review of
the market by the end of next month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Atlas Energy Inc. shareholders
approved Chevron Corp.&#8217;s $3.58 billion takeover bid, clearing
the way for the oil company&#8217;s first U.S. shale-gas purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost 100 percent of shareholder votes were cast in favor
of the takeover, which is expected to close &#8220;promptly,&#8221;
according to a statement today from Atlas. The company, based in
Moon Township, Pennsylvania, is one of the largest leaseholders
in the Marcellus Shale gas field, controlling 622,000 acres. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction &#8220;will most likely close tomorrow night,&#8221;
Scott Hanold, an Austin, Texas-based analyst with RBC Capital
Markets, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major U.S. oil companies have been acquiring holdings in
the Marcellus and other North America shale formations to
increase their access to onshore oil and gas production. Exxon
Mobil Corp. last year bought XTO Energy Inc., which owned
acreage in the Barnett Shale in Texas and Louisiana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shale-rock formations require injection of water, sand and
chemicals to release gas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s cash-and-stock bid valued the company at $43.34 a
share when it was announced Nov. 9, a 37 percent premium to the
previous day&#8217;s closing price. Based on current prices, the offer
is worth $45.48 a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Reliance Industries Ltd., which has a joint venture to
drill in the Marcellus Shale with Atlas, said in a Jan. 10
letter to Atlas&#8217;s board that it should&#8217;ve been given a chance to
make an offer. A spokesperson in the Houston office of Mumbai-
based Reliance didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a voice mail
seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pipeline Subsidiary &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the agreement with Chevron, Atlas will sell
certain gas reserves and assets to its pipeline subsidiary,
Atlas Pipelines Holdings LP, and acquire the subsidiary&#8217;s
interest in another pipeline partnership, Laurel Mountain
Midstream LLC. Atlas Energy didn&#8217;t immediately return a phone
call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, agreed on Feb. 7
to pay an additional 10 cents a share to settle a shareholder
lawsuit that alleged the bid was too low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atlas rose 73 cents to $45.84 at 4:54 p.m. on the Nasdaq
Stock Market. Chevron rose 32 cents to $96.66 in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s Windows Phone 7
operating system has lured an increasing number of application
developers since the software maker announced a partnership with Nokia Oyj last week, according to analytics firm Flurry Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the four days after the Feb. 11 deal, 4 percent of new
app projects started were for Windows Phone, compared with 1
percent in the previous four days, according to data from
Flurry, which tracks mobile games and programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New projects for Windows Phone passed Research In Motion
Ltd.&#8217;s BlackBerry and now rank third behind new apps for Apple
Inc.&#8217;s iOS and Google Inc.&#8217;s Android, Flurry said. Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft, which agreed last week to have its
Windows Phone software power Nokia handsets, is working to turn
around market-share losses to Apple and Google. A wide variety
of applications is critical to attracting mobile-phone users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple&#8217;s software for the iPhone was the platform for 69
percent of apps started in the 4 days after Feb. 11. Android had
25 percent. BlackBerry was fourth with 2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flurry predicts most developers will build apps for three
operating systems, meaning RIM and Microsoft are likely to
compete for the No. 3 spot, Peter Farago, vice president of
marketing at Flurry, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Appeal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crowdbeacon, maker of an app that lets users ask questions
about nearby businesses, is now planning to release a Windows
Phone 7 version, lured by Nokia&#8217;s international position, said
Robert Boyle, the company&#8217;s chief executive officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Crowdbeacon program, which lets customers ask things
like where to get a haircut nearby in the next 45 minutes, now
is focused on the U.S. A planned international expansion means
Nokia customers are a key audience, Boyle said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We weren&#8217;t even considering it before,&#8221; he said of
Windows Phone 7. &#8220;It just lags behind in users in the U.S. The
Nokia deal changed that.&#8221; The Crowdbeacon app was released a
week ago for Apple&#8217;s iOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reported surge in interest in Windows Phone comes on
top of an increase that started showing up early last week as
speculation about the deal mounted, Flurry reported in a Feb. 11
posting on its Web site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the largest software maker, rose 6 cents to
$27.02 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The
shares had dropped 3.4 percent this year before today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s investment
bank has reduced trading costs for foreign exchange and other
transactions from about 75 cents per trade to around 10 cents by
consolidating some trading systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overhaul began about two years ago, Jes Staley, the
unit&#8217;s chief investment officer, said during an investor meeting
at the company&#8217;s New York headquarters yesterday. JPMorgan has
cut its trading systems from 10 platforms to five with plans for
just two systems by 2014, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the project is complete, the costs to process a trade
should fall to five cents, with some of that savings being
passed on to clients, Staley said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Just think of the importance of having a foreign exchange
desk, whether you are in Sao Paulo, Brazil or Tokyo, Japan or
Berlin, Germany, you&#8217;re on the exact same system, so you have
the exact same pricing and deal with clients in the exact same
way. The impact is extraordinary,&#8221; Staley said. &#8220;Once we get
the consolidation, then we get to innovate and to make the
overall system that much more efficient.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lender, which processes about 68 million foreign
exchange trades a year, will be able to eliminate 3,000 jobs of
employees who manually process trades by the end of 2014, Staley
said. Those people may move to other functions within the bank,
said Jennifer Zuccarelli, a company spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new system, which will cost about $500 million over the
five-year program, will save the company about $300 million with
a &#8220;broader impact&#8221; of $1 billion a year once it&#8217;s in place,
Staley said. The new platform will enable JPMorgan to execute
trades faster and to get products to the market quicker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The real impact though is on the revenue side,&#8221; he said,
comparing the new systems with game-changers like the cellular
telephone for consumers and iPad for institutional clients. &#8220;If
we can get innovative like that, I think our revenue impact will
be even more significant.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is anyone else a bit BRIC-ed out? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, I completely get the importance of Brazil, Russia,
India and China as emerging powers, growth engines and, perhaps,
role models. Yet ever since Goldman Sachs Group Inc. squeezed
the indispensable four into an acronym, we seem to have lost
sight of a wider constellation of hugely promising economies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Jim O&#8217;Neill, coiner of Goldman&#8217;s now-ubiquitous BRICs,
says investors ought to concentrate on a broader basket of
&#8220;growth economies&#8221; as Brazilian, Russian, Indian and Chinese
stocks gyrate. It really is time to dispense with this BRICs
hype and focus on a more useful yardstick: the &#8220;7 Percent
Club.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concept comes courtesy of Standard Chartered Plc. It&#8217;s
a fluid list of economies that achieve that rate of growth
consistently over an extended period -- and, of course, it
includes China and India. More importantly, the nature of the
grouping has the power to exert a much-needed peer-pressure
dynamic in Asia, the world&#8217;s fastest-growth region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s an incentive for countries like Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Mongolia and Vietnam on the cusp of membership to try
harder. It&#8217;s also a reminder to investors that focusing only on
the biggest, sexiest emerging powers isn&#8217;t always best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine for a moment a utopia in which theoretically any
economy, regardless of population and mix of natural resources
can join the 7 percent crowd. All John Calverley, Standard
Chartered&#8217;s global head of macroeconomic research, has done is
create a simple criteria for entry. Club members can enter and
leave depending on their macroeconomic performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cult of GDP &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure there are caveats here. One is the Cult of GDP. In Asia, GDP stands less for gross domestic product than gross
domestic problem. Leaders work to mask challenges with big
headline growth rates. They are just as much about advertising
as they are a diversion. Racy data distract investors from the
cracks undermining economies and give politicians room to step
before the cameras and say we&#8217;re moving forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What matters is that growth reaches those who most need it.
So it&#8217;s not just a matter of growing faster, but the quality of
that growth. By focusing on growth alone without democratizing
its benefits, governments risk Egypt-like backlashes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another is environmental. Were Britain&#8217;s Prince Charles to
read this argument, he might be tempted to toss his morning tea
at the computer screen. In a recent piece in the Times, of London, the prince made an impassioned and logical call for
&#8220;decoupling economic growth from increased consumption in such
a way that both the well-being of nature&#8217;s ecology and our own
economic needs benefit simultaneously.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing Faster &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet high-income nations tend to do a better job of growing
sustainably than poorer ones. It&#8217;s also more likely that
developing nations will be far more enthusiastic about boosting
growth than reducing carbon emissions. So, for better or worse,
this issue of growing faster is what it is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument is a simple one. Economies growing 7 percent
annually double in size every decade and more than quadruple in
a generation. After three decades of growing at such rates, an
economy can be twice as large as one achieving 5 percent.
Calverley points to the experience of China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand
over the last half century. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors are learning to differentiate between Asian
economies doing the right things and those walking in place.
Indonesia and the Philippines are as good an example as any.
Long-term investment is pouring into Indonesia as the government
tries to improve infrastructure, reduce corruption and narrow
the rich-poor divide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perception Problems &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets are less enamored of the Philippines. There remains
a perception of timidity in Manila at a time when policy makers
need to reform an economic system that&#8217;s been neglected for
decades. Also, the nation&#8217;s key export has become its people.
Remittances account for more than 10 percent of the Philippine
economy. Not a good sign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Philippines, by the way, is actually growing faster
than Indonesia -- 7.1 percent year-over-year and 6.9 percent,
respectively. And yet Indonesia gets the headlines and the
kudos. The reason: It&#8217;s widely perceived to offer greater
potential than the Philippines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That gets us back to Goldman&#8217;s BRICs. Russia&#8217;s GDP is more
than double Indonesia&#8217;s and yet it&#8217;s often seen as a less
promising business opportunity. Russia is a proud BRIC member;
Indonesia is left wondering what gives. Some offer a similar
argument about Brazil. While it has performed masterfully over
the last decade, are the structural changes needed to bring
Brazil to the next level feasible? Only time will tell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this leaves the specter of upstarts out-BRIC-ing the
BRICs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chatter about adding another &#8220;I&#8221; for Indonesia (BRIICs,
anyone?) or a &#8220;K&#8221; for Korea (BRICKs) or a &#8220;T&#8221; for Turkey
(BRICTs) is good sport. It just doesn&#8217;t get us closer to knowing
where to invest and in which sectors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s time to think bigger. Let&#8217;s toss aside alphabet-soup
groupings parading as insights and missing the bigger picture
about emerging markets. The 7 Percent Club may be a good place
to start. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase  Co. set out
yesterday a $500 million plan to consolidate its trading

a year, the Financial Times reported, citing Jes Staley, who
heads the company&#8217;s investment banking unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staley said at the bank&#8217;s annual investor day that as many
as 3,000 employees might be eliminated or redeployed, and total
savings might be more than $1 billion, because of lower costs
and increased efficiency, the newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project began two years ago, in which time the number
of trading systems has fallen from 10 to five, and the aim is to
have just two by 2014, the FT said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Intel Corp. said the MeeGo mobile
operating system developed with Nokia Oyj has a future even
after the Finnish handset maker&#8217;s decision to use Microsoft
Corp.&#8217;s software in some devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that Nokia changing its strategy changes the
industry strategy,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini said
in an interview on the sidelines of a conference in Barcelona
today. &#8220;The operators still look for an open, operator-friendly
operating system.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meego will be used in tablets this year, the CEO said. It
will also be used in mobile phones and in embedded devices in
the automotive industry, he said. Intel announced in February
last year that it would work with Nokia on a joint platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia, led by Chief Executive Officer Stephen Elop,
unveiled plans last week to make Microsoft&#8217;s Windows its primary
software in the competition for smartphone customers. The
company is competing against Apple&#8217;s iOS and Google&#8217;s Android
platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elop plans to ship one MeeGo product this year as &#8220;an
opportunity to learn&#8221; before redeploying MeeGo team members and
product elements to Windows Phone 7 and future platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otellini said today he &#8220;understood&#8221; why Nokia is pursuing
a tie-up with Microsoft and said he would have made &#8220;the same
or a similar call.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel is seeking to recruit mobile-phone makers as
customers for its scaled-down PC chips. Smartphones powered by
its chips will be available this year, Otellini said at the
conference. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerging-market central banks are
failing to counter rising inflation, risking a &#8220;scary&#8221; and
&#8220;synchronized&#8221; global monetary-policy tightening as early as
next year, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real interest rates in emerging markets remain at
&#8220;recession lows&#8221; because policy makers believe increases would
pressure currency pegs to the dollar and risk exacerbating
capital inflows, said chief economist Bruce Kasman in an
interview in Beijing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk is that emerging markets tighten policy only after
inflation leaks into developed economies and the U.S. Federal
Reserve reacts, prompting simultaneous interest rate increases
across the world after a longer period of &#8220;financial excesses,&#8221;
Kasman said. JPMorgan strategists cut their year-end target for
the MSCI Emerging Markets Index to 1,300 from 1,500 yesterday on
expectations that accelerating inflation in developing nations
will spur tighter monetary policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The pressures are building and we don&#8217;t see policy makers
addressing them in a serious way,&#8221; New York-based Kasman said.
&#8220;A more synchronized adjustment globally is kind of a scary
prospect down the road for how this stuff ultimately unwinds.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; China and India are among nine of 15 Asian nations where
inflation is outpacing benchmark interest rates even after
central banks acted this year to counter price gains, Bloomberg
data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The willingness of China to tolerate faster price increases,
underscored by an inflation target of 4 percent this year
compared with 3 percent in 2010, and its reluctance to allow
&#8220;significant&#8221; appreciation of its currency, are also slowing
monetary-policy adjustments in emerging markets, Kasman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;China is an anchor in the region in terms of policy
setting,&#8221; Kasman said. &#8220;The idea that they are still reluctant
to allow for any significant appreciation of their currency
means that it&#8217;s much harder to get normal monetary policy in
places like Singapore, Korea, Taiwan and a number of other
countries.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agreement, along with accords Disney-owned stations

&lt;p&gt;The agreement advances Disney&#8217;s effort to receive so-called
retransmission fees from pay-TV carriers for signals that are
available free over the air. The company announced such an
agreement today with Verizon Communications Inc.&#8217;s FiOS pay-TV
service and has similar accords with Cablevision Systems Corp.,
the New York-area cable company, and Time Warner Cable Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Verizon accord is part of a larger deal that gives FiOS
subscribers online access to Disney&#8217;s ESPN cable programs along
with traditional pay TV viewing of the ABC Family, Disney and
Disney Junior cable channels, the companies said in a statement.
Terms weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement with Verizon covering the cable channels and
ESPN online was announced in October. Starting today, Verizon&#8217;s
3.3 million FiOS customers have access to ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU and
ESPN Buzzer Beater, which provides live clips of college
basketball games through personal computers and mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interactive Cuts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, closed unchanged at
$43.70 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
The shares have risen 17 percent this year, the second-highest
gain among stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Verizon,
based in New York, gained 20 cents to $36.37. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also said it plans to cut operating expenses at
its money-losing interactive division by 25 percent by 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reductions are part of a drive to achieve profitability
at the division by 2013, John Pleasants and James Pitaro, co-
heads of the interactive business, told investors at the meeting
in Anaheim, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The division, which posted a loss of $234 million for all
of fiscal 2010, plans to reduce spending on video games for
consoles by 50 percent over the next few years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, the company agreed to buy Playdom Inc. for $563.2
million, acquiring the second-biggest maker of games played on
Facebook Inc. and MySpace websites, and completed the purchase
of Tapulous Inc., a developer of music-related video games for
Apple Inc. products. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Barrick Gold Corp. and Visa Canada
Corp. are exploiting an exemption in ethics legislation to hire
former Harper administration aides as lobbyists, triggering
calls for increased regulation as Canadian lawmakers prepare to
review the rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barrick, the world&#8217;s largest gold producer, and Visa
Canada, the subsidiary of the world&#8217;s largest bank-card network,
have hired former advisers to Finance Minister Jim Flaherty and
Industry Minister Tony Clement as directors of government
affairs. They have done so even though a 2006 law sought to ban
politicians and ministerial staffers from lobbying for five
years after leaving office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies are taking advantage of a provision that
exempts former policy makers who take jobs with corporations and
spend less than 20 percent of their time lobbying. The exemption
undermines the effectiveness of rules Prime Minister Stephen Harper has said were aimed at eliminating lobbying by insiders,
and should be removed, said Pat Martin, a lawmaker for the
opposition New Democratic Party. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It violates the spirit if not the letter of the law to be
lobbying on policy or legislation when you&#8217;ve just recently left
the ranks of government, and I don&#8217;t care if it&#8217;s for 20 percent
or 1 percent of your time,&#8221; Martin said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;There are inherent loopholes in the lobbyist
registration regime that you could drive a Mack truck through
and make a mockery of the intent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Revolving Door&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin, who said he wants removal of the exemption to be
part of his party&#8217;s platform in the next election, raised the
issue in the House of Commons today, asking the Conservatives
what happened to their pledge to &#8220;clean up the revolving door
between their government and lobbying firms.&#8221; Treasury Board
President Stockwell Day, the minister responsible for the law,
said lawmakers &#8220;can review the legislation at any time, adding
he intends to keep it &#8220;the best legislation among most western
democracies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law is up for review by a parliamentary committee
before Parliament breaks for its summer session and the
government will review suggestions on how to improve the law,
Jay Denney, a spokesman for Day, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alanna Heath, a former adviser to Flaherty, was part of
Barrick&#8217;s efforts last year to defeat a bill requiring the
government to probe any alleged human-rights violations by
domestic mining companies outside Canada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government Relations &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heath worked for Flaherty from 2007 to 2009 before joining
Toronto-based Barrick as director of government relations early
last year. Heath isn&#8217;t registered as a lobbyist, according to
public records as of Feb. 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heath deferred questions about her actions to Barrick
spokesman Andy Lloyd, who confirmed in an e-mailed statement
that Heath met with lawmakers. Lloyd said the meetings were
allowed because of the exemption in the law, and that all
meetings were disclosed to the office of Commissioner of
Lobbying Karen E. Shepherd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rodney MacDonald, a former adviser to Clement, signed on
last year as director of government relations for Toronto-based
Visa Canada. In a telephone interview Jan. 6, MacDonald said he
has lobbied lawmakers legally because he doesn&#8217;t spend more than
20 percent of his time lobbying. He was listed as an active
lobbyist in a Feb. 2 filing by Visa on the commissioner&#8217;s
website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MacDonald said he voluntarily tells the lobbying commission
who he is meeting in order to &#8220;safeguard&#8221; himself from
&#8220;hearsay&#8221; about what he is doing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Legislation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Accountability Act was the first piece of
legislation introduced after Harper took office in 2006. In
addition to the lobbying restrictions, it ended political
donations by companies, required public servants to record all
contacts with lobbyists and eliminated contingency fees in the
lobbying industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law, which Harper says was aimed at removing the
influence of insiders, prohibits former government employees who
held senior positions from communicating with designated
&#8220;public office holders&#8221; on behalf of companies for five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It exempts from that provision former officials for whom
lobbying doesn&#8217;t constitute a significant part of their work. In
July 2009, Shepherd ruled that &#8220;significant&#8221; means &#8220;20
percent or more of overall duties.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exemption isn&#8217;t available to former officials who work
for lobbyist consulting firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Lobbying Ban &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is no five-year ban on lobbying; there is a five-
year ban on doing a significant amount of it,&#8221; said Duff Conacher, head of Ottawa-based Democracy Watch, an advocacy
group for government accountability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals can also apply for an exemption from any
lobbying restrictions if they held office for a short period of
time or had administrative duties only. The exemptions are
posted on the commissioner&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former senior government employees are also constrained by
conflict of interest regulations in the law that prohibit them
from taking &#8220;improper advantage&#8221; of their public office,
giving advice to employers using confidential information or
communicating for one year with any public official with whom
they had &#8220;significant official dealings&#8221; while in office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa&#8217;s MacDonald said that means he doesn&#8217;t meet with any
officials from a &#8220;swath of ministries,&#8221; though there aren&#8217;t
any specific guidelines from the ethics commissioner on whom he
could meet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Honor System&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is kind of an honor system,&#8221; MacDonald said. &#8220;I
really wish it wasn&#8217;t. The onus is on me not to meet with people
that would be against those rules. So I have self-determined
that just as a safeguard I&#8217;m not meeting with any ministers&#8217;
offices because I worked with all the ministers&#8217; offices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barrick&#8217;s Heath met or spoke to lawmakers on at least four
occasions in October, according to Members of Parliament who
witnessed her doing so, as part of efforts by companies such as
Barrick, Goldcorp Inc., and IAMGOLD Corp. to defeat a bill aimed
at cracking down on alleged human-rights violations by Canadian
mining companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liberal lawmaker Wayne Easter said he met Heath in his
office on Oct. 20. Liberal lawmaker Martha Hall-Findlay said
Heath took part in a meeting with lawmakers from her party
shortly before the bill was defeated by a 140-134 margin in an
Oct. 27 vote. Heath also spoke to Liberal lawmaker Marc Garneau
in Garneau&#8217;s office on Oct. 18, according to Roch Gamache, a
Garneau aide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares Decline &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Barrick have lost 3.6 percent over the past three
months and returned 26.8 percent over the past year. The
company&#8217;s 10 closest gold mining peers by market value have
averaged a 6 percent decline over the past three months, and a
14.5 percent gain over the past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of San Francisco-based Visa Inc. have lost 10.2
percent over the past year, compared with a 13.9 percent gain
for MasterCard Inc. and a 22.4 percent gain for American Express
Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natalie Hall, a spokeswoman for Shepherd, said that the
office doesn&#8217;t comment on specific lobbyists or cases. Jocelyne
Brisebois, a spokeswoman with the country&#8217;s ethics commissioner
who oversees this aspect of the Federal Accountability Act, also
declined to comment on specific cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harper&#8217;s office deferred questions about the act to Day,
the Treasury Board president. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exemption was intended to ensure that former public
officials who have &#8220;one meeting a year&#8221; with a lawmaker aren&#8217;t
hurt by a &#8220;whopping regulatory overhead,&#8221; according to Charles
King, president of the Government Relations Institute of Canada,
an Ottawa-based association that represents the lobbying
industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King said in a Jan. 24 interview he was concerned that use
of the exemption may &#8220;wind up giving everyone who follows the
rules a black eye, and wind up strengthening the case for
tougher rules for everyone&#8221; who attempts to sway lawmakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Lobbying is lobbying is lobbying,&#8221; King said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Intel Corp. Chief Executive Officer
Paul Otellini said Nokia Oyj went to the &#8220;highest bidder&#8221; when
it chose to use Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s operating system on future
phones instead of software Nokia is developing with Intel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Between Microsoft and Google he was getting incredible
offers, money to switch,&#8221; Otellini said on a conference call
with investors, referring to Nokia CEO Stephen Elop. &#8220;Microsoft
bid more.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia, the world&#8217;s largest handset maker, said on Feb. 11
that it will use Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Phone software as its
primary mobile-phone platform, replacing its own Symbian
software. Intel and Nokia had jointly developed an alternative
operating system called MeeGo, an attempt by both companies to
break into the market for smartphones, which is dominated by Google Inc.&#8217;s Android and Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t have made the decision he made,&#8221; Otellini
said. &#8220;I would have probably gone to Android. Doing MeeGo would
have been the best strategy for him, but he concluded he
couldn&#8217;t afford it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laurie Armstrong, a U.S.-based spokeswoman for Nokia,
didn&#8217;t immediately return an e-mail and phone calls seeking a
comment. Microsoft spokeswoman Melissa Havel declined to comment
on Otellini&#8217;s statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking Other Partners &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel, the world&#8217;s largest chipmaker, is trying to grab a
foothold in the rapidly growing market for smartphones and
tablet computers. Its scaled-down personal-computer processors
have failed to win a spot in any phone that&#8217;s currently on sale.
The majority of smartphones and tablets run on chips made by
companies such as Qualcomm Inc. and Texas Instruments Inc.,
using technology from ARM Holdings Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel is developing MeeGo to try to expand in the industry.
Otellini said that mobile-phone service providers support his
effort because they don&#8217;t want the market to be dominated by
Apple and Google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The carriers still want a third ecosystem,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll find other partners.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia&#8217;s Elop said last week that a MeeGo-based device will
be shipped this year as a way to &#8220;learn&#8221; about users&#8217;
experiences, and then developers will be put on other projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel rose 22 cents, or 1 percent, to $21.97 at 4 p.m. New
York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The stock has gained
4.5 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Credit Suisse Group AG hired four
bank analysts and two equity salespeople from JPMorgan Chase 
Co. in London as it rebuilds a team weakened by departures,
according to two people with knowledge of the moves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts Carla Antunes da Silva, Ignacio Cerezo Olmos, Amit Goel and Andrea Unzueta will join the bank, said the people, who
declined to be identified because the information is private.
Nick Gough and Justine Shih will join the team to sell European
financial stocks, the people said. None of the analysts could be
reached for comment on their office telephone numbers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, analyst Maxence Le Gouvello du Timat will join
the Zurich-based bank from Morgan Stanley, said Sebastian Howell, a London-based spokesman for the U.S. bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, Credit Suisse lost a team of five banking
analysts and two specialist salesmen, two people with knowledge
of the moves said at the time. Analysts Jonathan Pierce and
Daniel Davies both stayed at the bank. The lender came second in
Institutional Investor&#8217;s 2010 poll for best European banking
coverage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sofia Rehman, a London-based spokeswoman for Credit Suisse,
and Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for JPMorgan in London, both

&lt;p&gt;Thibault Nardin will take over research coverage of French

&lt;p&gt; Verizon Communications Inc.&#8217;s FiOS
pay-TV service will start paying Walt Disney Co. for access to
local signals from 10 ABC stations owned by the media company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement is part of a broader deal giving FiOS
subscribers online access to Disney&#8217;s ESPN cable programs, while
also covering Disney cable channels ABC Family, Disney Channel
and Disney Junior, the companies said today in a statement.
Terms weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ABC agreement advances Disney&#8217;s efforts to receive so-
called retransmission fees from pay-TV carriers for signals that

with New York-based Time Warner Cable Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accord covering the cable channels and ESPN online was

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Capital Partners and
EQT Partners AB will sell shares of ISS Holding A/S, the world&#8217;s
largest cleaning-service provider, in what may be Denmark&#8217;s
biggest initial public offering in more than 16 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IPO will consist mostly of new shares and will raise
gross proceeds of about 13.3 billion kroner ($2.42 billion)
which will be used to reduce the company&#8217;s debt, the Copenhagen-
based company said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s an appetite for IPOs in the market now, there&#8217;s
liquidity,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer Jeff Gravenhorst said in a
phone interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offering would be Denmark&#8217;s biggest since the
government in 1994 sold a stake in Copenhagen-based phone
company TDC A/S for $3 billion and would exceed last year&#8217;s $1.7
billion IPO of Pandora A/S, a Glostrup-based maker of jewelry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EQT and Goldman Sachs, which acquired ISS for 21.9 billion
kroner in 2005, said in August they were considering a sale of
the company and hired bankers to review their options. ISS has
an enterprise value of as much as 49 billion kroner, Jyske Bank
A/S said in December. Because the owners haven&#8217;t decided how
many shares to sell, it isn&#8217;t possible to estimate the company&#8217;s
value from the planned IPO proceeds, Gravenhorst said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduce Gearing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t go to the stock exchange without doing
something to reduce our gearing at the same time,&#8221; Gravenhorst
said. The IPO will take place on the Copenhagen exchange &#8220;in
not too long,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISS said net debt amounted to 30.6 billion kroner at the
end of last year, according to today&#8217;s earnings report. ISS
reported a 7.3 percent advance in 2010 sales to 74.1 billion
kroner while its net loss shrank three-fold to 532 million
kroner. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization jumped 21 percent to a record 5 billion kroner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;EQT and Goldman are staying on board for a while, but in
the long run they&#8217;ll probably dispose of all their shares,&#8221;
Martin Bo Hansen, a corporate bond analyst at Jyske Bank said by
phone today. He said he will now review his December ISS
valuation estimate of 47 billion kroner to 49 billion kroner
based on today&#8217;s earnings report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biggest Acquisition &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apax Partners LLP dropped a 6.4 billion-euro ($8.7 billion)
bid for ISS last month, according to two people familiar with
the talks. That would have been the biggest acquisition by a
European private equity firm since the credit crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISS, operating in more than 50 countries with more than
500,000 workers, provides cleaning, catering, security and call-
center services. It has mainly grown through acquisitions of
more than 600 companies in the past decade, making it the Nordic
region&#8217;s most acquisitive company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of insuring the senior debt of ISS Global fell 31
basis points to 198, the lowest level since December 2007,
according to CMA. Credit-default swaps linked to the holding
company&#8217;s subordinated debt dropped 65 basis points to 183. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros of debt from default for five years is equivalent
to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc.,
Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc and Nordea Bank AB will
manage the IPO. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
tricked JPMorgan Chase  Co. into holding onto collateral that
the bankrupt investment firm internally described as &#8220;goat poo,&#8221;
according to a court filing by JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was stuck with Lehman&#8217;s worst securities backing
$25 billion of loans as Lehman was sold to Barclays Plc in
September 2008, JPMorgan said in its filing yesterday in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. Lehman described the collateral
as &#8220;toxic crap&#8221; and &#8220;goat poo&#8221; to be scattered &#8220;in other
people&#8217;s backyards,&#8221; JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Only later was JPMorgan able to determine that the
position in which it unexpectedly found itself was the result of
collusion and deception&#8221; by Lehman and Barclays, JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accusations appeared in amended counterclaims against
Lehman in its lawsuit against JPMorgan. Both companies are based
in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman accuses JPMorgan of siphoning billions of dollars
from Lehman, leading to it collapse in September 2008. London-
based Barclays bought Lehman&#8217;s broker-dealer unit after Lehman&#8217;s
bankruptcy filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimberly Macleod, a spokeswoman for Lehman, and Mark Lane,
a spokesman for Barclays, both declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. v. JPMorgan Chase
Bank NA, 10-03266, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

in a research note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Leverage is quite high and could be a drag for future
growth,&#8221; Huerta said. &#8220;Credibility on earnings expectations is
lower now as earnings in the past two years have been weaker
than expected.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net sales rose 1 percent to 5.6 billion pesos ($465.5
million) in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, the company
said in a statement to the Mexico stock exchange Feb. 16. Total
liabilities rose 10 percent to 21.6 billion pesos in 2010 from a
year earlier, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Grupo Televisa SA gained the most in
two months in Mexico City trading after its fourth-quarter
profit more than doubled on gains in satellite- and cable-TV
clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa climbed 1.38 pesos, or 2.4 percent, to 59.49 pesos
at 4 p.m. New York time, the biggest gain since Dec. 1. The
shares have declined 6.9 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa&#8217;s Sky unit is using a brand called VeTV to offer
lower-cost satellite packages with fewer channels to reach more
Mexican consumers, competing with Dish Mexico. Televisa added
291,000 satellite customers in the quarter to bring its total to
3.04 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income increased to 2.62 billion pesos ($218 million)
from 1.19 billion pesos a year earlier, Mexico City-based
Televisa said yesterday. Sales rose 8.8 percent to 16.5 billion
pesos, topping the 16.3 billion peso estimate of Michel Morin,
analyst at Barclays Plc in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three cable carriers controlled by Televisa added a
total of 42,912 TV customers in the fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ad-Customer Loss &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa failed to sell upfront advertising this year to
companies controlled by billionaire Carlos Slim after raising
prices, Executive Vice President Alfonso de Angoitia said.
Televisa&#8217;s advance bookings of ad sales for the year fell 4
percent from a year earlier because of Slim&#8217;s absence, he said.
Slim&#8217;s companies represented 1.5 percent of Televisa&#8217;s sales in
2010, de Angoitia said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Slim&#8217;s Telefonos de Mexico SAB competes with Televisa
for phone and Internet customers, the decision was based solely
on the price increase, said Arturo Elias, Slim&#8217;s spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are many other advertising media,&#8221; Elias said in
an e-mail today. Televisa has about 70 percent of Mexico&#8217;s
broadcast television market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa is still evaluating ways to enter Mexico&#8217;s mobile-
phone market, where Slim&#8217;s America Movil SAB is the top carrier,
de Angoitia said. Mexico&#8217;s government has barred Slim from
entering the pay-TV market, saying he must comply with
regulations on interconnecting with competitors first. Slim said
last month he has complied with the necessary rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa plans capital investments of $850 million this
year, mostly for its cable and satellite units, de Angoitia
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following companies had unusual
price changes in Mexico trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4 p.m. New York time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IPC index rose 0.8 percent to 37,522.30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bolsa Mexicana de Valores SAB (BOLSAA MM), the operator of
Mexico&#8217;s securities exchange, gained 1.5 percent to 24.86 pesos.
The exchange&#8217;s derivatives unit will offer contracts for corn,
gas, oil and wheat traded by CME Group Inc. in April, Jorge Alegria, the chief executive officer of Mexico&#8217;s Derivatives
Exchange, said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corp. Geo SAB (GEOB MM), the second-largest homebuilder in
Mexico, dropped 5.1 percent to 36.41 pesos. JPMorgan Chase  Co.
cut the company&#8217;s rating to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;overweight&#8221; and
set a 12-month target of 43 pesos per share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Grupo Televisa SA (TLEVICPO MM), the largest Spanish-
language broadcaster in the world, rose 2.4 percent to 59.49
pesos. Fourth-quarter profit more than doubled to 2.62 billion
pesos as the company signed up more customers for satellite and
cable television, the company said yesterday in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimberly-Clark de Mexico SAB (KIMBERA MM), the largest
maker of consumer goods in Mexico, declined 0.4 percent to 72.84
pesos. Fourth-quarter net income was 1.2 billion pesos, the
company said in a statement to the stock exchange today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. will likely
repay the $5 billion investment from Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. and may buy back as many as 10 percent of its
outstanding shares over the next two years, according to Glenn Schorr, an analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repurchasing the preferred shares from Berkshire would
increase annual earnings per share at the New York-based firm by
about 85 cents, Schorr said today in a note to investors. A
5 percent reduction in shares outstanding would add about
$1 a share to earnings, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is awaiting results of a stress test that the Federal Reserve is using to determine whether the largest U.S.
banks can begin returning capital to shareholders through
dividends and share repurchases. The firm has an estimated
Tier 1 common ratio of about 8 percent under the so-called Basel
III capital rules, Schorr wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think Goldman will be part of the small group of U.S.
banks allowed to return capital at the end of 1Q11 and we
believe the firm is clearly able to effectively manage its
capital base given its strong starting point,&#8221; Schorr wrote.
&#8220;Goldman&#8217;s shares outstanding could be reduced by 10 percent
over the next two years (and we may be on the conservative
side).&#8221; That would boost earnings per share and returns on
equity, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is likely to invest in its emerging markets
businesses and technology improvements before returning capital
to shareholders, Schorr wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital Impact &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repayment could reduce the firm&#8217;s tier 1 common equity
ratio by about 0.4 percentage points and reduce book value by
about $3 a share, Schorr wrote. Those effects would likely be
offset by the first-quarter earnings, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; David Wells, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to
comment. The bank is considering repaying the Berkshire
investment, needing approval from the Federal Reserve to do so,
a person familiar with the plans said in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs turned to Buffett, the second-richest
American and a cult figure in the investing world, to shore up
the investment bank&#8217;s capital and restore market confidence
after its stock tumbled and borrowing costs spiked following the
Sept. 15, 2008, collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. News
of Berkshire&#8217;s investment also helped Goldman Sachs raise
$5.75 billion from a stock offering a day later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil bottlenecks at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for New York futures, will ease,
leading JPMorgan Chase  Co. to recommend buying June WTI
futures and selling Brent contracts for the same month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower prices for WTI in relation to other grades are making
it profitable to move supplies by rail from the supply hub and
will trigger &#8220;alternative solutions&#8221; to the movement of crude,
JPMorgan analysts led by New York-based Lawrence Eagles said in
a report today. Canadian oil output will drop in April, May and
June, as companies perform maintenance, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premium of April Brent crude, the European benchmark,
to New York oil for the same delivery month, narrowed to $12.31
a barrel at 11:03 a.m. in New York, down from a record $15.94 on
Feb. 16. The gap averaged 76 cents last year. The spread between
the June contracts dropped to $9.41 from $11.35 on Feb. 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the spread gets wide enough all sorts of innovative
alternative methods will be brought into play to move the oil,&#8221;
the analysts said. &#8220;These will take some time to set up and
will be price sensitive but there is every reason to believe
that they will contribute to clearing this market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent crude oil for April settlement added 25 cents to
$102.79 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. Crude oil for April delivery on the New York
Mercantile Exchange rose $1.69, or 1.9 percent, to $90.53. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude for March delivery, the front-month contract on the
Nymex, rose $1.13, or 1.3 percent, to $87.49. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Deutsche Telekom AG, France Telecom
SA and other mobile operators, who lost the battle for online
applications stores to Apple Inc. and Google Inc., say they have
a fighting chance of winning the corner convenience store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operators, along with Google and credit card providers
including Visa Inc., are scrambling to offer so-called near-
field communication payment systems, which will let people buy
everything from milk and butter to clothes with a swipe of their
smartphone. NFC may be the last chance for operators to avoid
being simple conduits of other companies&#8217; electronic commerce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Google&#8217;s massive, but Google does not have a billing
relationship with 99 percent of its customers,&#8221; Deutsche
Telekom Chief Technology and Innovation Officer Ed Kozel said in
an interview last week. &#8220;That&#8217;s our opportunity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stakes for losing out on this business development are
huge, with NFC payments -- which could potentially replace many
cash registers and credit cards -- likely to account for a third
of the $1.13 trillion global market in mobile transactions by
2014, according to IE Market Research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operators, who &#8220;were not as good as the Internet players&#8221;
for online apps, have an opportunity to get back in the game,
said Philippe Vallee, an executive vice president at SIM-card
maker Gemalto SA. With NFC, &#8220;they can become the applications
portal for the secure wallet.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strong demand from lenders allowed Murcia, Spain-based
Mivisa to reduce the interest margin on the 472.5 million-euro
seven-year term loan targeting non-bank lenders from 500 basis

&lt;p&gt;The amount of financing for the takeover of the can maker

&lt;p&gt;A drug used commonly to treat
alcohol abuse will be tested as a way of purging the last
vestiges of HIV from patients, extending the hunt for an AIDS
cure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of California, San
Francisco, and Johns Hopkins University plan to recruit 20 HIV-
infected people for a trial of the drug, Antabuse. They aim to
see whether it can deplete the pool of residual virus that
regular AIDS drugs don&#8217;t clear, according to details of the
study on ClinicalTrials.gov, a registry of trials maintained by
the U.S. National Institutes of Health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study is the latest attempt to flush out latent
reservoirs of HIV, an achievement that would allow patients to
go off their medications without the disease rebounding,
effectively curing AIDS. Success in the trial would show the
researchers are on the right track to eradicating the virus,
said Paul Cameron, a clinical immunologist at The Alfred
hospital in Melbourne. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would expect that there will be a detectable
decrease,&#8221; said Cameron, who&#8217;s not involved in the study.
&#8220;What the percentage decrease in latent virus is going to be,
that&#8217;s the real question.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Deeks, a professor of medicine at University of California, San Francisco, is leading the trial. It&#8217;s based on
as-yet-unpublished laboratory experiments about the effect of
Antabuse, also known as disulfiram, on latent HIV by Robert Siliciano, a professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore.
He said he doesn&#8217;t expect the drug to cure AIDS, and is looking
for clues that will guide future research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No single drug is likely to be able to eliminate these
reservoirs,&#8221; Siliciano said in a telephone interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s
going to come down to some sort of combination of agents.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cocaine Addiction &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antabuse, now available as a generic drug, is the oldest
medicine for alcoholism and causes nausea and vomiting when
people drink after taking it. Deaths have been reported in some
patients. It&#8217;s also used to treat cocaine addiction, said Alex
Wodak, director of the drug and alcohol service at Sydney&#8217;s St.
Vincent&#8217;s Hospital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a very well tolerated, very safe drug,&#8221; as long as
patients don&#8217;t drink after taking it, Wodak said in a telephone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers plan to add Antabuse to the patients&#8217;
regular cocktail of AIDS drugs for two weeks, then check their
blood after 24 weeks to see whether it has depleted the amount
of latent HIV. The trial started last month and will finish in
June next year, according to clinicaltrials.gov. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biggest Infectious Killer &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human immunodeficiency virus, the pathogen that causes AIDS,
infected 2.6 million people in 2009 and killed 1.8 million,
according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, or
UNAIDS, making it the world&#8217;s biggest infectious killer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of new infections worldwide has been declining
annually since the late 1990s, helped by drugs such as Gilead
Sciences Inc.&#8217;s Atripla that reduce HIV to undetectable levels,
giving many patients normal life expectancies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Existing HIV treatments don&#8217;t completely clear the virus.
It survives by switching off the normal process of copying
itself inside certain cells, avoiding detection by AIDS drugs,
which are designed to block replication. Studies have shown that
when patients with undetectable virus stop taking their pills,
HIV reactivates and comes roaring back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cure-hunters are looking for ways to awaken latent HIV by
kick-starting its replication process while patients are on
medication, flushing the virus out of hiding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kickstart Replication &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antabuse may do that by blocking an enzyme called methyl
transferase, or DNMT, that helps HIV go to sleep in cells, The
Alfred&#8217;s Cameron said. That would kickstart replication, making
the virus visible to antiretroviral drugs prowling the body. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, nature would take its course: HIV would exit
and kill its host cell, and enter the bloodstream in search of
new cells to infect. The drugs would prevent it from doing so,
and with nowhere left to go, the virus would die within hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are no published studies showing Antabuse works
that way with HIV, previous research shows that other DNMT
blockers can reactivate HIV in a lab dish, and that Antabuse can
inhibit methyl transferase in cancer cells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siliciano said he&#8217;s still trying to figure out exactly how
the drug reactivates latent HIV, and doesn&#8217;t know that it will
in patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The mechanism is unknown and likely to be complicated,&#8221;
he said in a telephone interview. &#8220;We have some ideas but we&#8217;re
still working on it. It&#8217;s possible that this drug will have no
activity in patients.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a similar and unrelated trial, researchers at the
University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill plan to test a Merck
 Co. cancer drug, Zolinza, in about 20 people this year. Like
the Antabuse trial, they&#8217;re trying to reactivate latent HIV by
targeting a different enzyme. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Walter Investment Management Corp.
call volume jumped to its highest level since December 2009,
with most of the trading concentrated in contracts that have a
strike price 5.6 percent below today&#8217;s close. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 3,500 puts to sell the mortgage real estate
investment trust changed hands today, 20 times the four-week
average and 47 times the number of calls to buy. The most-traded
contracts were the March $17.50 puts, which accounted for almost
all put volume and rose 33 percent to 20 cents. Ninety percent
of those puts were exchanged at the ask price, indicating that
buyers initiated most of the transactions. Tampa, Florida-based
Walter Investment declined 2.9 percent to $18.53. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The REIT is expected to report a 30 cent profit per share
excluding some items next week, according to the average of
three analyst estimates from a Bloomberg survey. Walter
Investment was created in 2009 through a merger of the company,
which was spun off from coal producer Walter Industries Inc.,
and Hanover Capital Mortgage Holdings Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter Investment&#8217;s implied volatility, the key gauge of
option prices, for at-the-money options expiring in 30 days rose
to 24.43 from 20.76 Feb. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil surged to the highest level in
more than two years as intensifying violence in Libya fueled
concern that supplies from the holder of Africa&#8217;s largest crude
reserves may be disrupted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices in New York jumped 8.6 percent from the Feb. 18
settlement as soldiers deserted Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi&#8217;s
government and diplomats resigned. Saudi Arabian Oil Minister
Ali al-Naimi said there is &#8220;absolutely no shortage of supply&#8221;
and that OPEC will be ready to boost output if one develops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The world could deal with the loss of Libyan barrels, but
the worry is that it won&#8217;t stop at Libya,&#8221; said Bill O&#8217;Grady,
chief market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis. &#8220;We don&#8217;t know where this is going to end.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude for March delivery gained $7.37 to $93.57 a barrel on
the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest settlement since
Oct. 3, 2008. Futures have risen 17 percent in the past year.
U.S. financial markets were closed yesterday for the Presidents
Day holiday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The March contract expired at the close of floor trading
today. The more-active April contract increased $5.71, or 6.4
percent, to settle at $95.42 a barrel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libya declared force majeure on all oil exports, Reuters
reported, citing sources it didn&#8217;t identify. Force majeure
allows producers to miss contractual obligations because of
circumstances beyond their control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qaddafi Will Fight &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qaddafi said he will fight until his last drop of blood,
after government forces attacked protesters and rebels claimed
control of Benghazi, Libya&#8217;s second-largest city. He said the
police and army will impose order tomorrow and vowed to use
force if necessary, in a speech on state-run television. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia has 4 million barrels a day of spare capacity,
al-Naimi said at a press conference at the ministerial meeting
of the International Energy Forum in Riyadh. All the world&#8217;s
producers, including Saudi Arabia, could pump an additional 6
million barrels, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kingdom is the largest oil exporter and the biggest
producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
The Energy Forum represents about 90 percent of global supply
and demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Paris-based International Energy Agency said in a
statement earlier on its website that &#8220;the IEA stands ready, as
always, to make oil available to the market in the event of a
major supply disruption if alternative supplies cannot be made
available via normal market mechanisms.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Price Surge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world economy can withstand the surge in oil prices
sparked by the unrest in the Middle East for a short time, John Lipsky, the No. 2 official at the International Monetary Fund,
said on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;Inside Track&#8221; today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the fears of disruption prove to be temporary, the
markets are amply supplied,&#8221; said Lipsky, the first deputy
managing director at the IMF, which based its economic forecasts
for this year on $95-a-barrel oil. &#8220;More than that,
substantially more than that, for these kinds of reasons, fears
of disruption would be very difficult in many dimensions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti-government riots that started in Tunisia have also
spread through Egypt, Yemen, Algeria, Iran, Bahrain and Morocco.
Countries in North Africa and the Middle East were responsible
for 36 percent of global oil output and held 61 percent of
proved reserves in 2009, according to BP Plc, which publishes
its Statistical Review of World Energy each June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Violence isn&#8217;t necessary to disrupt supply,&#8221; said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge
fund that focuses on energy. &#8220;All we need is a strike or attack
on infrastructure.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent Differential &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent oil for April settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange gained 4 cents to $105.78 a barrel, the
highest settlement since Sept. 22, 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spread between the two main April crude-oil contracts
narrowed to $10.36 a barrel, down from $12.81 Feb. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protests in Bahrain, provoked by discontent among the
majority-Shiite Muslim population, have sparked concern the
violence will erupt in neighboring Saudi Arabia. The kingdom
holds one-fifth of the world&#8217;s oil, according to the U.S. Energy
Information Administration. Saudi Arabia has a Shiite minority
concentrated in its eastern oil-producing hub. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent may surge to a record if the unrest in Libya
continues and spreads to other Middle Eastern oil producers such
as Saudi Arabia, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Brent
touched a record $147.50 a barrel in July 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The real key is the contagion risk,&#8221; Jeffrey Currie, the
bank&#8217;s London-based head of commodities, said in Hong Kong
today. &#8220;Then prices could test historical highs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libya pumped 1.59 million barrels a day of oil in January,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg News, making it the
eighth-largest producer among those with quotas in the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The group pumps
40 percent of the world&#8217;s oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 1.35
million contracts as of 3:55 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled
952,938 contracts Feb. 18, 29 percent above the average of the
past three months. Open interest was 1.51 million contracts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Gulf Coast gasoline weakened versus
futures after Exxon Mobil Corp. restarted a gasoline-making unit
at its Chalmette refinery in Louisiana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit, which was shut Jan. 22 for unplanned repairs, was
started over the weekend, Kevin Allexon, a company spokesman,
said in an e-mail today. The unit can process more than 75,000
barrels a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spread for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the Gulf
Coast weakened 0.55 cent to a discount of 5.8 cents a gallon
versus futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at
2:20 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt
delivery rose 6.05 cents to $2.5593. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; ConocoPhillips is conducting planned maintenance at its
Lake Charles refinery in Louisiana, Rich Johnson, a company
spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasoline and heating oil futures surged to their highest
levels in more than 28 months as violence in Libya raised
speculation that Middle Eastern unrest could disrupt oil and
fuel supplies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in New
York Harbor held steady at 1.75 cents a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premium for ultra-low-sulfur diesel at the East Coast
hub increased 1.12 cents to 8.25 cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premium for California-blend gasoline in San Francisco
dropped 11.25 cents to 13 cents a gallon after Valero Energy
Corp. started a crude unit at the Benicia, California, plant.
The unit had been shut for maintenance, according to Bill Day, a
company spokesman in San Antonio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same fuel in Los Angeles slipped 10.25 cents to a
premium of 13 cents a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Greg Stohr" date="Feb 22, 2011  2:43 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-22/suits-against-vaccine-makers-curbed-by-u-s-supreme-court-in-pfizer-case.html"><headline>Suits Against Vaccine Makers Curbed by U.S. Supreme Court</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court reinforced
the shield that protects drugmakers from lawsuits over vaccines,
ruling against two parents who blame Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s Wyeth unit
for their teen-age daughter&#8217;s seizure disorder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices, voting 6-2, said a 1986 federal law preempts
claims that a drugmaker should have sold a safer formulation of
a vaccine. The law, designed to encourage vaccine production by
limiting patient suits, channels most complaints into a company-
financed no-fault system that offers limited but guaranteed
payments for injuries shown to be caused by a product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The vaccine manufacturers fund from their sales an
informal, efficient compensation program for vaccine injuries,&#8221;
Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the majority. &#8220;In exchange
they avoid costly tort litigation and the occasional
disproportionate jury verdict.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling is a victory for the four companies that supply
vaccines for the U.S. market -- Wyeth, GlaxoSmithKline Plc,
Merck  Co. and Sanofi-Aventis SA. A ruling letting the parents
sue Wyeth might have allowed suits by thousands of families that
say vaccines caused autism in their children. Since 1988, the
no-fault process has led to almost $2 billion in compensation to
more than 2,500 families. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue for the Supreme Court was whether the 1986 law
leaves open the possibility that patients can sue manufacturers
when the side effects were avoidable. The Obama administration
joined Wyeth, acquired in 2009 by New York-based Pfizer, in
urging the justices to bar those types of suits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Regulatory Vacuum&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented.
Sotomayor said the ruling &#8220;leaves a regulatory vacuum in which
no one ensures that vaccine manufacturers adequately take
account of scientific and technological advancements when
designing or distributing their products.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Elena Kagan didn&#8217;t take part in the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most lower courts that had considered the issue had reached
similar conclusions, so the high court ruling won&#8217;t mark a
change in much of the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case concerned Hannah Bruesewitz, who as an infant
began experiencing seizures after receiving the third of five
scheduled doses of Wyeth&#8217;s Tri-Immunol diphtheria-pertussis-
tetanus vaccine in 1992. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking Compensation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her parents, Russell and Robalee Bruesewitz, sought
compensation from the special court that handles vaccine claims.
That court rejected the claim, saying there was no proof that
the vaccine contributed to Hannah&#8217;s problems. The Bruesewitz
family then took the case to federal court in Philadelphia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have great sympathy for the Bruesewitzes,&#8221; Pfizer
Executive Vice President Amy Schulman said in a statement. At
the same time, she said the vaccine law &#8220;appropriately places
the responsibility for determining the optimal design of life-
saving childhood vaccines in the hands of expert federal
agencies, not a patchwork of state tort systems.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family&#8217;s Supreme Court lawyer, David Frederick, said
the ruling &#8220;eliminates the only mechanism for ensuring that
manufacturers stop subjecting children to outmoded and
unnecessarily dangerous vaccines.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics, which represents 60,000
doctors, hailed the ruling. President O. Marion Burton said the
decision &#8220;protects children by strengthening our national
immunization system and ensuring that vaccines will continue to
prevent the spread of infectious diseases in this country.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bruesewitz v. Wyeth, 09-152. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Bob Bensch" date="Feb 22, 2011 11:44 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-22/ally-mccoist-to-succeed-walter-smith-as-rangers-manager-at-end-of-season.html"><headline>Ally McCoist to Succeed Walter Smith as Rangers Manager at End of Season</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Ally McCoist will take over as
Rangers manager when Walter Smith steps down after the season,
the Scottish Premier League soccer champion said on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCoist, 48, has agreed to a one-year rolling contract,
Rangers said. Current coach Kenny McDowall will step up to
become his assistant manager, the Glasgow club said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCoist had been the assistant to Smith since 2007 and has
helped Rangers win the past two SPL titles. The club is second
this season, eight points behind city rival Celtic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Over the past few years I have been privileged to learn
from one of the greatest managers in world football and Walter&#8217;s
record speaks for itself,&#8221; McCoist said on Rangers&#8217; website.
&#8220;I am delighted to be following in his footsteps and I will do
everything possible to bring further success to this club.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCoist scored 355 goals in 581 matches during his playing
career at Rangers from 1983-98. He also had 19 goals for the
Scotland national team and played at the 1990 World Cup in Italy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;First and foremost Ally is a passionate Rangers supporter
who has been a loyal servant to the club both as a player and
more recently assistant manager,&#8221; Rangers Chief Executive
Officer Martin Bain said. &#8220;He has contributed greatly to our
success over the past four years and that is why we feel he is
the right man to replace Walter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil jumped to the highest in more
than two years in New York as intensifying violence in Libya
stoked concern that supplies from the holder of Africa&#8217;s largest
crude reserves may be disrupted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures for April delivery in New York rose as much as 9.8
percent from the Feb. 18 settlement and London-traded Brent
surged to the highest since September 2008, as soldiers deserted
Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi&#8217;s government and diplomats
resigned. Brent may trade between $105 and $110 a barrel in
coming weeks if the unrest continues, according to Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Libya is quite an important oil exporter, especially to Europe,&#8221; said Hannes Loacker, an analyst with Raiffeisen Bank
International AG in Vienna. &#8220;Now fear and uncertainty is
increasing over whether countries in the Gulf may be affected.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude for April delivery rose as much as $8.77 to $98.48 a
barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange
and was at $95.96 at 12:27 p.m. London time. Floor trading was
closed yesterday for the U.S. Presidents Day holiday and
electronic trades will be booked with today&#8217;s transactions for
settlement purposes. The March contract, which expires today,
gained as much as $8.29, or 9.6 percent, to $94.49 a barrel.
Front-month futures are up 17 percent in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent oil for April settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange climbed as much as $2.83, or 2.7
percent, to $108.57 a barrel. It increased 3.1 percent yesterday
to $105.74, the highest settlement since Sept. 22, 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent&#8217;s Premium Declines &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spread between the two main April crude oil contracts
narrowed to $11.12 a barrel from $12.56 yesterday. A disruption
of supplies as a result of civil unrest in Libya may lead to a
further reduction in the price difference between Brent crude
and West Texas Intermediate oil, according to Switzerland-based
researcher Petromatrix GmbH. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If a real supply disruption develops in Libya in our
opinion it does not matter which benchmark better represents the
world supply and demand,&#8221; Petromatrix Managing Director Olivier Jakob said in a note today. &#8220;The U.S. investment flows that
will want to hedge against an oil price spike will come into 
WTI.'''' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices may extend gains, reaching a record, should the
unrest in Libya spread to larger producers in the Middle East,
such as Saudi Arabia, according to Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The real key is the contagion risk,&#8221; Jeffrey Currie, the
bank&#8217;s London-based head of commodities, said in Hong Kong
today. &#8220;Then prices could test historical highs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices May &#8216;Skyrocket&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libya pumped 1.59 million barrels a day of oil in January,
equivalent of about 8 percent of U.S. consumption, based on a
Bloomberg News survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The big risk for the world is that oil prices skyrocket
to, say, $120 a barrel for Brent,&#8221; Arjuna Mahendran, the
Singapore-based head of investment strategy for Asia at HSBC
Private Bank, told Susan Li on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;First Up Asia&#8221; program. &#8220;That could really cause a mini recession in
this consumption upsurge that we&#8217;ve seen in the U.S. starting
late last year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil-options market shows traders have never been less
certain whether prices will rise or fall as the unrest spreads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing speculation the protests will drive oil higher
narrowed the difference between the cost of betting on gains and
declines to 0.57 percentage point on Feb. 18, an all-time low
for June futures, according to data from the New York Mercantile
Exchange. That&#8217;s down from more than 2 percentage points on Jan.
24, before the violence began escalating around the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Rivers of Blood&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libya is the eighth-largest producer among those with
quotas in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, a
group that pumps 40 percent of the world&#8217;s oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qaddafi said he hasn&#8217;t fled the country after government
forces attacked protesters and rebels claimed control of
Benghazi, Libya&#8217;s second-largest city. More than 300 people have
died, the International Federation for Human Rights said.
Qaddafi&#8217;s son, Saif al-Islam Qaddafi, earlier threatened that
&#8220;rivers of blood&#8221; would flow unless the uprising ends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti-government riots that started in Tunisia have also
spread through Egypt, Yemen, Algeria, Iran, Djibouti, Bahrain
and Morocco. Countries in North Africa and the Middle East were
responsible for 36 percent of global oil output and held 61
percent of proved reserves in 2009, according to BP Plc, which
publishes its Statistical Review of World Energy each June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iranian &#8216;Provocation&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Egypt&#8217;s state-run Middle East News Agency reported that two
Iranian warships entered the Suez Canal, citing the Canal
Authority. Israel would consider the presence of Iranian
warships sailing through the waterway &#8220;a provocation,&#8221; said
Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Libyan port in Ras Lanuf operated by Harouge Oil
Operations was operating normally and a crude tanker there is
scheduled to leave later today, an official at the company&#8217;s
movement department said. Harouge is a joint venture operator on
behalf of state-owned National Oil Corp. and Petro-Canada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier today, Al Arabiya television said operations at
Libyan oil ports were suspended due to the unrest, without
saying where it got the information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protests in Bahrain, provoked by discontent among the
majority-Shiite Muslim population, have sparked concern the
violence will erupt in neighboring Saudi Arabia, which holds
one-fifth of the world&#8217;s oil. Saudi Arabia has a Shiite minority
concentrated in its eastern oil-producing hub. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Jeffrey McCracken, Jessica Resnick-Ault and Brett Foley" date="Feb 23, 2011  4:41 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-23/valero-said-in-talks-to-buy-chevron-s-u-k-refinery-for-up-to-1-5-billion.html"><headline>Valero Said to Be in Talks to Buy Chevron&#8217;s U.K. Refinery</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt; Valero Energy Corp., the largest
U.S. oil refiner, is in talks to buy Chevron Corp.&#8217;s U.K.
refinery for $1 billion to $1.5 billion, according to two people
with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An agreement may be reached as soon as next month, said one
of the people, who declined to be identified because the matter
is private. Chevron has been seeking a buyer for the Pembroke
refinery in Wales, its only remaining European plant, for almost
a year. It&#8217;s unclear whether there are other bidders for the
asset besides San Antonio-based Valero, and talks could still
break down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron is among oil companies selling refineries to cut
debt and redeploy spending to oil exploration and development in
higher growth regions. Valero has not bought a refinery since
its 2005 acquisition of Premcor Inc., and has sold four
refineries in that time, two on the U.S. East Coast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think they&#8217;re looking to Pembroke as an upgrade over
what they sold,&#8221; said Chi Chow, an analyst with Macquarie
Capital USA Inc. in Denver. The plant is a low-cost refinery
that has export capabilities to the U.S. and other parts of the
U.K., and has flexibility to run discounted grades of crude oil,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refining Deals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. refining deal since Valero&#8217;s acquisition
of Premcor was announced yesterday when Holly Corp. agreed to
acquire Frontier Oil Corp. of Houston for $2.9 billion. India&#8217;s
Essar Group last week offered to buy Royal Dutch Shell Plc&#8217;s
Stanlow refinery in the U.K. for $350 million in cash. Refining
deals are picking up as companies seeking exposure to the sector
are able to acquire plants at less than 20 percent of the cost
of plants five years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sean Comey, a spokesman for Chevron, said the sale process
is ongoing and the company has no further information to add at
this time. Bill Day, a Valero spokesman, declined to comment on
the Pembroke refinery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are looking specifically at refineries in Europe
because there are many that are available,&#8221; Day said in a phone
interview. Earlier this month, Valero Chief Executive Officer
Bill Klesse said at a conference that a properly structured deal
for a refinery would add &#8220;a lot of shareholder value.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valero is being advised by Barclays Plc, while Chevron is
working with Deutsche Bank AG, said the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valero shares fell 42 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $27.75 at
4:02 p.m. in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe Refineries &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valero had agreed in May 2009 to buy Dow Chemical Co.&#8217;s 45
percent stake in a refining venture that Dow operated with
France&#8217;s Total SA to gain a foothold in Europe. The venture
owned the Vlissingen refinery in the Netherlands. Total instead
agreed the following month to buy the part of the venture it
didn&#8217;t own and sell it to Russia&#8217;s OAO Lukoil, thwarting
Valero&#8217;s attempt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; San Ramon, California-based Chevron, the second-largest
U.S. oil company, said in March 2010 that it planned to sell
Pembroke, which can process 210,000 barrels of crude a day, or
about one in every eight in the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Krista Giovacco and Richard Bravo" date="Feb 23, 2011 10:10 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-23/istar-financial-seeking-3-billion-credit-line-from-jpmorgan-to-pay-debt.html"><headline>IStar Financial Hires JPMorgan to Obtain $3 Billion in Senior Credit Lines</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt; IStar Financial Inc., the commercial
real-estate finance company that must extend debt maturities to
avoid restructuring, will discuss $3 billion in loans with
potential lenders tomorrow, according to people briefed on the
matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proceeds of the JPMorgan Chase  Co.-led financing will be
used to repay secured loans maturing in June 2011 and 2012 and a
portion of the company&#8217;s unsecured debt maturing this year,
IStar said yesterday in a statement. The company said it hasn&#8217;t
yet received commitments for the new credit line. The bank
meeting will be held at 2:30 p.m. in New York, said the people,
who declined to be identified because the talks are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jay Sugarman is trying to take
advantage of loan prices approaching a three-year high as the New
York-based company deals with $2.7 billion of debt scheduled to
mature this year. The lender&#8217;s stock and bonds have soared in
the past year as capital markets have opened to the neediest
firms and commercial real estate has stabilized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This will refinance 2011 maturities, but 2012 will
probably need to be addressed,&#8221; said Timothy Daileader,
director of research at Knight Capital Group Inc. in
Greenwich, Connecticut. &#8220;The old financing that they are
replacing was very inexpensive, so the new financing will likely
come at higher cost and eat into their profitability.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IStar has $2.67 billion in long-term debt obligations due
in 2011 and $3.42 billion maturing next year, according to a
Nov. 8 regulatory filing. The company has $8.52 billion in long-
term debt outstanding as of Sept. 30, the filing shows. The
company has posted a net loss in eight of the past nine
quarters, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Share Surge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of IStar, which has funded properties including the
Trump SoHo hotel-condominium building in lower Manhattan, have
more than doubled to $8.39 since October and are up from 76
cents in February 2009. They rose 64 cents to $9.03 at 10 a.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lender&#8217;s $501.7 million of 8.625 percent senior
unsecured bonds due in June 2013 have risen 26 cents to 101.25
cents on the dollar since March as of yesterday, according to
Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 Index
has risen 3.51 cents this year to 96.42 cents on the dollar
yesterday. On Feb. 14, the index closed at 96.48 cents on the
dollar, the highest since November 2007. The index tracks the
100 largest dollar-denominated first-lien leveraged loans, which
are usually rated below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and
lower than BBB- by SP. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Billionaire Carlos Slim&#8217;s companies
probably will reverse their decision to snub Grupo Televisa SA
and agree to buy advertising this year to reach the audience of
the world&#8217;s largest Spanish-language broadcaster, Barclays Plc
and Citigroup Inc. analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slim&#8217;s companies -- America Movil SAB, Telefonos de Mexico
SAB and Grupo Carso SAB -- eventually will strike a deal with
Televisa because both sides would benefit, said Michel Morin, an
analyst at Barclays in New York. The rivalry was probably a
factor in the decision by Slim&#8217;s companies not to purchase ads
from the broadcaster this year, the analyst said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slim&#8217;s companies won&#8217;t want to miss out on the reach of
Televisa, which controls 70 percent of Mexico&#8217;s broadcast
market, Morin said. Televisa would rather avoid a revenue
decline this year after its annual sales of advance advertising
dropped 4 percent this year with Slim&#8217;s absence, the analyst
said yesterday in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Everything is negotiable,&#8221; Morin said. &#8220;There will
probably be a desire on both parts to come to an agreement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa Executive Vice President Alfonso de Angoitia said
last week on an earnings conference call that the company, after
raising prices, had failed to sell upfront advertising this year
to companies controlled by Slim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Arturo Elias, a spokesman for Slim, said last week that
Slim&#8217;s companies had made the decision solely because of price.
Slim&#8217;s Telmex competes with the cable units of Televisa for
phone and Internet customers, and Televisa has said it plans to
enter Mexico&#8217;s mobile-phone business, where America Movil is the
top carrier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low Prices &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa has maintained for years that its advertising
rates are low, compared with other markets around the world,
Morin said. A 10 percent to 15 percent price increase would
encourage shareholders, said the analyst, who predicts that
Televisa&#8217;s U.S.-traded shares will perform in line with the rest
of the industry in the next 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa rose 15 centavos to 58.50 pesos at 9:46 a.m. New
York time in Mexico City trading. The shares had dropped 8.7
percent this year before today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Televisa official didn&#8217;t respond to phone and e-mail
messages seeking comment. A Telmex official who can&#8217;t be named
under company policy declined to comment. Slim&#8217;s advertising
purchases last year contributed 1.5 percent of Televisa&#8217;s 57.9
billion pesos ($4.77 billion) in sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slim&#8217;s request to enter the pay-TV market to compete
against Televisa has been rejected by government regulators, who
say he must first comply with rules for connecting phone calls
from competing networks. The standoff with Televisa may indicate
that Slim is interested in bidding on broadcast-TV airwaves that
the Mexican government plans to auction this year, said James Rivett, an analyst at Citigroup in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the negotiations may be just &#8220;business as usual,&#8221;
Rivett said yesterday in a research note. Slim&#8217;s companies have
normally been late participants in the &#8220;upfront&#8221; season when
advertisers buy airtime in advance, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European Central Bank Governing
Council member Mario Draghi&#8217;s career at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
is a problem for European Union governments as they seek to find
a successor for ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet, Handelsblatt
reported, citing an unidentified French official. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Draghi was at the core of the U.S. financial system, whose
&#8220;excesses&#8221; went far beyond the imaginable, the newspaper said,
citing the official. France hasn&#8217;t determined which candidate to
back as a decision won&#8217;t come before June, the Duesseldorf-based
newspaper reported today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest U.S.
oil company, reported a compressor trip and flaring at the
Beaumont, Texas, refinery, according to a filing with the U.S.
National Response Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Operations has restarted the compressor and is working to
normalize operations,&#8221; the company said in another filing with
the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality today. The
compressor trip was associated with a coker unit, the filing
showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Production was not impacted,&#8221; Kevin Allexon, a company
spokesman based in Fairfax, Virginia, said today in an e-mail.
The compressor was restarted, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flaring associated with the trip began yesterday at about 2
p.m. local time and lasted until almost 8 a.m. today, according
to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refinery outages can increase prices for refined products
as refiners turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts. Operational disruptions can also depress prices for
crude oil because less feedstock is needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Irving, Texas-based company had a release of hydrogen
sulfide and sulfur dioxide from a flare stack at the refinery,
according to an earlier filing with the U.S. National Response
Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. refineries must notify the National Response Center if
they release hazardous substances in excess of reportable
quantities, according to the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as
Superfund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plant can process 359,100 barrels of crude a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Mark Shenk" date="Feb 24, 2011  4:09 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-24/oil-advances-to-29-month-high-on-libyan-unrest-goldman-sees-upside-risk-.html"><headline>Oil Retreats on Assurances Libyan Shipments Can Be Replaced</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Crude in New York retreated from the
highest level in 29 months on assurances from the U.S., Saudi
Arabia and the International Energy Agency that they can
compensate for any disruption of Libyan shipments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil slipped after President Barack Obama said the U.S. will
be able to &#8220;ride out&#8221; a cut resulting from turmoil in Libya.
The crisis has trimmed supply by 500,000 to 750,000 barrels a
day, the IEA said today. The cuts create &#8220;significant upside
risk&#8221; to prices, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It looks like the assurances that any missing barrels
will be made up are finally having an impact,&#8221; said Gene McGillian, an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
Stamford, Connecticut. &#8220;Nothing appears to have changed in
Libya and there&#8217;s still quite a geopolitical premium in the
market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude oil for April delivery declined 82 cents, or 0.8
percent, to settle at $97.28 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The contract touched $103.41, the highest intraday
price since Sept. 29, 2008. Futures are up 22 percent from a
year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent oil for April settlement rose 11 cents to $111.36 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, the
highest close since Aug. 29, 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICE raised the margin requirement on its oil contracts
today by 7 percent. It was the second increase this week,
bringing the total to 14 percent. The latest change goes into
effect tomorrow. Margins represent cash that traders must
deposit to safeguard transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you have the margin raised, that takes capital out of
your position,&#8221; said Carl Larry, president of Oil Outlooks 
Opinions LLC in Houston. &#8220;You have to reduce your position to
balance your margin account.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IEA Offer &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IEA said that it is ready to release emergency oil
stockpiles, if needed. The Paris-based agency, founded in 1974
in response to the Arab oil embargo, advises 28 developed
nations, including the U.S., Japan and Germany. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We actually think that we&#8217;ll be able to ride out the Libya situation and it will stabilize,&#8221; Obama said to members
of his outside council on jobs and competitiveness at the White
House. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia and other members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries said they won&#8217;t wait for an
emergency meeting of the group to increase output, according to
a person with knowledge of producer-nation policy. Any extra
supply would be conditional on requests for more crude, the
person said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market started to break hard when the International
Energy Agency came out saying how much oil they have and that
they&#8217;ll release oil if they need to,&#8221; said Phil Flynn, vice
president of research at PFGBest in Chicago. &#8220;Earlier in the
day, Saudi Arabia was talking to the refiners.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libyan Output &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libya, which pumps 1.6 million barrels of oil a day, is the
ninth-largest producer among the 12 members of OPEC, shipping
most of its crude and fuels across the Mediterranean to Europe.
The country has the largest reserves in Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total SA and OMV AG became the latest energy producers to
scale back operations, following Eni SpA, RWE AG and BASF SE&#8217;s
Wintershall unit. China National Petroleum Corp. said it
relocated 47 of its Libyan-based workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opponents of Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi consolidated
control over the oil-rich east while he clamped down on Tripoli,
using tanks to block highways and security forces to attack
residents, witnesses said. Foreign governments stepped up
efforts to extract their citizens from what fleeing Egyptians
said is turning into a bloodbath. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The big fear is that the unrest will spread to other
major oil-producing countries such as Algeria, or God forbid,
Saudi Arabia,&#8221; said Adam Sieminski, chief energy economist at
Deutsche Bank in Washington. &#8220;The big question now is what $100
oil will mean for the economy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spreading Unrest &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libya is the latest nation to be rocked by protests ignited
by the ouster of Tunisia&#8217;s president last month and fanned by
the Feb. 11 fall of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
Disturbances have spread to Iran, Bahrain, Yemen and Algeria. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When geopolitics in the Middle East are at play in the
oil markets, all conventional bets on the direction of oil
prices based on supply and demand fundamentals are off,&#8221; said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity-markets strategy at BNP
Paribas SA in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countries in North Africa and the Middle East were
responsible for 36 percent of global oil output and held 61
percent of proved reserves in 2009, according to BP Plc, which
publishes its Statistical Review of World Energy each June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. crude-oil stockpiles climbed by 822,000 barrels to
346.7 million last week, a sixth straight increase, a weekly
Energy Department report showed. A 1.1 million-barrel gain was
projected, according to the median estimate of 15 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasoline Stockpiles &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasoline inventories tumbled 2.8 million barrels to 238.3
million in the week ended Feb. 18, the first drop this year, the
department said. Analysts forecast that stockpiles advanced
850,000 barrels last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 1.08
million contracts as of 3:26 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled
1.28 million contracts yesterday, 67 percent above the average
of the past three months. Open interest was 1.52 million
contracts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy Kroger Co.
options before the largest U.S. grocery-store chain reports
earnings next month, as food inflation and unstable energy
prices will drive volatility, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derivatives strategists John Marshall and Katherine Fogertey recommended buying July $22 puts and July $23 calls, a
strategy known as a &#8220;strangle.&#8221; The strategists cited analyst
Adrianne Shapira, who&#8217;s had a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on Kroger since
December and a price forecast of $25. Cincinnati-based Kroger
dropped 0.6 percent to $22.97 today. The company is scheduled to
report earnings on March 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While Kroger has committed to passing on nominal price
increases, a sharp rise in agriculture inputs and food inflation
could present headwinds to Kroger&#8217;s ability to smoothly pass on
pricing, placing margins at risk as the year progresses,&#8221; the
strategists wrote in a note today. &#8220;We view July options as
attractive&#8221; because implied volatility is low given the risks
to the share price, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kroger will report fourth-quarter profit of 44 cents a
share excluding some items, according to the average of 17
estimates from a Bloomberg survey of analysts. In December, the
grocer tumbled 9.4 percent, the most in a year, after lowering
the top end of its full-year profit forecast. Kroger advanced
4.9 percent in the past year, compared with a 8.1 percent gain
for a gauge of consumer-staples companies in the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategists also said rising energy prices may result
in higher input costs and pressured sales, increasing
uncertainty for demand, according to the note. Oil yesterday
surged to $100 a barrel, a 28-month high, amid growing tensions
in the Middle East. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade will profit if shares close above $25.50 or below
$19.50 at expiration on July 15, the note said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s patent-
infringement claims against TiVo Inc. will be investigated by a
U.S. trade agency that has the power to block imports of TiVo&#8217;s
television set-top boxes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. International Trade Commission said today it would
investigate a complaint filed by Microsoft on Feb. 24.
Microsoft, the world&#8217;s biggest software maker, claims that set-
top boxes made by TiVo infringe four of its patents. TiVo, based
in Alviso, California, makes the devices in Mexico, according to
the Microsoft complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case before the trade agency expands a legal battle
that began more than a year ago when Microsoft challenged TiVo
patents after TiVo sued ATT Inc., a customer of Microsoft, over
the same patents. A separate lawsuit was filed by Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft claiming that TiVo infringed seven
Microsoft patents. The two sides are in talks to settle the
dispute, Microsoft said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four patents in the ITC case, which may be completed
within 15 months, relate to program schedules and selection,
controlling the interface, and a way to restrict use of the
digital-video recorder based on a program&#8217;s rating. Microsoft
said the technology is used in its Mediaroom software that runs
on competing set-top boxes including ATT&#8217;s U-Verse service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In the Matter of Set-Top Boxes, and Hardware

&lt;p&gt;Oil climbed to the highest in 30
months in London as Libya&#8217;s violent uprising reduced supplies
from Africa&#8217;s third-biggest producer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent rose above $119 a barrel on estimates the revolt
caused Libya to lose as much as two-thirds of its oil output.
Futures in New York gained for a sixth day, after climbing above
$100 a barrel. The cuts create &#8220;significant upside risk&#8221; to
prices and any further disruptions could create severe shortages
in global oil markets, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When geopolitics in the Middle East are at play in the
oil markets, all conventional bets on the direction of oil
prices based on supply and demand fundamentals are off,&#8221; said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity-markets strategy at BNP
Paribas SA in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent oil for April settlement rose as much as $8.54, or
7.7 percent, to $119.79 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange, the highest since Aug. 21, 2008. The contract traded
at $115.15 at 1:13 p.m. London time. It has rallied 12 percent
this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude for April delivery on the New York Mercantile
Exchange gained as much as $5.31, or 5.4 percent, to $103.41 a
barrel in electronic trading. Yesterday, it added $2.68 at
$98.10, the highest settlement since Oct. 1, 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libya, which pumps 1.6 million barrels a day of oil, is the
ninth-largest producer among the 12 members of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries, shipping most of its crude and
fuels across the Mediterranean to Europe. The country has the
largest reserves in Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Output Halt &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as 1 million barrels of Libya&#8217;s daily oil
production may have been shut, Barclays Capital said in a report
yesterday. Goldman Sachs estimated disruptions at 500,000
barrels a day. Total SA and OMV AG became the latest energy
producers to scale back operations, following Eni SpA, RWE AG
and BASF SE&#8217;s Wintershall unit. China National Petroleum Corp.
said it relocated 47 of its Libyan-based workforce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York futures retreated from an intraday high of $100 a
barrel yesterday after Saudi Arabia and other countries said
they won&#8217;t wait for an emergency meeting of OPEC to increase
output, according to a person with knowledge of producer-nation
policy. Any extra supply would be conditional on requests for
more crude, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;One reason we haven&#8217;t seen a far more aggressive rally is
because from an OPEC spare capacity perspective they are far
healthier now,&#8221; Soozhana Choi, head of Asian commodities
research at Deutsche Bank AG in Singapore, told Rishaad Salamat
on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;On the Move.&#8221; &#8220;Beyond spare
capacity, if you look at commercial inventories, they are quite
healthy as well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Inventories &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasoline prices advanced to their highest since September
2008. Contracts of the fuel for March settlement on the Nymex
gained as much as 14.1 cents to $2.8560 a gallon. The motor fuel
also reached similar highs in Europe to trade at $980 a ton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude stockpiles in the U.S., the world&#8217;s largest oil user,
climbed 163,000 barrels last week, the industry-funded American
Petroleum Institute said yesterday. An Energy Department report
today may show supplies increased 1.1 million barrels in the
seven days ended Feb. 18 from 345.9 million, according to the
median estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libya is the latest nation to be rocked by protests ignited
by the ouster of Tunisia&#8217;s president last month and fanned by
the Feb. 11 fall of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
Disturbances have spread to Iran, Bahrain, Yemen and Algeria. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unrest in Bahrain, which is linked to Saudi Arabia by a 26-
kilometer (16-mile) causeway, has in the past spread across the
border. In 1995, the Saudi government arrested a large number of
Shiite Muslims on suspicion of involvement in protests taking
place in Bahrain, said New York-based Human Rights Watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$220 Oil &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices may surge to $220 a barrel if more production is
halted in Libya and Algeria, analysts at Nomura Holdings Inc.,
led by Michael Lo in Hong Kong, said yesterday in a note.
Algeria is also an OPEC member. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is room for spikes, possibly to $175,&#8221; Carl Larry,
president of Oil Outlooks  Opinions LLC in Houston, told Susan Li on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;First Up.&#8221; &#8220;Something like that

such attacks had resulted in the loss of &#8220;project-financing
information with regard to oil and gas field bids and
operations.&#8221; In its report, Santa Clara, California-based
McAfee, assisted by other cyber-security firms, didn&#8217;t identify
the energy companies targeted. The attacks, which it dubbed
&#8220;Night Dragon,&#8221; originated &#8220;primarily in China&#8221; and occurred
during the past three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of companies hit, none of which disclosed the
attacks in filings with regulators, also includes Marathon Oil
Corp., ConocoPhillips and Baker Hughes Inc., according to the
people who worked on or are familiar with the companies&#8217;
investigations and asked not to be identified because of the
confidential nature of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese hackers broke into the computer network of Baker
Hughes, said Gary Flaharty, spokesman for the Houston-based
provider of advanced drilling technology. Baker Hughes concluded
the incident didn&#8217;t need to be disclosed because it wasn&#8217;t
material to investors, he said, declining to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undetected Access &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some of the cases, hackers had undetected access to
company networks for more than a year, said Greg Hoglund, chief
executive officer of Sacramento, California-based HBGary Inc., a
cyber-security company that investigated some of the security
breaches at oil companies. Hoglund, who was cited by McAfee as a
contributor to its report, declined to identify his clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Legal information, information on deals and financial
information are all things that appear to be getting targeted,&#8221;
Hoglund said, summing up conclusions his firm made from the
types of documents and persons targeted by the hackers. &#8220;This
is straight up industrial espionage.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hackers targeted computerized topographical maps worth
&#8220;millions of dollars&#8221; that show locations of potential oil
reserves, said Ed Skoudis, whose company, Washington-based
InGuardians Inc., investigated two recent breaches of U.S. oil
companies&#8217; networks. He declined to name his clients or the
origin of the hackers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Unsophisticated&#8217; Techniques &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The McAfee report described the techniques used to get into
the energy company computers as &#8220;unsophisticated&#8221; and commonly
used by Chinese hackers. The attacks began in November 2009,
McAfee said. Two cyber investigators familiar with the probes
said the attacks began even earlier -- in 2008 -- and involved
several well-financed groups. The investigators asked not to be
identified because the company investigations are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McAfee based the report on information gathered from its
own work on the breaches and from others who were directly
involved in investigating them. The report, produced on the
condition that the affected companies not be identified, was
done to &#8220;educate the community,&#8221; said Ian Bain, a McAfee
spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thefts of oil company data like those in the McAfee
report match the profile of industrial espionage operations that
have the backing or consent of the Chinese government, said Joel Brenner, former head of U.S. counterintelligence during the Bush
and Obama administrations and now a lawyer with Cooley LLP in Washington. In his former post, one of Brenner&#8217;s jobs was
tracking spying efforts against U.S. companies from foreign
countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;On the Hunt&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Chinese are on the hunt for natural resources to fuel
this massive economic leap forward,&#8221; Brenner said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ma Zhaoxu, spokesman for China&#8217;s Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, said he had no information about the attacks on the oil
companies when asked about the issue at a regular briefing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Chinese government opposes hacking activities,&#8221; Ma
said. &#8220;China falls victim to hacking itself. We will step up
efforts to crack down on hacking crimes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thefts might trigger legal liability for companies that
chose not to disclose them to investors, said Blair Nicholas, a
San Diego-based partner at law firm Bernstein Litowitz Berger
and Grossman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To the extent that there aren&#8217;t adequate procedures in
place to protect the companies&#8217; crown jewels and somebody gets
the key to jewelry box, there is certainly potential for
shareholder derivative liability,&#8221; Nicholas said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Securities Laws &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors might also argue they had a right under U.S.
securities laws to be informed of the thefts, which a judge
might construe as a &#8220;material&#8221; fact that should have been
disclosed, Nicholas said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Roper, a spokesman for Houston-based ConocoPhillips;
Lee Warren, a Marathon Oil spokeswoman at its Houston
headquarters, and Alan Jeffers, a spokesman for Irving, Texas-
based Exxon, said in e-mail messages that their companies don&#8217;t
comment on security-related issues. David Nicholas, a spokesman
for London-based BP, and Kim Blomley, a spokesman in London for
Shell, which is based in The Hague, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenny Shearer, an FBI spokeswoman in Washington, said she
couldn&#8217;t comment on whether the agency was investigating the
attacks. Laura Sweeney, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said
the department can&#8217;t comment on a possible investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hacker Activists &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some aspects of the attacks were disclosed in internal e-
mails made public after a February security breach at HBGary.
The e-mails were stolen from HBGary&#8217;s computer network by the
group of hacker activists called Anonymous, which posted them on
the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;ve been able to confirm that the same attackers are
conducting coordinated IP thefts against Baker Hughes and Shell
Oil, going after bid data and operational reporting, as well as
projects/plans and related financial information,&#8221; according to
an e-mail written on Jan. 13 by an independent security
consultant working on the cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I reached out to some friends at Conoco and Exxon and
they also experienced similar breaches,&#8221; the consultant wrote
in the e-mail. &#8220;This is of course client confidential,&#8221; he
added under the subject line &#8220;coordinated Chinese attacks on
oil companies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate e-mail, an HBGary investigator discussed the
analysis of malware designed to steal data in the computers of a
drilling rig working on a ConocoPhillips project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc Zwillinger, an attorney representing HBGary, declined
to comment on the e-mails&#8217; content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Stolen E-Mails&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Those are stolen e-mails and they contain confidential
information relating to clients,&#8221; Zwillinger said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The McAfee report, which cites several attacks connected to
the Chinese hacking underground, doesn&#8217;t link the &#8220;Night
Dragon&#8221; attack directly to the Chinese government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts who assessed the attacks on energy companies said
the source of the breaches was easier to pinpoint than in
previous hits by Chinese hackers, including an attack against Google Inc. that that company disclosed in January 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hackers used tools prevalent in China&#8217;s underground
hacking forums, the McAfee report said, and they appeared to
work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Beijing time. McAfee traced the
hackers&#8217; command-and-control operations to servers operated by a
company in China&#8217;s Heze City in Shandong province. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owner of the company, Song Zhiyue, said he wasn&#8217;t aware
of any hacking taking place from his servers and that he always
seeks to verify the activities of customers who rent server
space from him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are so many servers in the world,&#8221; Song said.
&#8220;This has nothing to do with me. This is very unfair.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Walt Disney Co. and Viacom Inc.&#8217;s Paramount Pictures are among Hollywood&#8217;s biggest movie studios
that lost a piracy lawsuit in Australia as an appeals court
upheld a ruling that a local internet provider wasn&#8217;t
responsible for customers illegally downloading films. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Court of Australia Full Court, in a two-one
decision, today upheld Judge Dennis Cowdroy&#8217;s Feb. 4, 2010,
verdict that vindicated iiNet Ltd. The studios can appeal the
ruling to the country&#8217;s High Court and a notice must be filed
within 28 days, unless an extension is sought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Village Roadshow Ltd.&#8217;s Roadshow Films led the companies
trying to stop iiNet customers from using BitTorrent software to
illegally download copyrighted films, in a precedent-setting
case for all Internet providers in Australia. A ruling in the
studios&#8217; favor would have made all Internet providers liable for
their customers&#8217; conduct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The evidence supports a conclusion that iiNet
demonstrated a dismissive and, indeed, contumelious, attitude to
the complaints of infringement,&#8221; Judge Arthur Emmett wrote.
&#8220;Its conduct did not amount to authorization of the primary
acts of infringement on the part of iiNet users.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iiNet rose 2 percent to A$2.55 at the 4:10 p.m. close of
trading on the Australian Stock Exchange, reversing an earlier
decline of 1.6 percent. The stock has slid 12 percent this year,
compared with a 1.4 percent gain for the SP/ASX 200 index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also appealing Cowdroy&#8217;s ruling were Time Warner Inc.&#8217;s
Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc., Twentieth Century Fox Film
Corp., a unit of News Corp., and 30 other entities who owned or
had exclusive licenses to commercially released films. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future Lawsuits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s victory for iiNet doesn&#8217;t protect Internet
providers from future lawsuits and that they may be found
liable, Emmett said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It does not necessarily follow from the failure of the
present proceeding that circumstances could not exist whereby
iiNet might in the future be held to have authorized primary
acts of infringement,&#8221; Emmett wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Roadshow Films Pty. Ltd. v iiNet Ltd.
NSD179/2010, Federal Court of Australia (Sydney.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest U.S.
oil company, flared gases at its Joliet refinery in Channahon, Illinois, for more than 29 hours, according to a filing with
state regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The filing to the Illinois Emergency Management Agency
didn&#8217;t say what caused the flaring or why it occurred for so
long before being discovered at 5:20 p.m. local time yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Operating conditions necessitated flaring, there was no
impact on production,&#8221; Tricia Simpson, an Illinois-based
company spokeswoman, said in an e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refinery outages can increase prices for refined products
as refiners turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts. Operational disruptions can also depress prices for
crude oil because less feedstock is needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery has a processing capacity of 248,000 barrels a
day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase  Co. boosted its
2011 oil-price forecast for Brent oil by $9 to $104 a barrel,
citing supply shut-ins in Libya. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $104 forecast &#8220;assumes that supply problems will be
limited to Libya, that OPEC will supply additional oil and that
demand for precautionary inventories will moderate over time
from their crisis-levels of today,&#8221; analysts led by Lawrence Eagles in New York said in a note to clients today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a &#8220;smaller but significant chance&#8221; prices could
head toward $180 a barrel if the disruptions spread, with the
probability at 5 percent, the report showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent will likely average $108 a barrel in the first
quarter of the year, a 7.9 percent increase from its quarterly
average to date of $100.08 a barrel, the report said. JPMorgan
also raised its 2012 forecast by $5 to $110. The previous
forecasts were issued on Dec. 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent crude oil for April settlement rose 78 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $112.14 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. Yesterday, it touched $119.79, the highest
price since Aug. 22, 2008. Brent gained 9.2 percent this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also changed its estimates for West Texas
Intermediate in the U.S., increasing the 2011 forecast by $4 to
$97 a barrel and lowering the 2012 outlook by $1 to $103. The
oil will likely average $96 a barrel in the first quarter of
this year, the report showed. Oil has averaged $89.47 so far
this quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil for April delivery gained 60 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
settle at $97.88 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Oil touched $103.41 yesterday, the highest intraday price since
Sept. 29, 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protalix BioTherapeutics Inc. (PLX) fell
the most in two years in New York trading after it failed to win
U.S. approval of a plant-based medicine it&#8217;s developing with
Pfizer Inc. (PFE) to treat Gaucher disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protalix, based in Carmiel, Israel, dropped $1.73, or 18
percent, to $7.63 at 4:04 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading, the biggest percentage decline since Dec. 1,
2008. Pfizer fell 4 cents to $18.86. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration asked for more data from
two studies and information on testing specifications in the new
drug application for taliglucerase alfa, developed to treat
Gaucher disease, an inherited illness that causes fat build-up
that can lead to lung disease and brain damage, Protalix said
today in a statement. No new trials were requested. The drug
would compete with Genzyme Corp.&#8217;s top-selling Cerezyme and
Shire Plc (SHP)&#8217;s Vpriv. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t think this is going to be a very long process,&#8221;
Protalix Chief Executive Officer David Aviezer told analysts and
investors on a conference call today. The company plans to work
closely with Pfizer and request a meeting with the FDA as soon
as possible to determine what needs to be done for approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taliglucerase is the first product for Protalix. The
medicine is designed to replace an enzyme missing in people with
Gaucher disease, a disorder that causes fat to build up in the
liver, spleen, bone marrow and nervous system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rivals&#8217; Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cerezyme had global sales of $719.6 million last year for
Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Genzyme, a 42 percent decline
from two years ago because of manufacturing issues. Vpriv,
chemically known as velaglucerase alfa, generated sales of $143
million for Dublin-based Shire after being approved by the FDA
in February 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Importantly, it does not appear that the FDA has
significant safety concerns with taliglucerase,&#8221; said Brian Abrahams, an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities in New York, in a
note to clients today. &#8220;Rather, given the improving supply of
Genzyme&#8217;s Cerezyme and availability of Shire&#8217;s velaglucerase,
the agency likely prefers to wait for a more complete dataset
for patients on taliglucerase prior to approval.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaucher disease affects about 1 in every 50,000 to 100,000
people and can lead to bone pain, anemia, lung disease or brain
damage, according to the National Human Genome Research
Institute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taliglucerase, once approved, may win at least 15 percent
of patients &#8220;through strong marketing and competitive
pricing,&#8221; said Ritu Baral, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity in
New York, in a Feb. 22 note to clients. Cerezyme costs more than
$200,000 a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, paid $60 million for
rights to taliglucerase in November 2009 and promised Protalix
an additional $55 million if the drug passed certain regulatory
hurdles. New York-based Pfizer is entitled to 60 percent of the
drug&#8217;s revenue under the licensing agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanofi-Aventis SA of Paris said Feb. 16 it would buy
Genzyme for at least $20.1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, had its credit outlook upgraded by Standard  Poor&#8217;s, which said the lender&#8217;s profit is likely to
rise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outlook was raised to &#8220;stable&#8221; from &#8220;negative&#8221;
because the New York-based firm &#8220;is well-positioned to resume
significant earnings growth as the general economy recovers,&#8221;
SP said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The credit rater said JPMorgan has a &#8220;very strong
competitive position&#8221; and implicit backing for the company&#8217;s
debt from the federal government because of the bank&#8217;s size and
importance in the global economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The stable outlook assumes that JPM&#8217;s earnings and
capitalization will continue to strengthen, and that it will
retain a sound funding and liquidity position,&#8221; SP said. New
York-based SP also warned that JPMorgan&#8217;s ratings could fall if
the credit quality of the bank&#8217;s lending book deteriorates or if home prices significantly decline. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects description of SSG founders in the fifth,
sixth paragraphs of story originally published Feb. 25.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
special situations-group chief Richard Ruzika plans to
leave and will be replaced by Jason Brown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruzika, 51, who has run the unit that invests in
distressed assets since 2007, will retire at the end of
April, Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and
President Gary Cohn wrote in a Feb. 17 memo obtained by
Bloomberg News. Brown, who has led the group in Asia since
2007, will remain in Hong Kong, according to a separate
memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group, known as SSG, began in Asia more than a
decade ago before expanding into Europe and the Americas.
While SSG&#8217;s overall performance isn&#8217;t made public, some of
its one-time gains and losses are included in company
disclosures. The group&#8217;s sale of Horizon Wind Energy LLC in
2007 generated about $900 million in gains, and it made
about $500 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 from the
recovery of failed Japanese golf courses that it purchased. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based
Goldman Sachs, confirmed the content of the memos. The
moves were reported earlier today by the New York Times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Briger, who left in 2001 and is now co-chairman
of Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG), and Edward Mule, now CEO
of Silver Point Capital LP, started the Asia business,
according to three people with knowledge of the group who
declined to be identified because the details haven&#8217;t been
disclosed by the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York Jet &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark McGoldrick, who left in 2007 to start Mount
Kellett Capital Management LP, became co-head of the global
business with Ralph Rosenberg in 2003, according to a
Goldman Sachs memo at the time, and later led the group
with Stephen McGuinness. Ruzika became co-head with
McGuinness and sole head when McGuinness moved into Goldman
Sachs Asset Management in 2008, according to one of the
people familiar with evolution of the unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruzika joined Goldman Sachs in 1982 as a silver and
gold trader. He became head of global commodities in 2000
and co-head of global macro trading in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruzika played football at Columbia University and was
signed by the New York Jets in 1981 as a tight end before
he decided he didn&#8217;t want to play football and left
training camp, according to a New York Times article at the
time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance Not Public &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm has never given detailed results of the
special-situations group, which had been included in the
fixed-income, currencies and commodities revenue segment.
Last month, the company changed the way it disclosed
financial information, moving SSG to a new investing and
lending division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer David Viniar
said last month that there&#8217;s a chance some activities in
the firm&#8217;s investing and lending segment won&#8217;t be allowed
by new regulatory rules. SSG shouldn&#8217;t be affected by the
Dodd-Frank Act&#8217;s prohibition on proprietary trading because
most of the group &#8220;is actually a lending business,&#8221;
Viniar told analysts on Oct. 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators are in the process of implementing the
Volcker rule, which was passed as part of Dodd-Frank in
July. The Federal Reserve confirmed this month that banks
would generally have two years to comply after the rule
takes effect. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase  Co. revised down
its first-quarter growth estimate for the U.S. economy to an
annual rate of 3.5 percent from a prior forecast of 4 percent,
according to chief U.S. economist Michael Feroli. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Consumers stumbled a bit to start the year,&#8221; Feroli
wrote in a note e-mailed to clients today. &#8220;The recent rise in
energy prices poses a notable headwind.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economy expanded at a 2.8 percent rate in the fourth
quarter, less than the earlier estimate of 3.2 percent as state
and local government spending declined, the Commerce Department
reported earlier today. Consumer spending grew at a 4.1 percent
rate, compared with a prior estimate of 4.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lifland did dismiss Picard&#8217;s claim seeking the immediate
turnover of transferred funds. Picard sued Chais and related
entities in May 2009 saying Chais was a beneficiary of the Ponzi
scheme for at least 30 years and &#8220;knew or should have known
that they were reaping the benefits of manipulated purported
returns, false documents and fictitious profits.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chais, who was among Madoff&#8217;s largest investors, denied
wrongdoing and said he was duped by Madoff. Chais died in
September at age 84. The defendants in the Picard suit are Chais
family members and trusts that the family oversees, according to
Lifland&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philip White, an attorney for the Chais entities, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a voice-mail left after regular business
hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff pleaded guilty and is serving a 150-year prison
sentence. At the time of his arrest in December 2008, his
account statements reflected 4,900 accounts with stated balances
of $68 billion. Investors lost about $20 billion in principal,
Picard has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. Chais, 09-01172, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Wins Claims Dismissal in Auction-Rate Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Bank of America Corp. won dismissal of claims by investors
that it misled them about the liquidity of its auction-rate
securities and manipulated the market for the investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White in San Francisco said
yesterday in an order that investors can renew market-
manipulation claims if they add more information to their case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors who bought auction-rated securities from 2003 to
2008 sued Bank of America in 2009 on claims the securities were
offered as safe, cash-like investments while the company hid
their risks. Banks running auctions abandoned the $330 billion
market in 2008 during the subprime market slump, and investors
were stuck with the products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, agreed
in October 2008 to buy back $4.5 billion in auction-rate
securities and pay a $50 million fine, in accords with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission and New York State. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plaintiffs in the San Francisco case haven&#8217;t benefited from
the settlement and continue to hold the securities or sold them
at a loss, according to White&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan Girard, an attorney for investors, didn&#8217;t immediately
return a voice-mail message seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bondar v. Bank of America, 08-02599, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NFL, Union Argue Television Revenue Advance Before U.S. Judge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A U.S. judge said he will rule quickly on the legal fight
between the National Football League and its players union over
about $4 billion in television money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NFL Players Association wants U.S. District Judge David
Doty in Minneapolis to overturn an arbitrator&#8217;s decision
allowing the league to keep the broadcast rights fees that the
union says were improperly negotiated so owners would receive
money from networks even if there&#8217;s a work stoppage that cancels
games in the 2011 season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom Heiden, a lawyer for the union, said in court in
Minneapolis yesterday that the television deals provided owners
with a &#8220;$4 billion war chest, every dollar of which is
available to them to finance their 2011 lockout.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This plan was so important that those TV deals would
never have been done without these lockout provisions,&#8221; Heiden
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owners voted in 2008 to opt out of the league&#8217;s labor deal
with players, which expires next week, saying it didn&#8217;t account
for costs such as those of building stadiums. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The league says the television deals were negotiated in
good faith. Gregg Levy, a lawyer for the NFL, said in court that
the league also earned hundreds of millions of dollars in new
broadcast money by redistributing some digital rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s no evidence at all that the NFL traded dollars,
or the potential for dollars, in 2010 for rights in 2011,&#8221; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is White v. NFL, 4:92-cv-00906, U.S. District
Court for the District of Minnesota (Minneapolis). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michigan Foreclosures-by-Advertising Surprise Homeowners &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chuck and Alicia Krantz fell behind on their mortgage
payments last year and sought to modify the loan to save their
three-bedroom ranch home in Westland, Michigan, just outside
Detroit, from foreclosure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two payments in April brought them current, they said in a
lawsuit filed in Detroit federal court. In May, CitiMortgage
Inc., a unit of Citigroup Inc., told them they were in
foreclosure and would be refunded the $3,129.96 they sent the
month before. As foreclosure proceeded, they continued to pursue
a modification, Chuck Krantz said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CitiMortgage sent a modification package in May, requesting
documents. Even as they discussed the modification with
CitiMortgage, an advertisement announcing the foreclosure was
published, said Adam Alexander, the Krantzes&#8217; lawyer. The home
was sold at a sheriff&#8217;s auction in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homeowners nationwide claim that banks and loan servicers
are pushing through foreclosures, or arbitrarily rejecting or
ignoring loan-modification requests, Bloomberg News&#8217;s Margaret
Cronin Fisk reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CitiMortgage denied the Krantzes&#8217; claims. The company
&#8220;admits only that it sent plaintiffs a notice under the &#8216;Making
Home Affordable&#8217; Program on May 26, 2010,&#8221; its lawyers said in
court papers. Making Home Affordable is the federal home-loan
modification program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Krantzes provided documents, they &#8220;were
repeatedly advised that their modification application was
incomplete,&#8221; the lawyers said in the Feb. 3 filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the case is without merit,&#8221; Robert Julavits,
a Citigroup spokesman, said in an e-mail. &#8220;We plan to defend
our position vigorously.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Krantz v. CitiMortgage, 2:11-cv-10371, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Michigan (Detroit). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beckman Coulter Sued by Investor Over $6 Billion Danaher Bid &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beckman Coulter Inc., the medical-diagnostic equipment
maker being bought by microscope maker Danaher Corp. for $6.8
billion, was sued by a shareholder who says the company is worth
more than the $83.50-a-share bid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directors of Brea, California-based Beckman Coulter didn&#8217;t
meet their obligation to get the best price for shareholders in
a sale, Yuri Levin said Feb. 23 in a complaint in Delaware
Chancery Court in Wilmington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale price &#8220;is unfair and grossly inadequate&#8221;
considering the prospect for growth, and officials have a self-
interest in selling the company because &#8220;the board and certain
officers would receive an aggregate of approximately $42
million&#8221; by cashing out stock, Levin contends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danaher, based in Washington, said Feb. 7 it agreed to buy
Beckman Coulter amid increased demand for medical tests from an
aging population. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As a matter of policy, we don&#8217;t comment on lawsuits,&#8221;
Mary Luthy, a Beckman Coulter spokeswoman, said yesterday in a
phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Levin v. Beckman Coulter Inc., CA6213, Delaware
Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publicis Groupe, MSLGroup Sued for Gender Discrimination &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publicis Groupe and MSLGroup were sued and accused of
discriminating against female public-relations employees in pay,
promotions and firings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monique da Silva Moore, a former global health-care
director for MSLGroup, a unit of Paris-based Publicis Groupe,
sued yesterday in federal court in New York, claiming that men
dominate senior management at a company where 70 percent of the
employees are women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Publicis&#8217;s glass ceiling might as well be a cement
wall,&#8221; da Silva Moore said in the complaint. &#8220;Gender
discrimination permeates Publicis&#8217;s entire PR practice.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Da Silva Moore seeks to represent a class of hundreds of
current and former U.S. public-relations employees of Publicis
and MSLGroup and claims more than $100 million in damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We generally do not comment on pending litigation, but we
can say that the fact that the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission dismissed Ms. da Silva&#8217;s charge reflects the lack of
merit to her claims,&#8221; Trudi Harris, a spokeswoman for MSLGroup,
said in an e-mailed statement. She said the company expects the
court will reach the same conclusion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janette Wipper, a lawyer for da Silva, said in an e-mailed
statement that the EEOC &#8220;did not issue any finding concerning
our client&#8217;s charge.&#8221; The agency&#8217;s investigation has no bearing
on the lawsuit, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peggy Nahmany, a spokeswoman for Publicis, had no comment
on the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Da Silva Moore v. Publicis Groupe, 1:11-cv-
01279, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAP Asks Court to Reduce Oracle Award or Order New Trial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; SAP AG, the business-software maker that a jury found
should pay $1.3 billion to rival Oracle Corp., asked a judge to
hold a new trial or reduce the award to no more than $407.8
million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle didn&#8217;t provide sufficient evidence to justify the
verdict, a &#8220;miscarriage of justice,&#8221; Walldorf, Germany-based
SAP said Feb. 23 in papers in federal court in Oakland,
California. SAP said Feb. 3 it would seek to overturn the jury
award, the largest ever for copyright infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new trial isn&#8217;t needed and the verdict should stand,
Oracle said in filings. Oracle, based in Redwood City,
California, accused SAP&#8217;s U.S.-based TomorrowNow software-
maintenance unit of making hundreds of thousands of illegal
downloads and several thousand copies of Oracle&#8217;s software to
avoid licensing fees and steal customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Oracle Corp. v SAP AG, 07-01658, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of California (Oakland). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-U.S. Mortgage President Sentenced to 14 Years for Fraud &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former president of U.S. Mortgage was sentenced to 14
years in prison after admitting to a conspiracy that prosecutors
said defrauded credit unions and Fannie Mae of $136 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael J. McGrath Jr., 47, of Montclair, New Jersey,
pleaded guilty in June 2009 to one count each of conspiracy to
commit money laundering and conspiracy to commit mail and wire
fraud. U.S. District Judge Katharine S. Hayden sentenced McGrath
yesterday in Newark, New Jersey, U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said
in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Mortgage, based in Pine Brook, New Jersey, underwrote
mortgages and serviced loans for credit unions before filing for
bankruptcy in 2009. Starting in 2002, McGrath fraudulently sold
credit-union loans to Fannie Mae and used the proceeds to
finance U.S. Mortgage&#8217;s operations and investments for himself
and his company, Fishman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conceal the fraudulent sales, U.S. Mortgage Chief
Financial Officer Leroy Hayden, 47, provided false reports to
credit unions saying loans that had been sold were still in
their portfolios, according to the statement. Hayden, who
pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud, is scheduled to be
sentenced next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McGrath&#8217;s lawyer, Michael Critchley, didn&#8217;t immediately
return a call seeking comment after regular business hours
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is USA v. Michael J. McGrath Jr.,09-436 U.S.
District Court, District of New Jersey (Newark). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Taylor, Bean Official Admits Guilt in $1.9 Billion Fraud &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ex-treasurer of Taylor, Bean  Whitaker Mortgage Corp.,
once the 12th-largest mortgage lender in the U.S., admitted
helping run a $1.9 billion fraud scheme that targeted the
government&#8217;s Troubled Asset Relief Program and contributed to
the failure of Colonial Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desiree Brown, 45, pleaded guilty yesterday in federal
court in Alexandria, Virginia, to a single fraud conspiracy
count and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors bringing Lee
Farkas, former chairman of Taylor Bean, to trial on April 4.
Brown also settled a civil suit with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until yesterday, Farkas, 58, was the only person charged in
what the government said was a massive scheme to deceive
financial firms and TARP by covering up shortfalls at Taylor
Bean. Farkas was charged in a 16-count indictment in June and
faces the possibility of spending the rest of his life in
prison, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Were there other people besides Mr. Farkas who were
involved in this scheme?&#8221; U.S. District Judge Leonie M.
Brinkema asked Brown at the plea hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; Brown answered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown, of Hernando, Florida, faces a maximum penalty of 30
years in prison, a $250,000 fine and an order to pay restitution
to more than 250 victims. She is to be sentenced on June 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crime included conspiring to transfer funds between
closely held Taylor Bean and Colonial Bank, a unit of Colonial
BancGroup Inc., to hide overdrafts, prosecutors said. The bank
was one of the 50 largest in the U.S., according to the
government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brown case is USA v. Brown, 1:11-cr-00084, and the
Farkas case is USA v. Farkas, 1:10-cr-00200, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of Virginia (Alexandria). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hollywood Studios Lose Appeal on Australian Piracy Lawsuit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Walt Disney Co. and Viacom Inc.&#8217;s Paramount Pictures are
among Hollywood&#8217;s biggest movie studios that lost a piracy
lawsuit in Australia as an appeals court upheld a ruling that a
local Internet provider wasn&#8217;t responsible for customers&#8217;
illegally downloading films. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Court of Australia Full Court, in a 2 to 1
decision, yesterday upheld Judge Dennis Cowdroy&#8217;s Feb. 4, 2010,
verdict that vindicated iiNet Ltd. The studios can appeal the
ruling to the country&#8217;s High Court. A notice must be filed
within 28 days, unless an extension is sought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Village Roadshow Ltd.&#8217;s Roadshow Films led the companies
trying to stop iiNet customers from using BitTorrent software to
illegally download copyrighted films, in a precedent-setting
case for all Internet providers in Australia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ruling in the studios&#8217; favor would have made all Internet
providers liable for their customers&#8217; conduct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The evidence supports a conclusion that iiNet
demonstrated a dismissive and, indeed, contumelious, attitude to
the complaints of infringement,&#8221; Judge Arthur Emmett wrote.
&#8220;Its conduct did not amount to authorization of the primary
acts of infringement on the part of iiNet users.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Roadshow Films Pty. v. iiNet Ltd. NSD179/2010,
Federal Court of Australia (Sydney.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Horizon to Pay $45 Million Fine in Price-Fixing Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horizon Lines Inc. will plead guilty and pay a $45 million
fine for fixing freight rates, the U.S. Justice Department said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horizon, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, conspired to
fix prices for shipping freight between the U.S. and Puerto Rico
from May 2002 to April 2008, according to the department, citing
a one-count felony charge filed yesterday in U.S. District Court
in Puerto Rico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fine stems from an investigation the department&#8217;s
Antitrust Division is conducting of the coastal water freight
industry, according to the department. In 2008, five former
executives pleaded guilty in the Horizon case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horizon executives met with co-conspirators to fix rates
and surcharges and then make sure the plot was carried out, the
department said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On The Docket &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toyota Sudden-Acceleration Suit Scheduled for Trial in March &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers suing Toyota Motor Corp. in sudden-acceleration
lawsuits coordinated in California said the carmaker didn&#8217;t
disclose that a related case was scheduled for trial next month
in federal court in Central Islip, New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This situation seriously undermines the policy goals
underlying the coordination of these actions in the present&#8221;
multidistrict litigation, lawyers for plaintiffs in the
coordinated cases said in a filing Feb. 23 in federal court in
Santa Ana, California. &#8220;Toyota never sought to have this action
coordinated with the MDL.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge James Selna, who is overseeing the
coordinated cases, set a hearing for today on whether the New
York case should be transferred to Santa Ana. The lawyers also
seek an order that Toyota disclose any related federal court
cases that aren&#8217;t already part of the multidistrict litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal lawsuits against Toyota alleging economic loss,
wrongful death or personal injury from sudden unintended
acceleration were consolidated before Selna in April. The judge
said last month that he wanted the initial bellwether case to go
to trial in the first three months of 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toyota, the world&#8217;s largest automaker, recalled millions of
U.S. vehicles last year and in 2009, most for defects related to
unintended acceleration. The company, based in Toyota City,
Japan, paid a record $48.8 million in fines for how some of the
recalls were conducted. The carmaker said yesterday that it&#8217;s
recalling another 2.17 million vehicles in the U.S. for carpet
and floor-mat flaws that could jam gas pedals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York case was brought in July of 2008 by Amir
Sitafalwalla, who claimed he was seriously injured when the 2005
Scion TC he was driving &#8220;without warning accelerated resulting
in a violent collision.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celeste Migliore, a spokeswoman for Toyota Motor Sales USA
in Torrance, California, and Robert Scumaci, a lawyer for Toyota
in the New York case, didn&#8217;t immediately return calls seeking
comment yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York case is Sitafalwalla v. Toyota Motor Sales,
08-03001, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York
(Central Islip). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coordinated cases are In re Toyota Motor Corp.
Unintended Acceleration Marketing, Sales Practices and Products
Liability Litigation, 8:10-ml-02151, U.S. District Court,
Central District of California (Santa Ana). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A company report to the National Response Center showed

&lt;p&gt;Dubai&#8217;s financial support fund, set
up to help the emirate&#8217;s state-owned companies pay back debt,
may need as much as $2.4 billion extra by 2012 to pay off
maturing liabilities, according to JPMorgan Chase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We estimate that DFSF&#8217;s cash will get exhausted later
this year or early next, and will have to be &#8216;topped up&#8217; by $1.3
to $2.4 billion over the next two years,&#8221; Zafar Nazim, a
London-based analyst at JPMorgan Securities Ltd, said in a
report to clients yesterday. &#8220;We would expect capital markets
to be the primary source of such fund-raising, although some
asset sales cannot be ruled out.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dubai roiled international markets in 2009 when it
announced plans to delay $24.9 billion in debt of its state-
owned holding company Dubai World. The holding company, which
has interests from real estate to industry, reached an agreement
with more than 70 creditor banks to delay loan payments after
property prices slumped in the emirate and frozen credit markets
prevented it from raising new loans to repay older ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dubai World plans to return $4.4 billion of its loans in
five years and $10 billion in eight years, and pay below-market interest rates over their lifespan as part of its restructuring
plan. The money will be raised by selling assets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
largest U.S. bank by assets, may face enforcement actions, fines
and other added costs stemming from probes of its mortgage-
servicing procedures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The firm expects to incur additional costs and expenses
in connection with its efforts to correct and enhance its
mortgage foreclosure procedures,&#8221; the New York-based company
said in its annual filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission yesterday. JPMorgan said it can&#8217;t predict the outcome
of the federal and state investigations or the financial impact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo  Co., the largest
and third-largest U.S. banks by assets, said in separate filings
last week they may face fines or enforcement actions from state
and federal law enforcement agencies tied to their foreclosure
practices. The probes may also lead to &#8220;significant legal
costs,&#8221; Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America said.
Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, said in its filing that
penalties are likely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and its subsidiaries are defending themselves in
more than 10,000 legal proceedings, including government
investigations and civil litigation, the company said. It added
$7.4 billion to its litigation reserves in 2010, up from $161
million in 2009. The bank reduced its legal reserves by $781
million the year before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possible Tally &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it&#8217;s &#8220;reasonably possible&#8221; that legal
proceedings may cause as much as $4.5 billion in additional
losses that aren&#8217;t covered by its litigation reserves, which
were not fully disclosed. Such losses may be as low as zero, it
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank may incur as much as $2 billion in losses beyond
accruals to cover demands that it repurchase faulty mortgages,
such as loans sold to government-sponsored enterprises Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac. Such losses may also be as low as zero,
JPMorgan said. The estimate is contingent on a further decline
in home prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said its cost of repurchasing mortgage loans sold
to the government-sponsored enterprises increased substantially
last year, &#8220;and there is no assurance that such costs could not
continue to increase substantially in the future.&#8221; JPMorgan&#8217;s
repurchase liability to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or private
companies may &#8220;materially and adversely&#8221; affect the bank&#8217;s
future earnings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo 
Co. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. are among financial firms that
added employees last year as the industry adjusted to an
expanding economy and demands imposed by new U.S. regulations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, the biggest U.S. lender, counted 288,000
employees in its annual report for 2010 to securities
regulators, an increase of 4,000, or 1.4 percent. Wells Fargo,
the biggest U.S. mortgage lender, increased headcount by 4,900,
or 1.8 percent, to 272,200, according to its annual report. Bank
of America&#8217;s workforce increased 17 percent in 2009, the year
when Merrill Lynch  Co. was added, while San Francisco-based
Wells Fargo dropped almost 5 percent that year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks reported a 77 percent increase in earnings in 2010,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Improved asset quality
and a decrease in loan-loss provisions contributed to the
earnings growth, according to a report last week from the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Bank of America, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, put aside $28.4 billion for bad loans
in 2010, down 41 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There was good talent out there at the right price,&#8221;
said Eric Moskowitz, head of market intelligence in the global
financial-markets practice of Los Angeles-based executive search
firm Korn/Ferry International. &#8220;A lot of banks cut pretty deep
in 2008 and 2009, and they needed to staff-up.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase  Co. picked Mike Stewart to head a proprietary trading unit the firm is moving
from its investment bank ahead of U.S. restrictions on making
bets for its own account, a person briefed on the decision said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank may seed the group with as much as $2 billion,
Financial News reported earlier, citing an unidentified person
familiar with the situation. While plans aren&#8217;t final, the team
may start a core fund that invests mainly in emerging markets,
credit and equities, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress passed restrictions known as the Volcker rule last
year, limiting risk-taking by lenders to prevent a recurrence of
the credit crisis. Proprietary traders make trades on behalf of
their firm, rather than clients. New York-based JPMorgan said in
September it planned to shift proprietary traders in emerging
markets, structured-credit and equity units to its asset
management division, with Stewart overseeing the move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stewart, co-head of the bank&#8217;s global emerging markets
business, will lead investments in that area, Financial News
said. Fahad Roumani, a managing director in credit proprietary
trading, will run credit, and Deepak Gulati, head of global
equity proprietary trading, will oversee equities, the newspaper
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, said she
couldn&#8217;t comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan plans to close its desk for proprietary trading of
commodities, affecting fewer than 20 traders, to comply with the
new rule, a person briefed on the matter said in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Years to Comply &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Volcker rule, a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act passed
last July, was named after former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, who campaigned for limits on risk-taking by lenders
following the global financial crisis. The Federal Reserve said
this month that banks would generally have two years to comply
after the rule takes effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. last year shut down an equity
proprietary trading group, Goldman Sachs Principal Strategies,
to comply with the rule. Morgan Stanley, the world&#8217;s top merger
adviser, said last month that it plans to break off its largest
proprietary-trading group, Process Driven Trading, as an
independent advisory firm by the end of 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will try to raise money from outside investors for
the fund, according to the report by Financial News carried on
the Wall Street Journal&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s shares climbed 34 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$47.02 as of 10 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The stock is up 11 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fina Antwerp Olefins NV, a
petrochemical venture of Total SA and Exxon Mobil Corp., will
halt a naphtha cracker next month for planned maintenance, two
people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naphtha cracker 3 will be idled at the site in Belgium from
the end of March, they said, declining to be named because the
information is confidential. The shutdown will last for as long
as six weeks, one of the people said. The cracker can produce
610,000 metric tons of ethylene a year, according to the
Association of Petrochemicals Producers in Europe. Ethylene is
used in plastics products from car parts to carrier bags. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naphtha cracker 2 at the same site in Antwerp was shut for
a few hours on Feb. 25 because of pressure problems, one of the
people said. The unit can produce 550,000 tons of ethylene
annually, according to the association&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Antwerp site has three naphtha crackers. Cracker 1 is
the smallest with a capacity of 255,000 tons a year. Total and
Exxon declined to comment on the crackers, referring questions
to the joint venture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rohit Chatterji, head of investment
banking at JPMorgan Securities India Pvt., comments on India&#8217;s
budget and stock market in an interview broadcast by Bloomberg
UTV today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bombay Stock Exchange&#8217;s Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
advanced 0.7 percent to 17,823.4 as of the 3:10 p.m. Mumbai
close today. India will cut its budget deficit to 4.6 percent of
its gross domestic product in the fiscal year ending in March
2012, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said in his annual
budget speech in parliament today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the budget: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The budget has set about a lot of enabling factors for
foreign investors to participate more directly in the Indian
markets, whether it be through an increase in capacity allocated
for the infrastructure funds, or it be through a reduction in
withholding taxes or for the ability to directly invest in
Indian mutual funds.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On foreign investment flows: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Directionally, the finance minister set the pace for what
he wants and sent out message to the market that &#8216;we would
welcome foreign capital in specific sectors and we will welcome
foreign capital in our equity markets,&#8217; which is positive
because then the capital is available to help fund the
investment plans and to create capacity that needs to exist in
the next 12 to 24 months in India to cater to the demand
growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The manner in which foreign investors react would depend
on the relative performance of the market vis-a-vis some of the
other markets in the west that are also on the path to
rebound.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the government&#8217;s fiscal deficit aim: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It has to be seen as to how it plays out particularly in
the subsidies, in the oil prices side. But, it&#8217;s a strong
positive and while it&#8217;s dependent on some ambitious assumptions
around tax buoyancy, the signal to the market regarding the
borrowing program for the government and the amount of credit
that will be available for the corporate sector is a strong
positive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Warren Buffett said Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. will probably win Federal Reserve approval this year
to repay the $5 billion he injected in the bank, pressuring
investment income at his Berkshire Hathaway Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs stake and a $3 billion investment in General Electric Co., each of which pay 10 percent annual
interest to Berkshire, will likely be terminated by Dec. 31,
Buffett said Feb. 26 in his annual letter. While the Fed has
held back Goldman from repaying, the regulator &#8220;will likely
give Goldman the green light before long,&#8221; Buffett wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GE and Goldman Sachs turned to Buffett in 2008 to bolster
their capital and increase confidence in the firms as borrowing
costs surged after the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
Goldman and GE are each required to pay a 10 percent premium to
Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire to redeem the investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The redemptions are nevertheless unwelcome,&#8221; Buffett
wrote. &#8220;After they occur, our earning power will be
significantly reduced.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment. David Skidmore, a spokesman for the
Fed, didn&#8217;t return calls outside of normal business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dividends from GE, Goldman Sachs and Swiss Reinsurance Co.
helped bolster investment income at Buffett&#8217;s insurance units
when fixed-income yields declined and Wells Fargo  Co. slashed
its dividend. Berkshire is the largest investor in the San
Francisco-based bank, with more than 340 million shares. Swiss
Re struck a deal in November to repay Berkshire. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Blockbuster Inc.&#8217;s proposed sale
benefits a group of lenders at the expense of all other
creditors, said objectors including Walt Disney Co., Universal
Studios, Yahoo! Inc., the U.S. Trustee&#8217;s office, landlords and a
committee of unsecured creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objections, filed yesterday, set up a fight over how
the cash-strapped movie-rental chain should end its bankruptcy.
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland in New York, in an order
today, adjourned a hearing that was scheduled for tomorrow to
consider a motion to sell the Dallas-based company to a group
including Monarch Alternative Capital LP. He rescheduled the
hearing for March 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Blockbuster filed bankruptcy with a partially
outlined reorganization and then became administratively
insolvent, the dispute was inevitable, said Steven Wilamowsky, a
Bingham McCutchen LLP partner who isn&#8217;t involved in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If parties come in expecting a crash landing, they
negotiate with those expectations in mind,&#8221; Wilamowsky said.
&#8220;&#8216;If they come in with a negotiated plan, they think they&#8217;ll
get paid in full and continue to ship.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Chapter 11 isn&#8217;t intended for companies that are
administratively insolvent, judges must resolve such conflicts,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockbuster, attempting to reorganize in Chapter 11 since
September, should liquidate under Chapter 7 because it can&#8217;t pay
the costs of its own bankruptcy, said the Office of the U.S.
Trustee, an arm of the Justice Department that oversees
bankruptcies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creditors&#8217; Arguments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsecured creditors, business partner Yahoo and landlords
also objected to Blockbuster&#8217;s plan to sell itself under an
offer from lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This court should not permit the Monarch group to abuse
the Chapter 11 process,&#8221; unsecured creditors wrote, saying that
lenders who stepped in with a $125 million loan to fund
operations used a &#8220;roll-up&#8221; provision to pay themselves back
for pre-bankruptcy debt and get fees and expense reimbursement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lenders saddled other creditors with &#8220;massive accrued
and unpaid administrative claims in excess of $250 million,&#8221;
the creditors claimed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;illusory&#8221; loan induced landlords, studios and other
creditors to keep supplying Blockbuster with goods, and the sale
process will let the lenders walk away unscathed leaving
&#8220;restructuring carnage&#8221; behind as the company can&#8217;t cover
administrative expenses, the unsecured creditor said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockbuster is proposing an auction using as a baseline the
$290 million &#8220;stalking horse&#8221; bid from Monarch, Owl Creek
Asset Management LP, Stonehill Capital Management LLC, and Varde
Partners Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cobalt Video Holdco &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stalking horse group, called Cobalt Video Holdco LLC,
holds more than half of Blockbuster&#8217;s $630 million debt in 11.75
percent senior secured notes. It made no commitment to continue
the business. A provision in the agreement gives Cobalt the
right to compel a conversion of the Chapter 11 reorganization
case to liquidation under Chapter 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Walt Disney, with a $9.2 million claim for merchandise
shipped to Blockbuster after its September filing, said a sale
may still be the best way to maximize assets. The current
proposal is unfair, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney &#8220;remains hopeful that the debtors&#8217; sale process
yields results favorable for all constituents,&#8221; the company&#8217;s
lawyers wrote. &#8220;Disney objects, however, to the secured lender
apparently having dictated sale terms beneficial to itself and
detrimental to the debtors&#8217; estates.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No True Financing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney said there is no true post-bankruptcy financing, or
&#8220;debtor-in-possession&#8221; loan, because the lenders, who are pre-
bankruptcy secured noteholders, never advanced any new cash
after the Chapter 11 filing. All there is, Disney says, is
$125 million in pre-bankruptcy notes that were transformed
through the so-called rollup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lifland also will consider a motion by Summit Entertainment
LLC, which wants to be paid $9.4 million for goods supplied
after bankruptcy. Summit wants the case converted to a
liquidation if the judge won&#8217;t allow it to reclaim its unsold
goods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Universal Studios Home Entertainment LLC, owed $6.4 million
for movies including  Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,&#8221; said
Blockbuster accepted its shipments post-bankruptcy without
intending to pay for them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockbuster admits that the studios as business partners
are the &#8220;lifeblood of their business,&#8221; Universal said in court
papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fox Documents &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment LLC asked the
court to protect its collateral. It filed documents outlining
its arguments under seal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Administrative expenses incurred in the bankruptcy through
Feb. 24 will be frozen, according to court papers. Those
beginning on Feb. 25 will be paid only if provided for in a sale
budget. The sale contract also requires the court to bar
creditors from taking any action to collect on a claim before
June 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockbuster said in court filings that there is a
possibility it won&#8217;t be able to pay all suppliers for goods
provided after the Chapter 11 filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company began reorganization in September with 5,600
stores, including 3,300 in the U.S. and the rest abroad. Among
the U.S. stores, 3,000 were owned. The rest are franchised.
About 200 stores closed before the bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The petition listed assets of $1.02 billion against debt of
$1.47 billion. Blockbuster estimated it owes $57 million in
accounts payable in addition to the secured and subordinated
notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Blockbuster, 10-14997, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York  Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rajat K. Gupta, a former Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. board member, was accused of insider trading by
U.S. regulators who said he passed confidential information to
Galleon Group founder Raj Rajaratnam including Berkshire
Hathaway Inc.&#8217;s $5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta, 62, also tipped Rajaratnam on quarterly earnings at
Goldman Sachs and Procter  Gamble Co., where he also was a
board member, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission
administrative order filed today. The tips generated more than
$18 million, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta, the former worldwide director of consulting firm
McKinsey  Co., was a direct or indirect investor in some of the
Galleon hedge funds at the time of the tips, the SEC said.
Gupta, who stepped down from Goldman Sachs&#8217; board last year,
resigned today from Procter  Gamble&#8217;s board &#8220;to prevent any
distraction,&#8221; company spokesman Paul Fox said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Gupta was honored with the highest trust of leading
public companies, and he betrayed that trust by disclosing their
most sensitive and valuable secrets,&#8221; SEC Enforcement Director
Robert Khuzami said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The SEC&#8217;s allegations are totally baseless,&#8221; Gupta&#8217;s
attorney Gary Naftalis said in a statement. &#8220;Mr. Gupta has done
nothing wrong and is confident that these unfounded allegations
will be rejected by any fair and impartial fact finder.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Warren Buffett&#8217;s decision to invest
in Goldman Sachs Group Inc. during the financial crisis was
leaked to a hedge fund by Rajat K. Gupta, who was then on the
bank&#8217;s board, U.S. regulators said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta alerted hedge-fund manager Raj Rajaratnam to
Buffett&#8217;s $5 billion investment in the company before the deal
was made public in September 2008, the Securities and Exchange
Commission said in an administrative order today. Rajaratnam&#8217;s
Galleon Group made more than $18 million on that tip and other
insider information from Gupta, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Gupta was honored with the highest trust of leading

sanctity of board room confidences for private gain will be held
to account for their illegal actions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett, the 80-year-old chairman of Berkshire Hathaway
Inc., has spoken out against Wall Street greed and said the
pursuit of short-term profit can compromise longer-term
performance. His 2008 investment was a bet &#8220;not just on the
strength of Goldman, but its integrity,&#8221; Berkshire Director Ron Olson said in an interview with Bloomberg Television last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase  Co. sold a $1.5
billion commercial-mortgage bond as Middle East turmoil slows a
three-month rally for the debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top-rated securities tied to skyscraper, shopping mall and
hotel loans are yielding 1.95 percentage points more than
Treasuries, up from a spread of 1.88 percentage points on Feb.
18, the lowest level in at least three years, according to a
Barclays Plc index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors are demanding higher yields as protests gain
momentum in Libya, sparking concern that rising oil prices could
hamper an economic recovery, said Brian Lancaster, a Stamford,
Connecticut-based analyst with Royal Bank of Scotland Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Earlier in the year we had tremendous momentum,&#8221;
Lancaster said in a telephone interview. &#8220;The events in the
Middle East have caused a pull-back in the stock market, and
that impacts investor sentiment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s largest top-rated portion of the commercial-
mortgage bond, a $485.4 million slice maturing in 9.77 years,
yields 112 basis points more than the benchmark swap rate,
according to a person familiar with the transaction who declined
to be identified because terms aren&#8217;t public. The New York-based
bank had originally offered the debt for 105 basis points over
swaps, according to marketing materials distributed to investors
on Feb. 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$45 Billion Forecast &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks have arranged about $6.5 billion in commercial
mortgage-backed securities this year, compared with $11.5
billion in all of 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
JPMorgan has forecast sales will rise to $45 billion this year
after plunged to $3.4 billion in 2009 amid the financial crisis.
Issuance peaked at a record $234 billion in 2007, Bloomberg data
show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investor appetite for bonds backed by commercial real
estate increases the credit supply for U.S. borrowers who need
to refinance maturing loans. About 63 percent of JPMorgan&#8217;s
offering is tied to retail properties, and almost 25 percent is
linked to office buildings, the person with knowledge of the
sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The securities comprise 45 loans on 109 properties, the
largest of which is a $215 million mortgage on a mall in
Holyoke, Massachusetts. Loans in Texas account for the highest
concentration, about 20 percent of the pool, followed by 16
percent in Massachusetts, said the person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competition among lenders has led to riskier loans being
included in more recent deals, Standard  Poor&#8217;s said in a Feb
24 report. Current offerings are more highly leveraged and have
less income to cover debt payments than those completed in late
2009, SP said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the short 15 months since we began seeing new CMBS
issuance again, transaction structures are becoming more complex
and underwriting standards are loosening somewhat,&#8221; the
analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, said &#8220;reasonably possible&#8221; losses
from legal claims against the company may amount to as much as
$3.4 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs hasn&#8217;t set aside a &#8220;significant&#8221; amount of
money against the possible losses, the New York-based bank said
today in a 10-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. The estimate, the first of its kind disclosed by the
firm, is the &#8220;upper end&#8221; of losses in matters where the risk
is &#8220;more than remote but less than likely,&#8221; the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are releasing possible-loss estimates after the SEC
said in an October letter to corporate finance chiefs that they
should disclose such losses &#8220;when there is at least a
reasonable possibility&#8221; that they may be incurred, even if the
risk is too low to require reserves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;ve got the best lawyers, they&#8217;re going to drag these
claims out as far as they possibly can,&#8221; said Brad Hintz, an
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in New York who has an
&#8220;outperform&#8221; rating on Goldman Sachs&#8217;s stock. &#8220;Goldman has
3 years or 3 1/2 years to build reserves for what will
ultimately be settlements.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hintz said securities law cases have a five-year statute of
limitations, so claims related to the financial crisis are
likely to peak in the next year. He said cases typically take
four or five years to be settled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, Citigroup &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Citigroup Inc. said last week that as much as $4 billion in
additional costs from pending legal matters are &#8220;possible, but
not probable.&#8221; JPMorgan Chase  Co. said yesterday that it&#8217;s
&#8220;reasonably possible&#8221; that legal proceedings may cause as much
as $4.5 billion in losses beyond its litigation reserves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s estimate doesn&#8217;t include any amount for
cases that are at early stages or where there are significant
factual issues to be resolved or novel legal issues, according
to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure was calculated by adding up three categories of
potential liability, the filing said. The firm included the
amount of money damages claimed, where applicable. It also added
the amount of securities sold in cases where Goldman Sachs is
being sued by purchasers of a deal underwritten by the company
and where it&#8217;s not being indemnified. Finally, in cases where
parties are demanding that Goldman Sachs repurchase securities
they acquired from the firm, the calculation is based on the
difference between the price paid and the estimated value on
Dec. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit Drop &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs reported a 38 percent drop in net income to
$8.35 billion in 2010 from a record $13.4 billion in 2009 as
trading revenue tumbled and non-compensation expenses, driven by
provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings, increased
14 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2010 litigation and regulatory costs include
$550 million to settle a fraud suit brought against the firm
last year by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which
accused Goldman Sachs of misleading investors in a mortgage-
linked investment that was sold in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said in today&#8217;s filing that it&#8217;s facing
complaints in federal and state courts from plaintiffs asserting
that its disclosures on mortgage-related products were improper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company estimates that aggregate cumulative losses by
the plaintiffs in active cases total about $457 million as of
Dec. 31. That total doesn&#8217;t include other potential claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs include the Federal Home Loan Banks of Seattle, Chicago and Indianapolis, Charles Schwab Corp.,
Cambridge Place Investment Management Inc., Basis Yield Alpha
Fund (Master) and Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Credit Union Administration also plans to
pursue similar claims on behalf of some credit unions, and &#8220;a
number of other entities have threatened to assert claims
against the firm in connection with various mortgage-related
offerings,&#8221; Goldman Sachs said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New York Mets hired JPMorgan
Chase  Co. to put together a loan to cover &#8220;basic operating
expenses&#8221; until the baseball team can sell a minority stake,
the New York Post reported, citing an unidentified person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan is trying to recruit a syndicate of lenders for
the new loan &#8220;totaling tens of millions of dollars,&#8221; the
newspaper said. The bank led a group that loaned the team about
$430 million last year, it added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for the bank, said
JPMorgan is not in discussions to syndicate a new loan for the
team. David Howard, executive vice president for business
operations, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team last week said it received a short-term loan from Major League Baseball, without revealing the amount. Mets
Chairman Fred Wilpon said Jan. 28 that team owners were
considering selling a minority stake of up to 25 percent because
of a lawsuit tied to the Ponzi scheme run by Bernard L. Madoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mets are valued at $858 million, third-highest among
baseball&#8217;s 30 teams, Forbes magazine said last April. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest U.S.

according to a message left on a community hot line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Conditions at the refinery at the time necessitated that
we flare,&#8221; Kevin Allexon, a company spokesman based in Fairfax,
Virginia, said in an e-mail today. Allexon declined to comment
further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outages can increase prices for refined products as
refiners turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts. Operational disruptions can also depress prices for
crude oil because less feedstock is needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plant can process 359,100 barrels of crude a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Phillips Chemical Co. LLC
had a power failure at its Cedar Bayou chemical plant in
Baytown, Texas, according to a filing with the U.S. National
Response Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company was &#8220;attempting to shut down and block in all
feeds from the pipeline as safely as possible&#8221; after the
incident at 7:12 p.m. local time yesterday, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linda Koenig, a spokeswoman for The Woodlands, Texas-based

&lt;p&gt;U.S. refineries must notify the National Response Center if
they release hazardous substances in excess of reportable
quantities, according to the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as
Superfund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemical plant outages can increase prices for products as
companies turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cedar Bayou plant is located about 32 miles (51

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, has closed or is closing two
trading units that made bets with the firm&#8217;s own capital, an
activity that has been prohibited under new U.S. financial rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To comply with provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, Goldman
Sachs during 2010 &#8220;liquidated substantially all of the
positions&#8221; in the principal-strategies unit that operated
within the firm&#8217;s equities division, the New York-based company
said today in its annual 10-K filing with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first quarter of 2011, the firm &#8220;commenced the
liquidation of the positions that had been held by the global
macro proprietary-trading desk&#8221; within the fixed-income,
currencies and commodities division, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Net revenues from principal strategies and our global
macro proprietary-trading desk were not material for the year
ended December 2010,&#8221; the filing said. &#8220;We will continue to
assess our business, risk management, and compliance practices
to conform with developments in the regulatory environment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Christine Harper" date="Mar 01, 2011  7:59 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-01/goldman-sachs-group-says-it-lost-money-from-trading-on-25-days-last-year.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Group Says It Lost Money From Trading on 25 Days Last Year</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, lost money from trading on 25 days
during 2010, up from a record-low 19 days in 2009, according to
a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After incurring losses on trades during 12 days in the
first 9 months, the full-year figures indicate that Goldman
Sachs lost money on 13 days in the fourth quarter. The firm&#8217;s
traders also made $100 million or more on 68 days in 2010, down
from the record 131 days in 2009, according to the New York-
based company&#8217;s annual 10-K filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traders exceeded the firm-wide &#8220;value-at-risk&#8221; limit, or
VaR, on one occasion during 2010 &#8220;to facilitate a client
transaction,&#8221; according to the filing. The risk position was
reduced the following day to comply with the limit, which is one
of the gauges Goldman Sachs uses to measure potential trading
losses. In 2009, the firm-wide VaR was exceeded on two
consecutive days, the filing said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the filing doesn&#8217;t say when the VaR limit was
exceeded, it includes a graph showing a one-day increase in
daily value-at-risk early in the fourth quarter to a high of
$223 million from a fourth-quarter range of between about $100
million and $140 million. The average value-at-risk for the year
was $134 million, down from $218 million in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PNC Financial Services Inc., JPMorgan Chase  Co. and SunTrust Banks Inc. led U.S. banks in
taking customers from competitors, according to a J. D. Power
and Associates survey of consumers who switched banks last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers who changed banks increased to 8.7 percent from
7.7 percent during the past year, the survey of 25 banks showed.
The three lenders each increased new customers by more than 11
percent among 4,791 people surveyed, Rockwell Clancy, vice
president of the financial-services practice at Westlake
Village, California-based J.D. Power and Associates, said in an
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are more people in play, and they&#8217;re being more
diligent,&#8221; Clancy said. &#8221;They&#8217;re looking at more alternatives
when they shop, which means the competitive pressure on the
banks is going up.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks that gained the most customers marketed well, with
ads for specific products, such as gift cards and banking phone
applications, Clancy said. Less than half, or 43 percent, of
customers who bought additional products from banks made the
purchase from their primary lender, he said. Most were lured by
competitors&#8217; promotional offers, Clancy said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It has less to do with the absolute product than it has
to do with the perceived innovation,&#8221; Clancy said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fees and interest rates carried &#8220;relatively little
weight&#8221; in consumers&#8217; decisions, according to the study
conducted in November and December. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s mortgage-
servicing unit, which suspended some evictions and foreclosures
in October, &#8220;has recently resumed some of those activities,&#8221;
according to a regulatory filing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Litton Loan Servicing LP said on Oct. 8 that it was
suspending some foreclosures to review its procedures. Attorneys
general from 50 states have been investigating the mortgage
industry&#8217;s foreclosure practices after discovering some firms
used faulty or falsified paperwork to seize homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At the date of this filing, the firm is not aware of
foreclosures where the underlying foreclosure decision was not
warranted,&#8221; the New York-based company said in its annual 10-K
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. &#8220;As of
December 2010, the value of the firm&#8217;s mortgage servicing rights
was not material and any impact on their value would not be
material to the firm.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said it is cooperating with requests from
regulators and state attorneys general and continues to review
Litton&#8217;s practices. The inquiries &#8220;may result in the imposition
of fines or other regulatory action,&#8221; the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer David A. Viniar said on Oct. 19
that the company was unlikely to have large losses from
mortgage-related issues because Goldman Sachs played a small
role in creating and packaging such loans. He said at the time
that an &#8220;extensive review&#8221; of Litton&#8217;s practices identified
&#8220;certain process issues&#8221; in the foreclosures. The firm still
believed the decision to foreclose was justified, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
acquired Houston-based Litton in December 2007 as investors
including billionaire Wilbur Ross and Centerbridge Capital
Partners LLC bought mortgage servicers to help them better
understand the market and profit from buying discounted loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viniar, 55, told analysts in December 2007 that the
purchase was &#8220;not just to help us take advantage of the
distressed environment that we think we&#8217;re in,&#8221; adding that
&#8220;we think being able to purchase them is going to help us as
the whole mortgage market kind of unfolds going forward.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest U.S.
oil company, agreed to enter the Faroe Islands as it bought
stakes in three exploration licenses from Statoil ASA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon will acquire a 50 percent in licenses 009 and 011,
and 49 percent in license 006, in which P/F Atlantic Petroleum
holds 1 percent, Statoil said today in a statement. Statoil,
based in Stavanger, Norway, will keep the operatorship in all
licenses. Faroe Island authorities have approved the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m very pleased with getting such a competent and
experienced partner on board in this frontier area,&#8221; said Tim Dodson, executive vice president for exploration at Statoil.
&#8220;Both ExxonMobil and Statoil have extensive experience in
exploring in harsh environments.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As North Sea fields mature, oil producers are exploring
harsher, more challenging environments such as the Arctic, a
region where large oil and gas deposits are estimated to remain.
The Faroe Islands, an island group located north of Scotland and
west of Norway, began awarding oil licenses in 2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baard Glad Pedersen, a Statoil spokesman, declined to
provide a price for the transaction when reached by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statoil, Exxon and Atlantic Petroleum plan to drill the
Brugdan exploration well in the second half of the year, Statoil
said today. Norway&#8217;s biggest oil and gas producer, which
operates six licenses in the Faroes, has drilled two wells there
to date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;ExxonMobil looks forward to working together with
Statoil, Atlantic Petroleum and the Faroes&#8217; authorities on this
exploration opportunity,&#8221; Russ Bellis, exploration director at
Irving, Texas-based Exxon, said in the statement. &#8220;We plan to
apply our experience and expertise to explore this area through
the application of industry-leading technologies and the highest
standards of safety.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase  Co. has invested in
a fund that has bought about $400 million in Twitter Inc.
shares, valuing the blogging service at as much as $4.5 billion,
three people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund, which has more than $1 billion, is being run by
Twitter investor Chris Sacca, said two of the people, who
declined to be identified because the arrangement isn&#8217;t public.
JPMorgan is committing the bulk of the financing for the fund,
the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter, founded in 2006, has seen its valuation climb in
tandem with the popularity of its site, which lets users post
140-character messages. The company was valued at $3.7 billion
in December after receiving $200 million in a funding round led
by venture-capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield  Byers.
Twitter was worth $1 billion in September 2009, a person
familiar with the matter said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s investment management division said in a
regulatory filing last month that it&#8217;s raising as much as $1.22
billion in a venture-capital fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February, venture firm Andreessen Horowitz said it was
investing more than $80 million in Twitter, whose online-
messaging service has more than 175 million registered users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sacca declined to comment, as did Darin Oduyoye, a
spokesman for JPMorgan, and Sean Garrett, a spokesman for San
Francisco-based Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment in closely held Twitter was reported earlier
by the Financial Times and technology blog TechCrunch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cargill Inc. said that its sugar
business took delivery of almost 1 million metric tons of the
commodity as part of transactions involving expiring contracts
at ICE Futures U.S. and handled by a unit of JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Futures accepted delivery on 18,748 ICE futures
contracts, or the equivalent of 952,398 tons, from  five
brokers, the New York exchange said yesterday on its website.
The delivery was the biggest for ICE since 2009. The sweetener
was sent to the sugar unit of Minnetonka, Minnesota-based
Cargill, Pete Stoddart, the director of media relations, said
today in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raw sugar doubled in 2010&#8217;s second half on concern that
global supplies would trail demand following crop damage in
Australia and India. The sweetener touched a 30-year high of
36.08 cents a pound on Feb. 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agricultural prices have a &#8220;lot of risks to the upside,&#8221;
Abah Ofon, an analyst at Standard Chartered Plc, said today by
phone in Singapore. &#8220;When there&#8217;s a risk of supply disruptions,
a lot of users would rather take delivery now.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raw sugar for May delivery climbed 1.12 cents, or 3.8
percent, to settle at 30.38 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York, the biggest gain since Feb. 2. In London, refined sugar for May delivery gained $27.10, or 3.7
percent, to $760.50 a ton on NYSE Liffe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quantity of the sweetener received represents 9.2
percent of the current year&#8217;s U.S. consumption as estimated by
the government. Cargill, an agricultural processor and
distributor, is the largest closely held company in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.35 Million Tons &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPMorgan&#8217;s futures business accepts and makes deliveries
on behalf of clients, as part of our normal business operations
that facilitate customer access to global commodities
exchanges,&#8221; Justin Perras, a JPMorgan spokesman, said today in
an e-mailed reply to Bloomberg questions. JPMorgan is the
second-largest U.S. bank by assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The delivery was the biggest since 1.35 million tons were
delivered to satisfy the July 2009 contract, exchange data show.
Each sugar contract is for 112,000 pounds (50.8 metric tons).
The U.S. will consume 11.41 million short tons (10.4 million
metric tons) in the year that began Oct. 1, the Department of
Agriculture estimated on Feb. 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The delivery was above the 700,000 metric tons we were
expecting,&#8221; said Marcos Mine, head of sugar and ethanol trading
at ICAP Brasil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than two-thirds of the delivered sugar came from Brazil, the world&#8217;s largest producer and exporter, according to
the ICE report. The rest came from Central America and Thailand.
March 15 is the last day for delivery against the recently
expired contract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Strong Hands&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The larger-than-expected delivery against March may have
weighed on sentiment initially, but as the sugar was received by
strong hands, attention shifted onto the implications for May
and May/July spreads,&#8221; Nick Penney, an analyst at Sucden
Financial in London, said in a report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World demand exceeded supply by about 8 million tons last
year, Ofon of Standard Chartered said. Improving supplies from
Brazil may move the market toward a balance, with either a
shortage or an excess of 1 million tons this year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Inventories are very low, and users are rebuilding their
stockpiles,&#8221; Ofon said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a backdrop against a very tight
market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global sugar market will be in deficit for a third year
in the 2010-11 marketing season, C. Czarnikow Sugar Futures Ltd.
said yesterday. The shortfall is 3.7 million tons now, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian raw-sugar exports declined 6.5 percent from a
year earlier to 915,900 tons in February, data from the Trade
Ministry showed yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy options on HR
Block Inc. and FedEx Corp. as the stock of the biggest U.S. tax
preparer may decline and the selloff in the shipping company&#8217;s
shares may be overdone, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derivatives strategists John Marshall and Katherine Fogertey recommended buying HR Block April $14 puts because the
options are &#8220;attractive.&#8221; The Kansas City, Missouri-based tax
preparer dropped 3.1 percent to $14.72 yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;HR Block is rapidly losing market share in the tax
business to software based solutions,&#8221; the strategists wrote in
a note today. &#8220;Options appear attractive as we approach the
important tax filing season; HR Block generates two-thirds of
their annual revenue in their busiest two weeks of tax season.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HR Block last week rose the most since October after
reporting total tax returns had increased from a year earlier.
The company has fallen 13 percent in the past year through
yesterday, compared with a 17 percent gain for the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. HR Block on March 9 will report third-quarter
profit of 9 cents a share excluding some items, according to the
average of 10 estimates from a Bloomberg survey. The company
beat projections for the past five quarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HR Block&#8217;s implied volatility, the key gauge of option
prices, for at-the-money options expiring in 30 days increased
3.1 percent to 47.85 yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FedEx &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marshall and Fogertey also said investors should buy FedEx
calls, without recommending a specific trade. The Memphis,
Tennessee-based shipping company advanced 2.9 percent in the
past year through yesterday, compared with a 23 percent increase
for the Standard and Poor&#8217;s 500 Industrials Index. FedEx fell
2.4 percent to $87.88 yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our transportation analyst also sees the selloff as
overdone in the context of his estimates and price target,&#8221; the
note said. &#8220;We believe options prices are attractive and
recommend buying calls to gain exposure to a rebound in
sentiment on growth sensitive stocks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shipper on March 17 will post third-quarter adjusted
earnings of 82 cents a share, according to the average of 21
estimates from a Bloomberg survey. FedEx missed projections for
the past two quarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FedEx&#8217;s implied volatility rose 7.1 percent to 31.91
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve had a pretty good crisis,&#8221;
says Barry Bausano, smiling as he surveys Deutsche Bank AG&#8217;s
sprawling 35,000-square-foot equities trading floor in downtown Manhattan. Behind him, on bookshelves in his glass-walled
office, sit two copies of &#8220;Too Big to Fail,&#8221; along with &#8220;Liar&#8217;s
Poker&#8221; and &#8220;Triumph of the Optimists,&#8221; which tracks 101 years of
worldwide investment returns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bausano, 47, who heads the Frankfurt-based bank&#8217;s equities
division in the Americas, has reasons to be upbeat, Bloomberg
Markets magazine reports in its April issue. Deutsche Bank got
the best stock prices for institutional clients both globally
and in North America during the 12 months ended on Sept. 30,
2010, according to data compiled for Bloomberg Markets&#8217;
worldwide ranking of equities brokers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Germany&#8217;s biggest bank displaced Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
which had swept all four categories in the previous ranking.
This time, New York-based Goldman Sachs was ninth in the world,
fifth in Europe and third in Asia. The data were compiled by
Ancerno Ltd., a spinoff of brokerage Abel/Noser Corp. that
measures transaction costs for $7.5&#160;trillion of trades in more
than 70 countries every year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While U.S. banks retrenched, merged, took government
bailout money and -- in the case of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. -- declared bankruptcy during the financial meltdown of
2008 and 2009, Deutsche Bank overhauled its electronic stock
trading and analytics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-
biggest U.S. bank, made $907 million in pretax profit from
deposits held at the bank by imprisoned Ponzi scheme operator
Bernard L. Madoff, a study said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Madoff firm&#8217;s balances in its JPMorgan account
generated the profit from 1986 to 2008, according to Linus Wilson, an assistant finance professor at the University of
Louisiana at Lafayette. Entitled &#8220;Madoff&#8217;s Dirty Money,&#8221; the
study posted on the Social Science Research Network on Feb. 27
uses &#8220;previously unanalyzed data&#8221; from the Securities Investor
Protection Corp., which handles the Madoff firm&#8217;s bankruptcy,
Wilson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The profit calculation was arrived at by assuming that the
Madoff deposits were reinvested in JPMorgan&#8217;s stock through Feb.
18, 2011, the study says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for New York-based
JPMorgan, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was sued by the trustee liquidating Madoff&#8217;s firm
for $6.4 billion for allegedly aiding the con man&#8217;s fraud.
JPMorgan denied wrongdoing, saying the earnings from Madoff were
&#8220;wholly immaterial.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s fees totaled $597,000 in the six years before
Madoff&#8217;s 2008 bankruptcy, Picard calculated. JPMorgan earned
less than $3.5 million in interest by loaning $145 million to
Madoff&#8217;s firm in 2005 and 2006, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to court filings, Madoff&#8217;s accounts with JPMorgan
included Treasury securities as well as cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan case is Picard v. JPMorgan Chase  Co., 10-ap-
4932, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks rallied, giving
benchmark indexes their biggest advances in three months, as a
decrease in jobless claims and growth in service industries
bolstered confidence in the economic recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DuPont Co. and Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) advanced at least 2.8
percent, pacing gains in industrial companies. A gauge of
retailers in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index added 1.2 percent
as Retail Metrics said industry sales rose 4.3 percent in
February, topping analyst estimates. Big Lots Inc. (BIG) jumped 3.6
percent after reporting earnings that beat forecasts. Valero
Energy Corp. (VLO) rose 7.7 percent as the refiner projected a profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 added 1.7 percent to 1,330.97 at 4 p.m. in New
York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 191.40 points,
or 1.6 percent, to 12,258.20. Both gauges gained the most since
Dec. 1. Crude oil declined as Venezuela offered to mediate a
resolution to the Libyan crisis. The Chicago Board Options
Exchange Volatility Index, which measures the cost of using
options as insurance against declines in the SP 500, tumbled 10
percent, the most since November, to 18.60. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a relief rally,&#8221; said Michael Nasto, senior trader
at U.S. Global Investors Inc., which manages about $3 billion in San Antonio. &#8220;We got strong economic data across the board. Oil
is down, which is also a positive, reflecting what I like to
call a controlled chaos in the Middle East. Traders are happy
about the fact that the market has been hanging in there despite
all the recent turmoil.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate Earnings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 has risen 5.8 percent this year as government
stimulus measures, improving profits and increased takeovers
bolstered confidence in equities. Per-share profit topped
analysts&#8217; estimates at 71 percent of the 470 companies in the
gauge that have reported results since Jan. 10, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier today, equity-index futures extended gains before
the open of exchanges as the Labor Department report said
applications for unemployment benefits fell by 20,000 to 368,000
in the week ended Feb. 26. Economists forecast claims would rise
to 395,000, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey. The total number of people receiving unemployment
insurance fell to the lowest level since October 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A separate report today showed that the Institute for
Supply Management&#8217;s index of non-manufacturing businesses rose
to 59.7, the highest level since August 2005, from 59.4 in
January. Economists forecast the gauge would fall to 59.3,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. A
reading above 50 signals growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer Confidence &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. consumer confidence last week held close to the
highest level in almost three years as more Americans said their
finances were in good shape. The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort
Index, formerly the ABC News U.S. Weekly Consumer Comfort Index,
was minus 39.3 in the period to Feb. 27, compared with minus
39.2 the prior week. Respondents&#8217; view of their financial
situation climbed to an almost two-year high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All the economic data today was strong and pointed to a
self-sustaining U.S. recovery,&#8221; said Richard Campagna, chief
executive officer of 300 North Capital LLC, which manages $500
million in Pasadena, California. &#8220;You had two big picture
things that came out. There&#8217;s possibly less uncertainty in the
Middle East. At the same time, jobless claims dipped below
expectations. These things added together are driving everything
higher except the safe havens.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Pretty Good Environment&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bridgewater Associates LP Chief Investment Officer Ray Dalio told financial-news channel CNBC that a &#8220;pretty good
environment&#8221; exists for some investments in U.S. equities.
Dalio said investors in U.S. stocks should consider
diversification in underrated assets, adding that 2011 &#8220;should
be a good year for equities, by and large.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of industrial companies, among the stocks most
dependent on economic growth, led the gains in the SP 500,
rallying 2.4 percent as a group. The Morgan Stanley Cyclical
Index added 2.1 percent as 28 of its 30 stocks advanced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones Transportation Average of 20 shipping,
airline, railroad and trucking companies increased 2.5 percent
as the drop in oil prices eased concern about rising fuel costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DuPont, the third-biggest U.S. chemical maker, rose 2.8
percent to $54.55. Caterpillar, the world&#8217;s largest maker of
construction equipment, advanced 3.3 percent to $104.25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 Retailing Index (S5RETL) gained 1.2 percent as same-
store sales in February surpassed analysts&#8217; estimates, driven by
department stores as more confident shoppers embraced the
arrival of warm-weather goods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18 Months &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same-store sales rose 4.3 percent last month, beating an
overall compilation of analysts&#8217; estimates for a gain of 3.8
percent at the 27 chains tracked by Retail Metrics, based in
Swampscott, Massachusetts. That marked the 18th straight monthly
gain from September 2009 and the fifth time in the past seven
months that sales have beaten projections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big Lots advanced 3.6 percent to $41.33. The Columbus,
Ohio-based discount retailer reported fourth-quarter profit of
$1.46 a share excluding some items. Analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg had estimated profit of $1.38 on average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valero climbed 7.7 percent, the biggest gain in the SP
500, to $28.98. The independent U.S. refiner said it expects to
earn as much as 30 cents a share in the first quarter, after
recording a loss of $348 million on forward sales of refined
products. The company removed a &#8220;negative&#8221; by closing out the
positions, Credit Suisse Group AG said in a note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Coventry Health Care Inc. (CVH) advanced 5.7 percent to $32.30,
the highest price since September 2008. Stifel Nicolaus  Co.
raised its recommendation for the managed health-care company to
&#8220;buy&#8221; from &#8220;hold&#8221;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. fell 5.6 percent, the
biggest decline in the SP 500, to $26.78. The mobile-phone
maker was cut to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;outperform&#8221; by Cowen  Co.,
which cited competition for the company&#8217;s XOOM tablet from Apple
Inc.&#8217;s iPad 2, being introduced next week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co. (BMY) calls as approval for a melanoma treatment may boost
the drugmaker&#8217;s stock price, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity derivatives strategist John Marshall recommended
investors buy April $26 calls because 30-day implied volatility,
the key gauge of option prices, is now low and below three-month
implied volatility. The strategist cited drug analyst Jami Rubin, who&#8217;s kept a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on the stock since June and a
price forecast of $30. Bristol-Myers gained 3 percent to $26.14
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Bristol-Myers remains the most (in fact, only) compelling
new product story in the pharma sector, with significant room
for consensus upside earnings-per-share revisions,&#8221; New York-
based Marshall wrote in yesterday&#8217;s report. &#8220;Given our
expectation for higher volatility than normal over the next
month, we believe options prices are attractive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based drugmaker is awaiting U.S. regulatory
approval for its ipilimumab treatment for melanoma, which was
originally scheduled for Dec. 25 and got delayed until March. If
approved, the drug would be the first new melanoma medicine in
more than a decade and may produce up to $1 billion in annual
sales within five years, said Linda Bannister, a health-care
analyst at Edward Jones  Co. in Des Peres, Missouri. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls would more than double if Bristol-Myers gains at
least $1.50 by the end of March, the note said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bristol-Myers rose 7.4 percent in the past year, more than
the 4.2 percent increase for health-care companies in the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), sued for $6.4
billion by the trustee for Bernard L. Madoff&#8217;s firm, said the
trustee has no right to &#8220;abrogate&#8221; a yearlong agreement to
protect trade secrets by revising his rules for handling
confidential information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trustee, Irving H. Picard, seeking $100 billion for
investors in Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme in lawsuits, has asked a
judge for more freedom to use information demanded for his
investigations. JPMorgan&#8217;s objection is one of at least eight
filed yesterday by banks and investment managers including UBS
AG (UBSN), Citigroup Inc. (C) and HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, based in New York, said it gave Picard documents
22 times in the past 15 months, relying on his agreement not to
share the information with competitors or other parties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The proposed order would permit the trustee to disclose
JPMorgan&#8217;s confidential and proprietary information to any party
or its agent in any one of the more than one thousand adversary
proceedings that have been commenced by the trustee,&#8221; the
second-biggest U.S. bank said in a filing in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in New York. &#8220;The trustee is not entitled to abrogate
confidentiality arrangements that have been relied upon by
JPMorgan and other parties.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Picard has his way, the bank&#8217;s anti-money-laundering
policies, risk-assessment methods and internal reviews might be
shared with every major financial institution in New York and
thousands of other parties, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Fatally Flawed&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup called Picard&#8217;s proposal &#8220;fatally flawed.&#8221;
Thousands of pages of documents it delivered to Picard since
receiving his July 2009 subpoena might be passed around,
including pages identifying &#8220;potential and actual
transactions&#8221; contemplated by Citigroup, the New York-based
bank said in a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documents were delivered under a confidentiality
agreement with Picard that he is seeking to undo, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanda Remus, a spokeswoman for Picard, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard&#8217;s Feb. 1 proposal would allow him to share a bank&#8217;s trade secrets with more than 4,000 parties, UBS calculated in
court papers. Names and account numbers of Madoff customers,
amounts of withdrawals, redemptions, transfers and transferees
would lose their protection, UBS said in its filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignoring Red Flags &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trustee is demanding more than $18 billion from banks,
accusing them of aiding Madoff&#8217;s fraud by ignoring red flags
that should have prompted them to investigate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks have denied wrongdoing. Fees earned from dealing
with Madoff or feeder funds were minor for a big bank, giving no
motive to be willfully blind, JPMorgan said in its rebuttal of
the trustee&#8217;s allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank is seeking a jury trial in a different court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard&#8217;s lawsuits against banks are in a &#8220;gray area&#8221; of
the law, bankruptcy lawyer Harvey Miller told Bloomberg
Television in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not clear a financial institution has fiduciary
duties to investigate fraud and go out and report it,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A court hearing on Picard&#8217;s so-called litigation protective
order is set for March 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan case is Picard v. JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
10-ap-4932, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
 Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast narrowed 2.5 cents to 16 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 2:13 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose
0.07 cent to $2.8452 a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premium for ultra-low-sulfur diesel on the Gulf Coast
widened 0.12 cent to 4 cents a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only catalytic cracker at the 359,000-barrel-a-day
Exxon plant restarted March 1, after shutting Feb. 28 because of
a leak, two people familiar with the plant&#8217;s operations said.
The unit is moving toward planned rates, according to the
people, who declined to be identified because they aren&#8217;t
authorized to speak for the refinery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emissions associated with the upset in a fluid catalytic
cracking unit at the Borger refinery began at 2 p.m. local time
yesterday and lasted six minutes, Houston-based ConocoPhillips (COP)
said in a filing with the Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Chinese Estates Holdings Ltd. (127), a
property company controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Joseph Lau,
wants to buy two buildings in the City of London occupied by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese Estates aims to add Peterborough Court and Daniel
House after purchasing River Court, a Goldman building on the
same street, in January. The two properties were put up for sale
last month for at least 300 million pounds ($488 million),
according to Jones Lang LaSalle Inc., which is marketing them.
They are part of Goldman&#8217;s European headquarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chinese Estates is very interested in buying the Goldman
Sachs buildings in London,&#8221; Alison Yeung, a spokeswoman for
Chinese Estates in Hong Kong, said yesterday by telephone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; London was one of the first real estate markets to see a
pickup in deals and prices after the financial crisis. Sales of
existing commercial property in the U.K. capital generated more
money than any other city last year, according to Real Capital
Analytics Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman buildings are the kind of assets that attract
&#8220;strong interest from overseas investors who view London as
their preferred investment location and a safe haven during this
period of global economic uncertainty,&#8221; said Stephen Down,
managing partner of Gresham Down Capital Partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gresham Down, a London-based property broker, handled the
280 million-pound sale of River Court. Knight Frank LLP advised
Chinese Estates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peterborough Court and Daniel House have total space of
370,526 square feet (34,500 square meters). The buildings on
Fleet Street in central London were put on the market after the
former owner, Canadian developer Jesta Group, defaulted on debt
repayments, Jones Lang said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman has two other office buildings in London, both of
which are in the city&#8217;s main financial district. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s Beaumont, Texas,
refinery has restarted its fluid catalytic cracker after a Feb.
28 shutdown that followed a leak, two people familiar with the
plant&#8217;s operations said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit, Beaumont&#8217;s only catalytic cracker, was restarted
the evening of March 1 and is moving toward planned rates, said
the people, who declined to be identified because they aren&#8217;t
authorized to speak for the refinery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Allexon, a Fairfax, Virginia-based Exxon spokesman,
declined to comment, saying that Exxon doesn&#8217;t comment on day-
to-day operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery is capable of processing 359,100 barrels a
day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon is the largest U.S. refiner. Its three Gulf Coast
plants account for 17 percent of that region&#8217;s operable crude
oil capacity, according to the Energy Department. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European gasoline fell from a 30-
month high as Chevron Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc sold
barges of the motor fuel. Gasoil&#8217;s crack, or premium to Brent
crude, widened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light Products &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eurobob gasoline for immediate loading in Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp traded at $977 to $986 a metric ton, according
to a survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin
Board. That&#8217;s down from $967 to $990 yesterday, when the
benchmark grade hit its highest since Sept. 2, 2008. Ethanol is
added to make finished fuel. The prices are for so-called barge
lots, usually of 1,000 or 2,000 tons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, Shell, Mabanaft BV and Trafigura BV sold mainly to
Morgan Stanley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasoline&#8217;s crack widened to $7.30 a barrel, compared with
$7.05 in the previous session, according to data from London-
based brokerage PVM Oil Associates Ltd. on Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naphtha&#8217;s discount to Brent shrank to $4.70 a barrel from
$5 the previous session. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April Brent futures fell 77 cents to $115.45 a barrel on
ICE Futures Europe exchange as of 12:01 p.m. London time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Middle Distillates &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasoil futures for March delivery on London&#8217;s ICE exchange
decreased $5.25, or 0.5 percent, to $959.50 a ton. The more
active April contract fell 0.5 percent to $962.75 a ton.
Gasoil&#8217;s crack advanced to $13.80 a barrel versus $12.97 at 4:30
p.m. yesterday, ICE data showed. The fuel is the European
equivalent of heating oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refinery &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reliance Industries Ltd., owner of the world&#8217;s largest
refining complex, plans to start a fluid catalytic cracker at
its facility in western India next week, two people with
knowledge of the schedule said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mumbai-based Reliance said in a Feb. 3 statement that it
would shut the FCC on Feb. 7 for maintenance after five years of
continuous operations. The unit will begin start up procedures
on March 7, the people said, asking not to be identified as they

&lt;p&gt;Vitol Group, the world&#8217;s largest
independent oil trader, was ranked as 2010&#8217;s most productive
developer of projects yielding tradable emission credits,
according to a survey by Bloomberg New Energy Finance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitol Group&#8217;s Carbon Resource Management sought credits
last year for projects that may yield 11.1 million metric tons
of United Nations-overseen greenhouse gas credits through 2020,
according to the ranking. JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s EcoSecurities
unit ranked second, with projects that may yield 8.6 million
tons in the period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy traders and banks have bought project developers to
create credits under the Clean Development Mechanism and Joint
Implementation programs instead of starting from scratch, said
Marisa Beck, a London-based analyst for New Energy Finance.
&#8220;Bigger players are better placed to manage these projects
because they can diversify the risks and achieve economies of
scale,&#8221; she said today in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Energy Finance used public data to assess the
performance of companies seeking credits last year. The CDM is
the second-biggest greenhouse gas market by traded volume after
the European Union cap-and-trade program. Factories and power
stations in the EU can use CDM credits as a cheaper alternative
for compliance than permits sold by nations. They range from
wind farms in China to industrial gas-cutting plants in Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certified Emission Reduction credits from the program for
delivery in December, the industry benchmark, fell 0.2 percent
to 11.90 euros ($16.50) a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in London as of 11:20 a.m. They earlier today traded as
high as 11.96 euros a ton, their most expensive intraday level
since Nov. 25. Prices have fallen 1.3 percent from a year ago as
slow economic growth curbed demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third-Ranked &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third in the ranking was Tokyo-based Eco Asset Inc., with
7.2 million tons, while Barclays Plc (BARC)&#8217;s Tricorona Carbon Asset
Management unit was fourth, with 6.5 million tons, according to
a report e-mailed by New Energy Finance. Noble Carbon Credits, a
unit of Singapore-based Noble Group Ltd. (NOBL), was fifth, with 5.1
million tons expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitol, based in Geneva, said last month it increased its
stake to 100 percent of Carbon Resource Management as part of a
strategy to develop emission-reduction projects after 2012.
Terms of the deal weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon Resource Management didn&#8217;t make last year&#8217;s rankings
by New Energy Finance. Barclays&#8217; Tricorona unit was ranked third
last year, while JPMorgan&#8217;s EcoSecurities was fifth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan purchased EcoSecurities for about $206 million in
2009, while London-based Barclays bought Tricorona for about
$141 million in June last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Energy Finance adjusted expected credits for risks,
including the chance the project would not be registered by the
CDM executive board, the possibility the supply of credits would
be delayed by regulators and the likelihood of operating risks,
according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s sale of
shares in Bank of Moscow to VTB Group was blocked by a London
court, Vedomosti reported, citing unidentified people familiar
with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A company affiliated with Bank of Moscow Chief Executive
Officer Andrei Borodin petitioned the court to stop the deal,
saying it has the right of first refusal to buy the shares, the
Moscow-based newspaper reported today, without identifying the
company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VTB agreed to pay the city of Moscow 103 billion rubles
($3.6 billion) for its 46.5 percent of Bank of Moscow on Feb.
22, and then agreed to buy Goldman Sachs&#8217;s 3.88 percent for 7.14
billion rubles to boost its stake to more than 50 percent,
according to Vedomosti. Kommersant newspaper said March 1 that
Borodin and other Bank of Moscow executives agreed to sell their
combined 20 percent stake to VTB, citing VTB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vadim Sukhoverkhov, a spokesman for VTB, declined to

&lt;p&gt;The rise in oil prices is a &#8220;real
risk&#8221; for U.S. markets, and investors should consider stocks
including Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) based on the potential for crude
to stay high, JPMorgan Chase said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A $20-a-barrel rise in the price of oil over three months
has an impact of $2.22 in earnings per share for the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 Index, Thomas Lee, chief U.S. equity strategist at
the New York-based bank, said in a note yesterday. There&#8217;s
&#8220;downside risk&#8221; to JPMorgan&#8217;s 2011 SP 500 earnings-per-share
estimate of $97.50, though not to the 1,425 year-end forecast,
he said. Crude for April delivery rose $2.51 today to $104.42 a
barrel, the highest settlement since Sept. 26, 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The seeds of a pullback are being sown,&#8221; Lee said in the
note. &#8220;A sustained rise of $20 per barrel in oil is $145
billion in incremental oil spend (70 percent via gasoline) and
effectively acts as a tax on households.&#8221; JPMorgan doesn&#8217;t
expect the &#8220;supply shock&#8221; to affect the full year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil rose today as civil unrest in Libya fueled concern that
supply disruptions in Africa&#8217;s third-largest producer will be
prolonged. Demonstrations have toppled leaders in Tunisia and
Egypt, while there have been protests in countries including
Iraq, Iran, Yemen and Oman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Saudi Arabia, the biggest oil producer in the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, websites have
called for a nationwide &#8220;Day of Rage&#8221; on March 11 and March
20, according to Human Rights Watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil&#8217;s Rise &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude has advanced 15 percent so far this year. The SP 500
has gained 5.1 percent in 2011, after slipping 0.7 percent to
1,321.15 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newmont Mining, Metals USA Holdings Corp. (MUSA), Thompson Creek
Metals Co., Freeport-McMoRan Copper  Gold Inc. (FCX), DHT Holdings
Inc. (DHT), Amgen Inc. (AMGN), Steel Dynamics Inc. (STLD), Jabil Circuit Inc. (JBL) and Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD) are among stocks that may benefit from a
positive leverage to oil and have a &#8220;low&#8221; price-to-earnings
ratio and an &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating from JPMorgan, as well as the
potential to rise at least 10 percent based on JPMorgan&#8217;s price
estimate, Lee said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Cellular Corp., MDC Holdings Inc. (MDC), Affymetrix Inc. (AFFX), Beazer Homes USA Inc. (BZH) and Standard Pacific Corp. (SPF) are stocks to
avoid, based on similar criteria, Lee said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Arthur Lau

sold by American International Group Inc. (AIG) last year, to be head
of fixed income for Asia excluding Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lau, based in Hong Kong, will head a team of eight,
PineBridge said today in a statement posted on its website. He
was formerly a senior portfolio manager and head of Asian
credits at JPMorgan Asset Management in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I look forward to working closely with him as PineBridge
continues to grow its market position in Asia,&#8221; Rajeev Mittal,
head of emerging markets and international fixed income at
PineBridge, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PineBridge, based in New York, had $82 billion in assets
under management as of Dec. 31, according to the statement.
Closely held Pacific Century Group purchased PineBridge from
AIG, where the firm was called AIG Global Investment Corp., for
$500 million in March. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rajat Gupta, a former member of the
board of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and the former head of
McKinsey  Co., was a co-conspirator with Raj Rajaratnam, the
Galleon Group LLC founder at the center of a probe of insider
trading at hedge funds, a U.S. prosecutor said. Gupta passed
information to Rajaratnam about Goldman&#8217;s earnings and about an
investment Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) made in Goldman, the
prosecutor said in a pre-trial court conference. Prosecutors
have not charged Gupta criminally. Rajaratnam&#8217;s criminal trial
starts March 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Joel Rosenblatt and David Glovin" date="Mar 04, 2011 11:20 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-04/goldman-s-blankfein-said-to-agree-to-be-u-s-witness-at-rajaratnam-trial.html"><headline>Blankfein Said to Agree to Be Prosecution Witness at Galleon Insider Trial</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein agreed to be a prosecution
witness in Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam&#8217;s insider
trading trial next week, said a person briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, 56, may not testify because prosecutors
typically line up potential witnesses before a trial who aren&#8217;t
later called on, said the person, who declined to be identified
because the talks are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam is at the center of the largest crackdown on
hedge-fund insider trading in U.S. history. The Sri Lankan-born
billionaire is charged with earning $45 million from
confidential information leaked by corporate insiders and hedge
fund traders. If convicted, the 57-year-old could spend as long
as 20 years in prison on the fraud charges. He denies
wrongdoing, saying he based his trades on Galleon research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors are likely calling Blankfein as a witness to
show that Rajaratnam traded on inside information about Goldman
Sachs, said Andrew Stoltmann, a securities lawyer in Chicago.
Rajaratnam got a tip from then-Goldman Sachs director Rajat Gupta about a $5 billion investment in the firm by Berkshire
Hathaway Inc., and Gupta allegedly passed the news immediately
to Rajaratnam, who bought shares, according to U.S. allegations
in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timeline Issue &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s no question it&#8217;s a timeline issue,&#8221; Stoltmann
said in an interview. Also, &#8220;they really want to rope Goldman
Sachs into the trial&#8221; because the firm may be viewed
unfavorably by jurors, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta&#8217;s lawyer, Gary Naftalis, has called the allegation
&#8220;baseless.&#8221; Rajaratnam&#8217;s lawyer, John Dowd, said yesterday he
may call Gupta as a witness to explain why he was talking with
Rajaratnam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta may invoke his constitutional right not to testify if
he believes it would incriminate him, said Stoltmann, who is not
involved in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission has separately filed
administrative charges accusing Gupta of leaking confidential
information to Rajaratnam, including Berkshire&#8217;s investment in
Goldman, the securities firm&#8217;s quarterly earnings, and the
results of Procter  Gamble Co., where Gupta was also a
director. The action was filed March 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta stepped down from Goldman Sachs&#8217;s board last year and
resigned from Procter  Gamble this week. Gupta is the former
managing director of McKinsey  Co., the consulting firm, and is
currently the firm&#8217;s senior partner emeritus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A block from Greenwich,
Connecticut&#8217;s main street, where Saks Fifth Avenue and Tiffany
stores vie for shoppers, sits the hedge-fund capital&#8217;s YMCA,
brought to the brink of insolvency after building an Olympic-
size swimming pool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than five years after it began, a project to expand
and update the landmark Y remains unfinished as the cost soared
60 percent to $41 million. The Y halted construction and
defaulted on $20 million of municipal bonds, leaving it to
negotiate with creditors such as JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) as it
tries to raise more money in a town that&#8217;s home to some of the
wealthiest people in America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s sad,&#8221; said Michael D&#8217;Andrea, 65, a former Y director
who dropped his membership last year to use another gym. &#8220;They
might be rich here but they&#8217;re not stupid. People are going to
say it&#8217;s like throwing money in a black hole.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Y&#8217;s predicament shows that even in Greenwich, charity
has its limits. The town is home to about 100 hedge funds and
industry leaders including Paul Tudor Jones, founder of Tudor
Investment Corp., and Steven A. Cohen, the billionaire who runs
SAC Capital Advisors LP. Its more than 60,000 residents had a
median family income of $117,857 in 2007, more than double the
$52,673 U.S. midpoint, according to Census Bureau figures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Y&#8217;s directors counted on donations as they sought to
transform the institution into a modern, family-friendly place
worthy of its surroundings, where the average home sells for
about $2.5 million. Instead, as costs soared, contributions fell
30 percent to $3.7 million in 2009 from $5.3 million a year
earlier, according to U.S. Internal Revenue Service filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building for Giving &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was kind of like, if you build it they would give,&#8221;
said Jeffrey Asher, executive director of the Connecticut Health
and Educational Facilities Authority in Hartford, the agency
that approved the nonprofit&#8217;s $20 million tax-exempt bond sale
in 2005. &#8220;You&#8217;d think in Greenwich that would be realistic.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default also illustrates a peril of investing in the
$2.86 trillion municipal-bond market. The Y sold unrated
securities backed initially by a letter of credit from the Bank
of New York Mellon Corp. (BK) Municipal-bond defaults reached a
record $8.5 billion in 2008 amid the credit crisis, falling to
$2.7 billion last year, according to Richard Lehmann, publisher
of Distressed Debt Securities newsletter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenwich residents still support the Y, which opened the
50-meter (164-foot) pool in September 2007, according to Jeffrey Dishner, chairman of the organization&#8217;s board of directors. He
said $6 million is needed to pay bills and finish renovating the
original 57,200 square-foot building. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return to &#8216;Fabulous&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That will solve the problem once and for all,&#8221; said
Dishner, chief operating officer of Starwood Capital Group LLC,
a Greenwich-based private-equity firm started by hotelier Barry Sternlicht. &#8220;I still firmly believe we are going to get this
project completed and return to a fabulous institution.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, sections of the original red-brick building&#8217;s white-
columned facade remain shrouded in debris-retaining green mesh.
An exterior wooden staircase for construction workers extends
from a four-story wing to the ground. A second phase of the
expansion, to add a $7 million gym, has been suspended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parts of the Y&#8217;s unfinished interior are off-limits to its
6,000 members, including a planned child-care center and the old
pool, which was to be converted into a therapeutic facility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Y had to undertake the ambitious overhaul or risk going
out of business, said Sandra Waters, a director and Greenwich
resident. She and her husband, Steve, are named on the wall of
the new pool building to commemorate their donations. When
project planning began in the 1990s, the building was run down
and membership, at fewer than 4,000, was falling, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Leap of Faith&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We decided that really to save the Y we had to do that,&#8221;
Waters said about the project. &#8220;We took a leap of faith.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board hired a new chief executive officer, John Eikrem,
from a YMCA in Beverly Hills, California, in 1997 to oversee the
project. The organization was renamed the Greenwich Family YMCA,
to broaden its appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2002, the Greenwich Planning and Zoning Commission
approved renovating the building and adding 45,300 square feet.
The plan called for replacing the original 60-foot-long pool and
gym built in 1916, as well as adding a 95-space underground
garage on the 2.7 acre site, according to town records.
Membership was projected to rise to 7,500, the records show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Property Sale &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help pay for the work, the Y sold a 30-acre island in Long Island Sound to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for
about $5.5 million in 2003. It also shut down rooms on the top
floors of the building that were rented to transients in
anticipation of the overhaul. The temporary residences were a
legacy from the origins of the Young Men&#8217;s Christian
Association, started in London in 1844. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the state agency approved the Y&#8217;s debt sale in 2005,
officials there were concerned that the amount might be too
great a burden, Asher said. The Y had less than $2 million of
cash and other easy-to-sell assets on hand, after excluding
proceeds from property sales, he said. At the time, he was the
authority&#8217;s chief financial officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Y sold variable-rate bonds, instead of conventional
fixed-rate securities. The backing from the bank&#8217;s letter of
credit gave investors protection from losses in the event of a
default, Asher said. New York-based Gates Capital Corp.
underwrote the securities, according to bond documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundraising was certain to rise to meet costs once the work
began, and membership would reach 10,000, Eikrem told Asher&#8217;s
agency in June 2005, according to minutes of the meeting. The
minutes say that &#8220;$500,000 as capital campaign contributions
for each year has been added to the financial projections,&#8221;
based on fund-raising at Connecticut YMCAs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful Fundraisers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the months before the credit crisis began, the Y held
its most successful annual golf tournament, raising about
$120,000 at the nearby Tamarack Country Club, according to a
video of the event. In May 2007, it attracted about 600 people
for wine and hors d&#8217;oeuvres and brought in $25,000 at the Stone
Chase mansion, a new 18,000 square-foot home built &#8220;on spec&#8221;
by a Y director in the northern reaches of the town. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all, the organization has raised $21.8 million since the
project began, including $13 million from directors and $8.8
million from the community, said Rachel Reese, a spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of that cash helped cover operating losses. In 2008,
the nonprofit reported expenses from operations of about $6.92
million and fee income of about $4.03 million, according to IRS
filings. In 2009, operating costs rose 14 percent to about $7.88
million, while fees increased 12 percent to about $4.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cost Drivers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time the pool opened, the estimated cost to finish
the project was approaching $40 million, up from $25.8 million.
The increase stemmed partly from rising prices for materials
such as steel and from unanticipated site-preparation
complications. Eikrem left the Y in 2007 and was followed by a
succession of three leaders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project ground to a halt in July 2009. Later that year
the Y stopped making monthly interest and principal payments,
triggering a default on its bonds. The organization had budgeted
more than $1 million a year for debt service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worth Construction Co., the project&#8217;s Bethel, Connecticut-
based general contractor, filed a lien against the property
seeking $4.1 million, according to court records. Erik Loftus, a
lawyer at Anderson, Reynolds  Lynch in New Britain,
Connecticut, which represents the company, declined comment when
reached by telephone. Four other companies also filed liens,
totaling about $856,000, according to the records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holding $13 Million &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which in 2008 succeeded the Bank of New York as
the letter of credit provider, now holds about $13 million of
the Y&#8217;s bonds. The New York-based bank sued late last year,
asking a Superior Court judge in neighboring Stamford to make
the Y&#8217;s property available for other uses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebecca Witherell, an heiress whose $100,000 donation in
1912 paid for the original building, put a provision in the deed
that restricts it to the exclusive use by the Y. The building is
listed in the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.
JPMorgan&#8217;s suit remains pending, according to court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Tom Kelly, a spokesman for the bank, the second-largest in
the U.S. by assets, declined comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The creditors are doing what they need to do to preserve
their position,&#8221; said Dishner, the Y&#8217;s board chairman. They are
&#8220;being quite helpful&#8221; by giving the organization more time to
raise money, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dishner declined to comment on local news reports that
Greenwich Hospital, which is part of the Yale New Haven Health
System, is in talks to take over the new pool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploring Opportunities &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Greenwich Hospital is constantly exploring new
opportunities to enhance the health and wellness of our
community,&#8221; said George Pawlush, a spokesman for the
institution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Y has joined the bank in asking the court to remove the
deed restriction, according to Reese, the spokeswoman. Dean
Montgomery, a lawyer at Bentley, Mosher, Babson  Lambert PC in
Greenwich who represents the trustee for Mary D. Washbourne, an
heir of the Witherell estate, declined comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A lot of people worked really, really hard to try to make
it a better Y,&#8221; said Frank Farricker, a Greenwich Planning and
Zoning commissioner. &#8220;A lot of people made exceptional
sacrifices. There is a lot of concern that it may not survive
and that would not be a good thing for the town.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
