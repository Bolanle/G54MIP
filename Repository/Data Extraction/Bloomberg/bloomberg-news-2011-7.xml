<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE)''s anti-smoking pill
Chantix may receive new warnings from U.S. regulators after a
study released today found the drug increased the risk of
hospitalizations for heart problems by 72 percent. </p>
<p>The report, led by researchers at Johns Hopkins University,
analyzed 14 Pfizer-sponsored drug trials with 8,216 patients and
found about one new heart attack or similar disorder for every
400 patients taking Chantix. The U.S. Food and Drug
Administration is examining the study and may consider new
warnings, Curtis Rosenbraugh, director of the agency''s office of
drug evaluation, said in an interview. </p>
<p>Chantix revenue has declined since the FDA warned in 2009
that the medicine may increase suicides and erratic behavior.
Regulators last month added a warning for patients with a
history of heart disease, based on a 700-patient study. The new
analysis shows the greatest increased risk may be among patients
with no signs of heart problems, said Sonal Singh, lead author
of today''s study. </p>
<p>I stopped prescribing Chantix several months ago, as soon
as we found out about this data, said Singh, a doctor and
professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in
Baltimore. I''m not saying that nobody should use it, but I
think people should have this information. They should decide
whether the risk is acceptable to them. </p>
<p>Pfizer Disagrees </p>
<p>Chantix affects dopamine, a chemical in the brain involved
in controlling mood and behavior. Because dopamine triggers a
positive mood response, regulating its levels can remove some of
the pleasure derived from smoking. The drug is the most
effective pill to help smokers quit, and is about as effective
as nicotine-replacement supplements available as patches,
chewing gum, lozenges, nasal sprays and inhalers, Singh said. </p>
<p>Pfizer disagrees with the interpretation of the data,
said Gail Cawkwell, vice president of medical affairs at New
York-based Pfizer, in an e-mail. The health benefits of
quitting smoking are immediate and substantial. Pfizer strongly
believes in and supports Chantix as an important treatment
option. </p>
<p>Chantix had sales of $755 million last year, down 14
percent from its high of $883 million in 2007, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The increased risk of heart problems while taking Chantix,
if confirmed, doesn''t cancel out the benefits of taking the drug
to quit smoking, J. Taylor Hays, a doctor who specializes in
nicotine dependence at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota,
wrote in an editorial published with Singh''s study in the
Canadian Medical Association Journal. </p>
<p>Worst Outcome </p>
<p>The worst outcome of this study would be for health-care
providers to abandon Chantix, Hays wrote. The risk for
serious cardiovascular adverse events is low and is greatly
outweighed by the benefits of diminishing the truly
heartbreaking effects of smoking. </p>
<p>An FDA staff review from 2006 shows the agency was aware of
a potential link between Chantix and serious heart
complications. At the time, two researchers were asked to
independently review each reported heart problem to rule out
cases that were incorrectly reported or not related to the drug.
On closer inspection, one reviewer said there was a 16 percent
added risk of heart problems with Chantix, while the second
reviewer found an 8 percent decreased risk, according to the
staff documents. </p>
<p>We saw a swing going anywhere from favorable to
unfavorable, said the FDA''s Rosenbraugh. When you get
results like that it''s hard to draw a definitive conclusion.
It''s not something we would label. </p>
<p>Label Uncertain </p>
<p>Dr. Singh has added to what we have seen and is helping
to define the picture better, Rosenbraugh said. I''m not sure
until we can further evaluate the study whether it''s going to
change the label or not, but I can assure you this is something
we''re very concerned about and are taking very seriously. </p>
<p>Any risk from the Chantix needs to be evaluated against the
benefits of quitting smoking, he said. The drug is taken for a
short period of time to help people quit, while the significant
health risks of continued smoking continue for a lifetime. For
long-term smokers, more than half will die from complications
related to their habit, according to a study of British doctors
in 2004. </p>
<p>We don''t want to send the message that people shouldn''t
try to quit smoking, Rosenbraugh said. We just want to send
the message that you should be cautious and look for
cardiovascular symptoms should they occur. </p>
<p>New Analysis </p>
<p>In the new heart study, 52 patients had serious
cardiovascular complications among 4,908 patients taking
Chantix, compared with 27 hospitalizations among 3,308 patients
taking a placebo. The risk of Chantix complications was doubled
for patients with no history of heart disease, Singh said. </p>
<p>The studies included in today''s report ranged from 7 to 52
weeks in duration. It''s not clear whether the added heart risk
persists after treatment ends, Singh said. </p>
<p>GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)''s competing drug, Zyban, has been found
to cause irregular heartbeats and increases in blood pressure in
some patients, according to the FDA. The 700-patient study cited
by the FDA last month was conducted by Pfizer to assess the risk
of Chantix in patients with a history of heart disease. </p>
<p>That study found an increased risk of heart attack and
chest pains, though the results weren''t statistically
significant. The report prompted the FDA to seek a new analysis
of all available trials using the raw data from the original
research. That study will be completed by Pfizer within months,
not years, the FDA''s Rosenbraugh and Pfizer''s Cawkwell said,
without giving a specific time frame. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Baidu Inc. agreed
to bolster their Internet-search partnership in China as the
companies seek to gain users from Google Inc. (GOOG) in the world''s
biggest Internet market. </p>
<p>The agreement will let Baidu users see English search
results generated by the U.S. company''s Bing technology to users
in China, Viola Wang, a spokeswoman at Microsoft''s MSN venture
in China, said by phone today. A service jointly offered by the
companies will start this year, Baidu said in an e-mailed
statement today. </p>
<p>Baidu, based in Beijing, is expanding outside its main
business of Chinese-language search, after fending off Google in
China. Microsoft, which is gaining users for Bing in the U.S.,
is building on its partnership with Baidu after ending a search-
engine agreement with China''s Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd. </p>
<p>This is not good news for Google, said Jake Li, who
rates Baidu shares accumulate at Guotai Junan Securities in
Shenzhen. Most Chinese Internet users currently prefer Google''s
English-language search results over Baidu, whose service will
be improved by the partnership with Microsoft, he said. </p>
<p>Google declined to comment. </p>
<p>Google, owner of the world''s most popular search engine,
accounted for 19.2 percent of China''s search market by revenue
in the first quarter, down from 19.6 percent three months
earlier, according to research firm Analysys International.
Google''s figures includes revenue generated from its local sites
and international services, according to Analysys. </p>
<p>Market-Share Losses </p>
<p>Increased demand from Chinese companies marketing on
international websites such as the English-language Google.com
helped Google post increased revenue in China in 2010, Daniel Alegre, president for Asia-Pacific at Google, said in December. </p>
<p>Google has lost market share to Baidu in China since the
Mountain View, California-based company pulled its Google.cn
search-engine out of the country last year, according to data
from Analysys. Baidu increased its share to 75.8 percent from
75.5 percent in the first quarter, while Microsoft Bing''s market
share is less than 1 percent, according to Analysys. </p>
<p>Baidu had an existing agreement with Bing for some mobile-
phone users in China, Haoyu Shen, senior vice-president at
Baidu, said in May. Baidu is working on efforts to expand
overseas, and its developing products in 12 foreign languages,
Shen said at the time. </p>
<p>Alibaba stopped offering Microsoft Bing on its eTao search
service, Justine Chao, a spokeswoman at Alibaba, said in May. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) appointed
two senior bankers to run Japanese equity and bond underwriting
and set up a public-sector group to boost its investment banking
business following the country''s record earthquake. </p>
<p>Yasuro Koizumi and Makoto Ito will be co-heads of the
financing group in Japan, succeeding Jasper Tans, who will
return to London, according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg News.
Mitsunari Okamoto will head the new group that will focus on the
government sector, infrastructure and utilities, the memo said. </p>
<p>The U.S. bank is betting that demand for debt financing
from municipalities will increase as the nation recovers from
its worst postwar disaster. Japan''s government is also preparing
to exit investments in companies including Tokyo Metro Co. and
Japan Airlines Co. through initial public offerings. </p>
<p>We are strengthening the investment banking structure as
demand from public-sector clients will increase as the nation
looks to rebuild after the earthquake, said Masanori Mochida,
president of Goldman Sachs Japan Co. in Tokyo. It will enhance
our commitment to help Japan''s central and local governments
work on privatization projects and issue bonds. </p>
<p>Hiroko Matsumoto, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman, confirmed the
contents of the memo. </p>
<p>Planes, Trains </p>
<p>State-run Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corp. of Japan,
which owns shares in Japan Airlines, said on July 1 it will
begin selecting lead underwriters this month for an IPO of the
carrier by January 2013. Tokyo Metro, a government-owned subway
operator, plans to list as soon as possible, according to its
business plan. </p>
<p>Koizumi joined Goldman Sachs in 1999 as debt syndicate head
in Japan, while Ito entered the bank in 1997 and had a stint at
equity capital markets in Hong Kong, according to the memo.
Okamoto joined the company in 1998 and has worked at the firm''s
debt capital markets division in New York, it said. All three
are managing directors. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs in June helped the Ibaraki prefectural
government raise 10 billion yen ($124 million) from a bond
issuance backed by future revenue from a waste-processing
facility in the prefecture, the local government said. </p>
<p>The U.S. bank has experience backing sales of Japanese
government stakes in enterprises including Japan Tobacco Inc. (2914),
Nippon Telegraph  Telephone Corp. (9432), NTT DoCoMo Inc. (9437) and East
Japan Railway Co. (9020), as part of privatization campaigns. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs was No. 3 underwriter for Japanese equity and
equity-linked products last year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The bank helped Panasonic Corp. (6752), the world''s largest
maker of plasma televisions, raise 500 billion yen in Japan''s
biggest sale of corporate bonds in March. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) appointed
five new partners in Australia and named Simon Rothery as the
unit''s sole chief executive officer after the New York-based
parent completed the takeover of the business. </p>
<p>Rothery, who joined Goldman Sachs in 1998, and the co-heads
of investment banking, James McMurdo and Christian Johnston,
become partners, according to an internal memo sent to Bloomberg
News today. Andrew Rennie, head of equities, and Anthony Miller
from the financing group were also appointed. </p>
<p>The purchase of the remaining 55 percent of the unit last
week means Goldman Sachs now owns all its Asian operations
except the division in China. The offer valued the whole
business at between A$800 million ($859 million) and A$1.2
billion, according to the Australian Financial Review. The Wall
Street firm didn''t disclose the value of the deal. </p>
<p>Stephen Fitzgerald, a member of Goldman Sachs'' Asia
management committee and formerly co-CEO in Australia with
Rothery, becomes chairman and advisory director of the business,
according to the memo. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) Smith Barney, the
world''s largest brokerage, said compact discs containing tax
information of 34,000 clients were lost in transit to the New
York State Department of Taxation and Finance. </p>
<p>Clients were notified of the loss in a letter mailed last
month, said Jim Wiggins, a spokesman for New York-based Morgan
Stanley. The two password-protected CDs, which weren''t
encrypted, contained some clients'' account numbers and Social
Security numbers, as well as interest earned on tax-exempt bonds
and funds, Wiggins said. </p>
<p>We''ve seen no evidence of criminal intent or actual
misuse of this information, he said. We were informed that
the package appeared to be intact when it was received at the
department, but when it was delivered internally to the intended
recipient, the CDs were not there. </p>
<p>The discs weren''t located in a joint search with the
Taxation department and the U.S. Postal Service, Wiggins said.
For clients whose Social Security numbers were included on the
discs, MSSB offered to pay for a year of credit monitoring
provided by a third party, Wiggins said. </p>
<p>We are exploring with New York State how to improve the
security of this kind of data transmission, he said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley bought a controlling stake in a joint
venture with Citigroup Inc.''s Smith Barney unit in 2009. The
purchase gave it a retail brokerage that had 17,800 financial
advisers and $1.72 trillion in client assets as of March 31. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and consumers
who sued the bank over claims of excessive overdraft fees have
reached an impasse in settlement talks, a mediator said. </p>
<p>Two mediation sessions held between the company and the
plaintiffs'' committee on March 17 and June 28 failed, the
mediator, Thomas E. Scott, said July 1 in a report filed in
federal court in Miami. </p>
<p>Following the second effort, the undersigned has decided
to declare an impasse at this time, according to the document
signed by Scott. </p>
<p>Consumers sued accusing JPMorgan and more than a dozen
other banks of illegally charging excessive fees for overdrafts.
Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the largest U.S. lender by assets, agreed
to pay $410 million in February to settle the lawsuits against
it. The bank didn''t admit any liability in the cases. </p>
<p>Los Angeles resident Andrea Luquetta sued JPMorgan in 2009
claiming the bank''s overdraft fees were excessive, unfair and
deceptive. The suit named JPMorgan and Washington Mutual Bank
Inc., which JPMorgan acquired in 2008. The case is now part of
multidistrict litigation in the Miami court. </p>
<p>Thomas Kelly, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment on
the report. Jeremy W. Alters, a plaintiffs'' attorney, didn''t
immediately reply to phone and e-mail messages seeking comment. </p>
<p>FDIC Enforcement </p>
<p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. last week began
enforcing rules aimed at reducing overdraft fees. The FDIC rules
followed industrywide regulation approved by the Federal Reserve
last year requiring banks to obtain customers'' permission to
enroll them in overdraft programs. The FDIC rules impose daily
limits on overdraft fees charged to customers. </p>
<p>Consumers incur overdraft fees when they debit sums beyond

<p>Citigroup Inc., the New York-based
bank that reorganized its trading desk this year, hired JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM)''s John Novak for its equities unit. </p>
<p>Novak, head of U.S. cash equities sales trading, resigned
today from JPMorgan, said Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for
the New York-based bank. He will be a sales trader and report to
Citigroup U.S. head of cash equity sales trading Dan Sanders
after a mandatory 90-day period of garden leave, said
Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a Citi spokeswoman. </p>
<p>Citigroup Chief Executive Officer Vikram Pandit reshuffled
trading operations this year, promoting James Forese to head of
securities and banking in January. The equities unit is run by
Derek Bandeen, who appointed Mike Pringle as head of trading in
April. The bank, the third-largest in the U.S., said first-
quarter equities-trading revenue fell 12 percent to $1.1 billion
from the year-earlier period. </p>
<p>Average daily equity-trading in the second quarter on the
largest U.S. exchanges fell 31 percent from a year earlier and
9.6 percent from the prior period. Equity trading at JPMorgan
generated $1.4 billion, or 17 percent, of the investment bank''s
$8.2 billion in revenue in the first quarter. Analysts including
Nomura Holdings Inc.''s Glenn Schorr cut JPMorgan''s second-
quarter earnings estimates in part because of sluggish

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Google Inc. (GOOG)
were sued for allegedly violating a Louisiana company''s patent
covering mapping technology that helps computer users see
locations in three dimensions. </p>
<p>Officials of Transcenic Inc. contend in a lawsuit that
executives of Google, owner of the world''s biggest search
engine, and Microsoft, the world''s biggest software maker,
infringe patents for technology that helps capture 3-D images of
map locations. </p>
<p>The companies'' misuse of the mapping technology has
injured Transcenic and Transcenic is entitled to recover damages
adequate to compensate for such infringement, the closely held
Lake Charles, Louisiana-based company said July 1 in a suit
filed in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware. </p>
<p>Patents covering computer-mapping software have sparked
litigation against Google, Microsoft and other companies in
federal courts around the U.S. GeoTag Inc. has filed patent-
infringement suits against 300 entities, many of which use
mapping technology made by Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft
or Mountain View, California-based Google to show store
locations. </p>
<p>Jay Nancarrow, a Google spokesman, couldn''t immediately
comment July 1. Kevin Kutz, a Microsoft spokesman, didn''t
immediately return a call for comment. </p>
<p>Transcenic argues computer programs such as Google''s Street
View and Microsoft''s Streetside allow users to see 3-D images of
their destination rather than the traditional birds-eye view of
a map grid. </p>
<p>Google''s Street View system also has become a target for
lawsuits alleging the company is violating residents'' privacy
rights by collecting data from individual Wi-Fi networks. A
federal judge in California June 30 said a wiretapping suit over
the system could proceed. </p>
<p>Both Google and Microsoft have placed infringing systems
into action or service and obtain beneficial use of those
systems, lawyers for Transcenic said in the suit. </p>
<p>The patent-infringement suit also names AOL Inc. (AOL) and its
MapQwest unit as defendants. Sandy Drayton, an AOL spokeswoman,
didn''t immediately return a phone call for comment on the suit. </p>

District Court for the District of Delaware (Wilmington). </p>
<p>Apple Gets Mixed Ruling in S3 Chip Patent Case Before ITC </p>
<p>Apple Inc. (AAPL) received a mixed ruling in the patent-
infringement case brought by closely held S3 Graphics Co. over a
type of chip used to play video games on mobile devices. </p>
<p>Apple violates two S3 patents and was found to not have
infringed two others, U.S. International Trade Commission Judge
James Gildea said in a notice posted July 1 on the Washington-
based agency''s website. The findings are subject to review by
the six-member commission, which can block imports of products
that infringe U.S. patents. </p>
<p>S3, whose Texture Compression feature is used in Nintendo
Co.''s Wii and Sony Corp.''s PlayStation portable gaming systems,
claimed Apple was infringing four patents. The Fremont,
California-based company''s image compression technology allows
for access to encoded large color and 3-D image files to present
lifelike animation in video games. </p>
<p>The ITC complaint targets Apple''s Macintosh computer,
iPhone, iPad tablet and iPod Touch as well as video games for
those devices. Cupertino, California-based Apple makes its
products overseas and imports them into the U.S. for sale. </p>
<p>The ITC will decide within 60 days whether it will review
the judge''s decision. The case is scheduled to be completed by
Nov. 1, according to information on the commission''s website. </p>
<p>Apple is involved in more than a dozen patent cases at the
ITC, a quasi-judicial trade agency that has become a de facto
arbiter for disputes over intellectual property rights. </p>
<p>The commission June 30 ordered a judge to take a second
look at a case brought by Eastman Kodak Co. over an image
preview feature in mobile phones. The ITC also said in a

<p>Viacom Sued by Connecticut Disc Jockey Over DJ Paulie'' Marks </p>
<p>Viacom Inc. (VIA/B) was sued for trademark infringement by a
Connecticut disc jockey who objects to names used in connection
with a character from MTV''s Jersey Shore reality television
program. </p>
<p>Paul Lis of South Windsor, Connecticut, began broadcasting
as DJ Paulie in 1971. He''s also used the name for his own
record label, and for public appearances, he said in the
complaint filed June 30 in federal court in Hartford,
Connecticut. </p>
<p>Lis said as DJ Paulie he was commissioned to write and
produce September Mourn, the official 9/11 memorial
fundraising song for the U.S. Postal Service to benefit the
victims'' families. He has several registered U.S. trademarks for
the term DJ Paulie for disc jockey services. </p>
<p>When Viacom''s MTV Networks began airing the Jersey
Shore reality show, he said his trademarks were tarnished by
the association the public made with a character on the show. He
claims Jersey Shore shows a debauched lifestyle suggestive
of loose morals, violence, intoxication and liberal profanity,
and says it''s the exact opposite of the reputation he''s spent
decades cultivating. </p>
<p>From the time the show began to air in late 2009, it had
an immediate negative impact on his DJPaulie.com website,
and destroyed national advertiser interest in an Internet
radio show he performs, Lis said in his pleadings. He accused
Viacom of placing content on the Internet with metatags using
the spelling of DJ Paulie to direct traffic to sites associated
with one of the Jersey Shore characters. </p>
<p>Paul DelVecchio Jr., a performer on Jersey Shore,
promotes himself on the show as a disc jockey under the name
DJ Pauly and DJ Pauly D. according to court papers. Lis
said he''s harmed by this, and by applications DelVecchio has
filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to register DJ
Pauly D as a trademark. </p>
<p>Viacom didn''t respond immediately to an e-mailed request
for comment. </p>
<p>Lis claims he''s suffered damage to a $2 million business
investment and asked the court for an order barring the use of
the names DJ Paulie and DJ Pauly or similar names by
Viacom and other defendants, including DelVecchio himself. </p>
<p>Additionally, he seeks awards of money damages, extra
damages to punish the defendants for their actions, and for
attorney fees and litigation costs. </p>
<p>Lis is represented by Jose Rojas of the Rojas Law Firm of
Hartford. </p>
<p>The case is Paul Lis DJ Paulie Broadcasting LLC v. Paul
DelVecchio Jr., 3:11-cv-01057-AWT, U.S. District Court, District
of Connecticut (Hartford). </p>

<p>In a June 14 ruling, U.S. District Judge Roger L. Hunt said
that Righthaven LLC, the named plaintiff in the case, didn''t
have standing because it didn''t truly own the copyright it was
trying to enforce. </p>
<p>Judge Hunt then gave Righthaven two weeks to show why it
shouldn''t be sanctioned for this flagrant misrepresentation
about its ownership of the Stephens copyrights. </p>
<p>In a June 29 filing with the court, Righthaven said its in-
house counsel failed to consider copyright law''s requirement
that an enforcer have a direct pecuniary interest in the case.
Righthaven said in a footnote that two of the lawyers originally
associated with the case are no longer employed by
Righthaven. </p>
<p>In May, Righthaven added Dale Cendali of Chicago''s Kirkland
 Ellis LLP to its outside legal team. </p>
<p>Cendali may be best known for her successful representation
of Harry Potter''s U.S. publisher Scholastic Corp. (SCHL) in a trademark
case. She also represented the Associated Press in the
copyright-infringement case involving the photo of President
Obama against artist Shepard Fairey. </p>
<p>When she was with Los Angeles-based O''Melveny  Myers LLP,
she represented the Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance
in a trademark suit involving the name of the late Martha
Graham. Cendali moved from O''Melveny to Chicago-based Kirkland 
Ellis in March 2009. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) Chief Executive
Officer Robert Iger said that the owners of Hulu LLC, the video-
streaming service, are committed to selling. </p>
<p>There''s a lot of interest, he said in an interview at
the Allen  Co. conference in Sun Valley, Idaho. Hulu''s owners
include Disney, News Corp. (NWSA) and Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)''s NBC Universal. </p>
<p>Bankers for Hulu have met with Google Inc. (GOOG), Yahoo Inc. and
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) as the company explores a sale, people familiar
with the process said last week. The 10 to 12 potential bidders
Morgan Stanley (MS) and Guggenheim Partners have reached out to also
include ATT Inc. (T) </p>
<p>A sale would eliminate a conflict by setting up Hulu as an
independent buyer of movies and TV shows for online viewing,
said Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Morgan Securities
in Los Angeles. Hulu competes for content with the owners'' other
online customers, such as Netflix Inc. (NFLX), he said. </p>
<p>Hulu may fetch more than $2 billion, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg and SNL Kagan. The Los Angeles-based
company hired bankers after a potential suitor expressed
interest, people familiar with the matter said on June 21. </p>
<p>Under a new owner, Hulu may also gain capital to acquire
more films and TV shows and challenge Netflix, the dominant
subscription streaming service. </p>
<p>Hulu said today it will exceed 1 million users for its
$7.99-a-month service by the end of the U.S. summer season,
earlier than the year-end goal the company initially set.
Netflix, based in Los Gatos, California, has 23 million
customers and may generate $3.25 billion in revenue this year,
the average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg survey. </p>
<p>Branded Content'' </p>
<p>Iger declined to comment on the specifics of any
discussions or on whether movies and television shows would be
licensed exclusively to Hulu. </p>
<p>I don''t want to comment on any aspect of the deal, he
said. It''s a good time to be in the content business though,
the branded content business. </p>
<p>Disney fell 40 cents to $39.57 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange trading and has climbed 5.5 percent this year. Netflix
added $1.33 to $290.96 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading and has
gained 66 percent this year. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs  Co., a unit of the
most profitable bank in Wall Street history, took $15 billion
from the U.S. Federal Reserve on Dec. 9, 2008, the biggest
single loan from a lending program whose details have been
secret until today. </p>
<p>The program, which peaked at $80 billion in loans
outstanding, was known as the Fed''s single-tranche open-market
operations, or ST OMO. It made 28-day loans to units of 19 banks
between March 7, 2008, and Dec. 30, 2008. Bloomberg reported on
ST OMO in May, after the Fed released incomplete records on the
program. In response to a subsequent Freedom of Information Act
request for details, the central bank disclosed borrower names,
amounts borrowed and interest rates. </p>
<p>ST OMO is the last known Fed crisis lending program to have
its details made public. The central bank resisted previous FOIA
requests on emergency lending for more than two years,
disclosing details in March of its oldest loan facility, the
discount window, only after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled it had
to. When Congress mandated the December 2010 release of data on
special initiatives the Fed created in its unprecedented $3.5
trillion response to the 2007-2009 collapse in credit markets,
ST OMO -- an expansion of a longstanding program -- wasn''t
included. </p>
<p>The Fed has come a long way over a long period of time as
far as transparency, said Raymond W. Stone, managing director
and economist with Stone  McCarthy Research Associates in
Princeton, New Jersey. They thought counterparties might be
harmed, but now so much time has passed that the information is
not as sensitive anymore. </p>
<p>Primary Dealers </p>
<p>The 19 borrowers from the program are known as primary
dealers, which are designated to trade government securities
directly with Federal Reserve Bank of New York. They bid at
auctions for ST OMO''s cash. While the rates they paid generally
tracked the federal funds rate, the rate for some dipped as low
as 0.01 percent in December 2008. </p>
<p>The New York Fed conducted 44 ST OMO auctions, according to
its website. Banks bid the interest rate they were willing to
pay for the loans and pledged mortgage-backed securities
guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises such as Fannie
Mae or Freddie Mac as collateral for the Fed''s cash. The
transactions were known as repurchase agreements, or repos. </p>
<p>Longstanding Program </p>
<p>ST OMO was an expansion of longstanding open-market
operations, which offered cash for up to two weeks and were used
as a tool of monetary policy. In March 2008, the Fed adapted the
program to alleviate pressures in short-term credit markets,
according to a news release the central bank issued at the time. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) agreed to a $228
million settlement on charges it conspired to rig the bidding on
investment contracts sold to state and local governments to
boost its profits at taxpayer expense. </p>
<p>The agreement ends investigations of the second-largest
U.S. bank by the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the attorneys general of 25 states including the
District of Columbia, the Justice Department and SEC said today. </p>
<p>Federal investigators have probed for more than four years
how banks and financial advisers fixed bids on investment
contracts to let them pay governments below-market rates.
JPMorgan''s penalties are the largest yet to result from that
investigation, which also led to settlements with UBS AG (UBSN) and
Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the biggest U.S. bank by assets. </p>
<p>JPMorgan improperly won bids by entering into secret
arrangements with bidding agents to get an illegal last look''
at competitors'' bids, Robert Khuzami, director of the SEC''s
enforcement division, said in a statement. Municipal issuers
and investors didn''t stand a chance against the fraudulent
strategies, he said. </p>
<p>Criminal charges have been brought against 18 finance-
industry employees in the past two years, nine of whom have
pleaded guilty, including James Hertz, a former JPMorgan banker.
Hertz is one of five former workers at the bank who received
letters informing them that they are targets of the Justice
Department probe, according to regulatory filings. </p>
<p>Wide-Ranging </p>
<p>Court documents filed by prosecutors point to wide-ranging
collusion by Wall Street banks, insurance companies and advisers
hired by public officials to guide their investments. Papers
entered in a case against CDR Financial Products Inc., an
advisory firm based in Los Angeles, identified more than a dozen
banks and insurers as co-conspirators. </p>
<p>The accord marks the second for JPMorgan arising from its
municipal-derivatives business, which sold the investment
contracts as well as interest-rate swaps to state and local
governments, before the bank shut it down in 2008. In November
2009, the bank entered a $722 million accord with the SEC to end
a separate investigation over its sales of derivatives to
Jefferson County, Alabama, where its bankers made undisclosed
payments to friends of county commissioners to win business. </p>
<p>Settlement Terms </p>
<p>As part of today''s settlement, JPMorgan took responsibility
for illegal, anticompetitive conduct by its former
employees, the Justice Department said. The SEC said the bank
neither admitted nor denied claims in the agency''s complaint. </p>
<p>The accord includes $92 million for the states and the
district, $35 million for the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency, $51.2 million for the SEC and $50 million for the
Internal Revenue Service. The agreement with the states provides
for $17 million of payments in connection with the federal
settlement. JPMorgan said the deal will lead to $211.2 million
in net payments. </p>
<p>The bank doesn''t tolerate anticompetitive activity or
other violations of law, JPMorgan said in the statement. The
firm assisted the government agencies in their investigations
and is pleased to have resolved this matter with its
regulators, the bank said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan has increased the number of legal and compliance
staff in its public-finance division and raised the level of
auditing, said Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman. The bank also
has increased antitrust, ethics and other training, she said. </p>
<p>Shares Climb </p>
<p>The New York-based bank rose 76 cents, or 1.9 percent,
today on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have gained 8.3
percent in the past year. </p>
<p>The investment contracts at the center of the charges are
purchased by states and cities with proceeds of money raised in
the $2.9 trillion municipal bond market, allowing them to earn a
return until the cash is needed for public works projects. </p>
<p>While competitive bidding is meant to ensure local
governments get market rates on their investments, prosecutors
say bankers and brokers carved up the market among themselves.
Federal prosecutors say that inflated their earnings at the
expense of taxpayers and the Treasury, which collects levies on
investment earnings from tax-exempt bond proceeds. </p>
<p>The investigation is continuing and may result in
additional charges and settlements. To settle similar cases,
Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America in December
agreed to pay $137 million, and Zurich-based UBS agreed to pay
$160 million in May. </p>
<p>Full Pipeline'' </p>
<p>We have a pretty full pipeline on post-crisis cases,
SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro said today in an interview. So I
think hopefully we''ll see some more activity. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s misconduct ranged from 1997 to 2005, the SEC
said. The agency''s charges say bankers there received tips from
brokers that enabled them to win deals, or adjust their bids to
make them more profitable, and then lied to cover their tracks.
The bank also submitted sham offers in auctions that were won by
rivals to give the appearance of competitive bidding. </p>
<p>The SEC said at least 11 different bidding agents, who ran
the auctions, also participated, and JPMorgan steered work to
those firms in return. </p>
<p>The conspiracy spanned at least 93 transactions related to
the proceeds of more than $14.3 billion raised by borrowers in
31 states, the SEC said in its complaint. The agency said the
trades produced millions of dollars in ill-gotten gains. </p>
<p>The settlement will provide cash to municipalities
victimized in the scheme. </p>
<p>Among them are the Pennsylvania Intergovernmental
Cooperation Authority, which will get about $3.32 million, and
Philadelphia, in line for almost $1.38 million; Chicago, which
will get about $1.32 million. The Orlando, Florida, airport
authority will receive more than $853,700, according to the
agreement between JPMorgan and the U.S. Comptroller''s office. </p>

<p>Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. and
Safeco Corp. sued Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) for making
misleading statements and omissions in a preferred-stock
offering for Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (FMCC) in 2007. </p>
<p>The plaintiffs, which also include Peerless Insurance Co.,
said they invested $37.5 million in the offering of Freddie Mac
shares, which Goldman underwrote, according to a filing
yesterday in federal court in Boston. </p>
<p>Goldman claimed Freddie Mac already met its regulatory
capital requirements and that the offering was made to
increase the mortgage company''s capital base, the plaintiffs
said. </p>
<p>The stated purpose for the offering was false, the
plaintiffs said in the complaint. Goldman knew or recklessly
ignored that Freddie Mac did not meet its regulatory capital
requirements, and Freddie Mac remained severely undercapitalized
even after the sale of the preferred stock. </p>
<p>The suit is without merit and we intend to contest it
vigorously, Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based
Goldman Sachs, said in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>The insurers are seeking damages of more than $100 million
and a trial by jury. They said in the complaint that their
investments are virtually worthless. </p>
<p>Subprime Defaults </p>
<p>Freddie Mac, based in McLean, Virginia, is a corporation
chartered by Congress to provide liquidity to the U.S. mortgage
market. It buys mortgage loans from banks and bundles them into
mortgage-backed securities that are sold to investors. </p>
<p>In 2006, home prices in the U.S. began to decline and
subprime mortgage loans, given to homeowners who don''t have the
highest credit ratings, began to default at increasing rates. </p>
<p>Freddie Mac issued 240 million shares of Series Z preferred
shares in November 2007, raising about $5.9 billion, according
to the lawsuit. The shares were backed by billions of dollars
in subprime residential mortgages, the suit claimed. </p>
<p>Goldman''s bets against subprime-backed securities resulted
in a profit of $3.7 billion in 2007, the insurance companies
claimed in the suit. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs rose $1.12, or 0.8 percent, to $135.01 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Freddie Mac
was little changed at 37 cents in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
Boston-based Liberty, Seattle-based Safeco and Keene, New
Hampshire-based Peerless don''t trade publicly. </p>
<p>The case is Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. v. Goldman Sachs 
Co., 11-11194, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts
(Boston). </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s biggest
drugmaker, narrowed its plans to sell or spin off businesses,
saying today it would divest only the Animal Health and Baby
Food units, with combined annual sales of $5.5 billion. </p>
<p>The company''s shares fell 2.7 percent, as Pfizer said it
will keep the larger established products and consumer health
units within the parent company. Those businesses had revenue of
$12.9 billion last year. Investors have been pressing Chief
Executive Officer Ian Read to slim the drugmaker and focus on
developing new medicines. </p>
<p>Read said on Feb. 1 he was reviewing each of the four
business areas that aren''t involved in drug discovery as the
company faces loss of exclusivity for its biggest product, the
Lipitor cholesterol pill. Since then, Pfizer shares climbed 14
percent before today as investors anticipated the benefits from
sales and spinoffs. </p>
<p>It doesn''t transform Pfizer, it only adjusts it, said
Erik Gordon, a University of Michigan business professor in Ann
Arbor who studies the biomedical industry. Shedding the
consumer business would have been more interesting. </p>
<p>Pfizer fell 55 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $20.23 at 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
climbed 38 percent in the past 12 months. </p>
<p>The plan is to enhance the value of established products
and consumer health care within Pfizer, said Joan Campion, a
spokeswoman for Pfizer. That said, as is typical of global
companies our size, we will continue to assess our businesses
and assets on a regular ongoing basis. </p>
<p>Share Repurchases </p>
<p>Pfizer said it doesn''t anticipate making more announcements
about the alternatives for the two units until sometime in 2012,
and that any transaction could take as many as 24 months to
complete. Read said in a May 3 interview he plans to use
proceeds from the sales to buy back shares. The company sold
Capsugel, a hard-capsules business, to KKR  Co. in April for
$2.38 billion. </p>
<p>J.P. Morgan will advise on the Animal Health business,
while Morgan Stanley and Centerview Partners are advisers on the
Nutrition unit, Pfizer said. </p>
<p>From a credit standpoint, we view the news as a negative,
with the likely separation of two growing and healthy units,
said Joel Levington, managing director of corporate credit at
Brookfield Investment Management Inc. in New York, in an e-mail.
He said the moves may lead to negative rating actions at
Standard  Poor''s and Fitch Ratings. </p>
<p>No Immediate Impact </p>
<p>While today''s moves are negative for Pfizer''s credit
standing, Moody''s Investors Service doesn''t have any immediate
plans to lower the drugmaker''s rating, said Michael Levesque, a
Moody''s analyst, in a statement. </p>
<p>Pfizer was smart to keep the established products unit,
which makes generic drugs and medicines that have lost patent
exclusivity, said David Maris, an analyst with CLSA in New York.
Read said in May that about $915 million of the unit''s $2.37
billion in first-quarter sales were in emerging markets, an area
where the company plans to grow. </p>
<p>To give up emerging markets is a silly proposition,
because that is the future, Maris said in a telephone
interview. I''m sure there was some subset of investors that
was still hoping for established products to be divested. We''ve
said for a long time that wouldn''t make sense. </p>
<p>Various Buyers </p>
<p>Maris said the animal health and baby food units will
attract a variety of potential buyers, including private equity
and pharmaceutical companies hoping to diversify their product
offerings or gain market share in animal medicines or infant
formula sales. He said a spinoff of either unit is possible,
though a sale is more likely. </p>
<p>Tim Anderson, the Sanford C. Bernstein analyst whose March
14 research report drove up Pfizer shares on speculation the
company may halve its revenue base, said the company might take
different approaches to each unit. </p>
<p>Our best guess is that animal health could be a spin-out,
a tax-free transaction like Bristol-Myers Squibb did with Mead Johnson in 2009, and that Nutrition could be sold, Anderson
said in a note to clients today. </p>
<p>Pfizer had 28 divestitures completed in the last five
years, with an average deal size of $1.8 billion, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The company''s biggest was the $16.6
billion sale of its consumer products business to Johnson 
Johnson (JNJ) in June 2006. </p>
<p>Lipitor Sales </p>
<p>Lipitor had sales of $10.7 billion last year, accounting
for about 16 percent of the company''s revenue, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Pfizer forecasts revenue may fall as much as 6.9
percent in two years as the pipeline of experimental drugs fails
to offset lower sales of Lipitor. </p>
<p>Pfizer acquired the nutrition unit in the 2009 purchase of
Wyeth. It makes the Gold line of products for infants and
children and Enercal supplements for adults. The unit sells food
replacement and supplement products in more than 80 countries,
according to the company''s website. </p>
<p>Overall sales of baby food and milk formula in Asia, Latin
America and Eastern Europe more than doubled from 2005 to 2010,
according to Euromonitor, a London-based research firm. Nestle
SA (NESN) of Vevey, Switzerland, and Paris-based Danone (BN) are the market
leaders for infant formula in those markets, Euromonitor said. </p>
<p>In 2009, Pfizer bought Wyeth to add biologic drugs,
consumer and animal health products, and baby formula. The
company expanded sales in emerging markets such as China, India
and Brazil to 18 percent of the company''s revenue under Jeffrey Kindler, who was CEO from July 2006 until Read replaced him in
December. </p>
<p>Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. (MJN), the baby-formula maker that
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) took public in February 2009, had sales
of $3.14 billion last year, led by Enfamil infant formula. The
Glenview, Illinois-based company has more than doubled since the
initial public offering. </p>
<p>Abbott''s Similac </p>
<p>Abbott Laboratories (ABT), based in Abbott Park, Illinois, had
nutritional sales of $5.53 billion last year. The company sells
Similac baby formula. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s consumer unit, which sells the over-the-counter
brands Advil and Centrum, drew $2.8 billion in 2010 revenue,
making it the fifth-largest over-the-counter health products
business worldwide, Pfizer said in a February regulatory filing.
In addition to Advil and Centrum for pain management and dietary
supplementation, the unit sells the cough syrup Robitussin and
personal-care items including ChapStick and Preparation H. </p>

Securities and Exchange Commission said today in a statement. </p>
<p>The U.S. Justice Department and the SEC for more than four
years have been investigating how banks and financial advisers
fixed the bidding on investments sold to municipalities.
Prosecutors say the conspiracy cost taxpayers by allowing banks
to pay governments below-market rates. JPMorgan''s penalties are
the largest yet to result from the investigation, which also led
to settlements with UBS AG (UBSN) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) </p>
<p>JPMorgan improperly won bids by entering into secret
arrangements with bidding agents to get an illegal last look''
at competitors'' bids, Robert Khuzami, director of the SEC''s
enforcement division, said in a statement. Municipal issuers
and investors didn''t stand a chance against the fraudulent
strategies, he said. </p>
<p>The Justice Department said the investigation is
continuing. </p>
<p>Second Settlement </p>
<p>The settlement marks the second that JPMorgan has reached
arising from its municipal derivatives business, which sold the
investment contracts as well as interest-rate swaps to state and
local governments, before the bank shut it down in 2008. In
November 2009, the bank agreed to a $722 million accord with the
SEC to end an investigation over its sales of derivatives to
Jefferson County, Alabama, where its bankers made undisclosed
payments to friends of county commissioners to win business. </p>
<p>JPMorgan doesn''t tolerate anticompetitive activity or
other violations of law, the bank said in a statement. The
employees concealed their conduct from management, the bank
said. </p>
<p>The firm assisted the government agencies in their
investigations and is pleased to have resolved this matter with
its regulators, the statement said. </p>
<p>The investment contracts at the center of the charges are
purchased by states and cities with proceeds of money raised in
the $2.9 trillion municipal debt market, allowing them to earn a
return until the cash is needed for public works projects. </p>
<p>Competitive Bidding </p>
<p>While competitive bidding is meant to ensure local
governments get market rates on their investments, prosecutors
say bankers and brokers carved up the market among themselves.
The U.S. says that inflated their earnings at the expense of
taxpayers and the Treasury, which taxes investment earnings from
tax-exempt bond proceeds. </p>
<p>The SEC said JPMorgan was involved in rigging the bidding
on 93 transactions in 31 states. </p>
<p>So far, 18 bankers and advisers have faced criminal
charges, nine of whom have pleaded guilty, the Justice
Department said. Among them are James Hertz, a former employee
of JPMorgan. Hertz is among five former JPMorgan bankers who
received letters informing them that they''re targets of the
Justice Department probe, according to employment records filed
with regulators. </p>

<p>The U.S. National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration will propose a rule requiring electric and
hybrid vehicles to sound an alert under certain conditions to
alert pedestrians to their presence. </p>
<p>The rule will require all such vehicles to come equipped
with a pedestrian safety sound system, the agency said in a
notice published on its website today. The regulation will cover
light and low-speed vehicles, motorcycles, buses and heavy-duty
trucks. </p>
<p>Even as we make giant leaps forward with hybrid and
electric vehicles, we must remain laser focused on safety,
NHTSA Administrator David Strickland said in a statement. With
more and more quiet vehicles on the road, we have to consider
their effect on pedestrians. </p>
<p>NHSTA raised concerns about pedestrian safety risks   posed
by hybrid and electric vehicles, which make less noise than
internal-combustion-engine vehicles, when it convened a public
meeting on the matter in June 2008. </p>
<p>The agency, in an October 2009 report, found a higher rate
of pedestrian accidents associated with hybrid vehicles compared
with gasoline-powered vehicles. An April 2010 report found
quieter cars, such as hybrid-electric vehicles with only their
electric motors running, could pose a safety risk to visually
impaired pedestrians. </p>
<p>Rulemaking Process </p>
<p>NHTSA by law must write a standard by July 4, 2012 for an
alert system that doesn''t require action by a driver or
pedestrian to activate it, the notice said. All vehicles of the
same make and model must have the same alert sound, the notice
said. </p>
<p>A final rule must be published by Jan. 4, 2014. Covered
electric and hybrid vehicles will have to comply if they are
manufactured in September of the calendar year that begins three
years after the rule''s final publication. </p>
<p>General Motors Co. (GM)''s Chevy Volt, a plug-in electric
vehicle, has an alert system that''s activated when the driver
pulls the turn-signal handle, according to the NHTSA notice and
GM''s website. Japan issued guidelines in 2010 recommending that
sound alerts be required only on hybrids that can run
exclusively on electric motors, electric vehicles and fuel-cell
vehicles, according to the notice. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, named Wylie Collins to head its client-
solutions group after David Moffitt, who led some of the
businesses, left the firm. </p>
<p>Collins, a vice chairman in Morgan Stanley''s capital
markets unit, will oversee the group in the Americas, according
to an internal memo from capital markets head Raj Dhanda that
was obtained today by Bloomberg News. Mark Lake, a spokesman for
New York-based Morgan Stanley, confirmed the memo''s contents. </p>
<p>The client-solutions group has facilitated sales of
securitized assets, such as State Street Corp.''s divestiture of
$11 billion of mortgage-backed securities last year and private-
equity placements. Morgan Stanley generated $4.3 billion of
revenue from investment banking last year, which accounted for
26 percent of the institutional securities group''s revenue. </p>
<p>Our investment in this business area further develops our
ability to cover institutional clients across asset classes and
better positions us in these growing segments of the capital
markets, Dhanda wrote in the memo. </p>
<p>Collins was hired last year to develop corporate-client
relationships in the capital-markets business after more than
25 years at Merrill Lynch  Co., where he was head of Americas
debt capital markets. </p>
<p>Moffitt, 49, who was hired in November 2009 to lead the
credit-solutions business as Morgan Stanley prepared for a
pickup in securitized debt sales, left the firm, Lake said.
Moffitt previously oversaw structured-product sales in the
fixed-income division at Merrill Lynch. </p>
<p>Collins''s Oversight </p>
<p>Collins will oversee a business that includes the financial
-institutions solutions unit led by Kevin Ryan and Don Callahan,
the liability-management group headed by David Parsons and the
corporate-strategies and pension-solutions unit led by Caitlin Long, according to the memo. The credit-advisory group, headed
by Dotti Lee, and the closed-end funds unit, led by Sue
Portelli, will also report to Collins, according to the memo. </p>
<p>David Barrett, who leads the firm''s private capital markets
business, will also report to Collins, in addition to John Moore
and Paul Donahue, Morgan Stanley''s co-heads of equity capital
markets, according to the memo. The bank is planning to add a
debt private-placement business by September, Dhanda said in the
memo. </p>

<p>Visa Inc. (V), the world''s largest
payment network, said a Federal Reserve cap on debit-card fees
may lead to slower growth in revenue and earnings in 2012
compared with the current year. </p>
<p>Revenue growth for the 2012 fiscal year will be in the
high single-digit to low double-digits range, the San
Francisco-based company said yesterday in a filing. That''s down
from a projection of 11 percent to 15 percent for the 2011
fiscal year. </p>
<p>We expect that fiscal 2012 will bear the weight of the
regulations financially and in fiscal 2013 revenue growth will
regain momentum, Visa Chief Executive Officer Joseph Saunders
said yesterday on a conference call. The 2012 forecasts are
based on the changing business landscape including the
assumption that some portion of transactions may be routed
away to competitors, he said. </p>
<p>Investors have been concerned the cap on debit-card
transaction fees, mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, would crimp
Visa''s profits. The central bank last week capped debit-card
swipe fees, also called interchange, at 21 cents a transaction,
increasing the limit from an earlier proposal of 12 cents. The
system replaces a formula based on a percentage of the purchase
price that averaged 44 cents. </p>
<p>Visa and its rival MasterCard Inc. (MA) set interchange fees
that are paid by merchants and pass the money to card issuers
like Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) Shares of the
two card networks fell more than 10 percent on Dec. 16, when the
Fed''s cap was first proposed. Visa climbed 15 percent on June 29
when the Fed increased the cap. </p>
<p>Visa rose $1.81, or 2.1 percent, to $90.01 at 9:53 a.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares advanced
25 percent this year through yesterday. </p>
<p>An Improvement </p>
<p>On balance, the rules are an improvement from the initial
draft proposed in December 2010, Saunders said. </p>
<p>Diluted Class A common stock earnings-per-share growth in
the next fiscal year may be in the middle-to-high teens, less
than the 2011 per-share growth forecast of greater than 20
percent, the filing shows. </p>
<p>Visa projects client incentives, intended to generate
transaction volume on its network, will be at the high end of
the projected range of 16 percent to 16.5 percent of gross
revenue this year, Saunders said on the call. </p>
<p>The company also completed a $1 billion stock buyback
program, purchasing 13 million shares at an average price of
$77, according to the filing. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Bank of America
Corp. and three other U.S. mortgage servicers are in advanced
talks to resolve state and federal claims over faulty
foreclosures, according to two people briefed on the matter. </p>
<p>Negotiators tentatively set a July 13 target for a
settlement, which may exceed $20 billion, the people said,
speaking on the condition of anonymity because the talks are
private. Some banks are briefing their boards on deal terms,
which would form state and federal funds to resolve claims and
provide relief to borrowers, they said. The target date may be
postponed as parties iron out details. </p>
<p>Attorneys general and federal officials are negotiating
with the group of lenders -- also including Citigroup Inc. (C),
Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) and Ally Financial Inc. -- to resolve probes
into how banks treated borrowers during a surge in mortgage
defaults. A final agreement, setting standards for servicing
loans and processing foreclosures, may serve as a template for
claims against the rest of the industry. </p>
<p>The July 13 target corresponds with a separate deadline the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency set for banks to
submit an action plan for fixing deficiencies and
compensating people whose homes were improperly seized. If talks
aren''t done by then, the OCC may push back its date, the people
said. </p>
<p>We are trying to integrate our settlement with the OCC
action plan, said Geoff Greenwood, spokesman for Iowa Attorney
General Tom Miller, without commenting on the July 13 date.
The action plan does not involve us, but we''re trying to work
together. </p>
<p>Miller is leading the negotiations on the states'' behalf. </p>
<p>The proposed accord would require banks to set up a fund
for states to resolve civil mortgage complaints as well as a
separate federal account that would require them to provide a
specified amount of mortgage relief to borrowers, two people
said. Banks could get credit toward their relief obligation if
they write down principal and modify loans in their portfolio,
one of the people said. The exact mechanism to determine and
award credits is still being discussed, the person said. </p>
<p>Spokesmen for Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of
America, San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, Detroit-based Ally and
New York-based Citigroup and JPMorgan said they couldn''t
comment. A spokesman for the OCC didn''t immediately return phone
calls seeking comment yesterday. </p>
<p>Attorneys general from all 50 states announced an
investigation last year following claims of faulty foreclosure
practices by banks. At a May 24 meeting, state legal officers
told the banks they will face an estimated $17 billion in claims
if the inquiries result in civil lawsuits. </p>
<h2>New Suits </h2>
<h2>Morgan Stanley Sued by Allstate on Mortgage Fraud Claims </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) was sued for fraud by Allstate (ALL) Insurance Co.
over residential mortgage-backed securities in which the insurer
invested, according to a complaint filed in New York. </p>
<p>Allstate purchased more than $104 million in Morgan Stanley
residential mortgage-backed securities in six offerings between
2005 and 2007, based on registration statements, prospectuses
and other documents, as well as the central role that Morgan
Stanley played in creating and selling the securities, it said
in the suit filed July 5 in New York state Supreme Court. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley told Allstate it had conducted due diligence
on the companies that originated the mortgages before turning
them into securities, and assured the Northbrook, Illinois-based
insurer that the loans conformed with conservative
underwriting standards and that the appraisals of the mortgage
properties were accurate, the lawsuit says. </p>
<p>As Allstate and the world would only later discover, the
originators whose loans collateralized the Morgan Stanley RMBS
purchased by Allstate were among the worst of the worst culprits
in the subprime lending industry, Allstate said in the suit.
Morgan Stanley knew or recklessly disregarded that those
lenders were issuing high-risk loans that did not conform to
their respective underwriting standards. </p>
<p>Mary Claire Delaney, a spokeswoman for New York-based
Morgan Stanley, declined to comment in a telephone interview. </p>
<h2>Standard Chartered Sued in Singapore Over Investment Products </h2>
<p>Standard Chartered Bank Plc (STAN) was sued by Thai businessman
Chatchai Yenbamroong in Singapore for $2 million, claiming the
bank gave him negligent and fraudulent investment information. </p>
<p>Yenbamroong invested the money in a U.S. dollar callable
note which the London-based bank had falsely misrepresented as a
principal-protected conservative investment, the Thai
businessman said in his lawsuit filed with the Singapore High
Court on June 29. The case is scheduled to have its first closed
hearing on Aug. 10. </p>
<p>The businessman was induced by his Standard Chartered
banker to sign a blank account opening form, according to the
claim. The bank didn''t provide him with terms and conditions or
ask him for an investor profile before he opened the account in
2009, said Yenbamroong. </p>
<p>Standard Chartered, which hasn''t filed its defense, denied
liability on June 10 through its lawyers at Allen  Gledhill LLP
according to the lawsuit. Ally Lim, a Singapore-based
spokeswoman at Standard Chartered, declined to comment as did
Niru Pillai, the lawyer acting for Yenbamroong. </p>
<p>The case is Chatchai Yenbamroong v. Standard Chartered Bank
S456/2011 in the Singapore High Court. </p>

<h2>Lawsuits/Pretrial </h2>
<h2>Lehman Borrowed $18 Billion From Undisclosed Fed Program </h2>
<p>Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.''s brokerage borrowed as much
as $18 billion in four separate loans from a previously secret
program of the U.S. Federal Reserve in June 2008, three months
before its parent filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history. </p>
<p>The program, which peaked at $80 billion in loans
outstanding, was known as the Fed''s single-tranche open-market
operations, or ST OMO. It made 28-day loans to units of 19 banks
between March 7, 2008, and Dec. 30, 2008. Bloomberg reported on
ST OMO in May, after the Fed released incomplete records on the
program. In response to a subsequent Freedom of Information Act
request for details, the central bank disclosed borrower names,
amounts borrowed and interest rates. </p>
<p>The Lehman brokerage, Lehman Brothers Inc., tapped the ST
OMO program for as much as $5 billion in short term funding in
March 2008, and lower amounts at other times during the month.
It took as much as $10 billion in June as the credit crisis
worsened, according to Fed data. The maximum outstanding for any
period was $18 billion. </p>
<p>The brokerage agreed on Sept. 18, 2008, to pay outstanding
loans that day, the Fed said. It went into liquidation on Sept.
19, four days after its parent. </p>
<p>Separately, the Lehman parent then run by Chief Executive
Officer Richard Fuld had a $45 billion loan from the Fed''s so-called Primary Dealer Credit Facility around the time of its
bankruptcy. An August 2009 article in a Federal Reserve Bank of
New York publication said the Fed''s facility was expanded on
Sept. 14, 2008, in response to reports that Lehman was only
days away from bankruptcy, and might put other firms at risk. </p>
<p>The day before Lehman filed for bankruptcy, almost all of
its $41 billion cash pool was tied up at bank lenders including
JPMorgan Chase  Co., Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. (BAC),
according to a bankruptcy examiner''s report. </p>
<p>Expanding its facility to lend to Lehman, the Fed took
previously unacceptable collateral for its loans, including non-investment grade securities and equities, according to the
article, The Federal Reserve''s Primary Dealer Credit
Facility. </p>
<p>Concerned about the safety of the loan, the Fed told
Barclays Plc (BARC) to take over the loan when it bought the defunct
investment bank''s North American business, according to court
testimony. Barclays closed its purchase of Lehman''s business a
week after Lehman''s Sept. 15, 2008, bankruptcy. </p>
<p>Separately, the U.K. bank''s Barclays Capital Inc. unit had
peak loans from the ST OMO program of $21.4 billion, Fed data
shows. </p>
<p>Kimberly Macleod, a Lehman spokeswoman, didn''t immediately
respond to e-mails seeking comment. Michael O''Looney, a Barclays
spokesman, declined to comment. </p>
<p>The Lehman bankruptcy main case is In re Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc., 08-13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<h2>BofA Must Face Mortgage Modification Claims, Judge Rules </h2>
<p>Bank of America Corp. must face claims from homeowners who
accuse the biggest U.S. bank of failing to honor agreements for
modifying their mortgage loans, a federal judge ruled. </p>
<p>Homeowners who say they met requirements for permanent
modifications under contracts with the bank can proceed with
their cases, according a decision filed yesterday by U.S.
District Judge Rya Zobel in Boston. Zobel dismissed some claims
against the bank. </p>
<p>The complaint meticulously details each plaintiff''s
initial and ongoing compliance with all conditions, Zobel
wrote. </p>
<p>The complaint consolidates 26 cases originating in 19
states that were transferred to federal court in Boston,
according to Zobel''s decision. The homeowners sought loan
modifications from Bank of America under the federal
government''s Home Affordable Modification Program, which is
aimed to lower payments for borrowers and help them avoid
foreclosure. </p>
<p>BOA''s general practice and culture is to string
homeowners along with no intention of providing actual and
permanent modifications, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>Bank of America sought to dismiss the complaint. Shirley
Norton, a bank spokeswoman, said in an e-mail that the bank is
pleased that four of eight counts in the complaints were
dismissed. </p>
<p>The decision will give hundreds of thousands of families
a second chance at permanently lower mortgage payments, Gary
Klein, a lawyer for the homeowners, said in an interview. </p>
<p>The case is In re Bank of America Home Affordable
Modification Program (HAMP) Contract Litigation, 10-md-02193,
U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts (Boston). </p>

<h2>TCW Must Face Gundlach''s Breach of Contract Claims at Trial </h2>
<p>TCW Group Inc. must face claims at trial by its former
investment chief Jeffrey Gundlach, who said he was fired in 2009
so the company wouldn''t have pay him as much as $1.25 billion in
management and performance fees. </p>
<p>Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Carl West yesterday
denied TCW''s bid to bar Gundlach from pursuing breach-of-contract claims because he wasn''t under contract at the time he
was fired. The judge ruled that a jury should decide whether TCW
and Gundlach made an oral agreement in 2007. </p>
<p>There is conflicting evidence in the record which at
least raises a reasonable inference that the parties expressly
agreed to begin performing under the new deal despite the lack
of a signed agreement, West said in his ruling. </p>
<p>Gundlach''s claims were filed in a countersuit against TCW
that contended he was dismissed so the company wouldn''t have to
pay $600 million to $1.25 billion in future management and
performance fees from the funds his group managed. </p>
<p>About a month earlier, in January 2010, TCW, the Los
Angeles-based unit of Societe Generale SA, sued Gundlach and
three other ex-employees after more than half of its fixed-income professionals joined Gundlach''s new firm, DoubleLine
Capital Inc. TCW is seeking more than $200 million in damages,
claiming Gundlach stole its trade secrets as he plotted to start
his own business. </p>
<p>The case is scheduled to go to trial on July 25. </p>
<p>The case is Trust Co. of the West v. Jeffrey Gundlach,
BC429385, Los Angeles County Superior Court. </p>

<h2>Gribkowsky Detention Deadline Expires in August </h2>
<p>Prosecutors have until mid-August before they need to ask a
court to extend the pretrial detention of former Bayerische
Landesbank risk manager Gerhard Gribkowsky, a spokeswoman for
investigators said. </p>
<p>Gribkowsky has been held since his arrest on Jan. 5 over
allegations he may have received a $50 million kickback for
engineering the sale of BayernLB''s stake in Formula One racing.
While under German law a suspect can only be held for six months
unless found guilty at trial, a court can authorize longer
detention if it deems it necessary and not disproportionate. </p>
<p>In Gribkowsky''s case, the deadline will only elapse in
mid-August because after finding new facts after his initial
arrest, we were able to get a second arrest warrant for
additional allegations, Barbara Stockinger, the Munich
prosecutors'' spokeswoman, said in an interview yesterday. The
deadline thus started anew and only elapses next month. </p>
<p>Prosecutors will decide by then whether to ask the court to
keep Gribkowsky, she said. The probe against him hasn''t been
completed she said, declining to say when charges may be
brought. If the court doesn''t grant the request, Gribkowsky must
be freed, though the probe can continue. </p>
<p>Gribkowsky''s attorney Reinhard Hoess didn''t immediately
return a call seeking comment. </p>
<p>Formula One Management Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Bernie
Ecclestone is also a suspect of the investigation and being
probed over allegations he aided Gribkowsky. He was questioned
by Munich prosecutors in April. Prosecutors are looking into
whether Gribkowsky took the kickback for engineering the sale of
Formula One to CVC Capital Partners Ltd. </p>
<p>Ecclestone has denied the allegations. His German attorney,
Sven Thomas, didn''t immediately return a call seeking comment. </p>

<h2>Legal Reviews </h2>
<h2>ABB, Nexans, Prysmian Get EU Complaints in Power-Cable Case </h2>
<p>ABB Ltd. (ABBN), Nexans SA (NEX), Prysmian SpA (PRY) and as many as nine other
power-cable manufacturers received European Union antitrust
complaints over allegations of price-fixing for undersea and
underground high-voltage power cables. </p>
<p>The European Commission sent complaints to 12 companies
that may have colluded to allocate markets and customers for
underground and submarine power cable projects and fix prices,
it said in a statement yesterday. </p>
<p>The price of such cables is therefore directly relevant
for electricity consumers, the regulator said, without
identifying what companies were involved. Sumitomo Electric
Industries Ltd., Hitachi Cable Ltd. and General Cable Corp. (BGC) said
they also received EU complaints. </p>
<p>Prysmian outbid Paris-based Nexans last year to buy Dutch
rival Draka Holding NV, creating the world''s biggest cable maker
in an effort to restore margins and counter competition from
South Korea. (001440) Nexans said in December that EU antitrust scrutiny
put European manufacturers at a disadvantage to rivals in Asia
or the Middle East, where sanctions are rare or don''t exist. </p>
<p>Regulators can fine companies as much as 10 percent of
yearly sales for colluding with rivals to fix prices. Companies
may defend themselves in writing or at an oral hearing before
the EU decides on possible fines. </p>
<p>ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd., based in Zurich, Switzerland
and the world''s biggest maker of power-transmission gear, said
it received a statement of objections from the commission and
had a zero tolerance policy with respect to illegal or
unethical behavior. </p>
<p>Prysmian, based in Milan, Italy, said July 5 that it
received an antitrust complaint and would defend itself. Nexans
said it would respond to regulators in the second half of 2011
after an analysis of the numerous complex elements. </p>
<p>NKT Holding A/S (NKT), based in Broendby, Denmark, said yesterday
that the company and its units also received a complaint and
they would review the EU''s complaint and defend themselves in
this matter. </p>
<p>General Cable Corp., based in Highland Heights, Kentucky,
said the EU statement alleged that two of its units engaged in
violations of competition law for a limited period of time.
The company said it would defend itself against the allegations. </p>
<p>General Cable only recently entered the submarine power
cables business in March 2009 through its subsidiary in Germany,
Norddeutsche Seekabelwerke GmbH  Co, which was acquired in
2007, the company said in a statement. </p>
<h2>Verdicts/Settlement </h2>
<h2>BofA Settlement Raises Serious Questions,'' Public Funds Say </h2>
<p>A group of public pension funds has serious questions
about the fairness of Bank of America Corp.''s proposed $8.5
billion mortgage-bond settlement, saying it could give some
investors a windfall. </p>
<p>The public funds who asked to intervene in the case are the
Policemen''s Annuity  Benefit Fund of Chicago, the Westmoreland
County Employee Retirement System, City of Grand Rapids General
Retirement System, and City of Grand Rapids Police and Fire
Retirement System. They didn''t state the size of their
investments in Countrywide mortgage-backed securities. </p>
<p>Public pension funds purchased billions of dollars of
Countrywide mortgage backed securities, David Scott, a lawyer
for the funds, said yesterday in a statement. They need to be
given a seat at the table to make sure that the settlement is
fair, reasonable and in the best interests of the entire class
of investors. </p>
<p>Bank of America said June 29 that it had agreed to pay $8.5
billion to resolve claims by a group of 22 investors, including
BlackRock Inc. (BLK), which wanted the bank to buy back delinquent
home loans packaged into bonds by Countrywide Financial Corp.,
which Bank of America acquired in 2008. </p>
<p>The public pension funds said in a filing yesterday in New
York state court, where the agreement has been submitted for a
judge''s approval, that their interests may not be directly
aligned with those of the 22 corporate and hedge-fund
investors that negotiated the settlement. </p>
<p>Kathy Patrick, a lawyer for the 22 investors, and
representatives of Bank of New York Mellon Corp., the trustee
for the bonds that asked the New York court to approve the
settlement, didn''t return calls seeking comment after regular
business hours. </p>
<p>Shirley Norton, a Bank of America spokeswoman, didn''t
return a call seeking comment after regular business hours. </p>
<p>The case is In the matter of the application of The Bank of
New York Mellon, 651786/2011, New York state Supreme Court, New

<h2>Argentina Loses Debt Immunity Suit in U.K. Supreme Court </h2>
<p>Argentina''s state immunity can''t prevent an offshore trader
in distressed sovereign debt from using British courts to
enforce claims over the country''s 2001 default, the U.K. Supreme
Court ruled. </p>
<p>The decision in London yesterday, which reverses a lower
court ruling from last year, permits an affiliate of New York-based hedge fund Elliott Associates LP to seize Argentina''s
assets in Britain using a $284 million U.S. court judgment it
has against the South American nation. Argentina had argued U.K.
courts didn''t have jurisdiction on the issue. </p>
<p>It''s probably a good day for investors in sovereign
debt, Philippa Charles, a lawyer with Mayer Brown in London,
said in an interview. To make the bonds attractive, Argentina
had to waive some sovereign immunity rights and this case was
about the extent to which they''d done so. </p>
<p>Four years after Argentina''s $95 billion default, then-President Nestor Kirchner offered bondholders 30 cents on the
dollar for their debt -- a deal rejected by holders of about $20
billion of the bonds, including Cayman Islands-based NML Capital
Ltd., the Elliott affiliate in the U.K. case. </p>
<p>Kirchner''s wife and successor, President Cristina Fernandez
de Kirchner, last year held a second restructuring, exchanging
$12.9 billion of the debt that wasn''t swapped in the 2005
negotiation, bringing the total amount cleared to more than 92
percent of bonds outstanding. </p>
<p>Yesterday''s ruling could have implications for buyers of
European sovereign debt, since countries in Europe likely hold
significant assets in the U.K., Charles said. </p>
<p>The U.K. court has rejected another of Argentina''s
desperate legal strategies contrived to avoid repaying holders
of its defaulted bonds, Scott Tagliarino, a spokesman for NML,
said yesterday in a statement. </p>
<p>A spokesman for Argentina''s Economy Ministry didn''t
immediately respond to a call and a text message sent to his
mobile phone. </p>
<p>The judgment comes a day after a federal appeals court in
New York ruled against NML and another bondholder in their bid
to seize $105 million of Argentine central bank assets held at
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. </p>
<p>The U.K. case is NML Capital v. Argentina, U.K. Supreme
Court, (2011) UKSC 31. </p>

<h2>Antitrust Chief Said to Leave Justice Department for Cravath </h2>
<p>The top antitrust official at the U.S. Justice Department,
Christine Varney, will leave her post next month for Cravath,
Swaine  Moore LLP, a person familiar with the matter said. </p>
<p>Varney, 55, who has made her career in private practice and
government in Washington, will work at the law firm''s New York
headquarters, the person said. </p>
<p>I''ve let the attorney general know I will leave August 5
to return to private life and private practice, Varney said in
a telephone interview yesterday, declining to comment on which
firm she will join. </p>
<p>She said she plans some time off before taking her next
position. </p>
<p>Varney, appointed by President Barack Obama in January
2009, vowed to step up antitrust enforcement as she came into
the office in April of that year. One of her first moves was to
retract Bush administration guidelines on monopolization
policies, saying they raised too many hurdles to curbing
anticompetitive practices. </p>
<p>It''s been two and a half years, we''ve built a fantastic
team and we have fulfilled President Obama''s commitment to
reinvigorating the antitrust laws, said Varney, a commissioner
at the Federal Trade Commission from 1994 to 1997, appointed by
President Bill Clinton. It''s time to move on. </p>
<p>Her replacement will selected by Attorney General Eric
Holder and Obama, Varney said. </p>
<p>Cravath has worked on some of the biggest antitrust cases,
including the defense of International Business Machines Corp.
against a government antitrust lawsuit filed in 1969. </p>

<h2>Kremlin Probe Says Hermitage Lawyer Beaten to Death in Jail </h2>
<p>President Dmitry Medvedev''s human rights council said
Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer for Hermitage Capital Management Ltd.
who died in a Moscow prison in 2009, was probably beaten to
death. </p>
<p>Law enforcement agencies should probe the role of Russian
officials who denied Magnitsky medical care while he was in pre-trial detention for almost a year, the council said in a report
posted yesterday on its website. The lawyer had accused Interior
Ministry officials of abuse to force him to drop allegations
that they committed a $230 million tax fraud, it said. </p>
<p>The Investigative Committee hasn''t given proper attention
to investigating the officials'' guilt, according to the
report. The council, set up by Medvedev in February to examine
human-rights violations, also says the lawyer was illegally
denied bail. </p>
<p>Medvedev said in May that all guilty parties in Magnitsky''s
tragic death should be punished. The president has made
fighting corruption and improving the rule of law key objectives
as he seeks to attract foreign investors. London-based Hermitage
founder William Browder accuses the Russian authorities of a
whitewash over Magnitsky''s death. </p>
<p>Russia put Browder on its international wanted list in
2009, seeking to question him on suspicion of conspiring with
Magnitsky to evade 500 million rubles ($18 million) of taxes. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan
Stanley kept their bullish view on oil and copper, predicting a
global recovery in the second half that will push up prices. </p>
<p>Both banks maintained their Brent-crude forecasts even
after a 4.2 percent decline in the second quarter. The world
economy will accelerate in the second half, boosting demand and
helping raw materials with supply constraints, Goldman analysts
led by London-based Jeffrey Currie said in a report dated today. </p>
<p>Commodity prices tracked by the Standard  Poor''s GSCI
Index of 24 raw materials lost 7.8 percent in the second
quarter, the worst performance since 2008, as a record
earthquake hit Japan, the U.S. expansion slowed and China
tightened monetary policy. Commodity assets under management
dropped $26 billion in May, the most since October 2008,
according to Barclays Capital. </p>
<p>Prices and returns will rise further later this year and
into 2012, the Goldman analysts said. The SP GSCI Enhanced
Index will return 20 percent in the next 12 months, they said. </p>
<p>Europe''s sovereign-debt problems as well as China''s above-
target inflation will continue to create near-term volatility,
Goldman said. China, the world''s top consumer of energy, metals
and grains, raised its benchmark interest rates by 25 basis
points yesterday, the third time this year after inflation
accelerated to the fastest pace since July 2008. </p>
<p>The U.S. economy will expand between 2.7 percent to 2.9
percent this year, down from forecasts ranging from 3.1 percent
to 3.3 percent in April, the Federal Reserve said last month. </p>
<p>Brent Crude </p>
<p>Goldman predicted Brent crude will advance to $130 a barrel
in a year''s time, while Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts led by New York-
based Hussein Allidina said it will average $120 this year,
increasing to $130 in 2012. </p>
<p>Brent crude oil advanced 0.8 percent to $114.51 a barrel as
of 10:43 a.m. London time today. </p>
<p>Oil prices will be pressured in coming weeks after a
release of strategic oil stockpiles by member countries of the
International Energy Agency and will rise later in the year as
inventories shrink, Morgan Stanley said. </p>
<p>We remain bullish oil, particularly in the second half,
and expect inventory draws will prompt OPEC to increase
production, at the expense of spare capacity, Allidina said in
the report dated yesterday. </p>
<p>Copper will benefit from Chinese demand as the world''s
largest buyer has started restocking, Allidina said. The metal
will increase to $11,000 a metric ton in 12 months, Goldman
said, also citing increased purchases from China. </p>
<p>Buy Corn, Soybeans </p>
<p>Investors should buy corn and soybeans, Morgan Stanley
said, after prices tumbled 17 percent and 6 percent last month.
We view the recent weakness in agriculture prices as a buying
opportunity, the analysts said. </p>
<p>Not every firm is as bullish on commodities. There could be
a bull trap, said Edward Meir, senior commodity analyst at
MF Global Holdings in Darien, Connecticut. </p>
<p>Europe''s debt crisis has not yet ended because other
nations apart from Greece such as Portugal, Italy and Spain have
similar problems, he said. U.S. unemployment, higher interest
rates in the euro zone and China are among factors that do not
make the case for being long commodities that compelling, Meir
said in a report received today. </p>
<p>The European Central Bank will raise interest rates for a
second time this year, increasing the benchmark by 25 basis
points to 1.5 percent, when council members meet in Frankfurt
today, according to all 55 economist forecasts in a Bloomberg
News survey. The central bank may increase borrowing costs
further in the fourth quarter, according to a separate survey. </p>
<p>Goldman said there is upside to natural gas prices at
the U.K. National Balancing Point because of a tightening
shift in the global market for liquefied natural gas after the
shutdown of some nuclear plants in Japan and the loss of Libyan
oil and gas exports. </p>

<p>In the audience, couples sip house cabernet and applaud
politely. Some drop $10 tips into a metal bucket. </p>
<p>About 40 blocks uptown in a 42-story skyscraper overlooking

<p>Proposed Dodd-Frank swaps regulations
imposing margin requirements to reduce trading risks will
damage the competitiveness of foreign-based businesses of
U.S. banks compared with their overseas rivals, lawyers for six
banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
and Morgan Stanley told regulators. </p>
<p>Applying margin requirements to transactions outside the
U.S. will inevitably encourage customers to do business
instead with non-U.S. competitors, lawyers representing the
banks said in a letter dated June 29 and sent to the Federal
Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., Commodity Futures
Trading Commission and other regulators. </p>
<p>The letter, signed by lawyers at Sullivan  Cromwell LLP,
was sent also on behalf of Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Citigroup Inc. (C)
and Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) </p>
<p>The six banks endorsing the letter executed 97 percent of
the $321 trillion of over-the-counter derivatives traded by the
top 25 U.S. bank-holding companies as of March 31, according to
a June 17 report from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency. </p>
<p>Dodd-Frank, the financial-overhaul enacted last July, seeks
to reduce risk and boost transparency in the $601 trillion over-
the-counter swaps market after largely unregulated trades helped
fuel the 2008 credit crisis. The law requires bank regulators to
adopt capital and margin requirements for trades not guaranteed
by clearinghouses that stand between buyers and sellers. </p>
<p>$2 Trillion </p>
<p>The June 29 letter was sent in response to an April
proposal from banking regulators that would govern how swap
dealers collect margin for non-cleared trades. The proposed rule
may require U.S. banks to set aside $2 trillion in collateral
that could be used in more profitable ways, according to an OCC
study dated April 15. Public comments to the April proposal are
due by July 11. </p>
<p>In the proposal, the banking regulators said foreign swaps
pose no lesser risk to a U.S. company because of their
location. The regulators were concerned that an exemption would
allow banks to design swaps to evade the law. </p>
<p>We believe that the blanket application of the margin
requirements to all transactions by non-U.S. operations because
of the possibility that derivatives activity may move offshore
exceeds the extraterritorial scope and intent of the statute,
the lawyers wrote in the June 29 letter. </p>
<p>Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, Jerry Dubrowski, a Bank of America spokesman, Mark Lake, a Morgan
Stanley (MS) spokesman, Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a Citigroup
spokeswoman, Elise Wilkinson, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, and
Howard Opinsky, a JPMorgan spokesman, all declined to comment. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE)''s plans to shed two
businesses boosts the potential payoff for three experimental
drugs moving toward regulatory review later this year. </p>
<p>Pfizer, the world''s biggest drugmaker, yesterday said it
plans to sell or spin off its animal health and baby food
divisions. The units may command a price of $22 billion, said
Seamus Fernandez, an analyst at Leerink Swann  Co. in Boston.
Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read has said he plans to use
the proceeds to buy back shares and develop new drugs. </p>
<p>Read is giving new products led by the apixaban blood
thinner, the lung cancer drug crizotinib and tofacitinib for
rheumatoid arthritis added prominence within Pfizer''s revenue
portfolio. Divesting the units -- which generate $5.5 billion in
annual sales, or 8 percent of the New York-based company''s
revenue -- also lets Pfizer sharpen its focus on developing the
three drugs, which analysts surveyed by Bloomberg estimate may
reach $3 billion in annual sales by 2015. </p>
<p>In the next 3 to 6 months, there''s going to be a lot of
pipeline news, and as Pfizer gets smaller the pipeline becomes
more important, said David Maris, an analyst with CLSA in New
York. This is a management team that is following through on
what they said they would do, which is take a fresh look at the
business and decide what is important and what is not. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) must face claims it
aided and abetted murder, torture and sexual assault by its
security forces in Indonesia''s Aceh province, a federal appeals
court ruled, reinstating a lawsuit thrown out by a lower court. </p>
<p>In a 2-1 decision today, the U.S. Court of Appeals in
Washington said Exxon Mobil didn''t have corporate immunity from
claims filed by 15 Indonesian villagers under the Alien Tort
Statute. The court reversed the ruling of a trial judge who said
the villagers couldn''t use U.S. courts to sue over alleged
actions that took place in Indonesia and involved the Indonesian
military during a period of martial law. </p>
<p>It would create a bizarre anomaly to immunize
corporations from liability for the conduct of their agents in
lawsuits brought for shockingly egregious violations of
universally recognized principles of international law,'' Judge
Judith Rogers wrote in her 112-page opinion. </p>
<p>An Exxon Mobil spokesman, Patrick McGinn, said the company
has fought these baseless claims for many years and is
reviewing the decision. </p>
<p>In two lawsuits consolidated for appeal, Indonesian
villagers claimed Exxon Mobil was responsible for the abuses
because they were committed by an Indonesian military unit
dedicated only to Exxon''s Aceh facility and under the company''s
direction and control. Exxon provided material support to the
unit by hiring mercenaries for training, advice and
intelligence, the villagers alleged. The human rights abuses
began in the early 1990s, according to one of the complaints. </p>
<p>Human Rights Violations </p>
<p>Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, was aware that the army had
committed human rights violations in the past, they claimed. </p>
<p>In 2009, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth in Washington
ruled the Indonesian villagers didn''t have the right to sue
Exxon in a U.S. court because they are non-resident aliens. He
dismissed the lawsuits, filed in 2001 and 2007 against the oil
company. </p>
<p>We''re really looking forward to going to trial and that
is what we hope happens, said Agnieszka Fryszman, a lawyer for
the plaintiffs. </p>

<p>Stifel Financial Corp. (SF), the St.
Louis-based brokerage that has quintupled revenue since 2005
with nine acquisitions, may find its biggest takeover
opportunity yet in Regions Financial Corp. (RF)''s Morgan Keegan  Co. </p>
<p>Morgan Keegan may be attractive to Stifel for its retail
brokerage, fixed-income business and presence in the U.S.
Southeast, according to Silvant Capital Management LLC and FBR
Capital Markets. Silvant''s Randy Loving said Stifel may be
willing to pay as much as $1 billion, or six times more than its
largest deal, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Guggenheim Securities LLC estimates Morgan Keegan may fetch as
much as $1.5 billion, for Birmingham, Alabama-based Regions,
which said last month it was considering strategic
alternatives for the unit after paying $200 million to settle
claims over subprime mortgage-backed securities. </p>
<p>Stifel''s acquisitions, including Legg Mason Inc.''s capital-
markets business and Thomas Weisel Partners Group Inc., have
helped the brokerage post record net revenue in every year since
Ron Kruszewski became chief executive officer in 1997. While the
shares have also more than doubled since 2006, Stifel''s
operating margins trail 90 percent of its rivals. </p>
<p>Morgan Keegan seems to fit the Stifel model, said Steve Stelmach, an analyst at FBR Capital in Arlington, Virginia.
Ron is an aggressive guy and isn''t bashful about growth
through acquisitions. From that perspective, continued
acquisitions seem to make sense. </p>
<p>Stifel''s Kruszewski declined to comment on Morgan Keegan.
Tim Deighton, a spokesman for Regions, also declined to comment. </p>
<p>Evaluating Options </p>
<p>Shares of Stifel slipped 0.7 percent to $36.53 at 10:35
a.m. in New York today. Regions declined 2.3 percent to $6.03. </p>
<p>Regions hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to evaluate options
for Memphis, Tennessee-based Morgan Keegan and find ways to
manage capital and increase shareholder value, the bank said
June 22. Morgan Asset Management and Regions Morgan Keegan Trust
are not part of the review. </p>
<p>Regions agreed to buy Morgan Keegan in December 2000 for
about $789 million. </p>
<p>Morgan Keegan resolved claims brought last year by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority and state regulators, the SEC said.
Regulators said the firm misled clients about asset values and
risks of bond funds that caused investor losses during the
mortgage crisis. The company didn''t admit or deny wrongdoing. </p>
<p>Regions needs to repay the $3.5 billion in government
bailout funds it still holds. </p>
<p>Raise Capital'' </p>
<p>Regions is trying to raise capital, said Walter Todd,
who helps manage $950 million at Greenwood Capital in Greenwood,
South Carolina. They can raise capital without having to issue
stock by selling this asset. That''s one of the reasons they are
putting the company up for sale. </p>
<p>Morgan Keegan provides brokerage and investment-banking
services. Founded with five workers in 1969, it now has more
than 300 offices and 4,400 employees across the Southeast and
Midwest, including Texas, Missouri, Ohio, the Carolinas and
Florida. Stifel''s operations are concentrated in the Midwest and
Mid-Atlantic regions. </p>
<p>The Southeast is a desirable part of the country in terms
of growth, Greenwood''s Todd said. Morgan Keegan has a very
good footprint there and Stifel less so. It would give them a
very good jumpstart in the Southeast. </p>
<p>Generally Beneficial'' </p>
<p>Stifel could also increase its retail brokerage''s more than
1,900 financial advisers, as of March 31, by adding Morgan
Keegan''s 1,200 advisers. </p>
<p>Retail brokerage is a scale business, FBR''s Stelmach
said. The more scale you have, you can spread out fixed costs
across a much broader network. That''s generally beneficial. </p>
<p>That may help boost Stifel''s operating margins, which at
0.75 percent in the last 12 months were the second lowest among
comparable U.S. investment banks and brokerages with market
values greater than $1 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
The industry average is 13 percent. </p>
<p>Stifel''s margin was dragged down by a third-quarter loss.
In 2009 the company posted an operating margin of 11 percent. </p>
<p>By acquiring Morgan Keegan''s fixed-income platform, Stifel
would add to its geographic footprint for businesses such as
public finance, Stelmach said. </p>
<p>You need to have someone local in Cleveland that knows
the school board or knows the water and sewer guys, he said.
To the extent that you can get that local capacity in one
acquisition would probably be attractive. </p>
<p>Takeover Price </p>
<p>Marty Mosby, an analyst for Guggenheim Securities in
Memphis, Tennessee, said Morgan Keegan may sell for between 0.75
to 1.5 times his estimated revenue for the unit of about $1
billion. That would peg an acquisition anywhere from $750
million to $1.5 billion. </p>
<p>If they were able to get it for less than $1 billion, I
think that would be something of interest to them, said
Loving, an Atlanta-based portfolio manager for Silvant, which
owns Stifel shares. At a decent enough price, they''ll have
additional flexibility to make it work. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) may also be interested in buying Morgan
Keegan, according to Brian Foran, an analyst at Nomura Holdings
Inc. in New York. Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf said in March the
bank may expand by taking over non-bank companies, including
wealth-management or insurance businesses. </p>
<p>Bigger Question'' </p>
<p>The bigger question for Wells is do they feel like they
need to add scale in the wealth-management business or do they
feel like it''s not a strategic imperative right now, Foran
said. I''d be really surprised if they didn''t look. </p>
<p>Allison Miley, a spokeswoman for San Francisco-based Wells
Fargo, said the lender doesn''t comment on speculation regarding
acquisitions. </p>
<p>BBT Corp. (BBT), which expanded its brokerage business with the
acquisition of Scott  Stringfellow in 1999, may also look at
Morgan Keegan to add to its brokerage platform, Guggenheim
Securities'' Mosby said. </p>
<p>Cynthia Williams, a spokeswoman for BBT of Winston-Salem,
North Carolina, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Morgan Keegan''s retail brokerage would also be attractive
to private equity firms looking for cash-generating businesses,
Nomura''s Foran said. </p>
<p>Stifel, which has one of the largest U.S. equity research
platforms, may not benefit from Morgan Keegan''s institutional
business, FBR''s Stelmach and Silvant''s Loving said. </p>
<p>Wiggle Room'' </p>
<p>Also, Morgan Keegan has had a material decline in
fixed-income profitability and brokerage earnings estimates,
which may make buyers cautious, Chris Gamaitoni, an analyst at
Compass Point Research  Trading LLC in Washington, wrote in a
June 23 note. Regulatory changes in the brokerage business could
also stall a sale, he said. </p>
<p>Still, a lot of their acquisitions have come when markets
for those businesses weren''t at the peak, Devin Ryan, an
analyst with Sandler O''Neill  Partners LP in New York, said in
an interview. As a result, they weren''t paying peak multiples.
They had some wiggle room from a financial perspective for
things to work out even if the environment wasn''t perfect. </p>
<p>Stifel''s Kruszewski, 52, became CEO in 1997. The Legg Mason
deal was Stifel''s foundation for success in mergers and
acquisitions, he said in an interview. </p>
<p>If you approach mergers under the same framework that you
run the business every day, then they''re actually easy to
integrate, Kruszewski said. If you do it right, then you
drive shareholder value. </p>
<p>Legg Mason </p>
<p>Morgan Keegan would be Stifel''s eighth purchase after
buying Legg Mason''s capital-markets business in 2005. Since
then, Stifel''s revenue surged to $1.38 billion in 2010 from $264
million. The firm has reported record net revenue every year
since 1995. </p>
<p>Stifel has announced $454 million of publicly disclosed
acquisitions since 1999, capped by its biggest takeover of
Thomas Weisel last year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Stifel purchased Thomas Weisel for $159.1 million in
stock, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, adding
investment-banking business in the technology, health-care and
energy industries. </p>
<p>Stifel is probably one of the few firms that could make
it work, said Matt McCormick, a money manager at Cincinnati-
based Bahl  Gaynor Inc., which oversees $4 billion. If I''m
Stifel, I''d feel I''m in a power position. I don''t have to
overpay for this deal because frankly there''s not too many
people who have the ability to pay for it. </p>

<p>Visa Europe Ltd. said it stopped
payments to WikiLeaks a second time, hours after an Internet
site restarted donations to the anti-secrecy group. </p>
<p>WikiLeaks''s payment provider, DataCell, attempted to use
an alternative-payment gateway to process money sent through
MasterCard, the world''s second-largest payments network, and
Visa Europe, which runs the largest card network in the European
Union, Reykjavik, Iceland-based DataCell said yesterday. </p>
<p>As soon as this came to our attention, action was taken
with the suspension of Visa payment acceptance, Amanda Kamin,
a spokeswoman for London-based Visa Europe said in an e-mailed
statement today. </p>
<p>Visa Europe and MasterCard in December blocked WikiLeaks
from using its network to collect funds from donors. WikiLeaks,
led by Julian Assange, publishes secret documents, including
confidential U.S. diplomatic and military information.
MasterCard''s website has been attacked by hackers in retaliation
as recently as last month. </p>
<p>Sveinn Andri Sveinsson, a lawyer for DataCell and WikiLeaks
in Reykjavik, confirmed that Valitor, a payment processor linked
to Visa and MasterCard, terminated the contract with DataCell
for payment processing this morning, he said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>Donation Processing </p>
<p>The reason they give is that orders have been given by
the international card companies to close down the gateway and
that processing donations to WikiLeaks is a violation of general
terms between the two parties, DataCell said in a separate
statement. </p>
<p>Valitor, based in Reykjavik, declined to immediately
comment. </p>
<p>MasterCard, the world''s second-biggest payments network,
said it had never changed its policy on accepting WikiLeaks
donations. </p>
<p>MasterCard''s position on acceptance has not changed,
James Issokson, a spokesman for the firm, said in a phone
interview. </p>
<p>Andreas Fink, DataCell''s chief executive, said in an e-mail
that the company may have received five-to-six digit figures
in donations for Wikileaks before the payments were halted. </p>
<p>DataCell said yesterday it was also able to process
WikiLeaks donations made through American Express Co. (AXP), the
biggest credit-card issuer by customer spending. Christine Elliott, a spokeswoman for New York-based American Express Co.,
declined to immediately comment. </p>
<p>The WikiLeaks Twitter account, which has almost 1 million
followers, posted a message yesterday about the Financial
block workaround. </p>
<p>Donate whilst you can Visa, MasterCard and AmEx, read
the rest of the message, which linked back to the WikiLeaks

<p>A Chicago trading firm accused Bank
of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase  Co., UBS AG and Citigroup
Inc. (C) of conspiring to manipulate the London interbank offered
rate. </p>
<p>The banks drove down Libor to generate billions of dollars
in profits from swaps, loans, interest rate derivatives and
other financial instruments whose value depended on the rate,
Eldorado Trading Group LLC said in a complaint filed July 5 in
federal court in Newark, New Jersey. </p>
<p>The civil lawsuit is one of several filed in response to
probes by the U.S. Justice Department, Securities and Exchange
Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission related to
whether there were improper attempts to manipulate Libor. The
rate, at which banks borrow from one another in the London
interbank market, is a short-term, international benchmark. </p>
<p>The banks had a substantial incentive to manipulate, and
in fact did manipulate, Libor downward, in order to increase the
income from its interest rate derivatives and similar
instruments, according to Eldorado''s complaint. This
manipulation resulted in billions of dollars in revenue. </p>
<p>Eldorado owned futures and options contracts based on
Eurodollar deposits traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
from August 2007 to December 2009, according to the complaint.
It seeks to represent similar owners of contracts traded on the
Chicago exchange. </p>
<p>Karina Byrne, a UBS spokeswoman, said the Zurich-based bank
is cooperating with the U.S. probes, and has also gotten
requests for information from the Japan Financial Services
Agency and the U.K. Financial Services Authority. </p>
<p>We believe this suit is without merit, Danielle Romero-
Apsilos, a spokeswoman for New York-based Citigroup, said in an
e-mail. </p>
<p>Lawrence Grayson, a spokesman for Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America, declined to comment. Jennifer
Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan, declined
to comment. </p>
<p>The case is Eldorado Trading Group LLC v. Bank of America
Corp. (BAC), 11-cv-3847, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey
(Newark). </p>
<p>Liberty Mutual, Safeco Sue Goldman Alleging Securities Fraud </p>
<p>Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. and Safeco Corp. sued Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) for making misleading statements and
omissions in a preferred-stock offering for Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp. (FMCC) in 2007. </p>
<p>The plaintiffs, which also include Peerless Insurance Co.,
said they invested $37.5 million in the offering of Freddie Mac
shares, which Goldman underwrote, according to a filing July 6
in federal court in Boston. </p>
<p>Goldman claimed Freddie Mac already met its regulatory
capital requirements and that the offering was made to
increase the mortgage company''s capital base, the plaintiffs
said. </p>
<p>The stated purpose for the offering was false, the
plaintiffs said in the complaint. Goldman knew or recklessly
ignored that Freddie Mac did not meet its regulatory capital
requirements, and Freddie Mac remained severely undercapitalized
even after the sale of the preferred stock. </p>
<p>The suit is without merit and we intend to contest it
vigorously, Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based
Goldman Sachs, said in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>The insurers are seeking damages of more than $100 million
and a trial by jury. They said in the complaint that their
investments are virtually worthless. </p>

Providence Equity Partners Inc. </p>
<p>The company is being sold through an unfair process and

<p>The Providence, Rhode Island-based investment firm agreed
July 1 to buy Blackboard, of Washington, for $45 a share in

<p>Lawsuits/Pretrial </p>
<p>JPMorgan Reserves Right to Jury Trial in Lehman Lawsuit </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), sued for $8.6 billion by bankrupt
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ), said it reserved its right to a
review of the case in U.S. District Court and a trial by jury,
according to a court filing yesterday. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is fighting Lehman''s suit in bankruptcy court in
Manhattan, saying it was protected by so-called safe harbor law
when it took collateral from the defunct firm in 2008. Congress
created the law to protect banks lending to faltering companies,
New York-based JPMorgan has said. </p>
<p>Such issues aren''t usually decided in bankruptcy court,
according to JPMorgan. In yesterday''s filing, the bank said it
has a right to have the issues reviewed de novo by a
district court and to seek a jury trial in any case,
controversy or proceeding related to Lehman''s suit. </p>
<p>Lehman claimed in the lawsuit filed last year that JPMorgan
demanded guarantees that fatally weakened the firm, and the
transactions weren''t eligible for safe-harbor protections.
Lehman demanded $8.6 billion in collateral, plus tens of
billions of dollars in damages from JPMorgan, the second-biggest
U.S. bank. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, which lent $70 billion to Lehman''s brokerage
around the time of the September 2008 bankruptcy, sued Lehman
back, alleging it defrauded its lender into making the loan. </p>
<p>Separately, a district judge has taken over a $19 billion
lawsuit filed against JPMorgan by the trustee liquidating
Bernard Madoff''s firm. When asking the judge to take the case,
JPMorgan argued that it involved issues of common law and
federal law that a bankruptcy judge isn''t entitled to decide. </p>
<p>The Lehman suit is Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 10-03266, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<p>UBS Suits by Madoff Trustee May Be Handled by District Judge </p>
<p>A U.S. district judge said she will review lawsuits against
UBS AG (UBSN) by the liquidator of Bernard Madoff''s defunct firm, and
will probably take the case out of bankruptcy court to rule on
it herself. </p>
<p>Trustee Irving Picard sued UBS twice, demanding $2.6
billion and alleging the Zurich-based bank aided Madoff''s fraud
by setting up so-called feeder funds and agreeing to look the
other way at irregularities. U.S. District Judge Colleen
McMahon, who is handling Picard''s $19 billion suit against
JPMorgan Chase  Co., said the UBS case is related and raises
similar issues of whether Picard has a right to sue. </p>
<p>In a note to lawyers filed yesterday in court, McMahon gave
Picard until July 11 at 5 p.m. to explain on paper how she is
mistaken. </p>
<p>McMahon said in May that a bankruptcy judge isn''t entitled
to decide whether Picard has the right to sue New York-based
JPMorgan on behalf of the con man''s customers, and she would
handle that case. </p>
<p>JPMorgan argued that Picard was hired to liquidate the
Madoff firm, and wasn''t empowered by law to mount a class-action
suit to recover money on behalf of Madoff customers. Picard,
defending his suit, misses the point, the judge said. The
trustee last month trebled the amount of money he demanded from
the second-biggest U.S. bank. </p>
<p>The UBS case is Picard v. UBS AG (UBS), 10-ap-4285, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<p>JPMorgan Madoff'' Suit Rightfully Dismissed, Court Says </p>
<p>A lawsuit accusing JPMorgan Chase  Co. of conspiring with
Bernard Madoff to injure an investment company was rightfully
dismissed by a U.S. District Court, an appeals court said. </p>
<p>MLSMK Investment Co. accused New York-based JPMorgan of
violating U.S. racketeering law in conspiring with the Ponzi
scheme operator to harm investors. The plaintiff is barred from
making the claim by securities law, the higher court decided.
The ruling was filed by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
yesterday. </p>
<p>MLSMK lost its $12.8 million investment with Madoff''s firm
when the con man was arrested in December 2008, according to the
filing. It sued JPMorgan on grounds that the company was
Madoff''s banker, using state and federal law to allege that
JPMorgan helped Madoff to fleece his victims while
benefiting from fees paid by Madoff, according to the filing. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones in Manhattan dismissed
the case, saying the suit didn''t adequately show any of the
facts the plaintiff was alleging. The appeals court last month
affirmed the judge''s dismissal of the state law claims,
including aiding and abetting the fraud, commercial bad faith,
and negligence. The latest ruling affirms dismissal of the
outstanding claim brought under federal racketeering law,
according to the filing. </p>
<p>Madoff, 73, is serving a 150-year sentence in a North
Carolina federal prison. </p>
<p>The case is MLSMK Investment Co. v. JPMorgan, 10-cv-3040,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<p>Algosaibi Family Ordered by U.K. Court to Show Saudi Assets </p>
<p>Saudi Arabia''s Algosaibi family and their company, which
defaulted in 2009, were ordered by a U.K. judge to disclose
their assets after admitting liability in a $250 million lawsuit
by HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) and four other banks. </p>
<p>Ahmad Hamad Algosaibi  Brothers Co. and more than a dozen
wealthy family members must provide lists of all assets
worth $50,000 or more by Aug. 4, including property in Saudi
Arabia, Justice Julian Flaux ruled yesterday in the High Court
in London. </p>
<p>Algosaibi, which had sought as many as six weeks to catalog
its Saudi possessions, was also told to reveal if any business
assets had been moved irregularly since June 16, when the family
dropped its defense during a trial on the banks'' claims. The
company still hasn''t made a public offer to pay the banks, Flaux
said. </p>
<p>A Saudi court order freezing Algosaibi''s assets in the
country isn''t preventing the family from carrying on quite
expensive litigation all around the world, Tim Lord, a lawyer
for London-based HSBC, said at the hearing. It''s about time
they pay off these debts. </p>
<p>The case is part of a global dispute between Algosaibi and
one of Saudi Arabia''s richest men, Maan al-Sanea, who married
into the Algosaibi family and founded the Saad Group, which has
businesses ranging from construction to health care. Units of
Saad and Algosaibi, both based in the Saudi oil city of Al-
Khobar, defaulted after borrowing about $15.7 billion from more
than 80 banks. Algosaibi has sued al-Sanea in the Cayman
Islands, Saudi Arabia and New York, accusing him of heaping debt
on the company by taking out fraudulent loans. </p>
<p>Algosaibi, with interests including construction, beverage
bottling and finance, remains willing to negotiate with banks
toward a fair and comprehensive resolution, the law firm Baach
Robinson  Lewis Pllc in Washington said in a statement on
behalf of Algosaibi. AHAB does not have the funds to pay the
massive amounts that were borrowed in its name. </p>
<p>The London case, stemming from the largest Saudi default to
come out of the credit crunch, includes HSBC''s $85 million
claim, British Arab Commercial Bank''s $19 million claim, Arab
Banking Corp.''s claims totaling $140 million and Credit Agricole
SA (ACA)''s $6 million claim. </p>

<p>Trials/Appeals </p>
<p>JPMorgan, Mets Tactic May Cut Madoff Jackpot </p>
<p>Legal victories by owners of the New York Mets and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. may slash the $100 billion Irving Picard is seeking
on behalf of Bernard Madoff''s clients, undercutting bets traders
have made on victims'' claims, Bloomberg News'' Linda Sandler
reports. </p>
<p>Picard, liquidator of Madoff''s firm, has filed 1,000 suits
on behalf of Madoff investors. He sued JPMorgan Chase for $19
billion, equal to all the money lost by all investors in
Madoff''s Ponzi scheme. He sued HSBC Holdings Plc and a dozen
feeder funds for $9 billion, and seeks as much as $59 billion --
including trebled racketeering charges -- from Bank Medici AG,
its founder, Sonja Kohn, and UniCredit SpA. (UCG) The Mets owners,
Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz, face a $1 billion suit. </p>
<p>The banks say that Picard is straining the limits of the
law as he tries to grab back money for victims of Madoff''s
fraud. They won initial victories by persuading a judge to
remove their dispute with Picard from bankruptcy court to higher
district courts, which will decide whether Picard exceeded his
powers. </p>
<p>If the suits are scaled back by this tactic, Madoff clients
will have a smaller pot of damages from which to recover losses,
and investors who bought some of their claims at discount may
lose the bets they made. Madoff claims are now trading at about
70 cents on the dollar. </p>
<p>The general view is, Picard will have enough success with
his lawsuits to provide substantial recovery over and above what
has settled, said Andrew Gottesman, who heads bankruptcy
claims trading at SecondMarket in Manhattan. That''s what''s
driving pricing. If the trustee loses those lawsuits against the
banks, traders'' sense of the risk involved would change. </p>
<p>The main case is Securities Investor Protection Corp. v.
Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, 08-ap-1789, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Foreign Bribe Sting Operation for Weapons Ends in Hung Jury </p>
<p>U.S. prosecutors'' first foreign bribery case based on a
sting operation ended with jurors failing to agree whether four
security company executives sought corrupt deals from an agent
posing as a representative of Gabon. </p>
<p>The 12-member jury told U.S. District Judge Richard Leon in
Washington yesterday it had reached an impasse after six days of
deliberations. Leon decided to declare a mistrial rather than
sending the jurors back to continue deliberating. </p>
<p>It''s a close call, counsel, Leon said in court. What
makes it a particularly close call is the amount of time, money,
energy and effort that went into this case. </p>
<p>U.S. prosecutor Joey Lipton said in court that the
government intends to seek a retrial. </p>
<p>The prosecution of the four is part of a 22-defendant
kickback conspiracy case stemming from the sting operation and a
fake $15 million weapons deal. It''s the biggest U.S. prosecution
of individuals for bribing foreign officials. </p>
<p>Prosecutors allege the men sought to funnel payments to
Gabon''s minister of defense in exchange for contracts to provide
guns, grenades and uniforms for the African country''s
presidential guard. The attempted payments violated the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act, prosecutors said. </p>
<p>Defense lawyers accused the government of engineering the
conspiracy, breaking Federal Bureau of Investigation rules about
handling informants, and obscuring from their clients that the
deal involved a kickback payment by calling it a commission. </p>
<p>The defendants -- John Wier III, Andrew Bigelow, Lee
Tolleson and Pankesh Patel -- have denied any wrongdoing. </p>
<p>Laura Sweeney, spokeswoman for the Justice Department,
declined to comment, as did lawyers for the four defendants. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Goncalves, 09-cr-00335, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington). </p>

<p>Verdicts/Settlement </p>
<p>JPMorgan to Pay $228 Million to Settle Municipal Bid-Rig Case </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. agreed to pay $228 million to settle
federal charges that the bank conspired to rig the bidding on
investment contracts sold to state and local governments, the
Securities and Exchange Commission said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank, agreed to pay $177
million to settle federal and state charges and to return $51.2
million to municipal borrowers affected by the conduct, the SEC
said in a statement. </p>
<p>The U.S. Justice Department and the SEC for more than four
years have been investigating how banks and financial advisers
fixed the bidding on investments sold to municipalities.
Prosecutors say the conspiracy cost taxpayers by allowing banks
to pay governments below-market rates. UBS AG and Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) previously settled similar charges. </p>
<p>JPMorgan improperly won bids by entering into secret
arrangements with bidding agents to get an illegal last look''
at competitors'' bids, Robert Khuzami, director of the SEC''s
Division of Enforcement, said in a statement. Municipal
issuers and investors didn''t stand a chance against the
fraudulent strategies, he said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan doesn''t tolerate anticompetitive activity or
other violations of law, the bank said in a news release. The
charges were the result of former employees at a small part of
the company that has since been shuttered, the bank said. The
employees concealed their conduct from management, JPMorgan
said. </p>
<p>The firm assisted the government agencies in their
investigations and is pleased to have resolved this matter with
its regulators, the statement said. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo to Pay $125 Million Over Mortgage Securities </p>
<p>Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) agreed to pay $125 million to settle
accusations by investors that the bank misled them about the
risks of mortgage-backed securities it sold. </p>
<p>The plaintiffs in the consolidated group case, or class
action, include the General Retirement System of Detroit, New
Orleans Employees'' Retirement System and other public pensions,
according to the settlement filed July 6 in federal court in San
Jose, California. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. home lender, and several
investment banks that underwrote the securities were sued in
2009 over alleged violations of securities laws in connection
with sales of mortgage pass-through certificates. The bank and
the underwriters deny wrongdoing, according to the court filing. </p>
<p>The proposed settlement agreement is a negotiated
resolution as to all named defendants and is intended to avoid
the distraction and expense of litigation, Ancel Martinez, a
Wells Fargo spokesman, said in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>The bank still faces claims in state courts in California,
Illinois and Indiana filed by individual investors and federal
home loan banks seeking to rescind billions of dollars of
mortgage-backed securities purchases. </p>
<p>It''s a very favorable outcome and will be significant for
investors, David Stickney, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said
in a phone interview. </p>
<p>The case is In Re Wells Fargo Mortgage-Backed Certificates
Litigation, 09-1376, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
California (San Jose). </p>
<p>Fisher''s Firm Told to Pay $376,000 on Investment Losses </p>
<p>Fisher Investments Inc., the firm run by Forbes magazine
columnist Kenneth Fisher, may have to pay damages of $376,075
for breaching its fiduciary duty to a retired investor. </p>
<p>Sharyn Silverstein, 64, is entitled to out-of-pocket losses
she incurred as a result of Fisher Investments liquidating her
bond portfolio and investing 100 percent of the proceeds in
stocks, according to a copy of the interim arbitration award
obtained by Bloomberg News. Silverstein had invested with Fisher
in 2007 after multiple calls and visits from a Fisher outside
salesman, according to the award document. She had initially
contacted the firm after seeing a Fisher advertisement for a
complimentary book in USA Today, the document said. </p>
<p>She called Fisher to get a copy of a free book, with no
intention of doing business with Fisher, and ended up being
pressured and eventually persuaded, despite significant
resistance on her part and that of her husband, to turn over all
of her fixed-income securities to Fisher to be invested in
equities, Karen Willcutts, the JAMS arbitrator for the case,
wrote in a 25-page interim award dated July 5. JAMS, based in
Irvine, California, is a private forum for arbitration and
mediation. Some investment adviser firm agreements include a
clause that parties must resolve any disputes through private
arbitration. </p>
<p>The decision was completely wrong on the law and the
facts. With more than 25,000 clients, losing an arbitration once
every seven years is a record far better than any major
competitor, which underscores the integrity of our firm, said
David Eckerly, group vice president corporate communications for
Woodside, California-based Fisher Investments. Kenneth Fisher is
the firm''s founder and chief executive officer. </p>
<p>Joseph Peiffer, a New Orleans-based attorney with Fishman
Haygood Phelps Walmsley Willis  Swanson, LLP, who represents
Silverstein, declined to comment. </p>

<p>General Electric Co. (GE), the world''s
second-biggest maker of wind turbines, shifted production in
India to the west, with the country''s most untapped potential
for the alternative power, from a saturated southern market. </p>
<p>The company stopped assembling turbines at its facility in
Chennai in the southern state of Tamil Nadu and moved production
to a plant opened this year in Pune, in the west, GE said in an
e-mailed response to questions. </p>
<p>We plan to eventually grow the capacity to 450 megawatts
yearly in line with the growth in demand, GE said, without
specifying current output. </p>
<p>The shift may make it easier for GE to supply projects in
states including Maharashtra, where Pune is located, Gujarat,
Rajasthan and Karnataka, which, according to the Global Wind
Energy Council, have India''s most untapped wind potential. In
India, which ranks behind Ethiopia and Indonesia in
infrastructure quality, the biggest problem for wind projects is
transporting turbines and components along poor roads, according
to Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL), the nation''s dominant supplier. </p>
<p>Tamil Nadu is struggling with congestion that is crimping
investment in wind power. CLP Holdings Ltd. (2), Hong Kong''s largest
power supplier and India''s biggest wind-farm developer, passed
on a chance expand a project in the state by 50 megawatts
because the local electricity grid was unable to take additional
capacity. </p>
<p>We had to let it go because we could anticipate that for
the first three years of operation we would have heavy power
evacuation issues, Mahesh Makhija, director of renewables at
CLP''s local unit, said in an interview on June 23. </p>
<p>Supply Chain </p>
<p>In contrast, the states closer to GE''s new facility can
host another 22,000 megawatts of projects, 55 percent more than
India''s current wind capacity, according to the government. </p>
<p>GE is assembling 1.5-megawatt and 1.6-megawatt turbines
designed for low wind speeds at Pune, which is about 150
kilometers (93 miles) south of Mumbai, India''s financial hub. </p>
<p>Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE has also invested in
developing a local supply chain to buy components in India, it
said. Overseas turbine makers are increasingly relying on
cheaper Asian suppliers to help trim costs and increase
competitiveness. </p>
<p>Repower Systems SE, based in Hamburg, will start making
turbines in India for the first time this year and expects to
cut costs on average by 15 percent by buying more parts from
Asia, Chief Executive Officer Andreas Nauen said in an interview
last month. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) took over
the portfolio of DBS Partners LP, one of the largest independent
market makers for options on the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index,
after that firm declined to put up more collateral, according to
four people with knowledge of the transaction. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which had served as DBS''s clearing firm,
asked banks and brokerages late last week to submit offers to
close out about 575,000 options that Naperville, Illinois-based
DBS previously owned, said the people, who asked not to be named
because the information is private. That figure equals about 4.3
percent of the 13.5 million SP 500 contracts outstanding as of
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>DBS co-founder Eric Wojcikiewicz, known as Eji among
traders at the Chicago Board Options Exchange, owned contracts
that would have cost about $470 million to unwind as of the end
of last week, said three people familiar with the portfolio.
When Goldman Sachs asked him for more collateral, he opted
instead to turn over his portfolio, two of the people said. </p>
<p>Eric was well-known as one of the largest players in the
pit with positions bigger than some of the banks'', said Henry Schwartz, president of Trade Alert LLC, a New York-based
provider of options-market data and analytics. With this guy
gone from SPX, you might not see as much liquidity. </p>
<p>Final Hours </p>
<p>Wojcikiewicz declined to comment, as did Michael DuVally, a
spokesman for New York-based Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>Under rules set by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, clearing firms such as Goldman Sachs Execution and
Clearing must determine the amount of risk that market-making
clients such as DBS have taken on through their investments.
They can then ask for more collateral or take a charge against
their own capital to reflect that amount of risk, according to
Michael Macchiaroli, an associate director in the SEC''s Division
of Trading and Markets. </p>
<p>If the positions go down, they take the risk,
Macchiaroli said in a telephone interview. He declined to
comment on the events at Goldman Sachs and DBS. </p>
<p>Options are contracts granting their owners the right to
buy or sell a security, a commodity or an index''s cash value at
a set price. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs put the contracts up for bids during the
final two hours of trading last week, just before the
Independence Day holiday weekend in the U.S., according to the
people. </p>
<p>Best Offer </p>
<p>Banks and brokerages were seeking about $480 million, or a
$10 million premium, to take on the risk of closing out the
contracts. The best offer, at $457 million, came from another
Goldman Sachs unit, according to the people, meaning the bank
worked out at least part of the portfolio in-house. </p>
<p>When a clearing firm takes over a client portfolio and then
passes it along to an affiliate, the company must follow CBOE
rules for such transactions, known as position transfers,
according to Gail Osten, a spokeswoman for the exchange. She
declined to comment on the DBS transaction. </p>
<p>CBOE Holdings Inc. (CBOE), owner of the oldest U.S. options
market, has the exclusive right to trade options on the
benchmark for American equities. SP 500 options were the third
most-traded U.S. contracts last year, according to data from
Chicago-based Options Clearing Corp., which clears and settles
all U.S. option trades on exchanges. </p>
<p>Four Friends </p>
<p>DBS Partners was formed in March 1992 by four friends who
had attended the University of Pennsylvania, according to a
brokerage report that the firm filed with the SEC and a person
familiar with the firm. In addition to Wojcikiewicz, they
included Daniel Kerrane, Eric Bryant, and Kenneth Alpart. </p>
<p>After attending Penn, located in Philadelphia, all four
went to work for Cooper Neff  Associates, this person said.
Cooper Neff, a Philadelphia-based options trading firm, agreed
to be acquired in 1994 by Banque Nationale De Paris, according
to Roy Neff, one of the founders. </p>
<p>I remember him as a smart guy, Neff said of
Wojcikiewicz in a telephone interview. He was a physics person
and he added a lot to our mathematical modeling. </p>
<p>Kerrane died from cancer in 2002 at the age of 37,
according to an obituary published that November in the Chicago
Tribune and the person familiar with the firm. The two other
partners went to work elsewhere after DBS was formed, leaving
Wojcikiewicz as the firm''s last remaining principal. </p>
<p>Floor Trader </p>
<p>During the 1990s, Wojcikiewicz worked on the floor of the
CBOE, where his identification tag had the initials EJI, the
people said. He later began making markets from an office in
Naperville, where his home is located. </p>
<p>DBS had derivative contracts with a market value of $753.4
million listed as assets on its balance sheet as of Dec. 31,
2001, the only year that it filed a brokerage report with the
SEC. Its liabilities included $708.6 million of derivative
contracts listed as financial instruments sold, not yet
purchased. Partners'' capital totaled $19.3 million. </p>
<p>As a market maker and trader on various national
financial exchanges, the partnership is, in fact, in the
business of managing market risk, DBS Partners said in the SEC
filing. The partnership employs hedged, market-neutral trading
strategies and thus, in management''s opinion, market risk is
substantially diminished when all financial instruments are
aggregated. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE)''s shareholders are in a
win-win situation as the world''s largest drugmaker considers
whether to spin off or sell its baby-food unit as part of a
corporate overhaul. </p>
<p>As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, a comparable spinoff has
paid off at Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY), which got out of the
infant-formula business by distributing its stake in Mead
Johnson Nutrition Co. (MJN) in December 2009. </p>
<p>Mead Johnson has climbed about five times as much as
Bristol-Myers since the split, as depicted in the chart. The
companies went their separate ways 10 months after an initial
public offering of the unit''s shares. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s holders may fare even better if the company exits
baby food through a sale instead, according to Seamus Fernandez,
an analyst at Leerink Swann LLC. </p>
<p>Demand would be high and a sale would be relatively
straightforward, Fernandez wrote yesterday in a report. He
estimated that the unit''s price tag would be about $10 billion,
or 5 times sales. </p>
<p>Anyone looking for a spinoff may have to set their sights
on Pfizer''s animal-health unit, the report said. The drugmaker
said yesterday that it would divest that business, along with
baby food, while keeping units that make consumer health-care
products and off-patent prescription drugs. </p>

<p>Wall Street banks are marketing
about $3.7 billion of bonds tied to property loans, wagering
investor demand for the debt will withstand mounting concerns
that the U.S. economic recovery is stalling and the European
crisis is spreading. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Citigroup Inc. (C) are offering
$1.5 billion in bonds, while Wells Fargo  Co. and Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc (RBS) are selling $1.48 billion of securities,
according to people with knowledge of the sales. Deutsche Bank
AG (DBK) is marketing $685 million of notes tied to hotel mortgages. </p>
<p>Banks are preparing as much as $10 billion in new sales of
commercial-mortgage bonds in the third quarter, according to a
July 8 report from JPMorgan Chase  Co. Even as the pipeline has
grown in the $700 billion market for debt tied to hotels,
offices and shopping centers, the U.S. unemployment rate has
increased to the highest level this year and credit markets have
been roiled by speculation that Europe''s debt crisis may engulf
Italy. </p>
<p>Top-rated securities linked to commercial real estate yield
209 basis points more than Treasuries as of July 8, according to
a Barclays Plc index. The spread has narrowed from 227 basis
points on June 24 after the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
halted its sales of mortgage bonds acquired in the rescue of
American International Group Inc., which had curbed demand for
debt ranging from high-yield bonds to securities linked to
property. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. </p>
<p>The mortgage-bond deal from Goldman Sachs and Citigroup is
linked to 71 loans on 131 properties in states led by Texas,
Arizona and California, said a person, who declined to be
identified because terms aren''t public. The transaction from
Wells Fargo and RBS is linked to 76 loans on 132 properties in
states led by California, Wisconsin and New York. Both
securities may be sold as soon as next week. </p>
<p>Hotel Debt </p>
<p>Deutsche Bank is selling debt linked to 168 hotels across
the U.S., said a person familiar with that offering. The
Marriott hotel franchise accounts for 60 percent of the pool.
Hilton properties are 17.5 percent, while Starwood accounts for
7.5 percent. The hotels are owned by Goldman Sachs''s
Whitehall Street real-estate unit. </p>
<p>The offerings will bring 2011 sales of the securities to
$19.3 billion, compared with $11.5 billion in all of last year. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is aiming to
sell Spanish residential mortgage-backed securities this year,
kick-starting a market shut since 2007. </p>
<p>JPMorgan wants to repeat its feat of reviving the U.K.
mortgage bond market in 2009 when it shepherded a 4 billion-
pound ($6.4 billion) sale for Lloyds Banking Group Plc, and
restarting Italian issuance with a deal for Banca Monte dei
Paschi di Siena SpA in November. Oldrich Masek, JPMorgan''s head
of securitized products origination for EMEA, said reopening
Spain''s market will be our primary focus this year. </p>
<p>Spanish home loan-backed bonds may be a tough sell for a
country with Europe''s highest jobless rate, three years of
falling home prices and a five-fold increase in mortgage arrears
since 2007. Confidence in the nation was dealt a blow last week
when Moody''s Investors Service downgraded its neighbor Portugal
to junk. </p>
<p>A deal is a real challenge in the current market, said
Luis Merino, a Madrid-based fund manager at La Caixa who helps
oversee 15 billion euros ($21 billion) including asset-backed
debt. A reopening of Spain''s mortgage bond market would be one
of the most important milestones in the recovery of the Spanish
financial sector and the country''s economy, he said. </p>
<p>Spain''s banks have been the third-largest issuers of the
notes in Europe after the U.K. and the Netherlands, with 189
billion euros ($270 billion) outstanding, according to the
Association for Financial Markets in Europe. No Spanish
mortgage-backed securities have been sold publicly since a deal
by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA in July 2007. </p>
<p>Housing Boom </p>
<p>Spain has historically been a big securitization market
and Spanish banks need to raise funds, JPMorgan''s Masek said
in an interview. Secured funding is the most efficient way to
raise a large financing in a market with the problems of
peripheral Europe. </p>
<p>Mortgage-backed securities helped finance a decade-long
housing boom in Spain before losses from subprime mortgage bonds
in the U.S. caused investors to shun hard-to-value assets. Banks
pool home loans and sell them to investors as bonds, allowing
lenders to raise capital more cheaply than by issuing unsecured
debt. </p>
<p>JPMorgan arranged 17 asset-backed transactions totalling
19.3 billion euros in the first five months of the year, more
than any other bank, according to data compiled by Structured
Credit Investor, a financial information provider in London. </p>
<p>Lloyds, BMPS </p>
<p>The first deals in the Spanish ABS market are likely to
be offered as short-dated fast-pay senior tranches to make
them more attractive to investors, London-based Masek said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s transaction for Lloyds opened the U.K. market
after it had been virtually shut since 2008, according to
Bloomberg data. As well as finding investors for the bonds, the
U.S. bank bought a 1.25 billion-pound portion of the deal and
provided a loan to Lloyds using the securities as collateral,
Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>In Italy, JPMorgan helped reopen the residential mortgage
bond market with a 995 million-euro transaction for Banca Monte
dei Paschi di Siena in November, the first public sale of the
debt since June 2007, JPMorgan data show. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is possibly the best-placed player to reopen the
Spanish RMBS market, since not only are they able to arrange the
deal, but also to put in a lead order and provide financing,
said Stefano Loreti, a senior portfolio manager at Cairn Capital
in London, who helps oversee more than $20 billion of asset-
backed securities. We haven''t heard of any new issue Spanish
RMBS being marketed for a long time. </p>
<p>Higher Fees </p>
<p>A bank arranging Spain''s first mortgage securitization
would get a significant increase in fees compared with pre-
crisis levels, according to Santiago Ruiz-Morales, who was
Credit Agricole SA''s head of asset-backed securities for Spain
and Portugal until 2007. </p>
<p>In the pre-crisis years, banks were organizing Spanish
RMBS transactions for fees ranging between 10 and 20 basis
points, said Ruiz-Morales, now a partner at asset manager
Aguila Capital SL in Madrid. Now, a new transaction would face
a huge increase in fees to reflect the higher marketing efforts
needed to get the deal done. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) was left
out of financing Blackboard Inc. (BBBB)''s leveraged buyout after the
investment bank stiffened terms, another sign that private-
equity deals are becoming harder and more expensive to complete. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs increased the so-called flex on the portion
of the financing it originally agreed to provide Blackboard, the
education-software maker being acquired by Providence Equity
Partners Inc., according to people with knowledge of the deal.
The change would have given Goldman Sachs a bigger cushion if
credit markets moved against the New York-based firm before the
$1.64 billion deal closed. </p>
<p>Providence balked at the new terms and the sale''s
announcement was put off while the firm lined up a new lender.
It''s the latest in a series of deals that have been delayed or
repriced as credit markets show signs of stress. New leveraged
loans fell 18 percent to $116.4 billion in the second quarter
from the first three months of this year, according to Standard
 Poor''s Leveraged Commentary and Data. </p>
<p>A Greek sovereign debt default will most certainly lead
to risk contagion throughout the European banking system and
send shock waves through the global capital markets, said
Michael Cerminaro, a co-founder of Sound Harbor Partners, a New
York investment firm that lends to middle-market companies.
Combined with a slowing U.S. economy, this could put a damper
on deal activity over the near term. </p>
<p>Rising Risk </p>
<p>The stiffer terms from Goldman Sachs reflect concern at the
firm that credit markets are overheated and that risks are
rising as speculation swirls about sovereign defaults in Europe,
according to one of the people with knowledge of the firm''s
decision. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the
bank''s strategies are confidential. </p>
<p>The so-called flex gives lenders the ability to raise the
interest rate on a loan so long as it stays within a preset
range that the bank and borrower agree on. If credit markets
weaken, driving rates higher than the upper limit, a lender
could be forced to absorb the difference or hold the loan until
it can sell it at a better price. </p>
<p>Buyouts are typically financed with leveraged loans and
junk bonds, which carry some of the highest interest rates and
typically are among the first financing to be withdrawn when
credit tightens. While buyout activity more than tripled last
year to $95 billion, private-equity firms haven''t been able to
pull off the same kind of multibillion-dollar deals they
brokered before the credit crisis took hold. </p>
<p>Post-Crisis Deals </p>
<p>Del Monte Foods Co. is the biggest private-equity buyout
since the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008
prompted banks to shun financing for leveraged transactions. A
group led by KKR  Co. agreed to buy Del Monte for about $4
billion, plus $1.3 billion in debt, in November 2010. </p>
<p>Blackboard managed to get $1.15 billion in debt-financing
commitments, according to a regulatory filing by the Washington-
based company, with Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) stepping in for Goldman
Sachs. Deutsche Bank was joined by Morgan Stanley and Bank of
America Corp. in providing a $700 million first-lien term loan,
a $100 million first-lien revolving line of credit and a $350
million second-lien term loan, according to the July 1 filing. </p>
<p>Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment. Officials at Blackboard and Providence Equity didn''t
return calls seeking comment. </p>
<p>Tighter Terms </p>
<p>The Blackboard deal follows two other buyouts crimped by
tighter terms. Another Providence Equity deal, SRA International
Inc., had to offer a bigger discount to sell its buyout loan.
The provider of technology and consulting services priced an
$875 million term loan at 95 cents on the dollar, less than the
initial 99-cent price. </p>
<p>Similarly, Lawson Software Inc. (LWSN), acquired July 6 by Golden
Gate Capital Corp. and Infor Global Solutions for $1.81 billion,
sweetened terms for loan buyers by boosting the yield and
cutting the maturity on the loan funding the buyout. Banks
including Credit Suisse Group AG sold almost all of the $440
million portion of a $1.04 billion buyout term loan for St.
Paul, Minnesota-based Lawson after declining the week before to
market that piece of the deal amid falling loan prices. The bank
group also included Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Royal Bank
of Canada and Deutsche Bank. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) took the lead
in advising on chemical mergers and acquisitions in the first
half as 2011 shapes up to be a potential record beater for deals
in the $2.5 trillion industry. </p>
<p>The U.S. bank, which replaced last year''s winner Deutsche
Bank AG (DBK), advised on five transactions valued at a combined
$19.14 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, based
on announced takeovers. Credit Suisse Group and UBS AG (UBSN) took the
No. 2 and No. 3 slots respectively, followed by Morgan Stanley. </p>
<p>Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)''s $9.22 billion-acquisition of
lubricants maker Lubrizol is this year''s biggest deal in an
industry that''s drawing interest from buyout firms with renewed
access to credit as well as rivals. Cash holdings for the 167
companies in the Bloomberg World Chemicals Index swelled to
about $116 billion last year, an increase of 18 percent, as cost
cuts coincided with a global recovery. </p>
<p>Momentum in the deal cycle is upwards, said Bernd
Schneider, a consultant at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Frankfurt,
who advises on chemical deals. 2011 will definitely be a great
year. It may even become a record year for MA in chemicals. </p>
<p>The pace will need to accelerate in the second half to beat
the existing $183 billion high of 2007, Bloomberg data shows. In
the latest deal to be announced, Lonza Group AG yesterday agreed
to buy Arch Chemicals Inc. for $1.2 billion. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s tally includes working with Mosaic Co. when
investor Cargill Inc. sold shares in the potash maker and
advising DuPont Co. (DD) on its takeover of food-additives company
Danisco. Among the highest fees published this year is the $26
million paid by Lubrizol to Citigroup Inc. and Evercore Partners
Inc. amid the approach by Warren Buffett''s Berkshire Hathaway. </p>
<h2>Strategics Lead </h2>
<p>The first half saw $60.26 billion in announced deals, an
increase of 41 percent. The average transaction size rose
similarly, to $271.5 million. </p>
<p>The industry remains largely fragmented industry, Schneider
said. The Bloomberg World Chemicals Index has returned 47
percent in a year, double the return of the broader Bloomberg
World Index. </p>
<p>Strategic buyers are taking the lead rather than
financial sponsors, reflective of a high level of CEO confidence
and the full recovery we have seen in share prices, said Peter Hall, a partner at chemical adviser Valence Group, which has six
deals under its belt in the first six months of 2011. Based on
our pipeline, MA activity in the sector is set to continue at a
high level for the coming months. </p>
<p>Valence''s transactions include advising Bridgepoint Private
Equity Ltd.''s CABB on the purchase of KemFine from 3i Group Plc.
Other deals have involved Tessenderlo Chemie NV''s disposal of
PVC plastic operations to Ineos. </p>
<h2>Deal Diversity </h2>
<p>The diversity of these deals and the sectors in which
they are involved demonstrate that in the current environment,
even relatively difficult'' businesses can be divested such is
the appetite amongst buyers, Hall said. We''ve managed to
deliver one of the first moves in many years in the much-talked-about consolidation of the European PVC sector. </p>
<p>Disposals have attracted interest from buyers around the
world, including China, and targets will get more expensive,
said Hall. Higher prices aren''t necessarily a deal breaker as
CEOs are increasingly considering the long-term strategic
benefit of buying an asset, with less weighting placed on the
short-term savings from integrating acquired assets, he said. </p>
<p>During the next 12 months, Hall said he expects to see an
increasing number of the emerging-market players, especially in
China, gain the confidence to pull the trigger on
acquisitions, particularly where the target has world-leading
technology that can be applied in the domestic Chinese market. </p>
<h2>Multiples </h2>
<p>The multiples they have in some instances paid must be
evaluated against a backdrop of there being no immediate synergy
- so they have demonstrated their willingness to pay a market
entry multiple, Hall said. </p>
<p>Demand is coinciding with an expected increase in the
number of assets that are poised to be sold by private equity
firms, said Schneider. </p>
<p>There are a lot of assets around held by private equity
for five years or more, some of them are overdue for an exit,
consultant Schneider said. Private equity investors need to
act now, and many assets are being prepared for a sale. Some
private equity investors seem to be under pressure to invest.
They are hungry for assets. </p>

<p>Rajat Gupta, the former Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) director, can proceed with a lawsuit claiming
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission violated his rights
when it filed an administrative action accusing him of passing
illegal stock tips. </p>
<p>The SEC initiated the administrative proceeding in
Washington on March 1, claiming Gupta passed information to
Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam about Goldman Sachs
and Procter  Gamble Co. (PG), where Gupta was also on the board. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff ruled yesterday that Gupta,
who hasn''t been charged criminally, may argue that the agency
intentionally singled him out for unfair treatment in
retaliation for claiming his innocence. Rakoff said that all of
the other suits filed in the Galleon case, against 21 people and
seven companies, are in federal court. </p>
<p>We have the unusual case where there is already a well-
developed public record of Gupta being treated substantially
disparately from 28 essentially identical defendants, with not
even a hint from the SEC, even in their instant papers, as to
why this should be so, Rakoff wrote in an opinion yesterday. </p>
<p>Rajaratnam was found guilty of 14 criminal counts of
conspiracy and securities fraud on May 11. He is awaiting
sentencing. </p>
<p>The case is Gupta v. SEC, 11-CV-1900, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<p>SIPC Opposes Attempt by Mets Owners to Dismiss Madoff Suit </p>
<p>The Securities Investor Protection Corp. opposed a request
by the owners of the New York Mets baseball team to dismiss a $1
billion suit by the trustee liquidating Bernard Madoff''s firm. </p>
<p>The trustee, Irving Picard, is suing Fred Wilpon and Saul
Katz and their firm, Sterling Equities, seeking the return of
$700 million in principal and $300 million in profit from
Madoff''s Ponzi scheme. Picard claims the team''s owners had a
duty to investigate red flags warning of possible fraud. </p>
<p>SIPC yesterday asked U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in
Manhattan to let the suit go forward, arguing that Picard has
the legal authority to pursue the claim. </p>
<p>Rakoff agreed this month to review the case, which Picard
filed last year in bankruptcy court. He said judges have
struggled with the duty of inquiry into fraud for more than half
a century and the duty may not have applied to the Mets owners. </p>
<p>The case is Picard v. Katz, 11-cv-03605, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<p>Strauss-Kahn''s French Accuser Makes Statement to Paris Police </p>
<p>Paris police took a statement yesterday from French writer
Tristane Banon, who has accused Dominique Strauss-Kahn of
attempting to rape her. </p>
<p>Banon met with the police yesterday, said Agnes Labregere-
Delorme, a spokeswoman for the prosecution, which began a
preliminary investigation on July 8 into her claim that the
former International Monetary Fund chief assaulted her in 2003. </p>
<p>Strauss-Kahn, 62, stepped down from the IMF after being
charged with sexually assaulting a maid at a New York hotel in
May. He was released from home confinement this month and had
his bail returned after U.S. prosecutors uncovered evidence the
32-year-old woman who accused him had lied about key aspects of
her life. Strauss-Kahn denies the claims in both cases. </p>
<p>Banon''s lawyer David Koubbi declined to comment on her
police statement. </p>
<p>Strauss-Kahn has called Banon''s claims imaginary and
asked that a slander complaint against her be prepared,
according to his lawyers. </p>
<p>At the time of the alleged incident, Banon was an intern
with magazine Paris Match and had just signed a contract for a
book on politicians'' regrets. She met Strauss-Kahn for a follow-
up interview at his friend''s apartment in Paris, she said in an
interview published in the July 6 issue of L''Express. </p>
<p>Strauss-Kahn turned off her tape-recorder and began
assaulting her, touching her breasts and putting his hands in
her mouth and underwear, she said, according to the magazine.
She kicked him and said you''re not going to rape me, then
ran out, got in her car and called her mother, the magazine
quoted her as saying. </p>
<p>EMG Shareholders Seek $8 Billion in Pipeline Damages </p>
<p>Shareholders of East Mediterranean Gas Co. will take legal
action against Egypt, seeking more than $8 billion in damages
for interruptions in natural gas supply through a cross-border
pipeline, a company official said. </p>
<p>The shareholders from Israel, the U.S. and Thailand agreed
on the action in the wake of three explosions in the past five
months that damaged the pipeline, which carries gas from Egypt
to Israel, Nimrod Novik, a member of the EMG board, said
yesterday. The company will pursue the claims through the
International Court of Arbitration, a dispute resolution service
run by the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce. </p>
<p>The lawyers have advised the government of Egypt as well
as the United States and other relevant governments that this
process is under way, Novik said in a telephone interview from
his office in Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv . </p>
<p>Egypt restored gas exports to Israel last week at 20
percent of contracted amounts after a July 4 explosion disrupted
the network. Among the shareholders in EMG are Egypt National
Gas Co., Israeli businessman Yossi Maiman, U.S. billionaire Sam
Zell and PTT Pcl (PTT), Thailand''s biggest energy company. </p>

<p>New Suits </p>
<p>Pfizer Sues Apotex Over Generic Version of Pain Drug Lyrica </p>
<p>Pfizer Inc., the world''s largest drugmaker, accused Apotex
Inc. in a lawsuit of infringing two U.S. patents for the nerve-
pain drug Lyrica. </p>
<p>Apotex, based in Toronto, plans to market a generic version
of Lyrica before the newest patent expires in 2018, Pfizer said
in a complaint filed July 8 in federal court in Wilmington,
Delaware. Pfizer claimed it will be substantially and
irreparably harmed by the alleged infringement. </p>
<p>Lyrica generated more than $800 million in sales in the
first quarter for New York-based Pfizer, which is selling units
and trimming jobs in preparation for pending loss of patent
protection for its best-selling drug Lipitor, used to control
cholesterol. </p>
<p>Elie Betito, a spokesman for closely held Apotex, didn''t
immediately return voice and e-mail messages seeking comment on
the filing. </p>

<p>Nakheel''s Ex-CEO Suing Developer for $3.7 Million in Dues </p>
<p>Nakheel PJSC''s former chief executive officer, Chris
O''Donnell, is suing the developer of palm-shaped islands off
Dubai''s coast for $3.7 million in unpaid dues, interest and
damages. </p>
<p>The CEO, who quit last month after five years at the
developer''s helm, filed the lawsuit in the Dubai World Special
tribunal on June 22, according to a court filing dated June 22
and made available on the court''s website yesterday. </p>
<p>O''Donnell is seeking $3 million in long-term incentives as
well as $290,850 in losses tied to currency fluctuations. He is
also asking Nakheel to pay $180,000 in interest, calculated at
12 percent per year, the documents show. </p>
<p>Nakheel, which is restructuring $13 billion of debt, was
forced to cut hundreds of employees and cancel or delay property
projects after the global credit crisis caused demand in Dubai
to evaporate. Home prices in Dubai dropped more than 60 percent
from their peak in mid-2008. </p>
<p>The former CEO was paid 3.8 million dirhams ($1 million) in
basic annual salary and was given a business class ticket to his
home country of Australia every year, the documents show. </p>

<p>Verdicts/Settlement </p>
<p>Conrad Black Must Go Back to Prison by Sept. 6, Court Says </p>
<p>Conrad M. Black, the former Hollinger International Inc.
chairman and chief executive officer sentenced to serve an
additional year in prison, must report by Sept. 6, a federal
court in Chicago said. </p>
<p>Black''s original 6 1/2-year term was reduced to 3 1/2 years
last month by U.S. District Judge Amy J. St. Eve after the
former newspaper publisher successfully appealed two of three
mail fraud counts of which he was convicted in 2007. </p>
<p>St. Eve, in an order dated July 5 and posted on the court''s
electronic docket yesterday, recommended that Black, 66, be
returned to the low-security prison at Coleman, Florida, where
he spent 29 months before being granted bail last year. </p>
<p>Hollinger International was once the world''s third-biggest
publisher of English-language newspapers. Its publications
included the U.K.''s Daily Telegraph, Canada''s National Post and
the Jerusalem Post. </p>
<p>Black was originally found guilty for his role in the theft
of $6.1 million from the Chicago-based company now known as Sun-
Times Media Group Inc. Convictions overturned on appeal reduced
the total value of the theft to $600,000. </p>
<p>Each court reviewing the case upheld the jury''s finding
that Black obstructed justice when he removed boxes from his
Toronto office that prosecutors said contained documents sought
by the U.S. government. </p>
<p>The U.S. Bureau of Prisons has final say on where Black
will serve the remainder of his punishment. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Black, 05-cr-00727, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago). </p>
<p>Illinois Jobs Now!'' Stimulus Plan Upheld by Top State Court </p>
<p>Illinois Jobs Now!, the $31 billion economic stimulus
package of Governor Pat Quinn, was upheld by the state Supreme
Court in a ruling on the legality of the legislation that
created the program. </p>
<p>The court''s decision yesterday reversed a Jan. 26 ruling by
an intermediate-level appellate panel that held the legislation
creating the plan violated a state constitutional requirement
that bills be limited to a single subject. </p>
<p>What this means is our jobs recovery program can go
forward, full speed ahead, Quinn said yesterday in a televised
press conference. </p>
<p>The lower-court''s ruling derailed projects approved by the
state legislature in 2009 and cast doubt on the future of
economic-development plans that were part of the stimulus
package. </p>
<p>Among those plans were investments in state roads,
railways, schools and broadband Internet access, said Quinn, who
said he wanted to be the builder governor. </p>
<p>The now-overturned decision had also blocked a revenue
stream generated by higher liquor taxes, privatization of the
state lottery and levies on video poker operations. </p>
<p>Objecting to the tax increases, W. Rockwell Wirtz, the
owner of the Chicago Blackhawks hockey team, and his liquor
distributorship, Wirtz Beverage Illinois, sued to block the
program. </p>
<p>The Wirtz group, in an e-mailed statement issued by outside
spokesman by Guy Chipparoni, said while it was disappointed by
the outcome, it respected the court''s opinion. </p>
<p>Our issue was not with the lawmakers, but the law,
Chipparoni said. </p>
<p>The case is Wirtz v. Quinn, 111903, Illinois Supreme Court
(Springfield). </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Citigroup
Inc. (C), which report earnings this week, are under pressure to
show that banks can increase revenue as the U.S. economic
recovery sputters. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, set to announce results tomorrow, may say second-
quarter revenue declined 0.8 percent to $24.9 billion, according
to the average estimates of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Revenue at Citigroup, which reports results a day later, may
fall 10 percent to $19.9 billion, with more than half the
decline tied to assets the company has tagged for sale. </p>
<p>The street is going to be looking at revenue growth
that will be difficult for banks to produce in the current
economic environment, Paul Miller, an analyst with FBR Capital
Markets, said in a phone interview. You need the economy to
work, you need rates to go higher and you need to see continued
improvement in credit. </p>
<p>Boosting profit won''t be enough to impress investors,
according to analysts including Miller, a former examiner at the
Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. They already know that
fewer borrowers are defaulting, allowing banks to bolster profit
with funds that had been set aside for future loan losses. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, led by CEO Jamie Dimon, 55, may say second-
quarter profit climbed 6.2 percent from a year earlier to $5.09
billion according to the average estimate of analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. Citigroup may say profit rose 14 percent from the
same period last year to $3.07 billion. </p>

<p>(Corrects to add Dimon''s title in second paragraph.) </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is winding down
its $154 billion mortgage portfolio to close to zero as the
bank works through mortgage losses and litigation over loan-
servicing and foreclosure practices. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, which has reduced mortgage holdings by $19.3
billion in the past year, will continue shedding assets by about
as much as 15 percent a year forever, Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon told analysts on a conference call after the
New York-based company reported a 13 percent increase in net
income for the second quarter. </p>
<p>It''s going to go down 10 or 15 percent a year until it''s
close to zero, Dimon said in answering a question from Ed Najarian, the head of bank research at International Strategy
and Investment Group in New York. </p>
<p>Mortgage losses and litigation costs continue to weigh on
JPMorgan''s earnings. The company, the second-largest U.S. bank
by assets, added $1.27 billion to its litigation reserves,
mostly for mortgage-related issues, and took a $1 billion charge
in the second quarter to clean up some of its outstanding
foreclosure matters. </p>
<p>Dimon told reporters that the $1 billion charge covered
some of the costs to settle charges by U.S. and state officials
that the bank improperly foreclosed on borrowers. </p>
<p>It will take some time to resolve the mortgage problems
and the bank may face more expenses in the future, Dimon said. </p>
<p>There have been so many flaws in mortgages that it''s just
-- it''s been an unmitigated disaster, Dimon said. We just
really need to clean it up for the sake of everybody. And
everybody is going to sue everybody else and it''s going to go on
for far too long a time. </p>
<p>While the bank will continue originating home-equity loans
at its current pace of $1 billion to $2 billion a quarter, home
loans will never go back to where they were, he said. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is taking
advantage of its stature as the most creditworthy of the largest
U.S. banks with its $1.75 billion sale of 30-year bonds, the
first from an American financial firm in almost six months. </p>
<p>The second-biggest U.S. bank issued the 5.6 percent notes
today to yield 140 basis points, or 1.4 percentage points, more
than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the last U.S. bank to sell
debt with such a long tenor, raised $2.5 billion of the
securities at a spread of 170 basis points on Jan. 21. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the least risky of the six-biggest U.S. banks
based on derivatives prices, tapped the corporate bond market as
issuance revived after being largely shut this month. The New
York-based lender''s better-than-expected earnings helped bolster
confidence in U.S. company debt even after Moody''s Investors
Service threatened to cut its rating on the world''s biggest
economy as negotiations over raising its debt limit faltered. </p>
<p>Coming to the market with a 30-year bond right after
earnings is a show of strength, said Pri de Silva, a New York-
based analyst at CreditSights Inc. By doing it now, they''re
basically getting ahead of any potential uncertainty surround
Treasuries and the debt ceiling negotiations. </p>
<p>Previous Offer </p>
<p>In its previous offering of 30-year debt, JPMorgan sold
$1.25 billion of 5.5 percent bonds on Oct. 14 that paid 165
basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg
data show. The debt traded yesterday at 102.5 cents on the
dollar to pay a spread of 115.2 basis points, according to
Trace, the bond price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. </p>
<p>JPMorgan credit-default swaps, which investors use to hedge
against losses on the company''s debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, climbed 0.6 basis point to 89.4 basis points
after the company reported its highest half-year profit ever, at
$11 billion, according to data provider CMA. The contracts have
fallen from 114.3 basis points on Aug. 31, CMA data show.
investor confidence improves and rise as it deteriorates. </p>
<p>Trading and investment-banking fees bolstered results at
JPMorgan as second-quarter net income rose 13 percent from a
year earlier, to $5.43 billion, or $1.27 a share, six cents
higher than the average estimate of analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Bank Swaps </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps on San Francisco-based Wells Fargo 
Co. (WFC) climbed 2.2 basis points to 98.7, contracts on Bank of
America Corp. rose 2.4 basis points to 171.5, and swaps on
Citigroup Inc. (C) increased 1.8 basis points to 149.6, the data
show. Contracts protecting the debt of Goldman Sachs were little
changed at 147.3 basis points and those on Morgan Stanley (MS)
climbed 1.5 basis point to 174.3, according to CMA, which is
owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in
the privately negotiated market. </p>
<p>Banks have sold $240.5 billion of investment-grade
corporate bonds in the U.S. this year through yesterday, with 98
percent of offerings maturing in 10 years or less, Bloomberg
data show. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is able to issue 30-year debt because it''s going
to generate $20-plus billion of profits in 2011 and 2012, and
has amongst the best balance sheets of all banks, Joel Levington, managing director of corporate credit at Brookfield
Investment Management Inc. in New York, said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>Enticing Investors'' </p>
<p>The company is taking advantage of a difference between
yields on 10-year Treasury notes and 30-year government bonds
that''s twice as big as the average over the last decade,
attracting investors as yields on investment-grade corporate
bonds hover at about the lowest this year, said Anthony Valeri,
market strategist at LPL Financial in San Diego. </p>
<p>It''s a way of issuing debt at an attractive level while
recognizing the curve is enticing investors to buy longer-term
debt, Valeri said in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>The yield gap widened to 130.1 basis points, compared with
a 10-year average of 63.8 basis points, Bloomberg data show.
Investment-grade corporate bonds yielded 3.72 percent, versus a
2011 low of 3.68 percent on June 1, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data. </p>
<p>JPMorgan seems to trade on their reputation, which is
obviously very good, said James Leonard, an analyst at
Morningstar Inc. in Chicago. There''s a belief that U.S. banks
have really gotten a lot of their problems behind them, as
opposed to the Europeans. Whatever their troubles are, they''re
very manageable. </p>

almost $11 billion. Second-quarter net income increased 13
percent from a year earlier, to $5.43 billion, or $1.27 a share,
six cents higher than the average estimate of analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Trading and investment-banking fees bolstered results as
the retail bank labored under bad mortgages, low interest rates
and litigation over loan-servicing and foreclosure practices.
JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, was the
first of the six-largest U.S. banks to report earnings, topping
estimates for the 13th straight quarter, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>They''ve set a high bar for the rest of the industry in a
very difficult environment, Michael Holland, who oversees more
than $4 billion in assets at New York-based Holland  Co., said
in an interview with Bloomberg Radio. The firm''s $26.8 billion
in revenue was a blow-away number, Holland said. </p>

<p>Cumulus Media Inc. (CMLS) increased the
interest rate and changed the structure on $2.04 billion in
loans it''s seeking to back the acquisition of Citadel
Broadcasting Corp. after lenders pushed back against the
original terms. </p>
<p>The U.S. broadcaster cut the size of the first-lien term
loan to $1.25 billion and is now offering a $790 million second-
lien portion, said three people with knowledge of the deal, who
declined to be identified because the transaction is private </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., which is arranging the transaction,
had to rework the financing after loan prices fell in June by
the most since May 2010 amid sovereign-debt concerns that could
threaten the global economic recovery and a growing pipeline of
transactions. Lenders are also demanding higher yields from
transactions such as Cumulus that don''t contain maintenance
covenants. </p>
<p>The market, with the reemergence of the Greece crisis and
worsening economic data, has shifted more neutral, said Marc Gross, who helps oversee $3 billion in fixed-income funds as a
money manager at RS Investments in New York. You needed a
little bit of a correction to help restore sanity to the market
and that''s what''s happening. Sanity is being restored to the
market. </p>
<p>J.P. Hannan, chief financial officer at Atlanta-based
Cumulus, didn''t immediately return a call for comment. </p>
<p>Pricing Terms </p>
<p>Cumulus is offering lenders 4.25 percentage points to 4.5
percentage points more than the London interbank offered rate on
the seven-year, first lien-portion, with a 1.25 percent minimum
on the lending benchmark, the people said. The loan is expected
to price at 99 cents on the dollar, increasing the yield for
lenders. </p>
<p>The 7.5-year, second-lien loan will pay 6 percentage points
over Libor, with a 1.5 percent Libor floor, the people said. The
loan will price at 98.5 cents on the dollar. Commitments from
lenders are due at 12 p.m. New York time on July 19. </p>
<p>The deal was initially offered as a $2.04 billion term loan
that would pay 3.75 percentage points to 4 percentage points
more than Libor, with a 1.25 percent floor on the lending
benchmark, according to two other people familiar with the
transaction. </p>
<p>Cumulus offered to buy Citadel in a deal worth $2.4 billion
to expand its coverage and cut costs, the company said in a
March 10 statement. Cumulus''s leverage, or debt to earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, was
expected to be 5.7 times after the initial $2.04 billion deal
had been completed, according to an April 25 Moody''s Investors
Service report. </p>
<p>Call Protection </p>
<p>The first-lien loan will give lenders a one-year soft-call
protection of 101 cents, meaning Cumulus would have to pay 1
cent more than face value to refinance the debt during the first
year, the people said. The company will not be able to refinance
the second-lien portion during the first year, then can do so at
103 cents on the dollar in the second year, 102 cents in the
third year and 101 cents in the fourth year. </p>
<p>The Standard  Poor''s/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 Index,
which tracks the 100 largest dollar-denominated first-lien
leveraged loans, has dropped 0.81 cents on the dollar to 94.72
cents on the dollar since March 10. The index declined 0.94 cent
in June. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), this year''s
top adviser on corporate takeovers, promoted Larry Slaughter to
co-head of its North American investment banking division,
replacing Jeff Urwin. </p>
<p>Slaughter, based in London and head of corporates for
Europe, the Middle East and Africa, will relocate to New York at
the end of the third quarter, according to a memo. A spokeswoman
for the second-biggest U.S. bank confirmed the appointment
today. He joins Kevin Willsey as head of the unit. </p>
<p>The promotion follows less than a month after Urwin was
appointed global head of investment banking. Slaughter, who
joined JPMorgan more than two decades ago, had helped oversee
European mergers  acquisitions and advised private-equity and
industrial clients, according to the memo. The spokeswoman
declined to say who will replace Slaughter. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, based in New York, is the No. 1 adviser on global
MA this year, providing counsel on $282 billion in
transactions, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The firm
is working with ATT Inc. (T), the second-largest U.S. wireless
carrier, on its $39 billion bid for Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)''s T-
Mobile USA Inc. unit, the biggest transaction of the year,
Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Slaughter has been based in London since 1992. He has
advised on the sale of Chrysler by DaimlerChrysler, moisturizer-
ingredient maker Cognis Holding GmbH''s sale to to BASF SE (BAS) and on
the acquisition of British drugstore chain Alliance Boots
Holdings Ltd. by KKR  Co. </p>
<p>Separately, the company said today that second-quarter net
income rose 13 percent, more than analysts projected, partly
because of surging profit at the investment-banking unit. Fees
from underwriting stocks and bonds boosted investment-banking
earnings to $2.06 billion, or 38 percent of the total. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, was
the most profitable bank in 2010, with a record $17.4 billion in
earnings. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) listed about
$2.5 billion in second-quarter costs tied to cleaning up faulty
mortgages and foreclosures as the industry tries to quell
concern over lending practices. </p>
<p>The bank added $1.27 billion to litigation reserves, mostly
for mortgage-related matters, and incurred $1 billion of
expenses tied to foreclosures, according to a slide show
accompanying today''s quarterly earnings report. Repurchase
losses were $223 million, according to the New York-based
company, which ranks second by assets among U.S. banks. </p>
<p>Lenders are struggling to stanch losses tied to home loans
that were based on missing or wrong data about borrowers and
properties, and are facing probes of foreclosures that may have
used falsified documents. Some banks have bought back soured
mortgages sold to investors, with JPMorgan saying today it has
$3.3 billion in costs so far on repurchases from government-
backed firms such as Fannie Mae. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s additional litigation reserve may help cover
fees and assessments related to foreclosure delays and
payments for other settlements, including probes by the U.S.
Department of Justice and the state attorneys general, the bank
said. Litigation reserves also cover projected costs tied to so-
called private-label mortgage bonds that may have contained
faulty loans, the lender said. </p>
<p>Washington Mutual </p>
<p>The reserves aren''t earmarked for liabilities from loans
made by Washington Mutual, the lender acquired after it
collapsed during the financial crisis. JPMorgan said those
liabilities are the responsibility of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., adding that the FDIC has contested this
position. </p>
<p>The outstanding balance of those loans related to
Washington Mutual was approximately $70 billion as of March 31,
with about $24 billion overdue by 60 days or more, according to
the company''s first-quarter regulatory filing. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s second-quarter net income climbed 13 percent to
$5.43 billion as investment banking profit surged and more
customers paid credit cards on time, the company said today. The
lender advanced $1.44, or 3.6 percent, to $41.06 at 9:31 a.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The bank declined 6.6
percent this year through yesterday. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) unseated
Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) as Europe''s top underwriter of high-yield bonds
in the first half. </p>
<p>The six-month income surge gives Goldman Sachs an edge as
high-yield issuance starts to slow amid Europe''s spreading
sovereign debt crisis. The U.S. bank underwrote 10.6 percent of
the record $54 billion of deals in the first half, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Deutsche Bank fell to second place. </p>
<p>Underwriters made a lot of fees in the first half, said
Janet Tavakoli, founder of Chicago-based Tavakoli Structured
Finance Inc., a financial consulting firm. The high-yield bond
rally isn''t sustainable, certainly not in Europe. Now that we
have a lot of uncertainty and a little bit of panic in Europe,
investors are going to avoid these high-yield deals. You could
have impaired earnings for a long time. </p>
<p>High-yield issuance froze this week amid rising concern
European policy makers will fail to stave off a Greek default
and limit contagion to the rest of the region. Investors demand
50 basis points more than at the start of July to buy European
speculative-grade bonds, a premium to government debt of 620
basis points, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index shows. </p>
<p>We''ve seen some significant weakness in performance of
late in line with growth fears and the general risk-off trend as
a result of the Greek crisis, said Suki Mann, London-based
senior credit strategist at Societe Generale SA. Mann expects a
decline in second-half issuance to 19 billion euros ($27
billion) from 26 billion euros in the first half. Moody''s
Investors Service tallied $58 billion of sales in the first half
and expects full-year volume to surpass 2010''s record $65
billion, according to a report today. </p>
<p>Fees </p>
<p>European underwriters, which don''t report fees on
individual deals, typically charge issuers at least 2.5 percent
of a high-yield borrowing, according to Tavakoli. High-yield, or
junk, debt is rated below Baa3 by Moody''s Investors Service and
BBB- by Standard  Poor''s. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs reported $1.2 billion in revenue from debt
underwriting in 2010, flat to 2009. The bank was seventh among
European junk bond underwriters last year, Bloomberg data show.
It was last No. 1 in the second half of 2003. </p>
<p>The high-yield product serves as a very good tool to help
us in client-acquisition efforts, said Denis Coleman, head of
credit finance for EMEA at the New-York-based bank. We have an
expectation of a longer-term shift in favor of institutionally
raised debt capital in lieu of more traditional bank finance. </p>
<p>Loan Surge </p>
<p>Goldman managed 33 deals in the first half of the year,
including Boparan Group''s $1.1 billion sale of euro- and pound-
denominated bonds in April, Bloomberg data show. The bank also
managed a 250 million-pound ($400 million) issue for U.K. budget
clothing retailer Matalan Group Ltd. </p>
<p>Deutsche Bank led a 67 percent increase in leveraged loans
in Europe, displacing Goldman Sachs as the top arranger.
Issuance of debt mostly used for private-equity led takeovers
jumped to $78 billion in the first half, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>We are living in times of volatility but we will continue
to see decent loan and bond volumes through the second half of
this year, said Nick Jansa, European head of leveraged debt
and capital markets at the Frankfurt-based firm. </p>
<p>Deutsche Bank helped Continental AG (CON), Europe''s second-
largest car-parts maker, cut its borrowing costs by arranging
565 million euros of loans to help refinance about 6 billion
euros of debt stemming from a 2007 acquisition of Siemens AG''s
VDO unit. </p>
<p>We felt that the timing was right because we didn''t know
how secure the market conditions would be in the course of 2011
and afterwards, said Stefan Scholz, group treasurer of
Continental, based in Hannover, Germany. Due to the euro-zone
sovereign crisis, it is not possible to predict. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)''s shareholders
deserve the kind of dividends paid by utilities, telephone
companies and cigarette makers, according to a hedge-fund
manager cited by Whitney Tilson, a managing director of T2
Partners LLC. </p>
<p>The manager recommended that the world''s largest software
maker more than double its annual payout, to $1.48 a share, in a
letter to Microsoft''s board last month. Tilson, whose funds also
own shares, published the correspondence on the Seeking Alpha
financial website two days ago without naming the writer. </p>
<p>The CHART OF THE DAY shows the projected dividend yield for
Microsoft since 2006, three years after the Redmond, Washington-
based company began making payouts. The chart also provides the
comparable yield on the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s 2.4 percent estimated yield as of yesterday
would have been 5.6 percent with the higher payout. The latter
figure is in line with projections for Pepco Holdings Inc. (POM), the
SP 500''s highest-yielding utility; ATT Inc. (T), the biggest U.S.
provider of phone service, and Altria Group Inc. (MO), the country''s
largest cigarette producer. </p>
<p>The unnamed manager, who wrote that his funds have owned
Microsoft since 2006 and had more than 11 million shares at the
time of the letter, called on the board to pay out all the cash
generated in the U.S. and available to investors as dividends. </p>
<p>There were three more recommendations made in the letter:
selling $40 billion of debt, buying back shares with funds from
the bond sale, and borrowing against cash generated outside the
U.S. for additional stock repurchases. The investor estimated
that Microsoft would reach the high $30s if all of them were
adopted. The stock closed yesterday at $26.63. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley, which last year
missed an internal trading-revenue target by more than 40
percent, is under pressure to show improvement after a two-year
effort to turn around the firm''s fixed-income trading business. </p>
<p>The fixed-income unit failed to deliver on a promised
revenue increase last year, leading to the missed target,
according to a person with direct knowledge of the figures. It
has been beset by management turnover, weak markets, bad bets
and a struggle to win back clients lost when the firm retrenched
during the financial crisis, according to interviews with nine
current and former executives who requested anonymity because
they weren''t authorized to speak. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, 53, is looking to
prove to investors this week when results are reported that the
firm is advancing toward his goal of boosting market share in
fixed-income trading by 2 percentage points. With the stock down
69 percent since 2006 to $21.09 last week, Colm Kelleher and Ken deRegt, both 20-year veterans of the company, aim to succeed at
a task that has taken down three senior executives. </p>
<p>I''m absolutely surprised at how slow it has been, said
Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. who has a
buy rating on the firm''s shares and is a former Morgan
Stanley treasurer. I''d love to tell you what the trajectory is
going to be, but I don''t know how rapidly one can come back. </p>
<p>Second-Quarter Results </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) has made some progress. About 70 percent of
clients in a Greenwich Associates survey reported using the New
York-based firm as a fixed-income dealer last year, up from 56
percent in 2009. The company said revenue at its interest-rates
unit climbed 10 percent in the first quarter from a year
earlier, while total revenue in that business for the 10 largest
U.S. and European banks fell about 11 percent, according to
London-based research firm Coalition Development Ltd. </p>
<p>More evidence of progress may come July 21, when the bank
announces second-quarter results. While Citigroup Inc. and
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) both reported that fixed-income trading
revenue dropped at least 18 percent from the first quarter,
Fiona Swaffield, an RBC Capital Markets analyst, and David Trone
at JMP Securities expect Morgan Stanley to post fixed-income
revenue of $1.9 billion, little changed from the first three
months of the year. That would represent a market-share gain. </p>
<p>The bank may reap $200 million in the second quarter from
hedges against monoline insurers, including MBIA Inc., after
$318 million of losses in the first quarter, Howard Chen, a
Credit Suisse Group AG analyst, said in a note last month. </p>
<p>Mary Claire Delaney, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley in New
York, declined to comment on the firm''s fixed-income business. </p>
<p>Falling Behind </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley fell behind rivals in 2009 as fixed-income
trading became the dominant capital-markets business for the
largest global banks. Fixed-income units include banks'' trading
in government and corporate bonds, currencies, commodities,
mortgage-backed securities, interest-rate swaps, credit-default
swaps and other derivatives. </p>
<p>Fixed income, currencies and commodities, or FICC, has
topped combined revenue from equities trading and investment
banking at the biggest banks in each of the past two years. It
also has a pretax margin of about 25 percent, almost double that
of equity trading, according to Hintz. </p>
<p>The firm had a market share based on revenue of about 6.5
percent among the top nine U.S. and European investment banks
last year, up from about 5.5 percent in 2009 and down from about
9 percent in 2006, according to an April report by Glenn Schorr,
a Nomura Holdings Inc. analyst. That dropped to 6 percent in the
first quarter, according to RBC''s Swaffield. Both analysts
excluded losses and gains tied to the banks'' own debt, known as
debt-valuation adjustments, or DVAs. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, Goldman </p>
<p>JPMorgan had the largest market share last year, with 14.9
percent, while Citigroup, London-based Barclays Plc and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) each had more than 13 percent, Swaffield wrote
in a June note. JPMorgan and Citigroup both reported results
last week. Goldman is scheduled to announce them tomorrow and
Barclays on Aug. 2. </p>
<p>Gorman, an Australian and former McKinsey  Co. consultant
who previously led the firm''s wealth-management business, has
put forward a strategy that relies more on Morgan Stanley''s
17,000-plus brokers and less on principal risk-taking. Still, he
has called repairing the fixed-income unit his priority. </p>
<p>Kelleher, 54, an accountant at Arthur Andersen LLP before
joining Morgan Stanley in 1989 as a fixed-income salesman, took
charge of trading after Gorman ousted Mitch Petrick in late
2009. Kelleher, the firm''s chief financial officer during the
crisis, has overseen a rebound in the equities business, which
last year topped all U.S. rivals except Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>Optimistic Goals </p>
<p>Gorman and Kelleher have set optimistic goals for the
turnaround. Kelleher''s 2010 trading-revenue target that the
division missed was about $26 billion, $10 billion more than the
firm produced in 2009, and executives pushed for him to lower
his 2011 fixed-income target by as much as $3 billion, according
to two executives who left the bank this year. Delaney, the
spokeswoman, declined to make Kelleher available for comment. </p>
<p>Gorman laid out his plan for a 2 percentage-point increase
in February, which would bring the firm''s market share among the
top nine banks to 8.5 percent, according to Schorr''s figures.
That came almost a year after he set a 15 percent pretax profit-
margin goal for the firm''s brokerage, a target executives said
five months later they wouldn''t hit. </p>
<p>This management team tends to put out somewhat lofty
targets, said Shannon Stemm, an analyst at Edward Jones  Co.
in St. Louis who rates the stock a buy. I don''t think they
need to get to 2 percent at all. The market has pretty
pessimistic expectations for this company, and if we can see any
improvement, it will be applauded. </p>
<p>Fixing FICC </p>
<p>The effort to fix FICC began two years ago, when then-CEO
John Mack, who started at Morgan Stanley as a bond salesman in
1972, vowed to close the gap with competitors. The bank reported
$5 billion less FICC revenue than each of its U.S. rivals in the
first half of 2009 as it cut risk after a near-collapse in 2008
during the financial crisis. </p>
<p>The firm announced plans to increase hiring for its client-
flow units, which focus on buying and selling securities for
customers and had been shunned before the credit crisis as Mack,
66, focused on proprietary trading and the securitization
business. It also brought in Jack DiMaio to run interest-rates,
bond and currency trading with then-president Walid Chammah, 57,
deeming him ideally suited to turn around the business. </p>
<p>Played Baseball </p>
<p>DiMaio, 44, a Long Island native who played baseball at New
York Technical College, made his name at Credit Suisse First
Boston, from which he defected to Barclays in 2001 with his 43-
member team, only to be lured back a day later by a contract
guaranteeing the group $300 million over three years. DiMaio
worked under Mack at Credit Suisse and later started his own
credit hedge fund. </p>
<p>Mack and Chammah hired DiMaio to replace Roberto Hoornweg,
43, without letting Gorman and Kelleher, then co-president and
CFO of the firm, interview DiMaio, three people said. </p>
<p>The bank wasn''t alone in its effort to push further into
the client-trading business in 2009. UBS AG (UBSN) and Credit Suisse,
both based in Zurich, were also increasing staff after
recovering from the financial crisis. As competitors increased
their presence, opportunities diminished, analysts said. </p>
<p>That was an unusually profitable year in FICC, one which
we may never see again, said Frank Feenstra, managing director
at consulting firm Greenwich Associates in Stamford,
Connecticut. The pie was very large, and the number of firms
able to take a sizable slice out of that pie was pretty small
because some firms had just come through a very difficult period
and others were just not geared up for that kind of business. </p>
<p>The turnaround didn''t show the desired results in 2010, as
Morgan Stanley posted less than half the fixed-income trading
revenue of its biggest U.S. rivals for the second straight year. </p>
<p>Long Memories'' </p>
<p>The problem is that clients have long memories, said
Hintz, the Sanford Bernstein analyst, who is based in New York.
If you''re no longer the first button on a phone, it takes a
long time to become the first button. </p>
<p>As 2010 ended, DiMaio and Kelleher clashed over the unit''s
2011 revenue target, as well as compensation for fixed-income
traders, according to two people. Kelleher, who moved to London
from New York this year, and Gorman also lost confidence in
DiMaio''s ability to improve performance at his unit, two former
executives said. DiMaio declined to comment. </p>
<p>DiMaio had a background in credit trading, which includes
trading in corporate bonds, and less experience with interest
rates and foreign exchange, three executives said. </p>
<p>DiMaio Departs </p>
<p>In January, DiMaio left Morgan Stanley with plans to start
his own firm, according to two people. He was replaced by
deRegt, the firm''s chief risk officer. DeRegt, 55, was head of
fixed-income trading from the time of Morgan Stanley''s 1997
merger with Dean Witter until he departed in 2000. Mack brought
deRegt back to the firm in 2008 to help manage risk after losses
from a fixed-income proprietary bet. </p>
<p>DeRegt, who was Kelleher''s boss in the 1990s, has been
given more autonomy than DiMaio, two of the people said. While
deRegt has strong backing from Gorman, some employees point out
that he hasn''t run a trading group since 2000, four people said. </p>
<p>David Moore, global head of the structured interest-rates
unit who had been at Morgan Stanley for more than 20 years, was
pushed out in January, and the firm brought in Glenn Hadden from
rival Goldman Sachs as global head of the interest-rates
business, which includes trading of Treasuries, inflation-
protected bonds and interest-rate swaps. </p>
<p>This is the first time that I have felt comfortable with
the leadership across all of our fixed-income businesses,
Gorman said on a conference call with analysts in April.
You''ve got to have that ability at the top, and the investment
we made in hiring people combined with the leadership at the top
I think is what''s starting to move the needle. </p>
<p>More Confident'' </p>
<p>The management turnover meant that the business has been
under three heads of fixed-income trading and two leaders of
overall trading in the past two years. </p>
<p>It''s hard when you have a vision and you''re trying to
execute a strategy, and then the people creating that at the top
continue to turn over, said Stemm, the Edward Jones analyst.
Gorman is finally comfortable with the leadership in place, so
I''m a little more confident that we''re through that at this
point and maybe they can move forward. </p>
<p>The lack of improvement in trading has helped drive down
the firm''s share price, analysts including Stemm and Hintz said.
Morgan Stanley''s shares have dropped 26 percent in the past two
years, while the Standard  Poor''s 500 Financials Index is up 21
percent. Morgan Stanley trades at 34 percent below book value
and 23 percent below tangible book value. </p>
<p>The shares fell 40 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $20.69 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the lowest
closing price since March 2009. </p>
<p>Mitsubishi UFJ </p>
<p>The bank''s largest shareholder isn''t losing faith. </p>
<p>It''s a kind of change of the platform of the business,
and you cannot make it in a few months time, Nobuyuki Hirano,
deputy president of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., which
owns 22 percent of the U.S. firm, and the Japanese bank''s
representative on Morgan Stanley''s board until May, said in an
interview this month. It takes a few years, and that we''ve
been aware of since the beginning. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s lagging performance predated the crisis in
interest-rates and foreign-exchange businesses and was masked by
the firm''s strength in commodities, two former executives said. </p>
<p>While the company doesn''t break out revenue for the
businesses within the fixed-income unit, it''s among the top
three firms in commodities, credit sales and trading, Gorman
told investors in February. The bank is looking to gain market
share in interest rates, where it increased headcount by about
20 percent, and foreign exchange, where it expanded staffing by
40 percent, he said. </p>
<p>Flow Monsters'' </p>
<p>The macro space -- rates, foreign exchange and emerging
markets -- has pockets that are doing very well and pockets that
are not, Gorman said at the time. There are enormous
opportunities, and we''ve been investing in that space, in
headcount and in our technology. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley aims to increase share in a business
dominated by large commercial banks. JPMorgan, Barclays and
Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank AG, dubbed flow monsters in
the market, handle more than one-third of the volume in the
interest-rate, bond, securitization and emerging-markets
businesses, according to Greenwich Associates data. Clients are
increasing the number of dealers they do business with after
cutting back during the crisis, the consulting firm said. </p>
<p>Interest-rates products make up about 80 percent of fixed-
income volume for all banks, according to Greenwich Associates,
which tracks currency trading separately. Those trades are often
lower-margin deals: The category accounts for less than a
quarter of client revenue, the consulting firm''s data show. </p>
<p>Making Bets </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s low market share in the interest-rates
business has not only reduced fees earned from executing client
trades, it also has hindered the firm''s effectiveness in making
bets, according to three people familiar with the market.
Dealers benefit from knowledge about client flows and sharing
ideas with buy-side traders, the people said. </p>
<p>We believe that where we have insight like commodities,
we can position risk of a proprietary nature on the back of
those client flows, Kelleher said in 2008 as he discussed
exiting some proprietary-trading businesses. </p>
<p>Whether Morgan Stanley and other banks will be allowed to
continue taking proprietary positions depends on how regulators
write regulations designed to enforce the Volcker rule, which
bars banks from trading for their own accounts. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley may have seen the downside of such bets. The
bank''s interest-rates trading group lost at least tens of
millions of dollars in the second quarter on a wager on U.S.
inflation expectations, which the firm has been unwinding, two
people said last month, declining to be identified because the
transaction isn''t public. </p>
<p>Short Sales </p>
<p>Traders at the bank bet that inflation expectations for the
next five years would rise, while forecasts for the next 30
years would fall, according to the people. Such wagers on so-
called breakeven rates involve paired purchases and short sales
of Treasuries and Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, or
TIPS, in both maturities. Delaney, the Morgan Stanley
spokeswoman, declined to comment on the reported loss. </p>
<p>Even with the missteps, Morgan Stanley has made headway in
areas where it previously trailed peers, including hedge-fund
relations, risk management and technology. </p>
<p>Hedge Funds </p>
<p>The bank has improved relationships with its hedge-fund
clients in an effort led by Kevin Dunleavy, 51, who was hired by
DiMaio from Bank of America Corp. in 2009 after spending 28
years at Merrill Lynch  Co., where he held a similar job,
according to two hedge-fund clients. It has also strengthened
its presence in interest-rates and bond trading, while still
lagging rivals in derivatives, one of the clients said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley also has taken more risk to support clients
and make markets after cutting its balance sheet almost in half
to $626 billion of assets in the first quarter of 2009. Its
assets were $836 billion as of March 31. </p>
<p>The firm''s trading value-at-risk, or VaR, an estimate of
how much the company could lose in securities markets in one
day, went from less than half that of Goldman Sachs in the first
two quarters of 2009 to more than its rival''s in each of the
past four periods. </p>
<p>The increased risk-taking has been accompanied by more
stringent risk management, CFO Ruth Porat said at an investor
presentation in June. The firm hired 200 people in its risk-
management group from January 2009 to April 2011, she said. It
also increased the number of trading limits, better matched the
maturities of its assets and introduced a stressed VaR measure. </p>
<p>Exceeding VaR </p>
<p>The bank had only one day in 2009 and 2010 when trading
losses exceeded VaR estimates. Over the 19 months from June 2007
through the end of 2008, trading losses exceeded VaR limits on
36 days, or about 9 percent of the time. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s effort to catch rivals in technology and
electronic trading are being led by Dexter Senft, hired last
year as head of e-commerce for the fixed-income unit from
Barclays. He held a similar position at Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. and was chairman of LiquidityHub Ltd., a company set up by
banks in 2006 to make it easier to trade fixed-income products
electronically by aggregating prices. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley started an application in 2009 called
Matrix, which provided clients with research, analytics, live
prices and trading capability for some fixed-income products. </p>
<p>Foreign Exchange </p>
<p>Electronic foreign-exchange trading volume with Morgan
Stanley has tripled since 2009, and revenue is four times
greater, Porat said at the June investor conference. Electronic
trading volume in the interest-rates business has increased at a
compound annual rate of 60 percent, said Porat, 53. </p>
<p>We expect an increase in electronic volumes in fixed-
income as Dodd-Frank is implemented, and we have been
positioning ourselves for the change, Porat told investors. </p>
<p>Most large dealers are investing heavily in electronic
trading as clients use it to trade more investment-grade debt
and interest-rate products, Greenwich Associates'' Feenstra said.
About 53 percent of customer accounts trade electronically, and
online trading makes up 43 percent of that volume, an increase
from 38 percent a year earlier, he said. </p>
<p>If you want to gain more traction with clients and gain
more share, that''s in some ways a relatively easy, though maybe
expensive from a PL perspective, way of increasing your
footprint, Feenstra said. It may be great to add
relationships and do more volume, but it may not be the most
profitable business. </p>
<p>Smaller Pool </p>
<p>While Morgan Stanley gained market share in 2010, it was
taking from a smaller pool. Fixed-income revenue at the top nine
global investment banks fell to $101 billion last year from a
record $146 billion in 2009. It dropped 17 percent to $32.1
billion in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to
Schorr and Swaffield. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s attempts to gain share have been hindered
by turnover, both at the top ranks and on the trading desks.
Hiring was interrupted by a freeze in the second half of 2010. </p>
<p>Seven of the top interest-rate traders, including Moore,
have left the firm over the past year. Six of them -- Richard Armes, Joeri Jacobs, Barry Piafsky, Vito Santoro, Colin Teichholtz and James Watson -- have landed at hedge funds.
Armes, Watson and Santoro all joined Brevan Howard Asset
Management LLP, one of Morgan Stanley''s biggest clients. </p>
<p>Pariente, Gaubert </p>
<p>The firm hired Olivier Pariente and Julien Gaubert last
year from BNP Paribas for the interest-rate swaps desk. The pair
has improved the bank''s swaps technology and analytic systems
and has been more aggressive in trading, according to one
executive. Hadden has also increased Morgan Stanley''s presence
in the interest-rate markets, three people said. </p>
<p>The bank is expecting its performance to improve as
problems from the credit crisis recede. Those issues include
clients viewing the firm as a weaker counterparty than
competitors as well as the losses related to monoline insurers
that have cost the company more than $1 billion since the
beginning of 2010. </p>
<p>The conversion of Mitsubishi UFJ''s preferred stake to
common shares will increase confidence in the firm as a
counterparty, Porat said last month. Morgan Stanley also may
benefit from the move of many derivatives to central
clearinghouses, which would eliminate credit-risk differences
between dealers because the clearinghouse would hold collateral
against trades. </p>
<p>Tremendous'' Opportunity </p>
<p>The opportunity for the firm''s shares to benefit from a
successful turnaround is tremendous as it would help drive
the stock price back to book value, said Roger Freeman, an
analyst at Barclays Capital Inc. in New York. Still, the market
is likely going to be skeptical until increased revenue and
decreased revenue volatility is the norm, he said. </p>
<p>We''d like to see three or four quarters of outperformance
to really make a market-share case, Freeman said. You can
outperform for one quarter or maybe a couple if you''ve deployed
capital a little more aggressively or some of your principal
positions went your way. The actual flow captured is going to be
the more sustainable piece. We haven''t seen it yet. </p>

Group Inc. (8306), according to a person briefed on the discussions. </p>
<p>Tamakoshi, the former chairman of Mitsubishi UFJ, will

<p>Mitsubishi UFJ converted $7.8 billion of outstanding

Stanley to 22 percent and gave the bank a second board seat. </p>
<p>Tamakoshi, 64, was chairman of Mitsubishi UFJ when it took
a $9 billion stake in Morgan Stanley as the investment bank''s
shares plunged in the wake of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.''s
September 2008 collapse. Nobuyuki Hirano, deputy president of

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) sold $2 billion of five-year notes at a lower interest
rate than it got in December after reporting second-quarter
sales that beat analysts'' estimates. </p>
<p>The world''s biggest computer-services provider issued $2
billion of 1.95 percent notes that yield 65 basis points more
than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. IBM last raised five-year debt in December with $1
billion of 2 percent notes that paid a 55 basis-point spread,
Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Higher-than-estimated results at companies led by Armonk,
New York-based IBM helped bolster investor confidence in U.S.
corporate debt by the most this month. It said yesterday that
second-quarter sales were $26.7 billion, topping the $25.4
billion average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>IBM is showing that it has been a very positive quarter
for them, said Jody Lurie, a corporate credit analyst at
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia. Today''s issuance
shows the company taking advantage of a cheap rate, she
said. </p>
<p>The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, dropped 2.9 basis points to a
mid-price of 96.1 basis points as of 4:59 p.m. in New York,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd. That''s the
biggest decline since June 30. The credit swaps index typically
falls when investor confidence improves. </p>
<p>Taking Advantage'' </p>
<p>Proceeds may be used for general corporate purposes, IBM
said today in a regulatory filing. The company has $21.7 billion
in long-term debt and $8.5 billion of short-term debt as of
March 31, according to the filing. It''s raised $11.5 billion of
bonds in the past two years, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>The company could be taking advantage of the market
conditions to refinance short-term debt to extend maturities and
management may want to add to its robust liquidity level to
provide additional cushion for shareholder rewards, buybacks,
dividends, while implementing its strategic growth
initiatives, Lurie said. </p>
<p>IBM plans to spend about $20 billion on dividends and $50
billion buying back stock through 2015, IBM said at an investor
meeting in March. Its quarterly payout will rise 15 percent to
75 cents a share, the company said in an April 26 statement. IBM
added $8 billion to its stock-repurchase plan, bringing the
total authorized by the board to $12.7 billion. </p>
<p>They''re a company that people like to have, they are very
global, Lurie said. </p>
<p>Debt Rankings </p>
<p>The company is graded Aa3 by Moody''s Investors Service and
a step lower at A+ by Standard  Poor''s. </p>
<p>Investors have shied away from longer-term bonds as the
combination of sovereign debt crises and U.S. Federal Reserve
actions to bolster the economy increase the likelihood of faster
inflation. The gap in relative yields on U.S. corporate debt due
in one to three years against that due in seven to 10 years
reached 74 basis points last month, the widest since 2001,
before narrowing to 73 basis points yesterday, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data show. </p>
<p>The yield on the benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond may
rise to 4.8 percent by mid 2012 from about 4.3 percent
currently, according to the median estimate of 49 economists and
strategists surveyed by Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>Not many investors feel confident in jumping in on the
long end, said Rajeev Sharma, a money manager in New York at
First Investors Management Co., where he helps oversee $1.5
billion of investment-grade debt. Rates are still expected to
go up. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world''s largest
soft-drink maker, said second-quarter profit rose 18 percent as
sales in Latin America and Asia gained. </p>
<p>Net income advanced to $2.8 billion, or $1.20 a share, from
$2.37 billion, or $1.02, a year earlier, the Atlanta-based
company said today in a statement. Excluding some items, profit
was $1.17 a share, topping the $1.16 average of 14 analysts''
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent has built new plants in
emerging markets and pushed more profitable package sizes
overseas to help offset limited U.S. pricing gains this year.
Second-quarter net operating revenue climbed 13 percent in Latin
America and 15 percent in Coke''s Eurasia and Africa division. </p>
<p>The surprise is not that international markets grew but
the rate at which they grew, Philip Gorham, a senior equity
analyst for Morningstar Inc. in Chicago, said today in an
interview. Coke is investing in distribution in emerging
markets and gaining points of sale. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola rose $2.20, or 3.3 percent, to $69.32 at 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
gained 5.4 percent this year, while PepsiCo Inc. increased 4.9
percent. </p>
<p>Total sales rose 47 percent to $12.7 billion, helped by
last year''s acquisition of the company''s largest distributor.
The average estimate of 11 analysts was $12.4 billion. </p>
<p>Volume sales in China grew 21 percent. The company is
attempting to boost profit there by introducing smaller packages
that fetch more revenue per ounce and are more affordable. </p>
<p>More Choice'' </p>
<p>The consumer is telling us they want more choice, Kent
said today in an interview. We''ve been implementing this
successfully in Latin America and in parts of Eurasia but not
everywhere. </p>
<p>The Japan earthquake and tsunami will cut full-year
earnings per share by as much as 5 cents, more than the 2 cents
to 4 cents forecast last quarter, according to the statement. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola boosted sales volume in North America by 4
percent, helped by new distribution of Dr. Pepper brands
acquired in Coca-Cola''s purchase of its largest bottler last
year. </p>
<p>The company said it will increase drink pricing in its
North American market by 3 percent to 4 percent in the second
half of the year after boosting it by 1 percent to 2 percent in
the quarter. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola repeated a forecast that commodity costs for the
year may rise by as much as $700 million. The increase is fueled
by the higher cost of oil-based plastics used in bottles, as
well as rising costs for metals, sweeteners and fruit for juice. </p>
<p>PepsiCo said in April it planned to raise prices on food
and beverages to help make up for higher costs for corn,
packaging plastic and other commodities. PepsiCo, which gets
about two-thirds of sales come from snacks, has said total
commodity costs may increase $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion this
year, from a base of $18 billion. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is dropping out of
the bidding for Hulu LLC, the online video service put up for
sale by its media-company owners, according to a person with
knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, told Hulu
executives last week it wouldn''t continue into a second round,
said the person, who wasn''t authorized to talk publicly. The
person didn''t rule out Microsoft re-entering later. </p>
<p>Hulu bankers at Morgan Stanley (MS) and Guggenheim Partners met
in the past four weeks with Microsoft, which already rents and
sells films and TV shows through its Xbox video-game console, to
solicit an offer, people with knowledge of the situation said on
July 1. The bankers also met with Google Inc. (GOOG), Yahoo Inc., ATT
Inc. (T) and as many as eight other companies, they said. </p>
<p>Elisa Schreiber, a spokeswoman for Los Angeles-based Hulu,
declined to comment, as did Frank Shaw, a spokesman for
Microsoft. </p>
<p>Yahoo would pay up to $2 billion for Hulu with four or five
years of exclusive access to current TV shows and older movies,
the Business Insider website reported, citing a person it didn''t
identify. </p>
<p>Hulu plans to offer suitors five years of access to shows
from its media-company owners, Walt Disney Co. (DIS), News Corp. (NWSA) and
Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)''s NBC Universal, including two years of
exclusivity, two people with knowledge of the situation said
yesterday. </p>
<p>Details of the rights, similar to terms Hulu''s owners
considered for an earlier share sale, and other financial data
will be provided to bidders who sign a non-disclosure agreement,
two people said. Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), based in Seattle, is unlikely
to bid without guarantees of access to shows, one person said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the U.S.
bank that makes most of its money from trading, said it will cut
about 1,000 jobs after a plunge in fixed-income revenue that was
bigger than analysts estimated. </p>
<p>Second-quarter fees from trading debt, currencies and
commodities tumbled 63 percent from the previous quarter, more
than twice the drop at other major U.S. banks. Net income was
$1.09 billion, or $1.85 per share, the New York-based company
said today in a statement, falling short of the $2.30 per-share
average estimate of 23 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman Sachs last year ceded its dominant position
among fixed-income traders to larger rival JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
In the second quarter of 2011, Goldman Sachs cut risk-taking to
the lowest level since 2006. Debt-trading revenue of $1.6
billion dropped below JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s $4.28 billion,
Citigroup Inc.''s $3.03 billion and Bank of America Corp.''s $2.7
billion. </p>
<p>It''s clear that Goldman underperformed many of its
peers, said Richard Staite, an analyst at Atlantic Equities
LLP in London, who has a neutral rating on the stock. It
seems to have prompted them into a cost-saving initiative. </p>
<p>The firm identified annual cost savings of $1.2 billion
that will include about 1,000 job cuts this year, Chief
Financial Officer David A. Viniar told analysts during a
conference call after earnings were released. Goldman Sachs
employed 35,500 people at the end of June, up 100 people from
the prior quarter. </p>
<p>Foreseeable Future'' </p>
<p>It looks like the environment''s going to be somewhat
slower for the foreseeable future and so we decided it made
sense at this point to cut some level of expenses to be more
efficient, said Viniar, who turned 56 years old today. </p>
<p>Job cuts will be broad based and are likely to affect
both junior and senior employees, he said, adding that Goldman
Sachs''s plans to grow in countries such as China, India and
Brazil, where the firm has been doing the most rapid hiring,
won''t be affected. </p>
<p>Operating expenses in the second quarter totaled $5.67
billion, down 28 percent from $7.85 billion in the first quarter
and 23 percent below the $7.39 billion in the second quarter of
2010. Compensation expenses fell 39 percent from the first
quarter to $3.2 billion. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs fell $2.73, or 2.1 percent, to $126.61 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading at 2:04 p.m. The stock, at
its lowest level since April 2009, has dropped about 25 percent
this year. </p>
<p>Net Income </p>
<p>Net income climbed 77 percent from the same period a year
earlier, and earnings fell 38 percent if one-time costs are
excluded from the 2010 results. Last year''s second-quarter
earnings were reduced by a $550 million settlement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission and a $600 million expense to
pay a U.K. tax on employee bonuses. </p>
<p>Analysts in the Bloomberg survey lowered their earnings
estimates by an average of $1.09 per share in the past four
weeks. </p>
<p>Revenue fell 39 percent to $7.28 billion from $11.9 billion
in the first quarter and $8.84 billion a year earlier. The
figure fell short of the average $8.2 billion estimate of 15
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Return on equity, a measure of
how well the firm reinvests shareholder funds, decreased to 6.1
percent from 12.2 percent in the first quarter. </p>
<p>No Rebound </p>
<p>We''ve had four relatively weak quarters in a row, and I
think it''s now quite clear that the difficult environment is
going to be continued throughout the remainder of this year,
Atlantic Equities'' Staite said. I''d be pretty surprised if we
see a marked rebound any time in the near term. </p>
<p>Overall revenue from trading, run since February 2008 by
Edward K. Eisler, David B. Heller, Pablo J. Salame and Harvey M. Schwartz, fell 47 percent to $3.52 billion from $6.65 billion in
the first quarter and was down 29 percent from $4.98 billion in
the second quarter of 2010. </p>
<p>Certain of our businesses had disappointing results as we
reduced our market risk in response to attempting to manage
fluctuations in prices and market liquidity, Blankfein, 56,
said in the statement. </p>
<p>Value at risk, a gauge of how much the firm could lose in a
single day of trading, fell for the eighth consecutive quarter,
to $101 million. The figure was the lowest since the third
quarter of 2006. The firm reduced the amount at risk to equity
prices, currencies and interest rates, while the risk in
commodity prices jumped. </p>
<p>Not as Effective'' </p>
<p>During the quarter we were not as effective at navigating
intra-quarter swings in market prices and liquidity as we have
been historically, Viniar told analysts. We generated lower
revenues from managing client-originated market-making
inventory, particularly in our largely U.S.-based mortgages
business and our global commodities and credit business. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s equity-trading revenue declined 17 percent
to $1.92 billion from $2.32 billion in the prior quarter and
rose 19 percent from $1.61 billion a year earlier. That compared
with $1.22 billion of second-quarter equity-trading revenue at
JPMorgan and $812 million at Citigroup. Analysts including as
Roger Freeman at Barclays Capital expected Goldman Sachs''s
equities revenue to be about $2 billion. </p>
<p>Revenue from investment banking, overseen globally by
Richard J. Gnodde, David M. Solomon and John S. Weinberg,
advanced to $1.45 billion in the quarter from $1.27 billion in
the first quarter and $941 million in the second quarter of
2010. By comparison, JPMorgan''s investment-banking fees totaled
$1.92 billion in the quarter and Citigroup reaped $1.09 billion. </p>
<p>Investment Banking </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s investment-banking revenue exceeded
estimates from analysts at Atlantic Equities, Barclays Capital
and ISI Group, who expected revenue in the range of $1.2 billion
to $1.3 billion. </p>
<p>Fees from takeover advice, a business led by Gene T. Sykes
and Yoel Zaoui, increased to $637 million from $357 million in
the first quarter and from $471 million a year earlier. The firm
ranks first among advisers on mergers and acquisitions announced
so far this year, according to Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>The firm also ranks first year-to-date in managing global
equity sales and initial public offerings, the data show.
Revenue from equity underwriting, overseen by London-based
Matthew Westerman, fell to $378 million from $426 million in the
first quarter, while debt underwriting revenue dropped to $433
million from $486 million in the prior three months. </p>
<p>Investing and Lending </p>
<p>Investing and lending, the segment in which Goldman Sachs
books gains or losses from the firm''s own stakes in companies
such as Industrial  Commercial Bank of China (1398) Ltd. and other
assets, made $1.04 billion in the period, compared with $2.71
billion of gains in the first quarter and $1.79 billion in the
second quarter of 2010. </p>
<p>Revenue from investing and lending was more than double
what was expected by analysts at Atlantic Equities, Barclays
Capital and ISI Group. Their estimates ranged from $210 million
to $411 million. </p>
<p>People regard those revenues as pretty volatile and I
don''t think people will take any comfort from a better
performance in that business, said Atlantic Equities'' Staite. </p>
<p>Revenue from investment management, the business run by
Edward C. Forst and Timothy O''Neill, was unchanged from the
first quarter at $1.27 billion and up from $1.13 billion in the
second quarter of last year. Assets under management increased
to $844 billion at the end of June from $840 billion at the end
of March. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) has about
$1.5 billion to $2 billion in net risk to the five most troubled
nations in Europe, Chief Financial Officer David A. Viniar said. </p>
<p>On a net basis, our exposure is actually pretty modest
to the five countries: Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and
Spain, Viniar said in response to an analyst''s question on a
conference call today. Our gross exposure is not very big
either, he added, without providing any figures. </p>
<p>Concerns about European countries'' creditworthiness have
accelerated in recent weeks, provoking questions about banks''
related risks. The cost of borrowing in Italy and Spain has
surged, with the Italian 10-year note yield jumping to 5.72
percent from 4.88 percent on June 30. Moody''s Investors Service
cut the ratings on Greek, Irish and Portuguese debt to junk. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-biggest U.S. bank, said
last week that it had $15 billion of net risk in those
countries, which accounts for offsetting hedges and collateral.
Citigroup Inc. (C), the third-biggest bank, said it has at least $22
billion in loans, trading assets and other exposure to the
five countries. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) has about $3.2 billion at risk in the
five nations, Chief Financial Officer Timothy J. Sloan said on
the company''s second-quarter earnings call today. Most of that
is corporate debt rather than bonds issued by the countries
themselves, he said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the U.S.
bank that makes most of its money from trading, reported second-
quarter profit that fell short of analysts'' estimates as fixed-
income revenue plunged 63 percent from the first quarter. </p>

estimate of 23 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Earnings fell 38
percent if one-time costs are excluded from the 2010 results. </p>
<p>The fixed-income trading-revenue drop was more than twice
as large as at any other major U.S. bank. Overall trading
revenue at Goldman Sachs, led by Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, fell 47 percent from the first
quarter. JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s investment bank reported a
smaller-than-expected 17 percent decline in trading revenue last
week, while the same business at Citigroup Inc. (C) fell 21 percent. </p>
<p>All the news is going to be about Goldman Sachs today
because people brought their numbers down and they still missed
those numbers, Paul Miller, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets,
said in an interview on Bloomberg television. The question is
going to be why were their revenues down much greater than their
competitors? Probably they were positioned differently. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) set aside
$8.44 billion for its compensation pool in the first six months
of 2011, 9 percent less than in the same period a year earlier
as revenue tumbled 11 percent. </p>
<p>The expense, which includes salaries, bonuses and benefits,
was enough to provide each of the firm''s 35,500 employees with
$237,662 for the six-month period, according to figures posted
today on the New York-based company''s website. A year earlier,
the firm set aside $9.3 billion for compensation, excluding a
$600 million one-time U.K. tax on bonuses, or $272,581 for each
of the 34,100 staff at the time. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd C. Blankfein, 56, is among Wall Street firms seeking ways
to curb costs as revenue from trading equities and fixed-income
products drops for the second consecutive year. JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) reported last week that the compensation expense at its
investment bank was unchanged for the first half of the year
even though it employed 5 percent more workers and generated 6
percent more revenue than a year earlier. </p>
<p>They''ve continued to streamline some of their costs,
said Douglas G. Ciocca, managing director at Kavar Capital
Partners LLC in Leawood, Kansas, which manages about $225
million in assets, including Goldman Sachs shares. He spoke
before the earnings were released. Still you''ve got to make
sure you retain the top people. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s pay expense represented 44 percent of
revenue in the six-month period compared with 43 percent a year
earlier. The same ratio at JPMorgan''s investment bank was 38
percent in the first six months of 2011, down from 40 percent a
year earlier. </p>
<p>Average compensation figures are derived by dividing the
overall compensation pool by the number of employees and don''t

<p>Johnson  Johnson and Pfizer Inc. (PFE)''s
experimental Alzheimer''s treatment bapineuzumab didn''t raise new
safety concerns in study participants monitored over a longer
period of time. </p>
<p>Researchers verified the compound''s safety and tolerability
beyond 78 weeks in people with mild to moderate Alzheimer''s
disease in an extension of a mid-stage trial. Results from an
interim analysis of the data are being presented today at the
Alzheimer''s Association International Conference in Paris. In
data released last year, bapineuzumab was linked to a side
effect similar to swelling of the brain when given at high
doses. </p>
<p>The major finding is that there were no new safety
signals, lead researcher Stephen Salloway, chief of neurology
and director of the Memory and Aging Program at Butler Hospital
in Providence, Rhode Island, said in an interview at the
conference. The types of adverse events that we saw in phase
2, we saw at about roughly the same rate in the open
extension. </p>
<p>Hopes for a medicine to treat Alzheimer''s, which is the
most common form of dementia, hinge on bapineuzumab and a
similar drug being developed by Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly 
Co. (LLY) Both target beta amyloid plaque, considered by researchers a
main contributor to Alzheimer''s. At least a dozen potential
treatments designed to slow or stop amyloid plaques from forming
have failed in mid- to late-stage testing since 2003. </p>
<p>Wait and See'' </p>
<p>Bapineuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed to
target beta amyloid in the brain. Monoclonal antibodies, which
have broken new ground in cancer treatment, are made in the lab
to mimic natural substances that stimulate a patient''s immune
system to attack disease-causing cells. </p>
<p>I am going to take a wait-and-see approach on
bapineuzumab, Marc Gordon, associate professor of neurology and
psychiatry at the North Shore LIJ School of Medicine, said in an
interview. Just because you remove amyloid from the brain may
not necessarily correlate with an improvement in the condition.
The jury is out. We don''t have sufficient data from the phase 2
studies to draw any conclusions on efficacy. </p>
<p>Out of the 194 participants in the extension trial, some
received bapineuzumab for at least three years, some for at
least four years and others for five years, researchers said
today. Patients were administered bapineuzumab every 13 weeks
and there was no placebo group. </p>
<p>Chronic Treatment </p>
<p>The fairly lengthy time period is important because
bapineuzumab is being considered as a long-running treatment for
Alzheimer''s, said Salloway, who also is a professor at Brown
University''s Alpert Medical School. It''s not meant to be just
a one-shot, for 18 months, he said. </p>
<p>Ninety-one percent of the participants reported side
effects, and about 24 percent of the individuals reported
adverse events that were considered to have a link or possibly
have a link with bapineuzumab. Most side effects were mild to
moderate, such as headaches. About 35 percent of the patients
reported serious adverse events, including convulsion, hip
fracture and swelling known as cerebral vasogenic edema, an
accumulation of water in the brain tissue, researchers said. </p>
<p>It continues to be unclear to us if these events are
harmful long-term or just short-term markers of drug efficacy,
Marc Goodman, an analyst at UBS AG in New York, wrote in a July
14 note to clients. </p>
<p>Side Effect </p>
<p>Vasogenic edema was the most commonly reported side effect,
occurring in 9.3 percent of participants, in line with previous
bapineuzumab studies, the researchers said. The risk of
developing vasogenic edema appeared to be lower after multiple
infusions of the drug, according to the investigators. </p>
<p>It tends to occur early and doesn''t seem to occur later
in the treatment, so that''s very encouraging, Salloway said.
Most of the vasogenic edema changes occurred with the first
three doses, and then over time it''s a much lower rate. I don''t
think we''ve seen it at all after two years of treatment. </p>
<p>Alzheimer''s is a progressive illness that starts with mild
forgetfulness and eventually robs patients of memories and
independence. It afflicts about 36 million people worldwide, a
number that is expected to double by 2050, according to the
Alzheimer''s Association, an advocacy group based in Chicago.
Existing drugs temporarily ease symptoms and none cure the
condition. </p>
<p>Bapineuzumab is in the third and final stage of testing
generally needed for regulatory approval. Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) has
said it plans to seek U.S. regulatory approval of bapineuzumab
in 2012 or 2013. Final-phase results are expected for mid-2012. </p>
<p>We are getting more familiar with bapineuzumab and
trial results next year will give a clearer answer on how well
the drug works and much more information about safety,
Salloway said. </p>

<p>Around the time readers first
learned of Sherlock Holmes''s turning to cocaine after a tough
case, two of the medical world''s great minds were getting a
serious buzz on for research, fun and abuse. </p>
<p>These actual early cokeheads were Sigmund Freud (1856-1939)
and U.S. surgeon William Halsted (1852-1922), the subjects of
Howard Markel''s colorful study An Anatomy of Addiction. </p>
<p>In the opening pages, we meet a young Halsted in May 1885
in a hospital dispensary. He frantically searched the
shelves for cocaine, shot up and then bolted from the
operating room where he was supposed to attend a compound
fracture. He fled to his Manhattan home and sank into a
cocaine oblivion that lasted more than seven months. </p>
<p>The drug wasn''t cheap then either, but Halsted was the
scion of a dry-goods and insurance fortune. A jock and a dandy
at Yale, his medical interests surfaced only in his senior year
after some unrequired light reading in Gray''s Anatomy. Following
two years of study in Vienna and several German cities, Halsted
returned to the U.S. a superbly trained surgeon, perhaps the
best of his generation, Markel writes. </p>
<p>Also in May 1885, we encounter Freud boasting in a letter
to his fiancee about how a dose of pure cocaine vanquished his
migraine and inspired him to stay up until four in the morning
writing a very important'' anatomical study, Markel writes. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world''s largest
software maker, reported fourth-quarter profit and sales that
exceeded analysts'' predictions as it benefited from robust
demand from corporations and a lower-than-expected tax rate. </p>
<p>Net income in the fiscal period that ended in June rose 30
percent to $5.87 billion, or 69 cents a share, from $4.52
billion, or 51 cents, a year earlier, Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft said in a statement today. That beat the 58-cent
estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales rose to $17.4
billion, compared with the $17.2 billion average projection. </p>
<p>Corporations, eager to upgrade aging fleets of computers,
are snapping up Microsoft''s Office business-productivity
programs and the company''s flagship Windows operating system.
That made up for weaker demand from consumers, who favored
smartphones and tablets sporting Apple Inc. and Google Inc.
software. Results were also boosted by Microsoft getting more of
its earnings in foreign countries that have lower tax rates. </p>
<p>It''s a great finish to a fiscal year full of records,
said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners LP in New York. </p>
<p>Microsoft said operating expenses in the year that started
July 1 will rise to $28 billion to $28.6 billion, reiterating an
April forecast. </p>
<p>Microsoft was little changed in late trading after earlier
gaining 4 cents to $27.10 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq
Stock Market. The shares rose 2.4 percent last quarter, while
the Standard and Poor''s 500 Index fell 0.4 percent. </p>
<p>Ireland, Singapore, Puerto Rico </p>
<p>Microsoft said its tax rate fell to 7 percent from 25
percent a year earlier because more earnings were taxed at lower
rates in Ireland, Singapore and Puerto Rico, Microsoft said. </p>
<p>Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal
statutory rate primarily due to a higher mix of earnings taxed
at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions, Microsoft said in the
statement. </p>
<p>The rate explains much of the reason why results surpassed
predictions, Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein said in an
interview. </p>
<p>Unearned revenue -- which comes from multiyear contracts
that isn''t recognized in the current period and indicates future
sales -- was also higher than analysts projected. That figure
was $17.1 billion, above the average estimate of $15.6 billion,
according to Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>It implies a strong close to the end of the quarter from
a bookings perspective, and that''s going to flow into revenue in
the next couple of quarters, said Tony Ursillo, an analyst at
Loomis Sayles  Co., which manages $162.3 billion, including
Microsoft shares. The flywheel has a lot of energy. </p>
<p>Windows PC Demand </p>
<p>Microsoft saw higher demand for Windows PCs for
corporations than those for consumers, Klein said. That trend
will continue through the fiscal year that started July 1 as
companies continue replacing older machines, he said. </p>
<p>The company follows Intel Corp., the largest chipmaker, in
reporting robust buying by corporations. Intel forecast sales
for the current quarter yesterday that exceeded some analysts''
predictions, citing demand from companies that are upgrading
dated technology. Sales in Microsoft''s business unit, mostly
from Office software, rose 7.5 percent to $5.78 billion,
compared with the $5.7 billion analysts predicted. </p>
<p>Sales to large corporations were strong in part because
Microsoft sales representatives pushed to close deals before the
end of the fiscal year, as is often the case in the fourth
quarter, Klein said. </p>
<p>Sales in Microsoft''s server software unit rose 12 percent
to $4.64 billion. </p>
<p>Consumer Weakness </p>
<p>Microsoft''s consumer business, by contrast, is suffering
amid rivalry from Apple, and its Internet business is contending
with competition from Google and Facebook Inc., which have added
features that keep users engaged for longer stretches. Windows
revenue fell less than 1 percent to $4.74 billion, missing the
$4.8 million average estimate of analysts. That was the third-
straight quarter that the division missed analysts'' estimates. </p>
<p>Consumer demand for Windows PCs was also crimped by
economic weakness in some parts of the world, Klein said. </p>
<p>There are macro-economic constraints on spending, he
said. We see it as specifically acute in netbooks, which
continue to drop roughly 40 percent. Certainly tablets are part
of it. </p>
<p>Apple, which reported more quarterly profit than Microsoft
for the first time in 20 years in the March quarter, is
persuading customers to pass up new laptop computers in favor of
its iPad tablet. Apple said this week it sold 9.3 million iPads
in the June quarter. </p>
<p>Mobile Laggard </p>
<p>About 85 million PCs were sold worldwide in the same
period, research firm Gartner Inc. said. About 20 percent of the
iPads sold went to customers who would have otherwise bought a
Windows PC, Gillis estimated. </p>
<p>Microsoft is working on a successor to its Windows
operating system that can work on tablet-style computers
comparable to the iPad. Windows President Steven Sinofsky showed
a preview of the software in June. The he declined to say when
it would be available, except to note it won''t be this fall. </p>
<p>Klein declined to provide specific sales numbers for
Microsoft''s Windows Phone, a revamped product released in
October to reverse share lost to Google and Apple. </p>
<p>Asked whether mobile sales were disappointing, he said,
Maybe a little. </p>
<p>Mobile-software sales won''t reach volume until 2012,
Klein said. </p>
<p>The market continues to await evidence of Microsoft''s
ability to establish a presence in mobile, said Josh Olson, an
analyst at Edward Jones  Co. in St. Louis. Until Microsoft is
able to do that, I think the stock is going to continue to trade
in a very narrow band. </p>
<p>Sales in the entertainment and devices division, which
includes mobile software, gained 30 percent to $1.49 billion --
a sign of demand for Microsoft''s Xbox gaming console. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS)''s second-quarter
revenue from both investment banking and fixed-income trading

<p>Fixed-income trading generated $2.09 billion for Morgan
Stanley and investment banking brought in $1.47 billion, while
Goldman Sachs reported $1.6 billion and $1.45 billion,
respectively. New York-based Morgan Stanley has never

trading results, company filings show. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, 53,
benefited as his firm took more risks while Goldman Sachs, led
by Lloyd C. Blankfein, 56, pulled back. Morgan Stanley rose the
most yesterday in more than two years on the New York Stock
Exchange after reporting a second-quarter loss smaller than
analysts estimated. Goldman Sachs dropped as much as 3 percent
after profit missed estimates on July 19, before paring that
decline. </p>
<p>It''s unusual to see them going in opposite directions,
Jason Tyler, senior vice president at Ariel Investments LLC,
said yesterday in an interview with Tom Keene on Bloomberg
Radio. Usually you''ll see investment banking as a whole
trending in one way. </p>

<p>Walter Energy Inc. (WLT)''s shareholders,
who lost almost $2 billion in three months on management turmoil
and disappointing earnings, may still be rewarded with a $4
billion windfall if the coal producer is acquired. </p>
<p>Investor Audley Capital Advisors LLP said this week the
southern Appalachia producer of steelmaking coal should explore
a sale following Chief Executive Officer Keith Calder''s
resignation after three months on the job. Walter Energy would
fetch as much as $192 a share, or a 60 percent premium to
yesterday''s close, based on the median earnings multiple paid in
coal deals since 1998, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>While the $12 billion price would mark the biggest takeover
of a coal producer, Walter Energy makes twice as much profit per
dollar of sales as the U.S. industry average, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. With metallurgical coal trading near a record
and the Birmingham, Alabama-based company''s shares down 15
percent from an all-time high in April, Walter Energy may lure
buyers from Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR) to Consol Energy Inc. (CNX),
according to Raymond James Financial Inc. It may also attract
steelmaker Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA, Davenport  Co. said. </p>
<p>It''s really an obvious takeout candidate, especially
after their CEO resigned, said Eric Green, a Philadelphia-
based fund manager at Penn Capital Management, which oversees
$6.5 billion and about 60,000 Walter Energy shares. It would
be extremely attractive for an international steel or materials
company. There''s huge demand for met coal, and Walter''s is very
high quality. </p>
<p>Constructive Dialogue'' </p>
<p>Michael Monahan, a spokesman for Walter Energy, declined to
comment beyond the company''s July 19 response to Audley Capital.
The coal producer said it welcomes constructive dialogue
with all investors, is focused on creating long-term shareholder
value and will still be led by an experienced senior
management team, according to the statement. </p>
<p>Armel Leslie, a spokesman for London-based Audley Capital,
declined to comment. </p>
<p>Walter Energy, which has operations in Alabama''s Blue Creek
seam, gained mines in Canada when it purchased Vancouver-based
Western Coal Corp. in April for C$5.3 billion ($5.6 billion). </p>
<p>Metallurgical coal, also referred to as coking coal, is
used to forge steel, while the thermal form is used by utilities
to generate electricity. Walter Energy''s coking coal is
considered better quality because it''s purer and has a higher
heat rate, making it desirable for steelmakers, said Timothy Parker, who oversees $8.5 billion in natural-resource stocks at
T. Rowe Price Group Inc., part of the firm''s $509.9 billion
under management globally. </p>
<p>Bee''s Knees'' </p>
<p>It''s excellent coal, said Baltimore-based Parker, whose
firm owned about 2.3 million shares of Walter Energy at the end
of March. It''s really essential for steelmaking, so it prices
at a premium, especially because it''s very hard to find. It''s
the bee''s knees. </p>
<p>Walter Energy was also one of more than 40 companies that
Bloomberg identified in March that met the acquisition criteria
Warren Buffett listed in his annual letter to shareholders.
Buffett typically prefers simple businesses with pretax
profit exceeding $75 million, consistent earning power, and
good returns on equity while employing little or no debt,
according to his report to Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) shareholders. </p>
<p>While Walter Energy has been a takeover candidate for
several years, the company became more vulnerable to a sale
after its CEO said he was stepping down just three months after
he took the position, according to Penn Capital''s Green. </p>
<p>Management Conflict </p>
<p>Calder, whose resignation is effective at the end of this
month, told the board of directors in a letter that he was
leaving due to differing opinions on management philosophy,
according to a June 30 statement from the company. Joseph B. Leonard, the interim chief from March 2010 to March 2011, will
be the interim CEO again. </p>
<p>The company missed analysts'' earnings estimates three
quarters in a row and has faced operational problems at deeper
mines in Alabama. Since reaching a record April 8, the shares
fell 21 percent before Audley Capital''s letter was made public,
wiping out about $1.9 billion in market value, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The stock had gained 7.8 percent since the
investor''s letter was disclosed through yesterday. </p>
<p>Walter Energy rose $5.51, or 4.6 percent, to $125.15 today
in New York, the highest closing price since May 10. </p>
<p>The company should sell because it now lacks the strong
leadership needed, which is weighing on the share price,
Audley Capital, which owns 900,000 shares, or about 1.5 percent
of the company, said in a July 17 letter to the board. </p>
<p>Headless Horseman'' </p>
<p>Walter Energy could fetch $240 a share in a takeover, based
on the 2012 earnings multiple that Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU) and
ArcelorMittal are offering for Macarthur Coal Ltd. (MCC), the letter
said. That would be double Walter Energy''s closing price of
$119.64 yesterday. </p>
<p>Walter has been the headless horseman before, and it''s
about to be the headless horseman again, T. Rowe''s Parker
said. It''s not totally shocking that some activists wanted to
shake the tree. </p>
<p>Coal producers have sold for a median of 7.25 times
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
since 1998, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Applying
that multiple to analysts'' estimated 2011 Ebitda of $1.66
billion, Walter Energy may draw a bid for its equity of $11.9
billion, or almost $192 a share, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>That''s $4.4 billion more than the company''s market value of
$7.5 billion as of yesterday. Such a deal would also top Teck
Resources Ltd.''s almost $8.7 billion acquisition of Fording
Canadian Coal Trust in 2008 as the biggest in the industry. </p>
<p>Record Coal Prices </p>
<p>While J. Christopher Haberlin, an analyst at Davenport,
estimates the company may fetch between $185 and $215 a share,
David Beard, an analyst at Iberia Capital Partners LLC, pegs a
takeover at about $160 a share. </p>
<p>The coal producer''s profit margin of 25 percent in the last
12 months tops 10 of 11 U.S. industry peers with market values
greater than $500 million, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The group''s average margin was almost 13 percent. </p>
<p>Benchmark prices for steelmaking coal settled at $315 a ton
for the quarterly contract, according to UBS AG, the second-
highest level on record. They slipped 4.5 percent from the all
time high of $330 for the three-month contract that started
April 1. </p>
<p>Prices have surged amid global production disruptions,
including record flooding in Queensland, Australia, and labor
strikes in the face of robust demand from China and India. </p>
<p>Time to Sell'' </p>
<p>Now is a good time to sell the company because of the
near-record prices for met coal, strong global demand and
constricted global supply, said Davenport''s Haberlin, who''s
based in Richmond, Virginia. The assets have more value now
than ever. </p>
<p>Walter has projected that coking coal production will
increase to 20 million metric tons in 2012 from sales of 7.2
million tons in 2010, prior to the Western Coal deal closing. </p>
<p>The company''s production growth, high-quality coal and
rising international demand may attract buyers in the coal
industry, including Consol Energy, a coal and natural-gas
company, and Alpha, the world''s third-largest producer of
steelmaking coal, said Jim Rollyson, an analyst at Raymond James
in Houston. </p>
<p>Consol Energy has a market value of $12.3 billion, while
Alpha of Abingdon, Virginia, is valued at $10.2 billion. Lynn
Seay, a spokeswoman for Consol Energy, and Ted Pile, a spokesman
for Alpha, said the companies don''t comment on speculation. </p>
<p>Rare Coal Quality </p>
<p>The quality of Walter Energy''s coal makes it attractive to
producers of steel, which is used in buildings and cars, said T.
Rowe''s Parker. Brazilian iron and steel manufacturer CSN, as
Siderurgica Nacional is known, is also a potential buyer,
according to Haberlin at Davenport. The company has a market
value of 25 billion real ($16 billion). </p>
<p>Fabio Rocha, a spokesman for CSN, didn''t respond to an e-
mail requesting comment. </p>
<p>While Walter Energy may appeal to a variety of companies,
many firms in the mining industry are already in the midst of
acquisitions or recently completed deals. </p>
<p>Alpha completed the $7.5 billion acquisition last month of
Massey Energy Co., the owner of the mine in West Virginia where
29 workers died in an April 2010 explosion. That may make Alpha
less likely to pursue another deal right now, said Iberia
Capital''s Beard, who''s based in New Orleans, Louisiana. </p>
<p>Steel manufacturer ArcelorMittal (MT) of Luxembourg and St.
Louis, Missouri-based coal miner Peabody announced on July 11 a
proposed acquisition of Macarthur that values the Brisbane,
Australia-based coal producer at A$4.7 billion ($5.1 billion). </p>
<p>Walter Energy Bidders </p>
<p>Although the bidders are still trying to persuade
Macarthur, ArcelorMittal, with a $50 billion market
capitalization, or Peabody, at $16.5 billion, may potentially
bid for Walter Energy, said Davenport''s Haberlin, Raymond
James''s Rollyson and Penn Capital''s Green. </p>
<p>Giles Read, a spokesman for ArcelorMittal, declined to
comment. Representatives for Peabody didn''t respond to phone
calls and e-mails requesting comment. </p>
<p>Clearly the market has worked in their favor in terms of
the strength in pricing of their commodity, Raymond James''
Rollyson said. Given the right circumstance, there will
probably be some interest in Walter. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s biggest
drugmaker, said it has no plans to break up the company''s animal
health unit after Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY) expressed interest in buying
some of its products. </p>
<p>Lilly, which had $1.39 billion in sales from animal-health
products last year, is monitoring Pfizer''s plans to divest its
unit and will pursue assets deemed of interest, Chief Financial
Officer Derica Rice said today in a conference call. Pfizer
wants a sale or spinoff of the unit and doesn''t foresee breaking
it up, said Joan Campion, a company spokeswoman. </p>
<p>Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read said on July 7 he
is divesting the company''s animal health and nutrition units to
buy back shares and focus on developing new drugs. The units may
fetch $22 billion, according to Seamus Fernandez, an analyst at
Leerink Swann  Co. Pfizer''s animal health unit had sales last
year of $3.48 billion. </p>
<p>While we are evaluating a variety of options including a
sale, spinoff or other transaction, we believe we will favor one
overall option rather than dividing assets and business
operations, Campion said today in an e-mail. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s review of its options for the unit will take 12 to
24 months, Campion said. The company doesn''t plan further
announcements about the unit until 2012, she said. </p>
<p>Pfizer shares rose 20 cents, or 1 percent, to $20.10 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Lilly rose
$1.15, or 3 percent, to $39.32, for the biggest single-day gain
since Jan. 19, 2010. </p>
<p>Evolving Situation </p>
<p>We will watch how that situation evolves, and if there
are some assets that become available that we are interested in,
yes, we will pursue them, Lilly''s Rice said in a conference
call with analysts. It is very early to speculate what type
of transaction Pfizer is seeking, he said. </p>
<p>Lilly isn''t likely to buy the unit outright, Fernandez said
in an e-mail. In order to maintain its quarterly dividend of 49
cents a share, which Rice has said Lilly will do, the company
would have to issue more stock and risk diluting earnings or use
so much cash that it would hurt the company''s credit ratings,
Fernandez said. The deal is also unlikely to be approved by
antitrust regulators, he said. </p>
<p>I simply don''t think they are interested, and a $12
billion-plus deal would be a pretty big deal, Fernandez wrote.
If another buyer emerges and faces regulatory hurdles, Lilly
might be able to purchase some assets from the acquiring
company, he said. </p>
<p>Lilly is interested in expanding its Elanco animal heath
unit''s offerings in vaccines and pet products, as well as
boosting its presence in Europe, Jeff Simmons, president of the
division, said in a June 29 telephone interview. Elanco''s
biggest product line is feed additives for cattle and poultry. </p>
<p>We are going to be opportunistic in animal health,
Simmons said. We are looking for additional assets. We are not
interested in acquiring for the sake of acquiring; it has got to
have a strategic element. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the largest U.S.
natural-gas producer since last year''s purchase of XTO Energy
Inc., is evaluating more acquisitions with an eye toward
expanding its gas holdings. </p>
<p>Exxon is assessing targets in more than a dozen gas-rich
shale-rock formations worldwide, Jack Williams, president of the
Irving, Texas-based company''s XTO unit, said yesterday in an
interview. The company has spent almost $3 billion to amass
shale leases in Texas, Pennsylvania, Arkansas and Louisiana
since closing the $34.9 billion purchase of XTO in June 2010. </p>
<p>The company''s desire for additional gas comes amid a series
of multibillion-dollar shale transactions. BHP Billiton Ltd.
agreed last week to pay about $12.1 billion for Petrohawk Energy
Corp. to expand its presence in U.S. shale. Since June 1,
companies including Exxon, Marathon Oil Corp. and Malaysia''s
Petroliam Nasional Bhd have announced at least $7 billion worth
of North American shale-gas deals. </p>
<p>Exxon is also expanding its international shale-gas reach,
starting hydraulic fracturing on formations in Poland this year
and last week agreeing with China Petrochemical Corp. to jointly
assess the resource''s potential in China. </p>
<p>Williams said he favors so-called bolt-on transactions that
include gas fields adjacent to existing Exxon assets. Three
years after Exxon abandoned the Barnett shale in north Texas
because of lagging returns, XTO-operated wells in the region are
among the most profitable in the company''s portfolio, even after
a 67 percent slide in U.S. gas prices since 2008, he said. </p>
<p>Good Returns </p>
<p>The economic returns are very good, Williams said
during the interview in XTO''s offices in a 90-year-old bank
building in Fort Worth, Texas. We''re running economics on
every individual well. We''re making sure each well makes
economic sense before we drill it. We''re not drilling anything
that''s losing money. </p>
<p>Exxon has purchased shale fields that hold more than 10
trillion cubic feet of gas since the XTO transaction, the
company''s biggest purchase in more than a decade, Williams said.
Ten trillion cubic feet of gas is enough to supply U.S.
household demand for two years, based on Bloomberg calculations. </p>
<p>Exxon has risen 45 percent since the XTO deal closed on
June 28, 2010, outperforming the Standard  Poor''s 500 index and
U.S. crude oil futures, which increased 25 percent and 27
percent, respectively, through today''s close of trading. The
company gained $1.72, or 2.1 percent, to $85.02 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. </p>
<p>Exxon''s Cash </p>
<p>With $12.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents, Exxon has
no need for joint-venture partners to help finance its shale
projects, said Williams, whose previous assignments for Exxon
included overseeing Alaskan oil production from 2000 to 2003. </p>
<p>Rival gas producers such as Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) have
signed joint-venture agreements with international energy
companies including Total SA to secure financing amid a gas glut
that has depressed U.S. prices for the fuel. Benchmark gas
futures traded in New York have averaged $4.30 per million
British thermal units this year, 32 percent below the 2006-2010
average. </p>
<p>I would love to have a higher gas price, but we''re
pleased with the returns we''re seeing, Williams said. If you
get a good position in a play and you view that as capable of
providing attractive returns, why would you want to dilute that
by bringing somebody else in? </p>
<p>Buying Shale </p>
<p>Exxon''s post-XTO shale acquisitions have included the $695
million purchase of Ellora Energy Inc. in July 2010 and the
$1.69 billion transaction for Phillips Resources Inc. and TWP
Inc., a pair of closely held explorers active in the Marcellus
formation in Pennsylvania and neighboring states. </p>
<p>XTO plans to drill 40,000 wells worldwide and more than
double gas production during the next decade, Williams said. In
the Barnett shale near Dallas, the company expects to drill
4,000 more wells in coming years to augment the 1,700 wells it
already operates in the region, he said. </p>
<p>The Barnett shale, where Houston billionaire George P. Mitchell pioneered the hydraulic fracturing and horizontal
drilling techniques in the late 1990s that triggered the shale-
gas boom, probably is less than 50 percent developed, Williams
said. That means it''ll take years of drilling before the region
begins to fade as a gas producer, he said. </p>
<p>XTO has eight rigs drilling in the Barnett formation,
little changed since the merger with Exxon, Williams said. </p>
<p>Return to Barnett </p>
<p>Exxon abandoned the Barnett formation in October 2008 after
returns failed to meet expectations. The company sold its stakes
in gas fields and an 80-mile (129-kilometer) pipeline to closely
held Harding Energy Partners LLC of Dallas, which in turn sold
the assets to Chesapeake. Other big producers in the Barnett
include Devon Energy Corp. (DVN), EOG Resources Inc. (EOG) and Quicksilver
Resources Inc. </p>
<p>Exxon''s return to the Barnett region has been profitable,
thanks partly to XTO''s well designs, drilling expertise and
leases in some of the most prolific zones, Williams said. He
declined to provide specific figures for returns on investment
or per-well profits. </p>
<p>Some of the best returns in the company are here in the
Barnett shale, Williams said. We have very good positions in
the heart of the play. Our drilling speed has doubled in the
past five years and our finding-and-development cost is 50
percent lower than it was five years ago. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley rose the most in more
than two years in New York trading after reporting a second-
quarter loss that was smaller than analysts estimated and the
only gain in trading revenue among major U.S. banks. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley climbed as much as 9.1 percent after posting
a net loss of 38 cents a share, smaller than the 61-cent average
estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. A $1.7 billion
charge tied to the conversion of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group
Inc.''s preferred stake in the New York-based firm caused the
loss, which compared with profit of $1.09 a year earlier. </p>
<p>Trading revenue rose 14 percent from the first quarter,
while Goldman Sachs Group Inc. posted a 47 percent drop earlier
this week. The results may help Morgan Stanley (MS) Chief Executive
Officer James Gorman, 53, convince investors the firm can reach
his goals of increasing profitability and gaining market share
in trading. The firm''s shares are trading below book value, and
this week touched the lowest level since March 2009. </p>
<p>So far as confidence in management and their ability to
deliver, delivering good fixed-income results is not only a good
bottom line victory, but from a symbolic standpoint it goes a
ways toward calming investor fears, Jeffery Harte, an analyst
at Sandler O''Neill  Partners, said today in an interview with
Bloomberg Television. </p>
<p>The shares climbed $1.91, or 8.8 percent, to $23.63 at
11:42 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the
biggest jump since May 1, 2009, and the third-largest gain in
the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index. </p>
<p>Very Impressive'' </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley really knocked the ball out of the park,
Jason Tyler, senior vice president at Ariel Investments LLC,
said today in an interview with Tom Keene on Bloomberg Radio.
This is a very impressive quarter from a revenue standpoint. </p>
<p>The stock was down 20 percent this year through yesterday,
after falling 8.1 percent in 2010. That made it the fourth-worst
performer in the 81-company Standard  Poor''s 500 Financials
Index since Gorman took over at the beginning of 2010. </p>
<p>Mitsubishi UFJ last month converted $7.8 billion of
outstanding convertible preferred stock in Morgan Stanley into
common stock. The move provides Mitsubishi UFJ with a 22 percent
ownership interest in the U.S. investment bank and a second seat
on its board. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley agreed in April to increase the number of
common shares Mitsubishi UFJ will receive by 75 million to speed
up the conversion and eliminate $784 million in annual dividend
payments. </p>
<p>Fixed-Income Goal </p>
<p>Revenue at Morgan Stanley climbed to $9.28 billion from
$7.96 billion a year earlier, the highest since the end of the
financial crisis. Book value per share fell to $30.17 from
$31.45 at the end of March. Net income was $1.19 billion, versus
$1.96 billion in the same period of 2010. </p>
<p>While global markets remained challenging this quarter,
the firm delivered higher year-over-year revenues across our
three major business segments, Gorman said in the statement. </p>
<p>In the second quarter, revenue from fixed-income sales and
trading, which is run by Ken deRegt along with commodity trading
co-heads Colin Bryce and Simon Greenshields, was $2.09 billion.
That compared with $1.77 billion in the first quarter and $2.33
billion in the second quarter of 2010. </p>
<p>Excluding gains or losses from its own credit spreads,
fixed-income revenue was $1.9 billion, higher than estimates of
$1.5 billion from Richard Staite at Atlantic Equities LLP and
$1.57 billion from Keith Horowitz at Citigroup Inc. Fixed-income
trading revenue was $4.28 billion at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), $3.03
billion at Citigroup and $1.6 billion at Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>Bond Insurers </p>
<p>Fixed-income trading benefited from $471 million of gains
in the second quarter attributed to hedges against exposure to
bond insurers, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said on a
conference call today. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley reported $318 million in losses in the first
quarter and more than $1 billion in total losses since the start
of 2010 related to the monoline insurers. The hedges were
adjusted in the second quarter and otherwise would have resulted
in more losses, Porat said. </p>
<p>Commodity trading revenue declined meaningfully in the
quarter as client volume decreased, Porat said. That decline
served to really mask the relative progress in the other
fixed-income trading units in difficult markets, she said.
The firm''s daily average value-at-risk, a measure of how much it
could lose in the markets, rose to $145 million from $121
million in the first quarter. </p>
<p>Gorman''s Goal </p>
<p>Gorman in February laid out a goal of increasing fixed-
income revenue market share by 2 percentage points, with Colm Kelleher, co-head of the firm''s investment bank, leading the
effort. The firm had a market share based on revenue of about
6.5 percent among the top nine U.S. and European investment
banks last year, up from about 5.5 percent in 2009, according to
an April report by Glenn Schorr, a Nomura Holdings Inc. analyst. </p>
<p>The reason we''ve set a 2 percent market share goal and
think that''s a reasonable first goal to set for ourselves is
that market share is relatively low for this franchise, Porat
said today in an interview. We''re regaining a share which
would be a logical share on this platform, and I think that
context is important. It gives us a little bit of a tailwind,
even in a tougher market. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs declined 0.7 percent on July 19 in New York
trading after fixed-income trading revenue fell 63 percent from
the first quarter. JPMorgan exceeded estimates last week as it
posted trading revenue that topped all other major U.S. banks by
more than $1.5 billion. Both companies are based in New York. </p>
<p>Equities Trading </p>
<p>In equities trading, headed by Ted Pick, Morgan Stanley''s
second-quarter revenue rose to $1.85 billion, from $1.70 billion
in the first quarter and up 31 percent from a year earlier. The
unit''s revenue compares with $1.92 billion at Goldman Sachs and
$1.22 billion at JPMorgan. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley generated $1.47 billion in second-quarter
revenue from investment banking, which is overseen by Paul J. Taubman. That figure, up 66 percent from a year earlier,
included $533 million from financial advisory, $419 million from
equity underwriting and $521 million from debt underwriting. </p>
<p>Global wealth management, led by Greg Fleming, posted
pretax income of $322 million, up from $207 million in the
second quarter of 2010. The division''s pretax profit margin fell
to 9 percent from 10 percent in the first quarter. Gorman has
said the unit should eventually post a pretax profit margin of
more than 20 percent. </p>
<p>Improve Soon'' </p>
<p>Margins must improve and do so soon, Gorman said on the
call. Fleming and Chief Operating Officer Jim Rosenthal are
analyzing what else we really need to do to get ourselves
faster to the finish line. So we are taking an aggressive relook
at the back end of some of the integration steps, he said. </p>
<p>Asset management reported a pretax gain of $165 million,
compared with a loss of $86 million in the previous year''s
period. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s Tier 1 common ratio was about 14.6 percent
under Basel 1 and between 6.5 percent and 7 percent under Basel
III rules, Porat said on the conference call today. The firm
expects its required buffer from being a systemically important
financial institution to be 2 percent and plans to run closer to
the 9 percent level sooner than required, she said. </p>
<p>Compensation and benefits increased 20 percent from the
year-earlier quarter to $4.68 billion, or 50 percent of the
firm''s overall revenue. The ratio was higher than in the second
quarter of 2010, when the bank set aside 49 percent of revenue. </p>
<p>China Venture </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s expenses included a $130 million charge
tied to a joint venture in China with Huaxin Securities Co. that
began operations in June. Morgan Stanley established the venture
after selling its 34.3 percent stake in China International
Capital Corp. last year. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley was the second-ranked adviser on mergers
announced in the first half of this year, as well as the third-
ranked underwriter of stock offerings, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The firm finished 2010 as both the top
underwriter of equity offerings and the top adviser on announced
mergers and acquisitions globally for the first time since
Bloomberg began compiling data in 1999. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley bought a controlling stake in a joint
venture with Citigroup''s Smith Barney unit in 2009, giving it a
retail brokerage with 17,638 advisers and $1.71 trillion in
client assets as of June 30. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and
Citigroup Inc. (C) overhauled a $1.5 billion commercial mortgage-
bond deal after investors demanded more protection from losses
amid concern that ratings from Standard  Poor''s and Morningstar
Inc. didn''t accurately reflect the risk. </p>
<p>The banks boosted the buffer that protects AAA securities
from loan defaults by increasing the amount of lower-ranked debt
that is first to absorb losses, according to people familiar
with the transaction. The so-called credit enhancement on the
highest-graded debt has been raised to 20 percent from 14.5
percent, which was the least since sales of debt tied to
commercial property loans revived in November 2009. </p>
<p>Buyers are demanding better terms as banks have to unload
as much as $10 billion in real-estate loans they have been
stockpiling for sale as securities amid some signs that the U.S.
economic recovery is stalling. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup also
increased yields, after SP held a call with investors including
MetLife Inc. and CB Richard Ellis Investors LLC on July 18 to
address concerns that the credit enhancement levels were low. </p>
<p>It really impairs the credibility rebuilding process to
have something like this happen so early in the cycle, said
Harris Trifon, a debt analyst at Deutsche Bank AG. Having to
carve out a new class says volumes about investors'' perception
of the ratings agencies reliability. It shows that investors are
the ultimate arbiters of credit quality. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, set aside $4.19 billion in the first six
months of the year to pay investment bank employee salaries,
bonuses and benefits, up 10 percent from a year earlier. </p>
<p>Pay at the institutional-securities unit, which employs
traders and bankers, was 48 percent of revenue, up from 39
percent in the first half of 2010, according to the New York-
based company''s website. The unit''s revenue fell 11 percent to
$8.78 billion during the period. For the company as a whole,
compensation and benefits totaled $9.01 billion, up 9 percent. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley set aside more money for employees even as
Wall Street firms look to rein in costs amid declining revenue.
Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said last month that the firm
planned a three-year program to cut annual expenses by more than
$1 billion. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said this week that it will
cut about 1,000 jobs in an effort to chop $1.2 billion of costs. </p>
<p>Companywide compensation, the firm''s largest expense, was
enough to pay each of its 62,964 employees $143,066 for the six
months, up from $133,994 for each of the 61,958 employees at the
end of the second quarter of 2010, according to figures released
today. The bank doesn''t report how many people work in
institutional securities. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s brokerage division, which employed 17,638
financial advisers at the end of June compared with 18,087 a
year earlier, set aside $4.28 billion for pay in the first half,
up 9 percent from a year earlier. The unit''s compensation cost,
which is set by a fixed grid for many employees, was 62 percent
of the division''s revenue, down from 64 percent last year. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs set aside $8.44 billion for its compensation
pool in the first six months of 2011, 9 percent less than in the
same period a year earlier as revenue tumbled 11 percent. The
expense was enough pay each employee $237,662 for the six-month
period, down from $272,581 a year earlier. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) set aside $5.86 billion in the first
half to compensate employees at its investment bank, or an
average $211,358 per person, up 4.8 percent from a year earlier.
Both New York-based banks'' figures excluded charges tied to a
U.K. bonus tax last year. </p>
<p>Wall Street firms typically reserve a portion of revenue
throughout the year for employees, awarding most of the money as
year-end bonuses. Average pay per worker doesn''t reflect the
amount of money employees actually receive. Top executives and
revenue producers sometimes receive multimillion-dollar awards,
while clerical workers get smaller salaries. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) sold $2.75
billion of bonds after reporting second-quarter earnings that
lagged behind analysts'' estimates. </p>
<p>The bank issued 5.25 percent, 10-year notes that yield 230
basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The offering, which was increased by
$250 million, follows Morgan Stanley (MS)''s $2 billion sale yesterday
that included $1.5 billion of 5.5 percent, 10-year notes that
were priced at a 250 basis-point spread. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-largest bank in the U.S. by
assets, said on July 19 its net income in the quarter was $1.09
billion, or $1.85 per share, short of the $2.30 per-share
average estimate of 23 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Bond
investors shouldn''t be fazed by the disappointing quarter, said
Marilyn Cohen, who oversees $320 million as chief executive
officer of Envision Capital Management in Los Angeles. </p>
<p>They''re still Goldman and they still have an uncanny way
of making money, said Cohen, who bought some of the bank''s
bonds after the earnings report. Even though they are reviled
by the media and by most people on Main Street, the
institutional investor knows that Goldman has the ability to
crank it out every year. </p>
<p>Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment. </p>
<p>The sale was the bank''s first U.S. debt offering of at
least $500 million since April. </p>
<p>Bonds Fall </p>
<p>The bank''s $3.85 billion of 3.625 percent notes due
February 2016 fell to 100.3 cents on the dollar on July 20 after
the earnings announcement, from 101.2 cents at the beginning of
the week, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The securities rose
to 100.5 cents at 10 a.m. today in New York. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is joining banks raising money in the U.S.
bond market even as relative yields on their debt climb. Banks
issued at least $24.9 billion of debt this month through
yesterday, almost triple the $8.95 billion of sales in the same
period in June, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Average spreads on bank bonds have increased 10 basis
points to 213 basis points, or 2.13 percentage points, since
June 30, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data.
The average yield has dropped to 3.78 percent from 3.83 percent
during the same period. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs last issued 10-year notes in a size of at
least $500 million in July 2010, selling $750 million of
securities with a 5.2 percent yield, Bloomberg data show. The
bank issued $1.35 billion of five-year notes on April 28 in an
add-on to an existing offering. </p>

to 156 bushels an acre. </p>
<p>On July 12, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said the
crop would total 13.47 billion bushels with yields of 158.7
bushels. Corn inventories before the 2012 harvest may fall to
694 million bushels, Goldman said. That compares with the
government''s estimate of 870 million. </p>

<p>General Electric Co. (GE) posted second-
quarter earnings that beat analysts'' estimates, buoyed by its
finance unit, as the industrial order backlog rose to a record. </p>
<p>Profit from continuing operations climbed 18 percent to
$3.73 billion, or 34 cents a share, from $3.15 billion, or 29
cents, excluding pension costs, Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE
said today in a statement. That exceeded the 33-cent average of
13 analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt has said losses have
peaked at GE Capital, and the unit is writing more profitable
loans. The division''s gains helped offset narrower operating
margins at GE Energy, where the company said profitability will
improve in the second half. GE''s total backlog, a measure of
future industrial growth, rose 6.8 percent to a record $189
billion. </p>
<p>The source of earnings growth was really GE Capital,
where profits more than doubled, Matt Collins, a St. Louis-
based analyst with Edward Jones, said in an e-mail. Industrial
revenue growth actually slowed and profits declined, but if the
healthy order growth continues, earnings should rebound in 2012
and beyond. </p>
<p>Equipment orders gained 33 percent as GE introduces more
efficient wind and gas turbines, and service orders climbed 16
percent. Infrastructure orders increased 24 percent. </p>

<p>Exxon could raise about 1 billion ringgit ($336.5 million)

Asian nation, according to the newspaper. That compares with
Royal Dutch Shell Plc''s more than 900 gas stations in the
country and Boustead Holdings Bhd. (BOUS)''s 330, it said. </p>
<p>Divesting the retail business would enable the Irving,
Texas-based company to focus on oil and gas exploration,

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) hired Naoki Mita, a former Barclays Plc (BARC) commodities banker in Tokyo, to help
bolster its fuel, currency and metal hedging operations in
Japan. </p>
<p>Mita, 35, joined the corporate solutions division in Tokyo
on July 22, said Sachiko Hasegawa, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan
Securities Japan Co. He will be responsible for marketing the
second-biggest U.S. bank''s commodity and currency hedging
products to Japanese utilities, oil refiners and manufacturers,
a person with knowledge of the matter said. </p>
<p>Japan''s imports of dollar-denominated natural gas have
surged following a record earthquake and tsunami in March that
led to a shutdown of the nation''s nuclear reactors. The New
York-based bank is also targeting Japanese shipping companies
and trading houses including Mitsubishi Corp. (8058), the person said. </p>
<p>Manufacturers will need more of these financial tools to
control production costs and sustain profit growth, said
Makoto Imai, an assistant general manager and copper trader at
Sumitomo Corp. (8053), the country''s fourth biggest trading company by
market value. Mita''s commodity experience will enable him to
quickly arrange and bring the financial services to customers. </p>
<p>Mita reports to managing director Takeo Kaneko in his new
position, according to the person. Tokyo-based Hasegawa declined
to comment on Mita''s duties or the unit''s marketing strategy. At
Barclays, Mita sold similar hedging products, and was with the
London-based bank for about five years. </p>
<p>Utility Demand </p>
<p>Tokyo Electric Power Co. and Chubu Electric Power Co. are
among Japanese atomic-plant operators that boosted liquefied
natural gas imports to offset reductions in nuclear power
generation. The magnitude 9 earthquake and ensuing tsunami
triggered Japan''s worst nuclear accident at Tokyo Electric''s
Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant, about 135 miles (217 kilometers)
northeast of Tokyo. </p>
<p>Ten regional power companies including Tokyo Electric used
about 31 percent more LNG in June and also increased thermal
power generation, according to data compiled by the Federation
of Electric Power Companies of Japan. The country''s LNG import
costs surged 24 percent in June to 60,712 yen ($777) a metric
ton from January, according to Finance Ministry data. </p>
<p>Copper for delivery in three months surged 35 percent on
the London Metals Exchange to $9,655 a metric ton in the past
year. On the New York Mercantile Exchange Crude oil futures
gained 25 percent in the last 12 months to $99.05 a barrel. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) cut its 2011
forecast for sales of bonds tied to commercial mortgages by as
much as $15 billion as volatile prices curb profitability for
Wall Street banks, impeding a recovery in the property market. </p>
<p>JPMorgan reduced its forecast to between $30 billion and
$35 billion, the New York-based lender said in a July 22 report.
It had projected in November as much as $45 billion in new
offerings for this year. </p>
<p>Securities tied to property loans have declined as Europe''s
fiscal crisis and a stalemate between U.S. lawmakers over
raising the debt ceiling roil markets. Banks sold $3 billion in
commercial-mortgage backed bonds last week at the highest yields
this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>It has gotten harder to make money in the new issue
market, according to JPMorgan analysts led by Ed Reardon. </p>
<p>Underwriters accumulate loans over several months to pool
for sale as securities. A drop in values before the debt is sold
means banks won''t receive as much cash as anticipated when the
loans were made. Jumps in spreads may cause lenders to pull back
as it''s difficult to protect against price swings, UBS AG
analysts said in a July 21 report. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. boosted spreads
on BBB bonds by 200 basis points to 700 basis points more than
benchmark swap rates on a $1.5 billion offering sold last week,
according to people familiar with the sales, who declined to be
identified because terms aren''t public. </p>
<p>Similar debt rated BBB-, the lowest investment-grade
ranking, was sold to yield 295 basis points, or 2.95 percentage
points, over the benchmark in February. </p>
<p>Trimming Deals </p>
<p>Banks have already begun to trim deals, with one offering
in the pipeline cut to $1.5 billion from $2.3 billion, according
to JPMorgan. Wall Street has arranged about $21.6 billion of
commercial-mortgage bond sales this year, compared with $11.5
billion in all of 2010, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>The pull-back could impede a recovery in commercial real
estate prices, particularly for properties that aren''t in the
large, coastal cities where insurance companies are focused.
Financial institutions like insurers that hold mortgages on
their books have been snapping up lending assignments on the
best properties, leaving Wall Street to lend more in smaller
cities on less stable properties, according to the UBS analysts. </p>
<p>The revival of the CMBS market has been a component of the
stabilization, of commercial real estate prices, the UBS
analysts led by Ross Nussbaum said. A pullback from this
capital source would be a real concern as real estate values sit
at the intersection of cash flows, and the cost and
availability of financing. </p>
<p>Maturing Loans </p>
<p>Sales of commercial-mortgage bonds peaked at $234 billion
in 2007, helping fuel a boom in property prices, Bloomberg data
show. Issuance plummeted to $12.2 billion in 2008 as souring
subprime-home loans infected credit markets. The market stayed
shut until November 2009, choking off funding to borrowers with
debt coming due. </p>
<p>Concern that a wave of maturing loans could derail an
economic recovery prompted the Federal Reserve to include
commercial-mortgage bonds in its Term Asset-Backed Securities
Loan Facility, or TALF, one of the programs started to jumpstart
credit markets in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brother
Holdings Inc. in September 2008. </p>
<p>About $158 billion commercial mortgages packaged into bonds
will need to be refinanced through 2014, according to Citigroup
data. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs will pay 5.05 liras ($2.94) a share to Aksa''s
parent company, Kazanci Holding AS, which will invest the
proceeds in power generation, Aksa Chairman Cemil Kazanci said
today by telephone. The price isn''t certain and could change
at the closing of the transaction, he said. </p>
<p>Turkey''s energy industry is luring international companies
as electricity demand is set to grow by an average 6.3 percent
over the next 20 years, Hasan Koktas, head of the energy-market
regulator, said June 15. Italy''s Ansaldo STS SpA won a 640
million-euro ($919 million) order for an 865-megawatt plant this
month. Austria''s Verbund AG (VER) and OMV AG, Germany''s RWE AG and
U.S.-based AES Corp. have also bought power assets in Turkey. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs loaned Kazanci Holding $192 million as part
of the transaction, Kazanci said. The holding company pledged 43
percent of Aksa shares as collateral for the loan, which has a
maturity of a year and one week, he said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s offer represents a 22 percent premium to
Aksa''s volume-weighted average share price over the 20 days
through July 22, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Aksa
rose 33 kurus, or 8.7 percent, to 4.14 liras at the 5:30 p.m.
close in Istanbul, the biggest one-day gain since the stock
started trading in May 2010. </p>

repurchase rate by a quarter percentage point to 7.75 percent at
a policy review tomorrow, according to 20 of 22 economists in a
Bloomberg survey. The rest expect no change. </p>
<p>We think the RBI''s language will still have a hawkish
bias, but will importantly recognize that domestic demand,
particularly investment demand, has slowed considerably, and
that there are headwinds to growth from the global environment. </p>
<p>We continue to expect the RBI to hike by another 25 basis
points after July 26 in the remainder of 2011, with the next
hike likely by October...Inflation and inflation expectations
remain at levels so far above the RBI''s preferred target that
the central bank would want to err on the side of having done
too much rather than too little in its fight against
inflation. </p>

<p>Matthew Salem, head of commercial-
mortgage bond trading at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., has left the
bank, according to a person familiar with the situation. </p>
<p>Salem joined the New York-based firm from Morgan Stanley in
January 2006, according to records from the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-
based Goldman, declined to comment. Salem said he couldn''t
comment. </p>
<p>The fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets is cutting about
1,000 jobs after reporting a plunge in fixed-income revenue last
quarter that was bigger than analysts expected. The company''s
mortgage businesses were among those that produced
particularly lower revenues, Chief Financial Officer David A. Viniar said on a July 19 conference call. </p>
<p>Our mortgages results reflected the negative impact of
asset-price declines, reduced market liquidity and divergence
between our cash positions and corresponding hedges, Viniar
said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs and Citigroup Inc. sold $1.5 billion in
commercial-mortgage backed securities last week after
overhauling the deal to ease investor concern that the ratings
didn''t accurately reflect risks. The securities were issued with
the highest yields since sales of the debt revived in November
2009 as Europe''s debt crisis and debate over the U.S. debt
ceiling roiled markets. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE)''s Zyvox antibiotic can
cause potentially fatal central nervous system reactions in
patients who also take antidepressants that increase levels of
the brain chemical serotonin, U.S. regulators said. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s Zoloft and Pristiq, Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY)''s Cymbalta and
GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)''s Paxil and Wellbutrin are among 29
psychiatric drugs that patients may need to stop taking
temporarily when they require treatment with Zyvox, the Food and
Drug Administration said today in a drug safety communication. </p>
<p>Zyvox, used to treat some types of drug-resistant bacteria
including MSRA or methicillin-related Staphylococcus aureus,
skin infections and nosocomial pneumonia, can interact with the
antidepressants to cause a toxic reaction known as serotonin
syndrome in which excess amounts of the chemical build up in the
brain, according to the FDA. </p>
<p>Some deaths among patients who suffered such a reaction
were reported to the FDA''s adverse-event database, the agency
said. Pfizer, based in New York, reported $1.18 billion in
revenue from Zyvox last year. </p>
<p>Excess Serotonin </p>
<p>Confusion, memory issues, hyperactivity, excessive sweating
and muscle twitching are among the symptoms of excess serotonin
levels. Patients taking psychiatric drugs shouldn''t stop using
them without first consulting a health-care professional, the
FDA said. </p>
<p>The current U.S. package insert for Zyvox already
includes prominent information regarding the potential for
serotonergic interactions, the risk of serotonin syndrome and
the need for careful observation of patients prescribed Zyvox
who are on such agents, Kristen Neese, a Pfizer spokeswoman,
said today in an e-mail. The company hasn''t identified any new
safety signals related to those drug interactions, she said. </p>
<p>In an ongoing commitment to ensure patient safety, Pfizer
continually monitors all relevant safety information including
information pertaining to the concomitant use of Zyvox and
serotonergic antidepressant medications, Neese said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
bought $225 million of claims on bankrupt Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) from a French insurance company last week, may
have paid 35 cents on the dollar, or less, a trading executive
estimated. </p>
<p>The claims sold by CNP Assurances consisted of securities
issued by Lehman Brothers Treasury Co., a Lehman unit, according
to court filings this week. LBT claims are trading in the low
20s to the high 30s, while creditors of Lehman''s derivatives
unit are getting about 40 cents on the dollar and claims on its
commercial paper unit fetch 60 cents to 75 cents, said the
executive, who trades in the securities and declined to be named
because of company policy. </p>
<p>The difference in prices shows why the defunct firm''s
creditors fought with Chief Executive Officer Bryan Marsal to
improve their payout in a proposed $65 billion liquidation plan.
Marsal said July 1 that holders of more than $100 billion in
Lehman claims signed their support for his latest plan, which
allots more money to a group including Goldman Sachs, and less
to bondholders including Paulson  Co. </p>
<p>Big holders of LBT claims include Silver Point Capital LP
and Morgan Stanley. (MS) They combined with Goldman Sachs and other
large holders of claims on Lehman''s derivatives unit, Lehman
Brothers Special Financing, to promote a rival payout scheme to
Lehman''s and a second plan put forward by Paulson and the
California Public Employees'' Retirement System, or Calpers.
Marsal said his plan was a fair economic compromise between
the two. </p>
<p>Bigger Claim </p>
<p>CNP Assurance''s LBT securities bought by Goldman were part
of a bigger claim against Lehman of $687 million filed by the
seller, which also sold $101 million of LBT claims to Barclays
Plc, this week''s filings show. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs spokesman Michael Duvally and CNP spokeswoman
Florence de Montmarin didn''t immediately respond to e-mails
seeking comment. Barclays spokesman Mark Lane declined to
comment. Both banks are active traders of Lehman claims,
according to court filings. </p>
<p>Lehman aims to confirm its plan by year-end and start
distributing a significant amount of cash shortly after,
Lehman''s bankruptcy lawyer Lori Fife of Weil Gotshal  Manges
LLP has said. </p>
<p>Marsal aims to raise a total of $65 billion from the firm''s
assets in the next few years, to pay claims of more than $300
billion he has said. </p>
<p>Lehman filed for bankruptcy in 2008 with assets of $639
billion. </p>
<p>The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) offered to buy the
rest of India''s UTV Software Communications Ltd. (UTV) it doesn''t own
for as much as 20.1 billion rupees ($454 million), as the
world''s biggest media company seeks to expand in Bollywood. </p>
<p>Disney, which owns 50.44 percent of UTV, offered to buy all
remaining outstanding shares for no more than 1,000 rupees each,
the Mumbai-based company said in a statement today. That''s 11
percent higher than the closing price yesterday. </p>
<p>The buyout will give the Burbank, California based company
control of UTV, which makes and distributes movies and produces
television programs, as rising incomes boost spending on
entertainment in Asia''s third-largest economy. Revenue from the
film industry in India may grow to 132 billion rupees in 2015
from 83 billion rupees last year, KPMG said in March. </p>
<p>Part of Walt Disney''s rationale for increasing its stake
in UTV is to get more of a foothold in the film industry, said
Rohit Maheshwari, an analyst at KR Choksey Shares  Securities
Pvt. in Mumbai. It''s the right time to do this because UTV is
one of the few players in the market that''s been really
successful at making movies. </p>
<p>UTV rose 5.4 percent to 950.15 rupees at the 3:30 p.m.
close in Mumbai, the highest since December 2007. </p>
<p>Approvals Sought </p>
<p>Disney will buy a 19.82 percent stake held by the founders,
UTV said in the statement. The remaining stake will be purchased
from public shareholders. The company''s board today approved
Disney''s proposal and UTV will seek permission from the
shareholders, it said. </p>
<p>The proposed delisting is subject to regulatory and
shareholders'' approvals, Disney said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Given the multiple stages and the nature of the process,
a successful outcome is uncertain, Disney said. In the event
Disney is successful in acquiring sufficient outstanding shares
of UTV to delist, Rohinton Screwvala, current CEO of UTV, will
sell his shares to Disney and become managing director of The
Walt Disney Company India. </p>
<p>Bloomberg TV, owned by Bloomberg LP, is in a strategic
partnership with founders of UTV to operate Bloomberg UTV, a 24-

India. </p>

<p>Visa Inc. (V), the world''s biggest
payments network, said fiscal third-quarter profit rose 40
percent, beating analyst estimates for the 14th straight period,
as consumers boosted credit-card spending. </p>
<p>Net income for the three months ended June 30 climbed to $1
billion, or $1.43 a share, from $716 million, or 97 cents, in
the same period a year earlier, the San Francisco-based company
said today in a statement. Adjusted earnings per share, which
exclude the revaluation of the firm''s Visa Europe Ltd. put
option, was $1.26, three cents better than the average estimate
of 30 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Joseph W. Saunders  is
looking to expand abroad as new U.S. limits on debit-card swipe
fees charged to merchants threaten to crimp revenue growth at
home. Visa, which derived 59 percent of sales from the U.S. last
fiscal year, aims to generate more than half its revenue in
international markets by fiscal 2015, Saunders has said. </p>
<p>While the regulatory process generated headlines over the
past 13 months, the overwhelming majority of Visa''s revenues are
derived from products and geographies that are completely
untouched by these events, Saunders, 65, said today during a
conference call with analysts and investors. </p>
<p>Visa authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program
after buying back 13.7 million shares in the third quarter at an
average price of $77.36 for about $1.1 billion. </p>
<p>Net revenue increased 14 percent to $2.32 billion, beating
analysts'' estimates, as operating expenses rose 9.5 percent to
$977 million. </p>
<p>Worldwide Spending </p>
<p>Worldwide spending on Visa debit and credit cards, adjusted
for currency fluctuations, climbed 13 percent from the same
period last year to $941 billion, the company said. Spending by
consumers outside their home countries surged 14 percent.
Processed transactions rose 11 percent to 13 billion. U.S.
credit-card purchases climbed 9.8 percent to $224 billion,
compared with a 5.9 percent rise in the same period last year. </p>
<p>Visa said in a July 6 regulatory filing that it expects
revenue growth for fiscal 2012 in the high single-digit to low
double-digits range -- down from a 2011 projection of 11
percent to 15 percent -- after the Federal Reserve capped debit
fees at about half of the current rate. </p>
<p>Visa and No. 2 network MasterCard Inc. (MA), based in Purchase,
New York, set swipe fees and pass the money to card issuers
including Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) </p>
<p>Grind Higher'' </p>
<p>Visa climbed 34 cents to $88.09 at 5:32 p.m. in extended
New York trading. The shares have advanced 25 percent this year. </p>
<p>Shares can continue to grind higher in the coming months
as investors get more comfortable with the post-regulatory
competitive environment, JPMorgan analysts led by Tien-tsin Huang wrote in a July 25 research note. </p>
<p>Visa''s net income was buoyed by a non-cash, non-operating
gain of $122 million related to the revaluation of the Visa
Europe put option, according to an investor presentation.
Excluding that, the company reported adjusted profit of $883
million. </p>
<p>The Fed last month limited debit interchange fees to 21
cents per swipe, while letting banks collect an additional 5
basis points of each transaction, or almost 2 cents based on the
average debit ticket of $38. The central bank conditionally
approved an additional 1-cent adjustment for banks that follow
certain fraud-prevention standards. </p>
<p>Transaction Processing </p>
<p>The rule also requires card-issuers to give merchants the
choice of using at least two unaffiliated debit networks for
transaction processing, which will prevent networks from
negotiating exclusive deals with banks and threatens to erode
Visa''s lead in the U.S. Visa processed $1.05 trillion in U.S.
debit-card purchase transactions last year, more than triple
MasterCard''s $333 billion, company data show. </p>
<p>Visa handled 66 percent of 120.4 billion purchase
transactions worldwide last year, making it the largest payment
network, according to the Nilson Report, an industry newsletter.
MasterCard was second, with 25 percent, while Shanghai-based
China UnionPay Co. was third, with 4 percent. </p>
<p>American Express Co. (AXP), which handled 3.9 percent of
worldwide purchase transactions and is also the biggest credit-
card issuer by purchases, reported a record $1.3 billion second-
quarter profit on July 20. MasterCard, based in Purchase, New
York, is set to report second-quarter results on Aug. 3. </p>

<p>General Dynamics Corp. (GD), the maker of
Abrams tanks and Gulfstream business jets, said second- quarter
profit rose 2.3 percent, aided by a small increase in combat
systems revenue, and boosted its full-year profit estimate. </p>
<p>Profit from continuing operations increased to $666
million, or $1.79 a share, from $651 million, or $1.68 a share a
year earlier, the Falls Church, Virginia-based company said in a
statement. The average of 20 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was
for $1.72 per share. Sales fell 2.8 percent to $7.88 billion. </p>
<p>With U.S. defense spending projected to decline or stay
flat in the next decade, Chief Executive Officer Jay Johnson has
said acquisitions are very important to General Dynamics,
both to expand its current portfolio and to fill gaps. </p>
<p>The company anticipates being very acquisitive,
spending as much as $1 billion on deals in the areas of combat
systems, information technology and aerospace, Johnson said in
June. The company had $2.48 billion in cash and other liquid
securities for the quarter ending March and raised $1.5 billion
July 5 by issuing five-year notes. </p>
<p>The company raised full-year profit to the range of $7.15
to $7.20 compared with earlier estimates of $7 to $7.10 a share.
Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expected profit of $7.13 a share. </p>
<p>General Dynamics fell $1.69, or 2.4 percent, to $68.63 at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </p>
<p>Debt Ceiling </p>
<p>Negotiations between President Barack Obama''s
administration and lawmakers over U.S. debt limit and budget
deficits will play a role in determining future U.S. defense
spending, Johnson said in a conference call with investors
today. </p>
<p>Obama on April 13 announced cuts of $400 billion in
national security spending through 2023, in addition to the $78
billion five-year reduction in the defense budget proposed in
January. Some lawmakers have proposed deeper cuts in defense
spending as part of the budget negotiations. </p>
<p>Defense Secretary Leon Panetta is conducting a review of
the Pentagon''s long-term spending plans to determine how best to
scale back the department''s budget. </p>
<p>Revenue and profit at General Dynamics'' Aerospace, Marine
Systems, Information Systems and Technology units declined
during the quarter. Earnings at the Aerospace unit, maker of
Gulfstream jets, fell 10.3 percent to $209 million. </p>
<p>Gulfstream''s new G650 model business jet that has resumed
flight tests after an April 2 crash killed four crew members is
still in a restrictive phase of testing, Johnson said.
Still, the company expects to deliver 10 to 12 jets later this
year. </p>
<p>Combat Systems </p>
<p>Combat Systems sales rose less than 1 percent, to $2.12
billion, aided by U.S. Army orders for rockets, and profit
gained 1.4 percent to $299 million. </p>
<p>The U.S. Army''s review of its combat vehicle needs will
inform decisions on all major platforms, Johnson said on the
conference call. </p>
<p>The company is bullish on prospects for its Information
Systems and Technology unit, whose sales fell slightly in the
quarter and profit declined 4.5 percent to $575 million. The
unit is aggressively taking out costs to remain competitive,
Johnson said. </p>
<p>The Marine Systems unit, which builds nuclear-powered
submarines and Navy destroyers, intends to bid for the new
family of DDG-51 destroyers, Johnson said. U.S. </p>
<p>Even with the shipbuilding budget under pressure, the Navy
still needs large surface combat vessels. The requirement for
the Navy''s new nuclear submarines also remains inviolate, he
said. </p>

<p>Morgan Properties Trust, a partner
with American International Group Inc. (AIG) in the 2007 purchase of
thousands of U.S. apartments, is seeking $800 million in an
initial public offering. </p>
<p>Morgan Properties announced its IPO today in a filing with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The King of
Prussia, Pennsylvania-based company didn''t say how many shares
it will offer or at what price. </p>
<p>The real estate investment trust, led by Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Mitchell Morgan, owns 94 properties in middle-
income suburbs of Philadelphia, New York, Baltimore and
Washington, according to the regulatory filing. Total revenue
climbed by almost 50 percent to $130.8 million last year. </p>
<p>These properties give them a big portfolio that''s
generating a lot of income that will be attractive to public
market investors, said Ben Thypin, director of market analysis
for Real Capital Analytics Inc., a New York-based researcher.
Prior to this, they didn''t have the scale to justify being a
public firm. </p>
<p>Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS) are leading the offering. The
company, which plans to list its shares on the New York Stock
Exchange under the symbol MPT, expects to use the proceeds to
repay debt. </p>
<p>Mitchell Morgan, 56, is the REIT''s largest shareholder,
according to the filing. A phone message left at the company''s
general number wasn''t immediately returned. </p>
<p>Deal With AIG </p>
<p>AIG in 2007 bought 86 apartment complexes, mostly in New
Jersey and Pennsylvania, in partnership with Morgan for $1.9
billion from Kushner Cos., a New York-based company then headed
by Charles Kushner and his son Jared. The deal was close to the
peak of U.S. real estate values, which plunged more than 40
percent over the next two years. </p>
<p>Morgan sued AIG in February 2009, saying the insurer''s
self-induced financial collapse led it to delay payments for
apartment renovations. The complaint referred to the 2007 deal
as one of the largest private offerings of multifamily
projects ever offered for sale. </p>
<p>AIG began considering the sale of its stake in 2010 as it
sought to repay loans within its $182.3 billion government
rescue package. </p>
<p>In January, Morgan bought out its partners in 76 apartment
properties valued at about $1.5 billion, the company said in a
statement. AIG was among the sellers, the Philadelphia Inquirer
reported on Jan. 11. </p>
<p>The insurer took title to some other apartments it once co-
owned with Morgan, the newspaper said. Earlier this month, AIG
sold 2,200 apartments acquired in the Kushner deal to Vantage
Properties LLC and Angelo, Gordon  Co. for $241.5 million. </p>

<p>Geoff Lewis, Hong Kong-based head of
investment services at JP Morgan Asset Management, comments on
China''s effort to become a more consumption-driven economy and
the potential of shale gas. </p>
<p>He made the comments today to reporters in Singapore: </p>
<p>China we believe has made some reasonable progress toward
shifting its economy away from dependence on investment. In the
first half of 2011, consumption accounted for 48 percent of GDP
growth. That is up from 37 percent in the calendar of 2010. </p>
<p>China knows it is in its own best interest to move away
from export dependence at a relatively rapid rate. </p>
<p>They are doing more to remove their share of global
imbalances than you might say the U.S. administration with all
their checks and balances are achieving on the other side of the
Pacific. </p>
<p>We think that it would be wrong to bet against Beijing at
this point. </p>
<p>On shale gas as an alternative energy: </p>
<p>Longer term, I think shale gas is going to offer an
alternative to oil for auto transport and heating purposes.
There is as much shale gas in Europe and there''s a ton of it in
Poland and it is a big changer. </p>
<p>It is going to reduce OPEC''s monopoly strength. It''s
going to reduce Russia''s bargaining power and it''s going to be a
lesson to smaller economies like Morocco, where you shouldn''t
put all your eggs into one basket as it depends 98 percent of
its exports on liquefied natural gas in Europe. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. energy company, agreed to sell Tokyo Electric Power Co. 3.1
million metric tons of liquefied natural gas annually from its
proposed Wheatstone project in Western Australia. </p>
<p>The fuel will be supplied for as long as 20 years, San
Ramon, California-based Chevron said in a statement today. The
oil and gas producer is also in talks to sell a stake in the
A$25 billion ($28 billion) venture to the Japanese utility known
as Tepco as part of the accord, Chevron said. </p>
<p>In a preliminary agreement signed in December 2009, Chevron
had said Tepco would buy 4.1 million tons of LNG a year and
purchase an 11.25 percent stake in Wheatstone. Colin Barnett,
premier of Western Australia, had at the time valued the fuel-
supply contract at A$90 billion. </p>
<p>Chevron calls the Wheatstone project and its A$43 billion
Gorgon LNG development in Australia the centerpieces of its
expansion plans. A final investment decision for Wheatstone
remains on schedule for 2011, it said today. The environment
regulator of Western Australia last month recommended approval
for the venture with stringent conditions. </p>
<p>Chevron and Woodside Petroleum Ltd. are among suppliers of
Australian LNG that may benefit as countries put plans to build
nuclear reactors on hold after the March 11 earthquake and
tsunami crippled Tepco''s Fukushima Dai-Ichi atomic power plant,
analysts including Deutsche Bank AG''s John Hirjee have said. </p>
<p>Wheatstone Output </p>
<p>Wheatstone will initially produce 8.9 million tons of LNG a
year when it starts in 2016, Chevron said in March. The project
may eventually have as many as six units producing 25 million
tons of LNG annually, the company said last year. </p>
<p>Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), also a Gorgon partner, agreed
earlier this year to acquire an interest in Wheatstone. That
transaction left Chevron with 73.6 percent of the project and
gave The Hague-based Shell 6.4 percent. Apache Corp. has 13
percent and Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Co. 7 percent. </p>
<p>Apache and Kuwait''s state-owned oil company agreed in 2009
to supply natural gas to Wheatstone in exchange for stakes in
the venture. </p>
<p>Chevron has initial agreements to sell Wheatstone LNG to
Kyushu Electric Power Co. and Korea Gas Corp. (036460) Kyushu also
intends to become a stakeholder, according to Chevron''s website. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. pulled its
buy rating on BMFBovespa SA (BVMF3), the operator of Latin
America''s biggest securities exchange, on concern a new
government tax on currency derivatives will erode trading. </p>
<p>BMF Bovespa fell 1.6 percent to 8.89 reais at 4:15 p.m. in
New York, the lowest since April 2009. That followed a 5.4
percent plunge yesterday sparked by the government''s creation of
a 1 percent tax on short dollar positions with a notional value
of more than $10 million in the futures market. </p>
<p>Brazil''s National Monetary Council, known as CMN, may
increase the derivatives tax up to 25 percent, according to the
government decree signed by President Dilma Rousseff. The
measure is the latest in a series of moves by Brazilian policy
makers to stem a 48 percent rally in the real since December
2008 that is crimping exporters'' profits. </p>
<p>These measures are going to hurt the BMF, Nathan Blanche, a partner and economist at Sao Paulo-based consulting
firm Tendencias Consultoria Integrada, said in a telephone
interview. The most they can achieve is to drive these
operations to other markets, including Chicago. </p>
<p>The number of dollar future contracts traded on the BMF
Bovespa was 328,000 as of 4:22 p.m. New York time, according to
the exchange. Yesterday, a total of 374,766 contracts traded,
and 388,365 traded July 26. </p>
<p>Significant Threat'' </p>
<p>While the details regarding how the CMN will use these
new powers are sparse, it represents significant threat for
government interference in the exchange''s operations, including
its ability to determine conditions for trades, Goldman Sachs''
analysts including Carlos G. Macedo wrote. They cut the stock to
neutral from buy. </p>
<p>Brazil will begin collecting the new tax on bets against
the dollar in the country''s futures market on Oct. 5, according
to the Finance Ministry. Tax authorities need extra time to
develop a system for collecting the levy, the ministry said in a
statement. </p>
<p>Brazilian banks are hesitant to place new bets in the
dollar futures market because they don''t know how this is
going to impact their positions, said Mario Battistel, head of
currency trading at Fair Corretora de Cambio e Valores in Sao
Paulo. </p>
<p>The real fell 0.8 percent to 1.5678 per dollar after a 1.1
percent decline yesterday. </p>

<p>The heads of commercial mortgage
bond trading for Citigroup Inc. (C) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
have left the firms this week as the market is roiled by
sovereign debt crises and new deals are cut back or put on hold. </p>
<p>Warren Geiger left Citigroup, according to a statement
today from the New York-based lender. He joined from American
International Group Inc. in 2004, according to records from the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. His exit followed the
departure of Matthew Salem from Goldman Sachs, a person familiar
with the situation said earlier this week. </p>
<p>The banks were forced to pull a $1.5 billion commercial-
mortgage bond offering that had already been placed with
investors after Standard  Poor''s said yesterday it wouldn''t
rate the notes because of a discrepancy in how it graded the
transaction. SP''s decision came after investors pushed back on
deal terms and demanded higher yields on $3 billion of bonds
sold last week. </p>
<p>The CMBS market remains a challenge going forward and
we''re still at an early stage of the recovery, said Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in New York in a
telephone interview. The rating agencies are much more in
control than perhaps they were prior to the crisis. </p>
<p>Geiger''s departure is unrelated to the review by SP of its
ratings on the offering, Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a spokeswoman
for Citigroup, said today in an e-mailed statement. The
suggestion that it is related is totally false, she said. </p>
<p>Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Planned Sale </p>
<p>Yields on commercial mortgage bonds have risen as investors
pull back amid a rush of offerings. Deutsche Bank AG and UBS AG
cut a planned sale of commercial-mortgage backed securities by
more than 36 percent to $1.4 billion, according to people
familiar with the sale. </p>
<p>The Goldman Sachs, Citigroup deal won''t close as planned
because SP is reviewing its criteria for commercial mortgage-
backed securities and can''t provide a rating, the banks said in
a joint statement. </p>
<p>The ratings company won''t give debt grades to any new
transactions that are based on certain criteria, New York-based
SP said in a separate statement. </p>
<p>Ratings are a condition precedent to closing and
settlement, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup said in their
statement. Standard  Poor''s had previously informed Goldman
and Citi that they were prepared to rate the transaction, they
said. </p>
<p>SP Review </p>
<p>SP is reviewing the application of our conduit/fusion
CMBS criteria in relation to the calculation of debt service
coverage ratios, the risk assessor said in its statement dated
yesterday. ''''The review was prompted by the discovery of
potentially conflicting methods of calculation.'''' </p>
<p>The banks had overhauled the transaction after investors
demanded more protection from losses amid concern that ratings
from SP and Morningstar Inc. didn''t accurately reflect the
risks, people familiar with the matter said last week. They
placed the securities totaling $1.5 billion with investors last
week, according to people familiar with the transaction. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs and Citigroup boosted the buffer that
protects AAA securities from loan defaults by increasing the
amount of lower-ranked debt that is first to absorb losses, the
people said. The so-called credit enhancement on the highest-
graded debt was raised to 20 percent from 14.5 percent. </p>
<p>Peaked in 2007 </p>
<p>The extra yield investors demand to hold the top-ranked
portion of bonds backed by commercial mortgages has risen 5
basis points to 214 basis points over Treasuries since June,
according to Barclays Capital data. </p>
<p>More than $21 billion of commercial-mortgage bonds have
been sold this year, compared with $11.5 billion in all of 2010,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales of the debt
peaked at $234 billion in 2007, helping fuel a boom in property
prices. Issuance plummeted to $12.2 billion in 2008 as souring
subprime-home loans infected credit markets. The market stayed
closed until November 2009, choking off funding to borrowers
with debt coming due. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) reported lower-
than-estimated second-quarter profit as production growth lagged
analysts'' forecasts and refining earnings outside the U.S.
declined. </p>
<p>Per-share profit was 16 cents less than than the $2.34 a
share forecast, based on the average estimate of 18 analysts in
a Bloomberg survey. Net income rose 41 percent to $10.68
billion, or $2.18 a share, from $7.56 billion, or $1.60, a year
earlier, the Irving, Texas-based company said today. </p>
<p>Exxon said second-quarter revenue climbed 36 percent from a
year earlier to about $125.5 billion. </p>
<p>Non-U.S. refining earnings fell 20 percent from a year
earlier to about $622 million. Oil and natural-gas production in
the quarter rose 10 percent to about 4.4 million barrels of oil
equivalent a day, less than the 12 percent growth expected by
Philip Weiss, an analyst at Argus Research in New York. Exxon''s
gas output in Europe tumbled 18 percent and the company relied
on last year''s purchase of XTO Energy to boost U.S. gas
production. </p>
<p>The earnings improvement is not as strong as some of its
peers, relative to last year, said Brian Youngberg, an analyst
at Edward Jones in St. Louis who has a hold rating on Exxon
shares and owns none. Part of that is attributable to the XTO
acquisition, which increases Exxon''s reliance on North American
natural-gas prices, which have remained weak compared to oil. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) plans to send out
information on its infant-nutrition unit to potential bidders in
September, kicking off an auction that may fetch as much as
$10.5 billion, said people with knowledge of the process. </p>
<p>Nestle SA, Danone SA (BN) and Abbott (ABT) Laboratories have spoken to
financial advisers about the business, and are likely to bid,
said the people, who declined to be identified because the talks
are private. Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. (MJN) and Unilever, the
second-biggest consumer-goods company, may also examine offers,
they said. </p>
<p>A successful bidder would gain operations with sales
approaching $2 billion annually and baby-formula brands
including SMA Gold and Promil Gold. If Pfizer fails to fetch the
price it''s seeking for the infant-nutrition unit, it could spin
out the business into a separate company. </p>
<p>The iron is definitely hot, and Pfizer would like to
strike, said Damien Conover, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. in
Chicago, in a telephone interview. There are some synergies
that these folks could have that would outbid what the market
would pay for the unit as a standalone spinoff, he said. </p>
<p>Possible buyers are currently studying the industry to
assess its size and growth potential, said one of the people.
They are also working to determine how much rivals would want to
pay, the person said. Potential bidders and financial advisers
have been preparing for a sale after Pfizer said in February
that it was reviewing its businesses. </p>
<p>Pfizer rose 6 cents, or less than 1 percent, to $19.36 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has
gained 29 percent in the past 12 months. </p>
<h2>Emerging Markets </h2>
<p>The formula unit has generated interest because it serves
emerging markets like Asia, and because the products don''t vary
much region to region, unlike most consumer goods, said the
people. Because there are multiple competitors in those markets,
it''s unlikely that antitrust legislation would get in the way of
a deal, Conover said. </p>
<p>Our decisions on strategic alternatives will continue to
be driven by what creates the best after-tax value to our
shareholders, Joan Campion, a spokeswoman for Pfizer, said in
a phone interview. </p>
<p>Spokesmen at Nestle, Danone, Abbott, Unilever and Mead
Johnson declined to comment on potential bids. </p>
<h2>Biggest Deal </h2>
<p>The Pfizer sale would be the largest of a vitamin or
nutrition company in more than a decade, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The biggest deal in that sector was
Carlyle Group''s $3.8 billion acquisition of vitamin maker NBTY
Inc. last year, the data show. </p>
<p>Nestle (NESN) had 8.06 billion Swiss francs ($10 billion) in cash
and near-cash items as of Dec. 31, according to company filings.
Danone had 1.05 billion euros ($1.51 billion), while Abbott had
$3.65 billion. </p>
<p>Pfizer acquired the infant-nutrition division in its $68
billion takeover of Wyeth less than two years ago. The unit may
fetch 16 times to 20 times earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization, estimated at $500 million to $525
million for 2010, people familiar with the situation said. That
would indicate a value of $8 billion to $10.5 billion, and the
price could be higher depending on this year''s performance. </p>
<p>The unit is forecast to have Ebitda of $550 million to $575
million on sales of about $2 billion for 2011, one person said. </p>
<p>By comparison, Mead Johnson trades at about 18.9 times last
year''s Ebitda of $776.8 million. Claudia Lenz, an analyst at
Bank Vontobel AG in Zurich, said Mead should have a higher
valuation than the Pfizer unit because Mead has better operating
margins and is more focused on the U.S., a key infant-formula
market. </p>
<h2>Shedding Assets </h2>
<p>Pfizer''s nutrition business, which also makes vitamins for
pregnant women, accounted for about 3 percent of its $67.8
billion in total sales last year. Pfizer this month disclosed
plans to shed that operation, as well as the animal health
division, following a review of its businesses not tied to drug
discovery. The New York-based drugmaker is facing the loss of
exclusivity for its biggest product, the cholesterol pill
Lipitor. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. is advising on the animal health
business, while Morgan Stanley and Centerview Partners are
working on the nutrition unit, according to a statement from
Pfizer on July 7. JPMorgan also is seeking a role in advising a
potential suitor for the nutrition business, the people said.
Financial advisers are trying to get mandates to work with the
four likeliest bidders, especially Nestle and Danone, said the
people. Tasha Pelio, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined to
comment. </p>
<h2>Two Teams </h2>
<p>There will be two teams of advisers from Morgan Stanley and
Centerview running the infant-nutrition process, one focused on
the sale of the unit and the other on a potential spin of it
into a separate company, said one of the people. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley and Centerview advisers have spent months
putting together stand-alone financial data on the infant-nutrition business while also assessing what companies could bid
and what antitrust issues companies such as Vevey, Switzerland-based Nestle could have, said one of the people. </p>
<p>Pfizer said earlier this month that it doesn''t anticipate
making announcements about options for the assets until sometime
next year, and that any deal could take as long as two years to
complete. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s senior
executives view a potential downgrade of the U.S.''s credit
rating as manageable, Citigroup Inc. (C) said in a note to
investors today. </p>
<p>Citigroup analysts led by Keith Horowitz wrote that they
met yesterday with Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer David A. Viniar, Co-Head of Securities Harvey M. Schwartz, and Co-Head
of Investment Banking David M. Solomon. </p>
<p>Management noted that they have run through various
scenarios and implied the risk of a U.S. debt downgrade seems
manageable, with the important caveat that there is always the
possibility of more severe knock-on effects, the note said.
New York-based Goldman Sachs noted that collateral agreements
related to Treasuries are not dependent on Treasury ratings. </p>
<p>Wall Street firms including Goldman Sachs, the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, are preparing for a potential
downgrade of the nation''s AAA rating if politicians are unable
to agree on a plan to raise the debt ceiling and reduce the
budget deficit. </p>
<p>Banks and other financial companies frequently use U.S.
Treasuries as collateral for loans in so-called repurchase-
agreements, or repos, and the prospect of a downgrade has raised
questions about whether such loans would become more expensive. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs has seen relatively limited reaction in
fixed-income markets and some negative moves in equities, which
reinforces the belief that the impacts are more likely to be
short-term as investors are not questioning the ability of the
U.S. government to actually repay their debt, the note said. </p>
<p>Rules governing money-market fund investments in Treasuries
aren''t typically tied to credit ratings, according to the note.
If a fixed-income fund is required to maintain a minimum average
credit rating, they''re more likely to sell lower-rated debt,
such as bonds rated BBB or lower, to rebalance the portfolio,
the note said. </p>

<p>Visa Inc. (V), the world''s biggest
payments network, said fiscal third-quarter profit rose 40
percent, beating analyst estimates, as consumers boosted credit-
card spending. </p>
<p>Net income for the three months ended June 30 climbed to $1
billion, or $1.43 a share, from $716 million, or 97 cents, in
the same period a year earlier, the San Francisco-based company
said yesterday in a statement. Adjusted earnings per share,
which exclude the revaluation of the firm''s Visa Europe Ltd. put
option, were $1.26, or 3 cents better than the average estimate
of 30 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Joseph W. Saunders is
looking to expand abroad as new U.S. limits on debit-card swipe
fees charged to merchants threaten to crimp revenue growth at
home. Visa, which got about 59 percent of sales from the U.S.
last fiscal year, aims to generate more than half its revenue in
international markets by fiscal 2015, Saunders has said. </p>
<p>While the regulatory process generated headlines over the
past 13 months, the overwhelming majority of Visa''s revenues are
derived from products and geographies that are completely
untouched by these events, Saunders, 65, said during a
conference call with analysts and investors. </p>
<p>Visa authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program
after spending about $1.1 billion in the third quarter to buy
back 13.7 million shares at an average price of $77.36. Revenue
increased 14 percent to $2.32 billion, beating analysts''
estimates, as operating expenses rose 9.5 percent to $977
million, the company said. </p>
<p>Credit, Debit </p>
<p>Worldwide spending on Visa credit and debit cards, adjusted
for currency fluctuations, climbed 13 percent from the same
period last year to $941 billion, the company said. Cross-border
volume, a measure of spending by consumers outside their home
countries, surged 14 percent. </p>
<p>Processed transactions worldwide rose 11 percent to 13
billion as consumers continue to shift from cash and checks to
electronic payments. </p>
<p>U.S. credit-card purchases climbed 9.8 percent to $224
billion, compared with a 5.9 percent rise in the same period
last year. Spending on debit cards in the U.S. advanced 11
percent to $295 billion, slower than the 21 percent expansion
Visa reported for the fiscal third quarter of 2010. </p>
<p>The company said in a July 6 regulatory filing that it
expects revenue growth for fiscal 2012 in the high single-
digit to low double-digits range -- down from a 2011
projection of 11 percent to 15 percent -- after the Federal
Reserve capped debit fees at about half of the current rate. </p>
<p>Financial Impact'' </p>
<p>Visa will bear the majority of the financial impact of
the new regulations in fiscal 2012, Saunders said. </p>
<p>Visa and No. 2 network MasterCard Inc. (MA), based in Purchase,
New York, set swipe fees and pass the money to card issuers
including Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) </p>
<p>Visa has advanced 25 percent this year, closing at $87.75
yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. MasterCard, which is
set to report second-quarter results on Aug. 3, has climbed 35
percent in 2011. </p>
<p>Shares can continue to grind higher in the coming months
as investors get more comfortable with the post-regulatory
competitive environment, JPMorgan analysts led by Tien-tsin Huang wrote in a July 25 research note. Huang has an
overweight rating on Visa. </p>
<p>Net income was buoyed by a non-cash, non-operating gain of
$122 million related to the revaluation of the Visa Europe put
option, according to an investor presentation. Excluding that,
the company reported adjusted profit of $883 million. </p>
<p>New Formula </p>
<p>The Fed last month limited debit fees to 21 cents per swipe
and will let issuers tack on 5 basis points of each transaction,
or almost 2 cents based on the average debit ticket of $38. The
central bank conditionally approved a 1-cent adjustment for
lenders that follow certain fraud-prevention standards. The new
fees are set to take effect Oct. 1, replacing a formula that
averages 1.14 percent of the purchase price, or about 44 cents. </p>
<p>The new rule also requires card-issuers to give merchants
the choice of at least two unaffiliated debit networks for
transaction processing, which will prevent networks from
negotiating exclusive deals with banks and threatens to erode
Visa''s lead in the U.S. Visa processed $1.05 trillion in U.S.
debit-card purchase transactions last year, more than triple
MasterCard''s $333 billion, company data show. </p>
<p>Visa handled 66 percent of 120.4 billion purchase
transactions worldwide in 2010, making it the largest payments
network, according to the Nilson Report, an industry newsletter.
MasterCard was second, with 25 percent, and Shanghai-based China
UnionPay Co. was third, with 4 percent. </p>
<p>American Express Co. (AXP), which handled 3.9 percent of
worldwide purchase transactions and is also the biggest credit-
card issuer by purchases, reported a record $1.3 billion second-
quarter profit on July 20. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) must pay $70 million
for infringing an Alcatel-Lucent patent used in versions of
Microsoft''s Outlook program and two other applications, a
federal jury in San Diego said today. </p>
<p>Alcatel-Lucent, France''s largest maker of
telecommunications equipment, asked for as much as $75 million
in damages. Microsoft''s lawyers asked jurors to limit the award
to $5 million. </p>
<p>The technology, called the Day patent, was described in
court during the as involving a touch-screen form entry.
Microsoft argued it''s simply a date-picker function and
isn''t used with e-mail, the most popular function on Outlook.
Paris-based Alcatel-Lucent described the technology as a tool
that plays a central role in the entire operation of
Outlook. </p>
<p>Alcatel-Lucent is obviously pleased with the verdict and
the jury''s recognition in the value of the Day patent that
Microsoft infringed, Luke Dauchot, a lawyer for Alcatel-Lucent,
said after the verdict. </p>
<p>A different jury in San Diego in 2008 found that Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft had infringed the patent and awarded
$358 million in damages. An appeals court, upholding the
infringement verdict, overturned the damages award, finding the
calculation lacked sufficient evidentiary support. The case was
sent back for retrial on damages only. </p>
<p>Genuine Apportionment'' </p>
<p>We continue to maintain that current law requires a
genuine apportionment of damages when the infringement is
directed to a small feature of a feature-rich product, David Howard, Microsoft''s deputy general counsel, said in an e-mail
today. We are reviewing the verdict in that light and
considering next steps. </p>
<p>Dauchot told the jury in his closing argument the patent
was pervasive in the affected programs and helped provide an
easy, fast, reliable way of using Outlook. </p>
<p>He told jurors Outlook wouldn''t have been as popular
without the patent''s technology and that Microsoft''s own survey
showed that Outlook is the most frequently used Microsoft Office
application by consumers. </p>
<p>Microsoft attorney Juanita Brooks told jurors that Alcatel-
Lucent is trying to win money for a patent that is of little
significance to Microsoft because the company''s patent portfolio
was not making enough money. </p>
<p>The case is Lucent Technologies Inc. v. Gateway Inc., 07-
cv-2000 U.S. District Court, Southern District of California
(San Diego). </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX) said net income
climbed 43 percent to a second-quarter record as rising energy
demand and the Libyan civil war drove crude above $125 a barrel
for the first time in 2 1/2 years. </p>
<p>Higher crude prices triggered contractual clauses in some
nations that reduced the company''s share of output, pushing
Chevron''s worldwide production down 1.9 percent to the
equivalent of 2.69 million barrels of crude a day. The full-year
output estimate was lowered by 2.2 percent today to 2.73 million
barrels a day, due in part to the crude rally. </p>
<p>Chevron fell $1.01 to $104.02 at 4:22 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. Crude futures traded in New
York dropped by $1.74 to $95.70 a barrel, dragging down an index
of 13 oil companies by about 1 percent. </p>
<p>Net income for the second quarter rose to $7.73 billion, or
$3.85 a share, from $5.41 billion, or $2.70, a year earlier, San
Ramon, California-based Chevron said today in a statement. The
result was 23 cents higher than the average estimate from six
analysts in a Bloomberg survey. </p>
<p>Profit from oil and natural-gas sales jumped 51 percent to
$6.87 billion as the price Chevron received for each barrel of
output outside the U.S. rose to $107 from $71 a year earlier,
the statement said. With 74 percent of its oil output located in
countries other than the U.S., Chevron was able to capitalize on
the premium price for London-traded Brent oil, which increased
at five times the pace of U.S. crude prices this year. </p>
<p>Global Demand </p>
<p>Their international assets and oil fields really carried
the day, said Gianna Bern, founder of Chicago-based Brookshire
Advisory  Research. They have a lot of higher-priced Brent
barrels, and that''s what propelled these impressive results. </p>
<p>Sales rose 31 percent to $66.7 billion. Chevron had $13.3
billion in cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, according to
the statement. </p>
<p>Worldwide demand for crude-based fuels such as diesel and
gasoline jumped by 740,000 barrels a day during the second
quarter, according to the International Energy Agency in Paris.
