&lt;p&gt;RWE AG (RWE) is working with Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) as Germany&#8217;s second-largest utility considers a sale
of its Npower unit in the U.K., according to a person familiar
with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The examination of the business, which had revenue of 7.8
billion euros ($11.3 billion) last year, is preliminary and the
Essen, Germany-based company may not pursue a sale, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the discussions
are private. A person familiar with the matter said in February
that RWE was considering a sale of U.K. assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RWE plans to raise as much as 8 billion euros with asset
divestments by 2013 to cut debt after its borrowings surged with
the acquisition of a Dutch competitor in 2009. The utility also
faces a tax on its German nuclear power plants that will reduce
earnings starting this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The U.K. continues to be a core market of RWE,&#8221; Peter
Hoscheidt, a spokesman for the company, said to Bloomberg News
in an e-mailed statement today. &#8220;Beyond that, we don&#8217;t have any
further comment on market speculation, which this is.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Npower supplies natural gas and power and owns fossil-fuel-
fired electricity plants, according to its website. RWE&#8217;s
renewable-energy unit, called Innogy, operates about 550
megawatts of wind turbines and hydropower facilities in the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RWE may sell Npower, one of the U.K.&#8217;s six leading energy
companies, for 5 billion pounds ($8 billion), the London-based
Times reported today, citing unidentified people familiar with
the matter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s anti-smoking pill
Chantix may receive new warnings from U.S. regulators after a
study released today found the drug increased the risk of
hospitalizations for heart problems by 72 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report, led by researchers at Johns Hopkins University,
analyzed 14 Pfizer-sponsored drug trials with 8,216 patients and
found about one new heart attack or similar disorder for every
400 patients taking Chantix. The U.S. Food and Drug
Administration is examining the study and may consider new
warnings, Curtis Rosenbraugh, director of the agency&#8217;s office of
drug evaluation, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chantix revenue has declined since the FDA warned in 2009
that the medicine may increase suicides and erratic behavior.
Regulators last month added a warning for patients with a
history of heart disease, based on a 700-patient study. The new
analysis shows the greatest increased risk may be among patients
with no signs of heart problems, said Sonal Singh, lead author
of today&#8217;s study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I stopped prescribing Chantix several months ago, as soon
as we found out about this data,&#8221; said Singh, a doctor and
professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in
Baltimore. &#8220;I&#8217;m not saying that nobody should use it, but I
think people should have this information. They should decide
whether the risk is acceptable to them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Disagrees &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chantix affects dopamine, a chemical in the brain involved
in controlling mood and behavior. Because dopamine triggers a
positive mood response, regulating its levels can remove some of
the pleasure derived from smoking. The drug is the most
effective pill to help smokers quit, and is about as effective
as nicotine-replacement supplements available as patches,
chewing gum, lozenges, nasal sprays and inhalers, Singh said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pfizer disagrees with the interpretation of the data,&#8221;
said Gail Cawkwell, vice president of medical affairs at New
York-based Pfizer, in an e-mail. &#8220;The health benefits of
quitting smoking are immediate and substantial. Pfizer strongly
believes in and supports Chantix as an important treatment
option.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chantix had sales of $755 million last year, down 14
percent from its high of $883 million in 2007, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increased risk of heart problems while taking Chantix,
if confirmed, doesn&#8217;t cancel out the benefits of taking the drug
to quit smoking, J. Taylor Hays, a doctor who specializes in
nicotine dependence at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota,
wrote in an editorial published with Singh&#8217;s study in the
Canadian Medical Association Journal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worst Outcome &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The worst outcome of this study would be for health-care
providers to abandon&#8221; Chantix, Hays wrote. &#8220;The risk for
serious cardiovascular adverse events is low and is greatly
outweighed by the benefits of diminishing the truly
heartbreaking effects of smoking.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An FDA staff review from 2006 shows the agency was aware of
a potential link between Chantix and serious heart
complications. At the time, two researchers were asked to
independently review each reported heart problem to rule out
cases that were incorrectly reported or not related to the drug.
On closer inspection, one reviewer said there was a 16 percent
added risk of heart problems with Chantix, while the second
reviewer found an 8 percent decreased risk, according to the
staff documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We saw a swing going anywhere from favorable to
unfavorable,&#8221; said the FDA&#8217;s Rosenbraugh. &#8220;When you get
results like that it&#8217;s hard to draw a definitive conclusion.
It&#8217;s not something we would label. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Label Uncertain &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Dr. Singh has added to what we have seen and is helping
to define the picture better,&#8221; Rosenbraugh said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure
until we can further evaluate the study whether it&#8217;s going to
change the label or not, but I can assure you this is something
we&#8217;re very concerned about and are taking very seriously.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any risk from the Chantix needs to be evaluated against the
benefits of quitting smoking, he said. The drug is taken for a
short period of time to help people quit, while the significant
health risks of continued smoking continue for a lifetime. For
long-term smokers, more than half will die from complications
related to their habit, according to a study of British doctors
in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to send the message that people shouldn&#8217;t
try to quit smoking,&#8221; Rosenbraugh said. &#8220;We just want to send
the message that you should be cautious and look for
cardiovascular symptoms should they occur.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Analysis &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new heart study, 52 patients had serious
cardiovascular complications among 4,908 patients taking
Chantix, compared with 27 hospitalizations among 3,308 patients
taking a placebo. The risk of Chantix complications was doubled
for patients with no history of heart disease, Singh said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The studies included in today&#8217;s report ranged from 7 to 52
weeks in duration. It&#8217;s not clear whether the added heart risk
persists after treatment ends, Singh said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)&#8217;s competing drug, Zyban, has been found
to cause irregular heartbeats and increases in blood pressure in
some patients, according to the FDA. The 700-patient study cited
by the FDA last month was conducted by Pfizer to assess the risk
of Chantix in patients with a history of heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That study found an increased risk of heart attack and
chest pains, though the results weren&#8217;t statistically
significant. The report prompted the FDA to seek a new analysis
of all available trials using the raw data from the original
research. That study will be completed by Pfizer within months,
not years, the FDA&#8217;s Rosenbraugh and Pfizer&#8217;s Cawkwell said,
without giving a specific time frame. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Baidu Inc. agreed
to bolster their Internet-search partnership in China as the
companies seek to gain users from Google Inc. (GOOG) in the world&#8217;s
biggest Internet market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement will let Baidu users see English search
results generated by the U.S. company&#8217;s Bing technology to users
in China, Viola Wang, a spokeswoman at Microsoft&#8217;s MSN venture
in China, said by phone today. A service jointly offered by the
companies will start this year, Baidu said in an e-mailed
statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baidu, based in Beijing, is expanding outside its main
business of Chinese-language search, after fending off Google in
China. Microsoft, which is gaining users for Bing in the U.S.,
is building on its partnership with Baidu after ending a search-
engine agreement with China&#8217;s Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is not good news for Google,&#8221; said Jake Li, who
rates Baidu shares &#8220;accumulate&#8221; at Guotai Junan Securities in
Shenzhen. Most Chinese Internet users currently prefer Google&#8217;s
English-language search results over Baidu, whose service will
be improved by the partnership with Microsoft, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, owner of the world&#8217;s most popular search engine,
accounted for 19.2 percent of China&#8217;s search market by revenue
in the first quarter, down from 19.6 percent three months
earlier, according to research firm Analysys International.
Google&#8217;s figures includes revenue generated from its local sites
and international services, according to Analysys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market-Share Losses &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased demand from Chinese companies marketing on
international websites such as the English-language Google.com
helped Google post increased revenue in China in 2010, Daniel Alegre, president for Asia-Pacific at Google, said in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google has lost market share to Baidu in China since the
Mountain View, California-based company pulled its Google.cn
search-engine out of the country last year, according to data
from Analysys. Baidu increased its share to 75.8 percent from
75.5 percent in the first quarter, while Microsoft Bing&#8217;s market
share is less than 1 percent, according to Analysys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baidu had an existing agreement with Bing for some mobile-
phone users in China, Haoyu Shen, senior vice-president at
Baidu, said in May. Baidu is working on efforts to expand
overseas, and its developing products in 12 foreign languages,
Shen said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alibaba stopped offering Microsoft Bing on its eTao search
service, Justine Chao, a spokeswoman at Alibaba, said in May. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) appointed
two senior bankers to run Japanese equity and bond underwriting
and set up a public-sector group to boost its investment banking
business following the country&#8217;s record earthquake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yasuro Koizumi and Makoto Ito will be co-heads of the
financing group in Japan, succeeding Jasper Tans, who will
return to London, according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg News.
Mitsunari Okamoto will head the new group that will focus on the
government sector, infrastructure and utilities, the memo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank is betting that demand for debt financing
from municipalities will increase as the nation recovers from
its worst postwar disaster. Japan&#8217;s government is also preparing
to exit investments in companies including Tokyo Metro Co. and
Japan Airlines Co. through initial public offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are strengthening the investment banking structure as
demand from public-sector clients will increase as the nation
looks to rebuild after the earthquake,&#8221; said Masanori Mochida,
president of Goldman Sachs Japan Co. in Tokyo. &#8220;It will enhance
our commitment to help Japan&#8217;s central and local governments
work on privatization projects and issue bonds.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiroko Matsumoto, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman, confirmed the
contents of the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planes, Trains &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State-run Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corp. of Japan,
which owns shares in Japan Airlines, said on July 1 it will
begin selecting lead underwriters this month for an IPO of the
carrier by January 2013. Tokyo Metro, a government-owned subway
operator, plans to list as soon as possible, according to its
business plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koizumi joined Goldman Sachs in 1999 as debt syndicate head
in Japan, while Ito entered the bank in 1997 and had a stint at
equity capital markets in Hong Kong, according to the memo.
Okamoto joined the company in 1998 and has worked at the firm&#8217;s
debt capital markets division in New York, it said. All three
are managing directors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs in June helped the Ibaraki prefectural
government raise 10 billion yen ($124 million) from a bond
issuance backed by future revenue from a waste-processing
facility in the prefecture, the local government said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank has experience backing sales of Japanese
government stakes in enterprises including Japan Tobacco Inc. (2914),
Nippon Telegraph  Telephone Corp. (9432), NTT DoCoMo Inc. (9437) and East
Japan Railway Co. (9020), as part of privatization campaigns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was No. 3 underwriter for Japanese equity and
equity-linked products last year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The bank helped Panasonic Corp. (6752), the world&#8217;s largest
maker of plasma televisions, raise 500 billion yen in Japan&#8217;s
biggest sale of corporate bonds in March. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) appointed
five new partners in Australia and named Simon Rothery as the
unit&#8217;s sole chief executive officer after the New York-based
parent completed the takeover of the business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rothery, who joined Goldman Sachs in 1998, and the co-heads
of investment banking, James McMurdo and Christian Johnston,
become partners, according to an internal memo sent to Bloomberg
News today. Andrew Rennie, head of equities, and Anthony Miller
from the financing group were also appointed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchase of the remaining 55 percent of the unit last
week means Goldman Sachs now owns all its Asian operations
except the division in China. The offer valued the whole
business at between A$800 million ($859 million) and A$1.2
billion, according to the Australian Financial Review. The Wall
Street firm didn&#8217;t disclose the value of the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Fitzgerald, a member of Goldman Sachs&#8217; Asia
management committee and formerly co-CEO in Australia with
Rothery, becomes chairman and advisory director of the business,
according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and consumers
who sued the bank over claims of excessive overdraft fees have
reached an impasse in settlement talks, a mediator said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two mediation sessions held between the company and the
plaintiffs&#8217; committee on March 17 and June 28 failed, the
mediator, Thomas E. Scott, said July 1 in a report filed in
federal court in Miami. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Following the second effort, the undersigned has decided
to declare an impasse at this time,&#8221; according to the document
signed by Scott. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers sued accusing JPMorgan and more than a dozen
other banks of illegally charging excessive fees for overdrafts.
Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the largest U.S. lender by assets, agreed
to pay $410 million in February to settle the lawsuits against
it. The bank didn&#8217;t admit any liability in the cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Los Angeles resident Andrea Luquetta sued JPMorgan in 2009
claiming the bank&#8217;s overdraft fees were excessive, unfair and
deceptive. The suit named JPMorgan and Washington Mutual Bank
Inc., which JPMorgan acquired in 2008. The case is now part of
multidistrict litigation in the Miami court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Kelly, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment on
the report. Jeremy W. Alters, a plaintiffs&#8217; attorney, didn&#8217;t
immediately reply to phone and e-mail messages seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FDIC Enforcement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. last week began
enforcing rules aimed at reducing overdraft fees. The FDIC rules
followed industrywide regulation approved by the Federal Reserve
last year requiring banks to obtain customers&#8217; permission to
enroll them in overdraft programs. The FDIC rules impose daily
limits on overdraft fees charged to customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers incur overdraft fees when they debit sums beyond
what they have in an account and their balance dips below zero. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re: Checking Account Overdraft Litigation,
1:09-md-02036, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida
(Miami). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc., the New York-based
bank that reorganized its trading desk this year, hired JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s John Novak for its equities unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novak, head of U.S. cash equities sales trading, resigned
today from JPMorgan, said Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for
the New York-based bank. He will be a sales trader and report to
Citigroup U.S. head of cash equity sales trading Dan Sanders
after a mandatory 90-day period of &#8220;garden leave,&#8221; said
Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a Citi spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Chief Executive Officer Vikram Pandit reshuffled
trading operations this year, promoting James Forese to head of
securities and banking in January. The equities unit is run by
Derek Bandeen, who appointed Mike Pringle as head of trading in
April. The bank, the third-largest in the U.S., said first-
quarter equities-trading revenue fell 12 percent to $1.1 billion
from the year-earlier period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average daily equity-trading in the second quarter on the
largest U.S. exchanges fell 31 percent from a year earlier and
9.6 percent from the prior period. Equity trading at JPMorgan
generated $1.4 billion, or 17 percent, of the investment bank&#8217;s
$8.2 billion in revenue in the first quarter. Analysts including
Nomura Holdings Inc.&#8217;s Glenn Schorr cut JPMorgan&#8217;s second-
quarter earnings estimates in part because of &#8220;sluggish&#8221;
trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novak, who reported to Adam Englander in the investment
bank, joined JPMorgan in 1996, according to his profile on
LinkedIn. He graduated from Lehigh University in 1992, according
to the profile. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Greek debt crisis will persist if
euro-zone policy makers don&#8217;t &#8220;get realistic&#8221; and focus on a
long-term approach instead of short-term gimmicks, according to
Columbia University&#8217;s Jeffrey Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greece is taking actions to service its debts, stay in the
euro and avoid a financial or banking panic. Its European
counterparts aren&#8217;t taking the appropriate steps, said Sachs,
a Columbia professor and the author of &#8220;The End of Poverty:
Economic Possibilities for Our Time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The European Commission, the European Central Bank and
the International Monetary Fund have so far been saying, &#8216;here,
take a little bit and get back to the markets in 24, 36 months&#8217;
-- that&#8217;s not going to happen,&#8221; Sachs said on Bloomberg
Television&#8217;s &#8220;Surveillance Midday&#8221; with Tom Keene. &#8220;So either
we have a real, longer-term framework, or Europe is going to
find that it can&#8217;t push Greece any further.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU leaders have asked investors to shoulder part of the
latest aid package for Greece after last year&#8217;s 110 billion-euro
($159 billion) rescue failed to contain Europe&#8217;s debt crisis.
Participation by Greek banks and pensions funds is important to
the success of a plan for investors to roll over as much as 30
billion euros of maturing bonds into longer-term securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Right now, we&#8217;re on a short-term rollover basis, which is
very unrealistic,&#8221; Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portugal&#8217;s long-term government bond ratings were cut today
to Ba2, or junk, from Baa1 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service. The
outlook is negative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou last week won the
backing of his country&#8217;s parliament to implement the 78 billion-
euro austerity package needed to qualify for further financial
assistance from the European Union. Greek citizens rioted in the
streets, protesting the austerity measures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christine Lagarde, who started today as managing director
of IMF, should say there will be no more short-term gimmicks and
force a discussion of a long-term fix to Greece&#8217;s debt problems,
Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Google Inc. (GOOG)
were sued for allegedly violating a Louisiana company&#8217;s patent
covering mapping technology that helps computer users see
locations in three dimensions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials of Transcenic Inc. contend in a lawsuit that
executives of Google, owner of the world&#8217;s biggest search
engine, and Microsoft, the world&#8217;s biggest software maker,
infringe patents for technology that helps capture 3-D images of
map locations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies&#8217; misuse of the mapping technology &#8220;has
injured Transcenic and Transcenic is entitled to recover damages
adequate to compensate for such infringement,&#8221; the closely held
Lake Charles, Louisiana-based company said July 1 in a suit
filed in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patents covering computer-mapping software have sparked
litigation against Google, Microsoft and other companies in
federal courts around the U.S. GeoTag Inc. has filed patent-
infringement suits against 300 entities, many of which use
mapping technology made by Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft
or Mountain View, California-based Google to show store
locations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jay Nancarrow, a Google spokesman, couldn&#8217;t immediately
comment July 1. Kevin Kutz, a Microsoft spokesman, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a call for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transcenic argues computer programs such as Google&#8217;s Street
View and Microsoft&#8217;s Streetside allow users to see 3-D images of
their destination rather than the traditional birds-eye view of
a map grid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google&#8217;s Street View system also has become a target for
lawsuits alleging the company is violating residents&#8217; privacy
rights by collecting data from individual Wi-Fi networks. A
federal judge in California June 30 said a wiretapping suit over
the system could proceed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Google and Microsoft have placed &#8220;infringing systems
into action or service&#8221; and obtain &#8220;beneficial use&#8221; of those
systems, lawyers for Transcenic said in the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent-infringement suit also names AOL Inc. (AOL) and its
MapQwest unit as defendants. Sandy Drayton, an AOL spokeswoman,
didn&#8217;t immediately return a phone call for comment on the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Transcenic Inc. v. Google Inc., 11-cv-582, U.S.
District Court for the District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Gets Mixed Ruling in S3 Chip Patent Case Before ITC &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL) received a mixed ruling in the patent-
infringement case brought by closely held S3 Graphics Co. over a
type of chip used to play video games on mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple violates two S3 patents and was found to not have
infringed two others, U.S. International Trade Commission Judge
James Gildea said in a notice posted July 1 on the Washington-
based agency&#8217;s website. The findings are subject to review by
the six-member commission, which can block imports of products
that infringe U.S. patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S3, whose Texture Compression feature is used in Nintendo
Co.&#8217;s Wii and Sony Corp.&#8217;s PlayStation portable gaming systems,
claimed Apple was infringing four patents. The Fremont,
California-based company&#8217;s image compression technology allows
for access to encoded large color and 3-D image files to present
lifelike animation in video games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ITC complaint targets Apple&#8217;s Macintosh computer,
iPhone, iPad tablet and iPod Touch as well as video games for
those devices. Cupertino, California-based Apple makes its
products overseas and imports them into the U.S. for sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ITC will decide within 60 days whether it will review
the judge&#8217;s decision. The case is scheduled to be completed by
Nov. 1, according to information on the commission&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple is involved in more than a dozen patent cases at the
ITC, a quasi-judicial trade agency that has become a de facto
arbiter for disputes over intellectual property rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission June 30 ordered a judge to take a second
look at a case brought by Eastman Kodak Co. over an image
preview feature in mobile phones. The ITC also said in a
separate case that Apple wasn&#8217;t violating patent claims brought
by Taiwanese chip designer Elan Microelectronics Corp. over
touch-controlled screens, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case In the Matter of Certain Electronic Devices with
Image Processing Systems, 337-724, U.S. International Trade
Commission (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viacom Sued by Connecticut Disc Jockey Over &#8216;DJ Paulie&#8217; Marks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viacom Inc. (VIA/B) was sued for trademark infringement by a
Connecticut disc jockey who objects to names used in connection
with a character from MTV&#8217;s &#8220;Jersey Shore&#8221; reality television
program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Lis of South Windsor, Connecticut, began broadcasting
as &#8220;DJ Paulie&#8221; in 1971. He&#8217;s also used the name for his own
record label, and for public appearances, he said in the
complaint filed June 30 in federal court in Hartford,
Connecticut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lis said as DJ Paulie he was commissioned to write and
produce &#8220;September Mourn,&#8221; the official 9/11 memorial
fundraising song for the U.S. Postal Service to benefit the
victims&#8217; families. He has several registered U.S. trademarks for
the term &#8220;DJ Paulie&#8221; for disc jockey services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Viacom&#8217;s MTV Networks began airing the &#8220;Jersey
Shore&#8221; reality show, he said his trademarks were tarnished by
the association the public made with a character on the show. He
claims &#8220;Jersey Shore&#8221; shows a &#8220;debauched lifestyle suggestive
of loose morals, violence, intoxication and liberal profanity,&#8221;
and says it&#8217;s the exact opposite of the reputation he&#8217;s &#8220;spent
decades cultivating.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the time the show began to air in late 2009, it had
&#8220;an immediate negative impact&#8221; on his DJPaulie.com website,
and &#8220;destroyed national advertiser interest&#8221; in an Internet
radio show he performs, Lis said in his pleadings. He accused
Viacom of placing content on the Internet with metatags using
the spelling of DJ Paulie to direct traffic to sites associated
with one of the &#8220;Jersey Shore&#8221; characters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul DelVecchio Jr., a performer on &#8220;Jersey Shore,&#8221;
promotes himself on the show as a disc jockey under the name
&#8220;DJ Pauly&#8221; and &#8220;DJ Pauly D.&#8221; according to court papers. Lis
said he&#8217;s harmed by this, and by applications DelVecchio has
filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to register &#8220;DJ
Pauly D&#8221; as a trademark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viacom didn&#8217;t respond immediately to an e-mailed request
for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lis claims he&#8217;s suffered damage to a $2 million business
investment and asked the court for an order barring the use of
the names &#8220;DJ Paulie&#8221; and &#8220;DJ Pauly&#8221; or similar names by
Viacom and other defendants, including DelVecchio himself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, he seeks awards of money damages, extra
damages to punish the defendants for their actions, and for
attorney fees and litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lis is represented by Jose Rojas of the Rojas Law Firm of
Hartford. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Paul Lis DJ Paulie Broadcasting LLC v. Paul
DelVecchio Jr., 3:11-cv-01057-AWT, U.S. District Court, District
of Connecticut (Hartford). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warner Music Withdraws &#8216;Digger&#8217; Application After Complaint &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warner Music Group Corp. (WMG)&#8217;s Warner Music Australasia
application has withdrawn its application to register &#8220;The
Diggers&#8221; as an Australian trademark, Melbourne&#8217;s Herald Sun
newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia&#8217;s Minister of Veterans&#8217; Affairs Warren Snowdon
had objected, saying it was &#8220;inappropriate&#8221; for the music
company to register a mark associated with those who had served
in his nation&#8217;s military, according to the Herald Sun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tony Harlow, managing director of Warner Music Australasia
told the Herald Sun his company backed down on its application
to register the name -- together with the image of a saluting
soldier -- for an album project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The project will not proceed without such protection,&#8221;
Harlow said and the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UAL Wins U.K. Trademark Dispute with Bangladeshi Air Carrier &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL)&#8217;s United Airlines won a
U.K. trademark dispute with a Bangladeshi air carrier, Aviation
International News Online reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A U.K. court said in a June 24 ruling that United Airways
(BD) Ltd. of Bangladesh infringed the Chicago-based carrier&#8217;s
trademarks and must change its name and repaint its aircraft,
according to AIN. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;United Airways was also ordered to place notice on its
website -- www.uabdl.com -- that it infringed the United
Airlines trademarks, AIN reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to London, the Bangladeshi airline serves
international destinations also served by United, including,
Dubai, Kuala Lumpur, Kathmandu, Kolkata, Jeddah and Bangkok,
according to AIN. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephens Media&#8217;s Righthaven Blames Former In-House Counsel &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Stephens Media Group&#8217;s copyright suit against the
Democratic Underground, counsel for the company that says it has
the right to pursue infringement actions against those who post
stories from Stephens&#8217; newspapers, has now blamed some of its
problems with the case on &#8220;former in house counsel.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a June 14 ruling, U.S. District Judge Roger L. Hunt said
that Righthaven LLC, the named plaintiff in the case, didn&#8217;t
have standing because it didn&#8217;t truly own the copyright it was
trying to enforce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Hunt then gave Righthaven two weeks to show why it
shouldn&#8217;t be sanctioned &#8220;for this flagrant misrepresentation&#8221;
about its ownership of the Stephens copyrights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a June 29 filing with the court, Righthaven said its in-
house counsel &#8220;failed to consider&#8221; copyright law&#8217;s requirement
that an enforcer have a direct pecuniary interest in the case.
Righthaven said in a footnote that two of the lawyers originally
associated with the case &#8220;are no longer employed by
Righthaven.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, Righthaven added Dale Cendali of Chicago&#8217;s Kirkland
 Ellis LLP to its outside legal team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cendali may be best known for her successful representation
of Harry Potter&#8217;s U.S. publisher Scholastic Corp. (SCHL) in a trademark
case. She also represented the Associated Press in the
copyright-infringement case involving the photo of President
Obama against artist Shepard Fairey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she was with Los Angeles-based O&#8217;Melveny  Myers LLP,
she represented the Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance
in a trademark suit involving the name of the late Martha
Graham. Cendali moved from O&#8217;Melveny to Chicago-based Kirkland 
Ellis in March 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case against the Democratic Underground is Righthaven
LLC v. Democratic Underground LLC, 2:10-cv-01356-RLH-GWF, U.S.
District Court, District of Nevada (Las Vegas). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Olivo Leaves Ward  Olivo for New Contingent-Fee Patent Practice &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John W. Olivo, a founding partner of Ward  Olivo of
Marshall, Texas, has begun his own independent contingent-fee

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) Chief Executive
Officer Robert Iger said that the owners of Hulu LLC, the video-
streaming service, are &#8220;committed to selling.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of interest,&#8221; he said in an interview at
the Allen  Co. conference in Sun Valley, Idaho. Hulu&#8217;s owners
include Disney, News Corp. (NWSA) and Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)&#8217;s NBC Universal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bankers for Hulu have met with Google Inc. (GOOG), Yahoo Inc. and
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) as the company explores a sale, people familiar
with the process said last week. The 10 to 12 potential bidders
Morgan Stanley (MS) and Guggenheim Partners have reached out to also
include ATT Inc. (T) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sale would eliminate a conflict by setting up Hulu as an
independent buyer of movies and TV shows for online viewing,
said Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Morgan Securities
in Los Angeles. Hulu competes for content with the owners&#8217; other
online customers, such as Netflix Inc. (NFLX), he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hulu may fetch more than $2 billion, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg and SNL Kagan. The Los Angeles-based
company hired bankers after a potential suitor expressed
interest, people familiar with the matter said on June 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under a new owner, Hulu may also gain capital to acquire
more films and TV shows and challenge Netflix, the dominant
subscription streaming service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hulu said today it will exceed 1 million users for its
$7.99-a-month service by the end of the U.S. summer season,
earlier than the year-end goal the company initially set.
Netflix, based in Los Gatos, California, has 23 million
customers and may generate $3.25 billion in revenue this year,
the average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Branded Content&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger declined to comment on the specifics of any
discussions or on whether movies and television shows would be
licensed exclusively to Hulu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to comment on any aspect of the deal,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a good time to be in the content business though,
the branded content business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney fell 40 cents to $39.57 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange trading and has climbed 5.5 percent this year. Netflix
added $1.33 to $290.96 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading and has
gained 66 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs  Co., a unit of the
most profitable bank in Wall Street history, took $15 billion
from the U.S. Federal Reserve on Dec. 9, 2008, the biggest
single loan from a lending program whose details have been
secret until today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program, which peaked at $80 billion in loans
outstanding, was known as the Fed&#8217;s single-tranche open-market
operations, or ST OMO. It made 28-day loans to units of 19 banks
between March 7, 2008, and Dec. 30, 2008. Bloomberg reported on
ST OMO in May, after the Fed released incomplete records on the
program. In response to a subsequent Freedom of Information Act
request for details, the central bank disclosed borrower names,
amounts borrowed and interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ST OMO is the last known Fed crisis lending program to have
its details made public. The central bank resisted previous FOIA
requests on emergency lending for more than two years,
disclosing details in March of its oldest loan facility, the
discount window, only after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled it had
to. When Congress mandated the December 2010 release of data on
special initiatives the Fed created in its unprecedented $3.5
trillion response to the 2007-2009 collapse in credit markets,
ST OMO -- an expansion of a longstanding program -- wasn&#8217;t
included. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Fed has come a long way over a long period of time as
far as transparency,&#8221; said Raymond W. Stone, managing director
and economist with Stone  McCarthy Research Associates in
Princeton, New Jersey. &#8220;They thought counterparties might be
harmed, but now so much time has passed that the information is
not as sensitive anymore.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary Dealers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 19 borrowers from the program are known as primary
dealers, which are designated to trade government securities
directly with Federal Reserve Bank of New York. They bid at
auctions for ST OMO&#8217;s cash. While the rates they paid generally
tracked the federal funds rate, the rate for some dipped as low
as 0.01 percent in December 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Fed conducted 44 ST OMO auctions, according to
its website. Banks bid the interest rate they were willing to
pay for the loans and pledged mortgage-backed securities
guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises such as Fannie
Mae or Freddie Mac as collateral for the Fed&#8217;s cash. The
transactions were known as repurchase agreements, or repos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longstanding Program &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ST OMO was an expansion of longstanding open-market
operations, which offered cash for up to two weeks and were used
as a tool of monetary policy. In March 2008, the Fed adapted the
program to alleviate pressures in short-term credit markets,
according to a news release the central bank issued at the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York picked JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
as investment manager of its college savings plan sold through
advisers, keeping Vanguard Group Inc. to run investments in its
direct-sold accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state had put the programs, known as 529 plans, out for
bids. The current direct-sold contract is with Vanguard and
Upromise Investments, a unit of student-lender SLM Corp. (SLM)
Upromise will be the administrator on both types of plans, the
New York State Comptroller&#8217;s Office said today. The contracts
run for seven years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Family budgets are getting tighter, but families still
need to save for college,&#8221; New York State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli said in a statement. &#8220;The 529 Program is a low-cost,
easy-to-use program that helps make college more accessible to
New Yorkers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 529 plans, named after a section of the U.S. tax code,
are set up by states. Investment earnings generally are free of
state and federal taxes when used to pay for eligible education
expenses. New York&#8217;s 529 College Savings Program has more than
$12 billion invested in more than 680,000 accounts, according to
the statement. Its direct-sold plan is the largest in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Savers in New York&#8217;s direct-sold plan can contribute on
behalf of a beneficiary up to $375,000, according to the state&#8217;s
website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuition and Fees &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuition and fees for in-state students at public four-year
institutions averaged $7,605 for the 2010-2011 school year,
according to the College Board, a New York-based nonprofit. At
private nonprofit four-year colleges and universities, they
averaged $27,293. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Advisor Plan offers individuals a disciplined way to
integrate savings for college into a comprehensive financial
plan,&#8221; said George Gatch, chief executive officer of J.P.
Morgan Investment Management Americas. The New York-based firm&#8217;s
relationships with the adviser community and range of investment
products will position it to help New Yorkers save, Gatch said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captain America is going into
business with America&#8217;s Team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marvel Entertainment LLC, a unit of Walt Disney Co. (DIS), and
the Dallas Cowboys are developing a co-branded apparel line
featuring Captain America, Spider-Man, Iron Man and other
characters wearing Cowboys&#8217; team colors and logos, the Cowboys
and Marvel said in a joint news release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are constantly looking for new and innovative ways to
energize our fans, and what better way than to combine our brand
with some of the all-time great superheroes that everyone has
grown up with,&#8221; Jerry Jones Jr., chief sales and marketing
office for the Cowboys, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the characters will be clad in the Cowboys&#8217; colors
and logo, there are no plans to portray individual Dallas
players as superheroes, Brett Daniels, a spokesman for the team,
said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial terms of the agreement weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Captain America, one of more than 8,000 characters in
Disney&#8217;s library, is featured in a film that will be released
later this month. The Cowboys picked up the nickname &#8220;America&#8217;s
Team&#8221; during the 1970s, when they won two of their five Super
Bowl titles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Marvel offered similar apparel lines
with the National Basketball Association&#8217;s Los Angeles Lakers,
New York Knicks and Boston Celtics. &lt;/p&gt;

a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have gained 91 percent in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davenport lowered the company&#8217;s rating, citing the
expectation for cheaper metallurgical coal prices later this
year, geological problems with some of its mines and the
resignation of Chief Executive Officer Keith Calder last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our downgrade is based on three factors: our view of the
commodity price, ongoing production issues and lack of stability
at the CEO position,&#8221; J. Christopher Haberlin, an analyst at
Davenport, wrote in a report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said Calder&#8217;s departure effective July 31 may lead to
Walter being acquired through a hostile takeover from a global
steelmaker, an auction process by its board or active investors
encouraging its sale. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WikiLeaks&#8217;s payment provider,
DataCell, said it&#8217;s again able to accept credit-card payments
seven months after Visa Europe Ltd. and MasterCard Inc. (MA) blocked
donations to the website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DataCell is using an alternative-payment gateway to process
money sent through MasterCard, the world&#8217;s second-largest
payments network, and Visa Europe, which runs the largest card
network in the European Union, Reykjavik, Iceland-based DataCell
said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;DataCell is happy to report that we are now able again to
process donations to WikiLeaks,&#8221; the company said. &#8220;We choose
to interpret this as that Visa and MasterCard has in fact given
in to our demand&#8221; to reinstate the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MasterCard&#8217;s website was attacked by hackers last month and
in December after the Purchase, New York-based firm and Visa
Europe blocked WikiLeaks from using its network to collect funds
from donors. WikiLeaks, led by Julian Assange, publishes secret
documents, including confidential U.S. diplomatic and military
information. The December attack on MasterCard was orchestrated
by hacker group Anonymous, TechCrunch reported at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanda Kamin, a spokeswoman for London-based Visa Europe,
denied that the firm had changed its policy on WikiLeaks
donations. &#8220;We have not reinstated DataCell and are looking
into how transactions are being made,&#8221; Kamin said in an e-
mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Issokson, a New York-based spokesman for MasterCard,
didn&#8217;t return e-mails or phone calls seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Express &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DataCell is also able to process WikiLeaks donations made
through American Express Co. (AXP), the biggest credit-card issuer by
customer spending, according to the statement. Christine Elliott, a spokeswoman for New York-based AmEx, didn&#8217;t return e-
mails and phone calls seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At about 4:20 p.m. New York time, the WikiLeaks Twitter
account, which has almost 1 million followers, posted a message
about the &#8220;Financial block workaround.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Donate whilst you can Visa, MasterCard and AmEx,&#8221; read
the rest of the message, which linked back to the WikiLeaks
website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, the U.S. Justice Department subpoenaed Twitter
Inc. to hand over data about users with ties to WikiLeaks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PayPal, a unit of EBay Inc. (EBAY), the world&#8217;s largest online
marketplace, also suspended payments to the website in December.
PayPal hasn&#8217;t lifted its block, company spokesman Anuj Nayar
said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nothing has changed regarding being able to take
WikiLeaks donations via PayPal,&#8221; Nayar said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assange Defence Fund &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PayPal still accepts donations for the Julian Assange
Defence Fund through a company called FundRazr, according to
Nayar. The fund was created by Assange&#8217;s defense team and
receives contributions to help defend the WikiLeaks leader,
according to a Facebook application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V)&#8217;s supension of payments to Wikileaks is still in
place, spokeswoman Erica Harvill said in an e-mailed statement.
Visa Europe split from Visa Inc. before the San Francisco-based
company&#8217;s initial public offering in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks jumped, sending the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index close to a three-year high, as
retail and job market data bolstered confidence in the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Target Corp. (TGT), the second-largest U.S. discount retailer,
and Kohl&#8217;s Corp. (KSS) rose at least 6.6 percent as June retail sales
surpassed analysts&#8217; projections. Urban Outfitters Inc. (URBN) rallied 6
percent after Morgan Stanley recommended investors buy the
shares. JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) climbed 1.9 percent as banking
shares soared. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 Index (SPX) climbed 1.1 percent to 1,353.22 at 4 p.m.
in New York, its highest closing level since May 10. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average rose 93.47 points, or 0.7 percent, to
12,719.49, as a report by ADP Employer Services showed U.S.
companies added more jobs than forecast in June. Volume on U.S.
exchanges totaled about 6.8 billion at 4:30 p.m., 4 percent less
than the three-month average through yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re starting to cycle through the list of issues that
have been on investors&#8217; minds,&#8221; said Christopher Blum, New
York-based chief investment officer for the U.S. behavioral
finance group at JPMorgan Asset Management, which oversees $1.9
trillion in assets. &#8220;Economic data is coming in better than
expected, and certainly the beat on the jobs number today came
earlier than most investors had expected.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 has climbed 6.7 percent over the past eight
days, with last week&#8217;s gain the biggest since July 2009. The
index is about 10 points shy of a three-year high reached April
29. Through June 24, U.S. equities had fallen for seven of the
previous eight weeks on concern that the European debt crisis
would spread and the U.S. economy slow. The index still has
gained 7.6 percent for the year amid better-than-expected
earnings and government stimulus measures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Job Reports &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities rose today as figures from ADP showed companies in
the U.S. added 157,000 workers to their payrolls in June. The
median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called
for an advance of 70,000. The data comes before the government&#8217;s
June payrolls report tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separate data from the Labor Department showed jobless
claims fell by 14,000 to 418,000 last week, compared with the
median forecast of economists for a drop to 420,000. The number
of people on unemployment benefit rolls and those getting
extended payments also declined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These kind of employment numbers are supportive for the
market,&#8221; said Lawrence Creatura, a Rochester, New York-based
fund manager at Federated Investors Inc., which oversees about
$355 billion. &#8220;Unemployment is the single most dominant
statistic in our national debate right now, it shadows all the
other economic and political debates and it shapes the sentiment
which surrounds the stock market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodity Producers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measures of fuel and materials companies climbed 1.4
percent and 1.5 percent, respectively, while the Morgan Stanley
Cyclical Index added 1.3 percent on speculation that the U.S.
labor market may be stronger, indicating that job growth could
accelerate in the second half of the year and demand for
commodities will improve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors next week also will be turning their attention to
second-quarter earnings. The season starts July 11 with Alcoa
Inc., the first Dow company to release results. Corporate
earnings are forecast to have grown by 13 percent, according to
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retailers in the SP 500 rallied 2.4 percent today to a
record. Sales reports indicated that shoppers took advantage of
discounts that retailers implemented in June to clear out
inventory and make room for back-to-school merchandise. Lower
gas prices and warmer temperatures also enticed consumers. Gas
prices in the U.S. have declined 10 percent since a high of
$3.99 a gallon on May 4, according to AAA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retailers Surge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Target jumped 6.7 percent to $51.67 while Kohl&#8217;s, the
department-store chain that&#8217;s been in business since 1962,
soared 7.1 percent to $55.78. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limited Brands Inc., operator of the Victoria&#8217;s Secret
chain, rose 2.7 percent to $40.36 after posting a gain of 12
percent in same-store sales for June, surpassing the 4.4 percent
average of analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Retail Metrics Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urban Outfitters, a clothing retailer, climbed 6 percent to
$32.58 after Morgan Stanley raised the stock to &#8220;overweight&#8221;
from &#8220;equal weight.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial companies rose 1.6 percent, the biggest gain
among 10 groups in the SP 500. JPMorgan climbed 1.9 percent to
$41.32, for the third-largest increase in the Dow. Wells Fargo 
Co. (WFC) added 1.9 percent to $28.66, Citigroup Inc. (C) advanced 1.5
percent to $42.63 and Bank of America Corp. jumped 1.7 percent
to $10.92. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faulty Foreclosures &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, JPMorgan and three other U.S. mortgage
servicers are in advanced talks to resolve state and federal
claims over faulty foreclosures, according to two people briefed
on the matter. Negotiators tentatively set a July 13 target for
a settlement, which may exceed $20 billion, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Post sent bank stocks lower yesterday after
reporting that the settlement&#8217;s total value might reach $60
billion, citing unidentified people close to the discussions.
The Post corrected its report today, saying the amount might
reach $25 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seagate Technology Plc (STX) rose 2 percent to $16.64. The
world&#8217;s largest maker of computer disk drives was raised to
&#8220;overweight&#8221; from &#8220;underweight&#8221; at JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Affymetrix Inc. (AFFX) tumbled 18 percent to $6.59. The producer
of genomic-analysis technology forecast second-quarter sales of
as little as $64 million, compared with the average analyst
estimate of $74.7 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By William Selway and Martin Z. Braun" date="Jul 07, 2011  5:21 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-07/jpmorgan-to-pay-228-million-to-settle-muni-bid-rigging-allegations-by-sec.html"><headline>JPMorgan to Pay $228 Million to Settle Muni Bid-Rigging Allegations by SEC</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) agreed to a $228
million settlement on charges it conspired to rig the bidding on
investment contracts sold to state and local governments to
boost its profits at taxpayer expense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement ends investigations of the second-largest
U.S. bank by the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the attorneys general of 25 states including the
District of Columbia, the Justice Department and SEC said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal investigators have probed for more than four years
how banks and financial advisers fixed bids on investment
contracts to let them pay governments below-market rates.
JPMorgan&#8217;s penalties are the largest yet to result from that
investigation, which also led to settlements with UBS AG (UBSN) and
Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the biggest U.S. bank by assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan &#8220;improperly won bids by entering into secret
arrangements with bidding agents to get an illegal &#8216;last look&#8217;
at competitors&#8217; bids,&#8221; Robert Khuzami, director of the SEC&#8217;s
enforcement division, said in a statement. &#8220;Municipal issuers
and investors didn&#8217;t stand a chance against the fraudulent
strategies,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Criminal charges have been brought against 18 finance-
industry employees in the past two years, nine of whom have
pleaded guilty, including James Hertz, a former JPMorgan banker.
Hertz is one of five former workers at the bank who received
letters informing them that they are targets of the Justice
Department probe, according to regulatory filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wide-Ranging &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Court documents filed by prosecutors point to wide-ranging
collusion by Wall Street banks, insurance companies and advisers
hired by public officials to guide their investments. Papers
entered in a case against CDR Financial Products Inc., an
advisory firm based in Los Angeles, identified more than a dozen
banks and insurers as co-conspirators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accord marks the second for JPMorgan arising from its
municipal-derivatives business, which sold the investment
contracts as well as interest-rate swaps to state and local
governments, before the bank shut it down in 2008. In November
2009, the bank entered a $722 million accord with the SEC to end
a separate investigation over its sales of derivatives to
Jefferson County, Alabama, where its bankers made undisclosed
payments to friends of county commissioners to win business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Settlement Terms &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of today&#8217;s settlement, JPMorgan took responsibility
for &#8220;illegal, anticompetitive conduct by its former
employees,&#8221; the Justice Department said. The SEC said the bank
neither admitted nor denied claims in the agency&#8217;s complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accord includes $92 million for the states and the
district, $35 million for the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency, $51.2 million for the SEC and $50 million for the
Internal Revenue Service. The agreement with the states provides
for $17 million of payments in connection with the federal
settlement. JPMorgan said the deal will lead to $211.2 million
in net payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank &#8220;doesn&#8217;t tolerate anticompetitive activity or
other violations of law,&#8221; JPMorgan said in the statement. &#8220;The
firm assisted the government agencies in their investigations
and is pleased to have resolved this matter with its
regulators,&#8221; the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has increased the number of legal and compliance
staff in its public-finance division and raised the level of
auditing, said Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman. The bank also
has increased antitrust, ethics and other training, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares Climb &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank rose 76 cents, or 1.9 percent,
today on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have gained 8.3
percent in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment contracts at the center of the charges are
purchased by states and cities with proceeds of money raised in
the $2.9 trillion municipal bond market, allowing them to earn a
return until the cash is needed for public works projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While competitive bidding is meant to ensure local
governments get market rates on their investments, prosecutors
say bankers and brokers carved up the market among themselves.
Federal prosecutors say that inflated their earnings at the
expense of taxpayers and the Treasury, which collects levies on
investment earnings from tax-exempt bond proceeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation is continuing and may result in
additional charges and settlements. To settle similar cases,
Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America in December
agreed to pay $137 million, and Zurich-based UBS agreed to pay
$160 million in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Full Pipeline&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have a pretty full pipeline on post-crisis cases,&#8221;
SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro said today in an interview. &#8220;So I
think hopefully we&#8217;ll see some more activity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s misconduct ranged from 1997 to 2005, the SEC
said. The agency&#8217;s charges say bankers there received tips from
brokers that enabled them to win deals, or adjust their bids to
make them more profitable, and then lied to cover their tracks.
The bank also submitted sham offers in auctions that were won by
rivals to give the appearance of competitive bidding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC said at least 11 different bidding agents, who ran
the auctions, also participated, and JPMorgan steered work to
those firms in return. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conspiracy spanned at least 93 transactions related to
the proceeds of more than $14.3 billion raised by borrowers in
31 states, the SEC said in its complaint. The agency said the
trades produced &#8220;millions of dollars in ill-gotten gains.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement will provide cash to municipalities
victimized in the scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among them are the Pennsylvania Intergovernmental
Cooperation Authority, which will get about $3.32 million, and
Philadelphia, in line for almost $1.38 million; Chicago, which
will get about $1.32 million. The Orlando, Florida, airport
authority will receive more than $853,700, according to the
agreement between JPMorgan and the U.S. Comptroller&#8217;s office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Don Jeffrey" date="Jul 07, 2011  4:16 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-07/goldman-sachs-sued-for-alleged-fraud-by-liberty-mutual-peerless-insurance.html"><headline>Liberty Mutual, Safeco Sue Goldman Alleging Securities Fraud</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. and
Safeco Corp. sued Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) for &#8220;making
misleading statements and omissions&#8221; in a preferred-stock
offering for Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (FMCC) in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs, which also include Peerless Insurance Co.,
said they invested $37.5 million in the offering of Freddie Mac
shares, which Goldman underwrote, according to a filing
yesterday in federal court in Boston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman claimed Freddie Mac &#8220;already met its regulatory
capital requirements&#8221; and that the offering was made to
increase the mortgage company&#8217;s capital base, the plaintiffs
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The stated purpose for the offering was false,&#8221; the
plaintiffs said in the complaint. &#8220;Goldman knew or recklessly
ignored that Freddie Mac did not meet its regulatory capital
requirements, and Freddie Mac remained severely undercapitalized
even after the sale of the preferred stock.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The suit is without merit and we intend to contest it
vigorously,&#8221; Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based
Goldman Sachs, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insurers are seeking damages of more than $100 million
and a trial by jury. They said in the complaint that their
investments are &#8220;virtually worthless.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subprime Defaults &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freddie Mac, based in McLean, Virginia, is a corporation
chartered by Congress to provide liquidity to the U.S. mortgage
market. It buys mortgage loans from banks and bundles them into
mortgage-backed securities that are sold to investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2006, home prices in the U.S. began to decline and
subprime mortgage loans, given to homeowners who don&#8217;t have the
highest credit ratings, began to default at increasing rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freddie Mac issued 240 million shares of Series Z preferred
shares in November 2007, raising about $5.9 billion, according
to the lawsuit. The shares were backed by &#8220;billions of dollars
in subprime residential mortgages,&#8221; the suit claimed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s bets against subprime-backed securities resulted
in a profit of $3.7 billion in 2007, the insurance companies
claimed in the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs rose $1.12, or 0.8 percent, to $135.01 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Freddie Mac
was little changed at 37 cents in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
Boston-based Liberty, Seattle-based Safeco and Keene, New
Hampshire-based Peerless don&#8217;t trade publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. v. Goldman Sachs 
Co., 11-11194, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts
(Boston). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Tom Randall" date="Jul 07, 2011  4:11 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-07/pfizer-says-it-may-sell-animal-health-nutrition-businesses-after-review.html"><headline>Pfizer Narrows Unit Sale Review to Animal Health, Baby Food</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, narrowed its plans to sell or spin off businesses,
saying today it would divest only the Animal Health and Baby
Food units, with combined annual sales of $5.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s shares fell 2.7 percent, as Pfizer said it
will keep the larger established products and consumer health
units within the parent company. Those businesses had revenue of
$12.9 billion last year. Investors have been pressing Chief
Executive Officer Ian Read to slim the drugmaker and focus on
developing new medicines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read said on Feb. 1 he was reviewing each of the four
business areas that aren&#8217;t involved in drug discovery as the
company faces loss of exclusivity for its biggest product, the
Lipitor cholesterol pill. Since then, Pfizer shares climbed 14
percent before today as investors anticipated the benefits from
sales and spinoffs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t transform Pfizer, it only adjusts it,&#8221; said
Erik Gordon, a University of Michigan business professor in Ann
Arbor who studies the biomedical industry. &#8220;Shedding the
consumer business would have been more interesting.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer fell 55 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $20.23 at 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
climbed 38 percent in the past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The plan is to enhance the value of established products
and consumer health care within Pfizer,&#8221; said Joan Campion, a
spokeswoman for Pfizer. &#8220;That said, as is typical of global
companies our size, we will continue to assess our businesses
and assets on a regular ongoing basis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Share Repurchases &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said it doesn&#8217;t anticipate making more announcements
about the alternatives for the two units until sometime in 2012,
and that any transaction could take as many as 24 months to
complete. Read said in a May 3 interview he plans to use
proceeds from the sales to buy back shares. The company sold
Capsugel, a hard-capsules business, to KKR  Co. in April for
$2.38 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan will advise on the Animal Health business,
while Morgan Stanley and Centerview Partners are advisers on the
Nutrition unit, Pfizer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;From a credit standpoint, we view the news as a negative,
with the likely separation of two growing and healthy units,&#8221;
said Joel Levington, managing director of corporate credit at
Brookfield Investment Management Inc. in New York, in an e-mail.
He said the moves may lead to &#8220;negative rating actions&#8221; at
Standard  Poor&#8217;s and Fitch Ratings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Immediate Impact &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While today&#8217;s moves are negative for Pfizer&#8217;s credit
standing, Moody&#8217;s Investors Service doesn&#8217;t have any immediate
plans to lower the drugmaker&#8217;s rating, said Michael Levesque, a
Moody&#8217;s analyst, in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer was smart to keep the established products unit,
which makes generic drugs and medicines that have lost patent
exclusivity, said David Maris, an analyst with CLSA in New York.
Read said in May that about $915 million of the unit&#8217;s $2.37
billion in first-quarter sales were in emerging markets, an area
where the company plans to grow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To give up emerging markets is a silly proposition,
because that is the future,&#8221; Maris said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure there was some subset of investors that
was still hoping for established products to be divested. We&#8217;ve
said for a long time that wouldn&#8217;t make sense.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various Buyers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maris said the animal health and baby food units will
attract a variety of potential buyers, including private equity
and pharmaceutical companies hoping to diversify their product
offerings or gain market share in animal medicines or infant
formula sales. He said a spinoff of either unit is possible,
though a sale is more likely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim Anderson, the Sanford C. Bernstein analyst whose March
14 research report drove up Pfizer shares on speculation the
company may halve its revenue base, said the company might take
different approaches to each unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our best guess is that animal health could be a spin-out,
a tax-free transaction like Bristol-Myers Squibb did with Mead Johnson in 2009, and that Nutrition could be sold,&#8221; Anderson
said in a note to clients today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer had 28 divestitures completed in the last five
years, with an average deal size of $1.8 billion, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The company&#8217;s biggest was the $16.6
billion sale of its consumer products business to Johnson 
Johnson (JNJ) in June 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipitor Sales &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipitor had sales of $10.7 billion last year, accounting
for about 16 percent of the company&#8217;s revenue, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Pfizer forecasts revenue may fall as much as 6.9
percent in two years as the pipeline of experimental drugs fails
to offset lower sales of Lipitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer acquired the nutrition unit in the 2009 purchase of
Wyeth. It makes the Gold line of products for infants and
children and Enercal supplements for adults. The unit sells food
replacement and supplement products in more than 80 countries,
according to the company&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall sales of baby food and milk formula in Asia, Latin
America and Eastern Europe more than doubled from 2005 to 2010,
according to Euromonitor, a London-based research firm. Nestle
SA (NESN) of Vevey, Switzerland, and Paris-based Danone (BN) are the market
leaders for infant formula in those markets, Euromonitor said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, Pfizer bought Wyeth to add biologic drugs,
consumer and animal health products, and baby formula. The
company expanded sales in emerging markets such as China, India
and Brazil to 18 percent of the company&#8217;s revenue under Jeffrey Kindler, who was CEO from July 2006 until Read replaced him in
December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. (MJN), the baby-formula maker that
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) took public in February 2009, had sales
of $3.14 billion last year, led by Enfamil infant formula. The
Glenview, Illinois-based company has more than doubled since the
initial public offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbott&#8217;s Similac &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbott Laboratories (ABT), based in Abbott Park, Illinois, had
nutritional sales of $5.53 billion last year. The company sells
Similac baby formula. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s consumer unit, which sells the over-the-counter
brands Advil and Centrum, drew $2.8 billion in 2010 revenue,
making it the fifth-largest over-the-counter health products
business worldwide, Pfizer said in a February regulatory filing.
In addition to Advil and Centrum for pain management and dietary
supplementation, the unit sells the cough syrup Robitussin and
personal-care items including ChapStick and Preparation H. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil is planning to sell $500
million more of its 4.875 percent bonds due 2021 as it seeks to
take advantage of the lowest borrowing costs in seven months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The securities, which may be sold as soon as today, will
yield 105 basis points more than similar-maturity U.S.
Treasuries, according to a person familiar with the transaction.
Brazil hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Banco Santander SA to
manage the sale, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because terms aren&#8217;t set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s government is selling dollar bonds overseas for
the first time since September as it cuts spending and raises
interest rates to contain inflation following the fastest
economic growth in two decades. The yield on the country&#8217;s 4.875
percent notes due in 2021 has tumbled 51 basis points, or 0.51
percentage point, this year to 4.1 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The bonds fell to 3.99 percent on June
24, the lowest since November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil was upgraded to Baa2, the second-lowest investment
grade, from Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service last month,
following a boost by Fitch Ratings in April. Fitch rates Latin
America&#8217;s largest economy an equivalent BBB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offer follows Latin American sovereign dollar debt
sales earlier this year from Colombia and Mexico. Brazilian
companies have sold $29.5 billion of bonds this year, and are on
pace to surpass last year&#8217;s record issuance, Bloomberg data
show. &lt;/p&gt;

Braun" date="Jul 07, 2011  1:24 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-07/jpmorgan-will-pay-228-million-to-settle-municipal-bond-bid-rigging-claims.html"><headline>JPMorgan Will Pay $228 Million to Settle Municipal Bond Bid-Rigging Claims</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) agreed to pay
$228 million to settle federal charges that the bank conspired
to rig the bidding on investment contracts sold to state and
local governments to boost its profits at taxpayer expense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank, agreed to pay $177
million to settle federal and state charges and to return $51.2
million to municipal borrowers affected by the conduct, the
Securities and Exchange Commission said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department and the SEC for more than four
years have been investigating how banks and financial advisers
fixed the bidding on investments sold to municipalities.
Prosecutors say the conspiracy cost taxpayers by allowing banks
to pay governments below-market rates. JPMorgan&#8217;s penalties are
the largest yet to result from the investigation, which also led
to settlements with UBS AG (UBSN) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan &#8220;improperly won bids by entering into secret
arrangements with bidding agents to get an illegal &#8216;last look&#8217;
at competitors&#8217; bids,&#8221; Robert Khuzami, director of the SEC&#8217;s
enforcement division, said in a statement. &#8220;Municipal issuers
and investors didn&#8217;t stand a chance against the fraudulent
strategies,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department said the investigation is
continuing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement marks the second that JPMorgan has reached
arising from its municipal derivatives business, which sold the
investment contracts as well as interest-rate swaps to state and
local governments, before the bank shut it down in 2008. In
November 2009, the bank agreed to a $722 million accord with the
SEC to end an investigation over its sales of derivatives to
Jefferson County, Alabama, where its bankers made undisclosed
payments to friends of county commissioners to win business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan &#8220;doesn&#8217;t tolerate anticompetitive activity or
other violations of law,&#8221; the bank said in a statement. The
employees concealed their conduct from management, the bank
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The firm assisted the government agencies in their
investigations and is pleased to have resolved this matter with
its regulators,&#8221; the statement said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment contracts at the center of the charges are
purchased by states and cities with proceeds of money raised in
the $2.9 trillion municipal debt market, allowing them to earn a
return until the cash is needed for public works projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competitive Bidding &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While competitive bidding is meant to ensure local
governments get market rates on their investments, prosecutors
say bankers and brokers carved up the market among themselves.
The U.S. says that inflated their earnings at the expense of
taxpayers and the Treasury, which taxes investment earnings from
tax-exempt bond proceeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC said JPMorgan was involved in rigging the bidding
on 93 transactions in 31 states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, 18 bankers and advisers have faced criminal
charges, nine of whom have pleaded guilty, the Justice
Department said. Among them are James Hertz, a former employee
of JPMorgan. Hertz is among five former JPMorgan bankers who
received letters informing them that they&#8217;re targets of the
Justice Department probe, according to employment records filed
with regulators. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accidental drug overdoses from
prescription pills have more than doubled in the past decade as
deaths from illegal drugs decreased, a Florida study found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prescription medications were implicated in 76 percent of
all overdose deaths in Florida between 2003 and 2009, while
illicit drugs like cocaine and heroin were present in 34 percent
of deaths, according to data compiled by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Ten percent of overdoses came
from a mix of both illegal and prescription drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unintentional poisoning is the second leading cause of
injury death in the U.S. after automobile accidents, accounting
for 29,846 deaths nationwide in 2007, the CDC&#8217;s Morbidity and
Mortality Weekly Report, said. In 2007, the U.S. government
began the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program, a $9 million
program that provides state funding for recording and monitoring
prescription drug use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;By 2009, the number of deaths involving prescription
drugs was four times the number involving illicit drugs,&#8221; the
report said. &#8220;These findings indicate the need to strengthen
interventions aimed at reducing overdose deaths from
prescription drugs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of annual deaths from lethal concentrations of
prescription medicines increased 84 percent from 2003 to 2009,
while deadly overdoses of illegal drugs fell 21 percent. Deaths
from the narcotic painkiller oxycodone and anxiety medicine
alprazolam, sold under the brand name Xanax, more than tripled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Availability &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The sense is that the widespread availability of
prescription drugs is causing people to switch from illicit
drugs like cocaine and heroin,&#8221; Leonard Paulozzi, a medical
epidemiologist at CDC&#8217;s Injury Center, said in a phone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulozzi said most prescription overdoses were in men
between the ages of 45 and 54. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heroin death rates dropped 62 percent in the period.
Cocaine overdoses increased until 2007, and declined in 2008 and
2009, researchers found. Methadone rates rose 79 percent, the
study said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal government spent $15.1 billion on the so-called
War on Drugs in 2010, according to the Office of National Drug
Control Policy. Efforts to combat illegal drug use included
prevention, treatment, law enforcement and interdiction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lawsuit accusing JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) of conspiring with Bernard Madoff to injure an investment
company was rightfully dismissed by a U.S. District Court, an
appeals court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MLSMK Investment Co. accused New York-based JPMorgan of
violating U.S. racketeering law in conspiring with the Ponzi
scheme operator to harm investors. The plaintiff is barred from
making the claim by securities law, the higher court decided.
The ruling was filed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MLSMK lost its $12.8 million investment with Madoff&#8217;s firm
when the con man was arrested in December 2008, according to the
filing. It sued JPMorgan on grounds that the company was
Madoff&#8217;s banker, using state and federal law to allege that
JPMorgan helped Madoff to &#8220;fleece&#8221; his victims while
benefiting from fees paid by Madoff, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones in Manhattan dismissed
the case, saying the suit didn&#8217;t adequately show any of the
facts the plaintiff was alleging. The appeals court last month
affirmed the judge&#8217;s dismissal of the state law claims,
including aiding and abetting the fraud, commercial bad faith,
and negligence. The latest ruling affirms dismissal of the
outstanding claim brought under federal racketeering law,
according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, JPMorgan is fighting a $19 billion suit by the
trustee liquidating Madoff&#8217;s firm, who alleges some similar
violations by the second-biggest U.S. bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 73, is serving a 150-year sentence in a North
Carolina federal prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is MLSMK Investment Co. v. JPMorgan, 10-cv-3040,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended
trading Google Inc. (GOOG) equity options because the world&#8217;s largest
Internet-search company tends to post bigger-than-average price
swings after quarterly results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katherine Fogertey and John Marshall, equity derivatives
strategists at the New York-based bank, encouraged buying July
$535 calls and the same number of July $535 puts, a strategy
known as a straddle. They gave the recommendation in a report
released yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google shares moved an average of 6.1 percent in the first
trading session after the Mountain View, California-based
company released its last eight quarterly reports, according to
data compiled by Goldman Sachs. That compares with an average of
1 percent on all other days, Goldman Sachs said. Google will
report second-quarter profit of $7.86 a share excluding some
items on July 14, according to the average analyst estimate in a
Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock has climbed eight consecutive days, the longest
streak since December, cutting its 2011 loss to 9.2 percent.
Google rose 0.8 percent to $539.36 at 11:11 a.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V), the world&#8217;s largest
payment network, said a Federal Reserve cap on debit-card fees
may lead to slower growth in revenue and earnings in 2012
compared with the current year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue growth for the 2012 fiscal year will be in the
&#8220;high single-digit to low double-digits range,&#8221; the San
Francisco-based company said yesterday in a filing. That&#8217;s down
from a projection of 11 percent to 15 percent for the 2011
fiscal year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect that fiscal 2012 will bear the weight of the
regulations financially and in fiscal 2013 revenue growth will
regain momentum,&#8221; Visa Chief Executive Officer Joseph Saunders
said yesterday on a conference call. The 2012 forecasts are
&#8220;based on the changing business landscape including the
assumption that some portion of transactions may be routed
away&#8221; to competitors, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors have been concerned the cap on debit-card
transaction fees, mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, would crimp
Visa&#8217;s profits. The central bank last week capped debit-card
swipe fees, also called interchange, at 21 cents a transaction,
increasing the limit from an earlier proposal of 12 cents. The
system replaces a formula based on a percentage of the purchase
price that averaged 44 cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa and its rival MasterCard Inc. (MA) set interchange fees
that are paid by merchants and pass the money to card issuers
like Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) Shares of the
two card networks fell more than 10 percent on Dec. 16, when the
Fed&#8217;s cap was first proposed. Visa climbed 15 percent on June 29
when the Fed increased the cap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa rose $1.81, or 2.1 percent, to $90.01 at 9:53 a.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares advanced
25 percent this year through yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Improvement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;On balance, the rules are an improvement from the initial
draft proposed in December 2010,&#8221; Saunders said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diluted Class A common stock earnings-per-share growth in
the next fiscal year may be in the middle-to-high teens, less
than the 2011 per-share growth forecast of greater than 20
percent, the filing shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa projects client incentives, intended to generate
transaction volume on its network, will be at the high end of
the projected range of 16 percent to 16.5 percent of gross
revenue this year, Saunders said on the call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also completed a $1 billion stock buyback
program, purchasing 13 million shares at an average price of
$77, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan
Stanley kept their bullish view on oil and copper, predicting a
global recovery in the second half that will push up prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both banks maintained their Brent-crude forecasts even
after a 4.2 percent decline in the second quarter. The world
economy will accelerate in the second half, boosting demand and
helping raw materials with supply constraints, Goldman analysts
led by London-based Jeffrey Currie said in a report dated today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodity prices tracked by the Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI
Index of 24 raw materials lost 7.8 percent in the second
quarter, the worst performance since 2008, as a record
earthquake hit Japan, the U.S. expansion slowed and China
tightened monetary policy. Commodity assets under management
dropped $26 billion in May, the most since October 2008,
according to Barclays Capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Prices and returns will rise further later this year and
into 2012,&#8221; the Goldman analysts said. The SP GSCI Enhanced
Index will return 20 percent in the next 12 months, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe&#8217;s sovereign-debt problems as well as China&#8217;s above-
target inflation will continue to create near-term volatility,
Goldman said. China, the world&#8217;s top consumer of energy, metals
and grains, raised its benchmark interest rates by 25 basis
points yesterday, the third time this year after inflation
accelerated to the fastest pace since July 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. economy will expand between 2.7 percent to 2.9
percent this year, down from forecasts ranging from 3.1 percent
to 3.3 percent in April, the Federal Reserve said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent Crude &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman predicted Brent crude will advance to $130 a barrel
in a year&#8217;s time, while Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts led by New York-
based Hussein Allidina said it will average $120 this year,
increasing to $130 in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent crude oil advanced 0.8 percent to $114.51 a barrel as
of 10:43 a.m. London time today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil prices will be &#8220;pressured&#8221; in coming weeks after a
release of strategic oil stockpiles by member countries of the
International Energy Agency and will rise later in the year as
inventories shrink, Morgan Stanley said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We remain bullish oil, particularly in the second half,
and expect inventory draws will prompt OPEC to increase
production, at the expense of spare capacity,&#8221; Allidina said in
the report dated yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper will benefit from Chinese demand as the world&#8217;s
largest buyer has started restocking, Allidina said. The metal
will increase to $11,000 a metric ton in 12 months, Goldman
said, also citing increased purchases from China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy Corn, Soybeans &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy corn and soybeans, Morgan Stanley
said, after prices tumbled 17 percent and 6 percent last month.
&#8220;We view the recent weakness in agriculture prices as a buying
opportunity,&#8221; the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not every firm is as bullish on commodities. There could be
a &#8220;bull trap,&#8221; said Edward Meir, senior commodity analyst at
MF Global Holdings in Darien, Connecticut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe&#8217;s debt crisis has not yet ended because other
nations apart from Greece such as Portugal, Italy and Spain have
similar problems, he said. U.S. unemployment, higher interest
rates in the euro zone and China are among factors that &#8220;do not
make the case for being long commodities that compelling,&#8221; Meir
said in a report received today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Central Bank will raise interest rates for a
second time this year, increasing the benchmark by 25 basis
points to 1.5 percent, when council members meet in Frankfurt
today, according to all 55 economist forecasts in a Bloomberg
News survey. The central bank may increase borrowing costs
further in the fourth quarter, according to a separate survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman said there is &#8220;upside&#8221; to natural gas prices at
the U.K. National Balancing Point because of a &#8220;tightening
shift&#8221; in the global market for liquefied natural gas after the
shutdown of some nuclear plants in Japan and the loss of Libyan
oil and gas exports. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legal victories by owners of the New
York Mets and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) may slash the $100 billion
Irving Picard is seeking on behalf of Bernard Madoff''s clients,
undercutting bets traders have made on victims'' claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard, liquidator of Madoff''s firm, has filed 1,000 suits
on behalf of Madoff investors. He sued JPMorgan Chase for $19
billion, equal to all the money lost by all investors in
Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme. He sued HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) and a dozen
feeder funds for $9 billion, and seeks as much as $59 billion --
including trebled racketeering charges -- from Bank Medici AG,
its founder, Sonja Kohn, and UniCredit SpA. (UCG) The Mets owners,
Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz, face a $1 billion suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks say that Picard is straining the limits of the
law as he tries to grab back money for victims of Madoff&#8217;s
fraud. They won initial victories by persuading a judge to
remove their dispute with Picard from bankruptcy court to
higher district courts, which will decide whether Picard
exceeded his powers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the suits are scaled back by this tactic, Madoff clients
will have a smaller pot of damages from which to recover losses,
and investors who bought some of their claims at discount may
lose the bets they made. Madoff claims are now trading at
about 70 cents on the dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The general view is, Picard will have enough success with
his lawsuits to provide substantial recovery over and above what
has settled,&#8221; said Andrew Gottesman, who heads bankruptcy
claims trading at SecondMarket in Manhattan. &#8220;That&#8217;s what&#8217;s
driving pricing. If the trustee loses those lawsuits against the
banks, traders&#8217; sense of the risk involved would change.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signs of Fraud &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of Picard&#8217;s suits are based on the theory that banks
and investors had a duty to investigate what Madoff was doing.
Instead, he says they ignored signs of possible fraud such as
the con man&#8217;s low-grade accountants and unusually steady
results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, Madoff&#8217;s primary banker, could have stopped the
fraud if it had passed on its suspicions to regulators, Picard
said in his suit, revised on June 24 to triple his demands from
an earlier complaint. New York-based JPMorgan, the second-
biggest U.S. bank, &#8220;knew&#8221; that billions of dollars flowing
through the Madoff account &#8220;could not have been linked to a
legitimate business purpose,&#8221; he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks, though, don&#8217;t have a duty to investigate customers,
JPMorgan says. Picard&#8217;s interpretation of banking law &#8220;would
impose broad investigative duties on banks that do not exist,&#8221;
it said in February as it asked a district judge to take the
case out of bankruptcy court where Picard filed it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. System &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S. justice system, bankruptcy judges rank below
district court judges and they&#8217;re not supposed to interpret
undecided issues of non-bankruptcy law. That&#8217;s what the banks
say Picard&#8217;s suits require U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland,
who is handling the Madoff case, to do. So Picard has to
persuade a higher court that he has the authority to sue the
banks for damages before he can try to get any money from them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff said on June 6 that he will
decide if Picard can use U.S. racketeering law to sue Milan-
based UniCredit and other foreign banks, in the biggest
challenge so far to the liquidator. Picard&#8217;s bankruptcy court
suit against these banks represents about 60 percent of the
money he is seeking for investors in the Ponzi scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An adverse ruling from Rakoff could send Picard back to the
drawing board to see how much he can demand. He sued UniCredit
with Bank Medici and other parties for $19.6 billion in New York
in December, using the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act to treble the amount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duty to Investigate &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a July 1 court hearing, Rakoff said the Mets owners may
not have had a legal duty to investigate whether Madoff was
running a fraud. If he rules that they didn&#8217;t, he would
undermine Picard&#8217;s argument for taking back $700 million in
principal they invested with the con man. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If Picard loses in district court, the risk he has is
that he might get some money back from JPMorgan and lose the $19
billion,&#8221; said Chip Bowles, a bankruptcy lawyer at Greenebaum
Doll  McDonald PLLC in Louisville, Kentucky. &#8220;With the Mets
owners, there if he loses, he stands at best to get the
fictitious profits and not the $700 million in principal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard said in April he had recovered $7.6 billion to pay
$17 billion in claims, although most of the money isn&#8217;t
available for distribution. He and his law firm, Baker 
Hostetler LLP, have charged more than $175 million for their
work since the Ponzi scheme collapsed in 2008, according to
court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I just keep reading in the papers how much is being paid
to Picard,&#8221; Rakoff told the trustee&#8217;s lawyers at a May hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common-Law Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Manhattan judge, who in past rulings has struck down
some charges leveled against banks, also will decide if Picard
can bring common-law claims such as unjust enrichment against
HSBC and can sue on behalf of customers, since his job is to
liquidate the Madoff firm, Bernard L. Madoff Investment
Securities LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquidators aren&#8217;t allowed by law to bring class actions on
behalf of investors, HSBC says. Asking Rakoff on May 3 to
dismiss Picard&#8217;s suit, Europe&#8217;s biggest bank said Picard was
&#8220;attempting to steal&#8221; money from Madoff investors who sued
HSBC in class actions. He planned to hand their money to other
parties on the principle of &#8220;robbing Peter to pay Paul,&#8221; it
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard&#8217;s bank suits are &#8220;very aggressive,&#8221; according to
bankruptcy lawyer Harvey Miller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The question is whether Picard is suing for damages
caused to the estate, or pursuing rights that are personal to
the individual customers of the firm,&#8221; said Miller, a partner
at Weil Gotshal  Manges LLP who&#8217;s the lead bankruptcy lawyer
for Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. &#8220;The Supreme Court long ago
decided that a bankruptcy trustee could not sue based upon
personal claims of investors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard has estimated that his 1,000 suits if successful
would
bring in about $100 billion. His spokeswoman, Amanda Remus, said
he wouldn&#8217;t comment beyond what he&#8217;s filed in court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Custodian &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC, which acted as custodian for so-called feeder funds
that had money with Madoff, has denied that it ignored signs of
fraud at the Madoff firm. The bank lost almost $1 billion of its
own money investing in feeder funds, &#8220;a fact that clearly
undermines the trustee&#8217;s claim that HSBC was on notice of
Madoff&#8217;s fraud,&#8221; it said in a filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rakoff, who rejected securities regulators&#8217; $33 million
settlement with Bank of America Corp. over undisclosed Merrill
Lynch bonuses in 2009, also has dismissed or reduced lawsuits
against banks. In 2004, he refused group status to a case
against Lehman over biased research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defending his suit against HSBC, Picard said in a filing he
is suing on behalf of a fund for customers, not on behalf of
customers themselves. He similarly defended his suit against
JPMorgan, saying it wasn&#8217;t a class action either. JPMorgan
accused Picard of fighting a &#8220;back door&#8221; class action suit on
behalf of Madoff customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge McMahon &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in New York will decide
if Picard is entitled to bring such a suit against JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mets owners have also challenged the trustee&#8217;s right to
sue them. Brokerage customers don&#8217;t have a duty to investigate
their money manager, according to Katz and Wilpon. Rakoff said
that may be true, and that he will review Picard&#8217;s $1 billion
suit against them and other Sterling Equities Inc. partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff claims have shot up to around 70 cents on the
dollar, from about 30 cents in early December, according to
Gottesman, the Manhattan claims trader. That was before Picard
began filing his suits against the banks, and before the estate
of Madoff investor Jeffry Picower agreed to pay him $7.2
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t recommend paying 70 cents for Madoff claims,&#8221;
said Bowles. &#8220;Trying to bet on litigation is a real scary
game.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main case is Securities Investor Protection Corp. v.
Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, 08-ap-1789, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proposed Dodd-Frank swaps regulations
imposing margin requirements to reduce trading risks will
&#8220;damage the competitiveness&#8221; of foreign-based businesses of
U.S. banks compared with their overseas rivals, lawyers for six
banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
and Morgan Stanley told regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying margin requirements to transactions outside the
U.S. &#8220;will inevitably encourage customers to do business
instead with non-U.S. competitors,&#8221; lawyers representing the
banks said in a letter dated June 29 and sent to the Federal
Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., Commodity Futures
Trading Commission and other regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter, signed by lawyers at Sullivan  Cromwell LLP,
was sent also on behalf of Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Citigroup Inc. (C)
and Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The six banks endorsing the letter executed 97 percent of
the $321 trillion of over-the-counter derivatives traded by the
top 25 U.S. bank-holding companies as of March 31, according to
a June 17 report from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dodd-Frank, the financial-overhaul enacted last July, seeks
to reduce risk and boost transparency in the $601 trillion over-
the-counter swaps market after largely unregulated trades helped
fuel the 2008 credit crisis. The law requires bank regulators to
adopt capital and margin requirements for trades not guaranteed
by clearinghouses that stand between buyers and sellers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$2 Trillion &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The June 29 letter was sent in response to an April
proposal from banking regulators that would govern how swap
dealers collect margin for non-cleared trades. The proposed rule
may require U.S. banks to set aside $2 trillion in collateral
that could be used in more profitable ways, according to an OCC
study dated April 15. Public comments to the April proposal are
due by July 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the proposal, the banking regulators said foreign swaps
pose &#8220;no lesser risk&#8221; to a U.S. company because of their
location. The regulators were concerned that an exemption would
allow banks to design swaps to evade the law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe that the blanket application of the margin
requirements to all transactions by non-U.S. operations because
of the possibility that derivatives activity may move offshore
exceeds the extraterritorial scope and intent of the statute,&#8221;
the lawyers wrote in the June 29 letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, Jerry Dubrowski, a Bank of America spokesman, Mark Lake, a Morgan
Stanley (MS) spokesman, Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a Citigroup
spokeswoman, Elise Wilkinson, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, and
Howard Opinsky, a JPMorgan spokesman, all declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s plans to shed two
businesses boosts the potential payoff for three experimental
drugs moving toward regulatory review later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, yesterday said it
plans to sell or spin off its animal health and baby food
divisions. The units may command a price of $22 billion, said
Seamus Fernandez, an analyst at Leerink Swann  Co. in Boston.
Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read has said he plans to use
the proceeds to buy back shares and develop new drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read is giving new products led by the apixaban blood
thinner, the lung cancer drug crizotinib and tofacitinib for
rheumatoid arthritis added prominence within Pfizer&#8217;s revenue
portfolio. Divesting the units -- which generate $5.5 billion in
annual sales, or 8 percent of the New York-based company&#8217;s
revenue -- also lets Pfizer sharpen its focus on developing the
three drugs, which analysts surveyed by Bloomberg estimate may
reach $3 billion in annual sales by 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the next 3 to 6 months, there&#8217;s going to be a lot of
pipeline news, and as Pfizer gets smaller the pipeline becomes
more important,&#8221; said David Maris, an analyst with CLSA in New
York. &#8220;This is a management team that is following through on
what they said they would do, which is take a fresh look at the
business and decide what is important and what is not.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) must face claims it
aided and abetted murder, torture and sexual assault by its
security forces in Indonesia&#8217;s Aceh province, a federal appeals
court ruled, reinstating a lawsuit thrown out by a lower court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 2-1 decision today, the U.S. Court of Appeals in
Washington said Exxon Mobil didn&#8217;t have corporate immunity from
claims filed by 15 Indonesian villagers under the Alien Tort
Statute. The court reversed the ruling of a trial judge who said
the villagers couldn&#8217;t use U.S. courts to sue over alleged
actions that took place in Indonesia and involved the Indonesian
military during a period of martial law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It would create a bizarre anomaly to immunize
corporations from liability for the conduct of their agents in
lawsuits brought for &#8216;shockingly egregious violations of
universally recognized principles of international law,&#8217;&#8221; Judge
Judith Rogers wrote in her 112-page opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Exxon Mobil spokesman, Patrick McGinn, said the company
has &#8220;fought these baseless claims for many years&#8221; and is
reviewing the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In two lawsuits consolidated for appeal, Indonesian
villagers claimed Exxon Mobil was responsible for the abuses
because they were committed by an Indonesian military unit
dedicated only to Exxon&#8217;s Aceh facility and under the company&#8217;s
direction and control. Exxon provided material support to the
unit by hiring mercenaries for training, advice and
intelligence, the villagers alleged. The human rights abuses
began in the early 1990s, according to one of the complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human Rights Violations &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, was aware that the army had
committed human rights violations in the past, they claimed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth in Washington
ruled the Indonesian villagers didn&#8217;t have the right to sue
Exxon in a U.S. court because they are non-resident aliens. He
dismissed the lawsuits, filed in 2001 and 2007 against the oil
company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re really looking forward to going to trial and that
is what we hope happens,&#8221; said Agnieszka Fryszman, a lawyer for
the plaintiffs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is John Doe VII v. Exxon Mobil Corp., 09-7125,
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LivingSocial, the second-largest
daily-coupon site, is close to hiring JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Bank
of America Corp. and Deutsche Bank AG to manage its initial
public offering, a person with knowledge of the talks said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Washington, D.C.-based startup is expected to make a
formal appointment in the next three weeks, though negotiations
with any of the banks could fall through, said the person, who
asked not to be identified because the talks are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LivingSocial is seeking to raise about $1 billion in an IPO
this year, a person familiar with the matter said last week. It
aims to capitalize on surging demand for shares of Internet
companies after LinkedIn Corp., Yandex NV and Pandora Media Inc.
have each gained at least 20 percent since raising money in
public markets this year. Groupon Inc., the leader in delivering
daily coupons, filed in June 2 for a $750 million IPO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are not
contenders to handle LivingSocial&#8217;s share sale because of their
involvement in Groupon&#8217;s IPO, said the person familiar with the
decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CNBC reported earlier today that LivingSocial had picked
JPMorgan, Bank of America and Deutsche Bank as underwriters.
Maire Griffin, a spokeswoman for LivingSocial, declined to
comment. John Yiannacopoulos, a spokesman for Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America, declined to comment, as did
Tasha Pelio at New York-based JPMorgan and Scott Helfman, a New
York-based spokesman for Germany&#8217;s Deutsche Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expansion Planning &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LivingSocial, led by co-founder Tim O&#8217;Shaughnessy, raised
$400 million in April, valuing the company at $3.5 billion, two
people said at the time. The company will generate $1 billion in
revenue in 2011, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is tripling its workforce to 1,800 this year
and plans to more than double the cities where it offers deals
to 300, O&#8217;Shaughnessy said in an interview in December. Groupon
has more than 7,000 employees and sells coupons in more than 500
cities. LivingSocial had 24 percent of online daily deal revenue
in top North American markets in May, according to a study
released last month by Yipit. It gained 4 percentage points from
a month earlier, while Groupon lost 4 points, to 48 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies deliver daily discounts on restaurants,
hotels, events, and other goods and services. The daily-deal
market may generate $3.9 billion in U.S. sales in 2015, compared
with $873 million in 2010, according to research firm BIA/Kelsey
in Chantilly, Virginia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors in LivingSocial include Twitter Inc. backer
Institutional Venture Partners, as well as T. Rowe Price Group
Inc., Lightspeed Venture Partners, Revolution LLC, Grotech
Ventures and U.S. Venture Partners. Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) invested
$175 million in LivingSocial in December. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer
demanded today that Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) provide the state with
details on the type of oil that has been shipped through the
ruptured Silvertip pipeline over the last three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a letter to Exxon Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson,
Schweitzer sought a description of the oil, including its
viscosity, volatility and toxicity, along with any test data the
company has for the &#8220;most effective dispersant&#8221; for the crude
that spilled into the Yellowstone River.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s 12-inch pipeline was shut July 1 after rupturing
and leaking as much as 1,000 barrels of oil into the river. The
line runs 69 miles from Elk Basin, Wyoming, and supplies the
company&#8217;s Billings refinery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The demand comes as owners of property along the river are
banding together to push the company to do more to restore the
land, which they say was soiled by the leak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schweitzer asked that the information be provided as soon
as possible and no later than July 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Bradley Olson" date="Jul 08, 2011 11:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-08/montana-landowners-push-for-cleanup-of-exxon-oil-pipeline-leak.html"><headline>Montana Landowners Push for Cleanup of Exxon Oil Pipeline Leak</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Montana landowners who say their
property along the Yellowstone River has been soiled by oil that
leaked from an Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) pipeline are banding together
to push the company to do more to restore the land. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of about 20 people who own hundreds of acres in the
area met last night and agreed they would fight for complete
cleanup and restoration of their land, said Kelly Goodman, who
owns 100 acres off the river. A week after the spill, owners say
cleanup crews have yet to visit some farms and some want
independent air testing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to happen,&#8221; Goodman, 52, said
in an interview at her home in Billings, Montana, yesterday. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t think Exxon does either. They&#8217;re a big corporation. Do
they care?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, based in Irving, Texas, has apologized for the
&#8220;inconvenience&#8221; caused by the estimated 1,000 barrels of oil
that spilled into the river after its Silvertip pipeline
ruptured near Laurel, Montana. It&#8217;s begun to process claims from
some landowners for losses related to the July 1 spill,
including paying for hay, fencing and iPhones, according to
residents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Jeffers, a spokesman for Exxon, had no immediate
response to e-mailed questions about the company&#8217;s spill
response. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Silvertip line, which was transporting about 40,000
barrels a day prior to the leak, runs 69 miles (111 kilometers)
from Elk Basin, Wyoming, to Exxon&#8217;s refinery in Billings,
Montana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Independent Air Testing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many residents still feel wary of the company and its
assurances about cleanup efforts and the safety of air and
drinking water, said Alexis Bonagofsky, 30, who helped organize
the meeting and raises goats on a family farm in Billings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An employee of the National Wildlife Federation, she
remains skeptical of Exxon and plans to do her own independent
air testing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preliminary tests showed no hydrocarbon presence in the
river above drinking-water standards in the region, the
Environmental Protection Agency said yesterday. Use of the water
for irrigation poses no threat and municipal drinking water in
the area is safe, the agency said. Final test results will be
published in a few days, the EPA said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer, a Democrat, pulled out
of a leak-response group yesterday that includes Exxon and
federal agencies because it has barred reporters from its
meetings, violating state law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interests &#8216;Not Aligned&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our interests are clearly not aligned with those of Exxon
Mobil,&#8221; Sarah Elliott, a spokesman for the governor, said
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schweitzer has scheduled a public meeting today with
affected landowners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re not going to just take Exxon&#8217;s word for it,&#8221; said
Montana State Senator Kendall Van Dyk, a Democrat who represents
Billings. &#8220;The biggest company in the world can
afford to fix our infrastructure and protect our Yellowstone
River.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van Dyk works for Trout Unlimited, a group that advocates
for conservation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking through a field on Goodman&#8217;s property that remained
darkened by oil residue after the river receded, she said she
didn&#8217;t know how the soil, the trees and the grass her sheep use
for grazing would ever be completely cleaned up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellowstone Flooding &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the oil is within 30 miles of the spill site in
Laurel, although crude has been spotted 80 miles downstream near
Miles City, Montana, the EPA said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flooding from the Yellowstone River, which peaked in the
past week because of above-average snow melt, has hampered
clean-up efforts on land that was already damaged by heavy
erosion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An estimated 544 officials from Exxon and local and state
governments are involved in the response effort, including 360
who are in the field, the EPA said. The river, which flows
through Yellowstone National Park, empties into the Missouri
River in North Dakota. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cleanup crews have yet to show up at the 100 acres of land
owned by Goodman, who trains Belgian Shepherds in sheep-herding
and raises wheat and sugar beets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapidly flowing floodwaters on the Yellowstone have made
oil hard to spot along the river&#8217;s main path, but the backwater
channels and creek beds that make up an essential part of the
river&#8217;s ecosystem are saturated, Goodman said. Her family has
lived and farmed along the river for 130 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaseous Smell &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gaseous smell permeated the air near the water, which
Goodman said had grown far less noxious than on July 2 when she
awoke in her home and thought she had a gas leak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grayish residue of oil was visible on grass covering
almost 40 acres of her property formerly used for hay to feed
sheep. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodman said Exxon&#8217;s claim process was good. A company
representative visited her home in response to her request for
about 12 tons of hay to replace lost grazing fields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s cleanup efforts have been less visible, she said,
with no one showing up on her land after numerous requests since
July 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonagofsky, whose family farm is downstream from Goodman&#8217;s,
has fared better with cleanup. Crews have laid out booms to
contain the oil and prevent it from reaching shore. They&#8217;ve also
put absorbent materials in the water to capture the oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon paid $750 to replace her iPhone, which she dropped
into oil-soaked water while documenting the spill. The company

&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe Ltd. said it stopped
payments to WikiLeaks a second time, hours after an Internet
site restarted donations to the anti-secrecy group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WikiLeaks&#8217;s payment provider, DataCell, attempted to use
an alternative-payment gateway to process money sent through
MasterCard, the world&#8217;s second-largest payments network, and
Visa Europe, which runs the largest card network in the European
Union, Reykjavik, Iceland-based DataCell said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As soon as this came to our attention, action was taken
with the suspension of Visa payment acceptance,&#8221; Amanda Kamin,
a spokeswoman for London-based Visa Europe said in an e-mailed
statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe and MasterCard in December blocked WikiLeaks
from using its network to collect funds from donors. WikiLeaks,
led by Julian Assange, publishes secret documents, including
confidential U.S. diplomatic and military information.
MasterCard&#8217;s website has been attacked by hackers in retaliation
as recently as last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sveinn Andri Sveinsson, a lawyer for DataCell and WikiLeaks
in Reykjavik, confirmed that Valitor, a payment processor linked
to Visa and MasterCard, &#8220;terminated the contract with DataCell
for payment processing this morning,&#8221; he said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donation Processing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The reason they give is that orders have been given by
the international card companies to close down the gateway and
that processing donations to WikiLeaks is a violation of general
terms between the two parties,&#8221; DataCell said in a separate
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valitor, based in Reykjavik, declined to immediately
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MasterCard, the world&#8217;s second-biggest payments network,
said it had never changed its policy on accepting WikiLeaks
donations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;MasterCard&#8217;s position on acceptance has not changed,&#8221;
James Issokson, a spokesman for the firm, said in a phone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andreas Fink, DataCell&#8217;s chief executive, said in an e-mail
that the company may have received &#8220;five-to-six digit figures&#8221;
in donations for Wikileaks before the payments were halted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DataCell said yesterday it was also able to process
WikiLeaks donations made through American Express Co. (AXP), the
biggest credit-card issuer by customer spending. Christine Elliott, a spokeswoman for New York-based American Express Co.,
declined to immediately comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WikiLeaks Twitter account, which has almost 1 million
followers, posted a message yesterday about the &#8220;Financial
block workaround.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Donate whilst you can Visa, MasterCard and AmEx,&#8221; read
the rest of the message, which linked back to the WikiLeaks
website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe split from Visa Inc. (V) before the San Francisco-
based company&#8217;s initial public offering in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chicago trading firm accused Bank
of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase  Co., UBS AG and Citigroup
Inc. (C) of conspiring to manipulate the London interbank offered
rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks drove down Libor to generate billions of dollars
in profits from swaps, loans, interest rate derivatives and
other financial instruments whose value depended on the rate,
Eldorado Trading Group LLC said in a complaint filed July 5 in
federal court in Newark, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The civil lawsuit is one of several filed in response to
probes by the U.S. Justice Department, Securities and Exchange
Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission related to
whether there were improper attempts to manipulate Libor. The
rate, at which banks borrow from one another in the London
interbank market, is a short-term, international benchmark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks &#8220;had a substantial incentive to manipulate, and
in fact did manipulate, Libor downward, in order to increase the
income from its interest rate derivatives and similar
instruments,&#8221; according to Eldorado&#8217;s complaint. &#8220;This
manipulation resulted in billions of dollars in revenue.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eldorado owned futures and options contracts based on
Eurodollar deposits traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
from August 2007 to December 2009, according to the complaint.
It seeks to represent similar owners of contracts traded on the
Chicago exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karina Byrne, a UBS spokeswoman, said the Zurich-based bank
is cooperating with the U.S. probes, and has also gotten
requests for information from the Japan Financial Services
Agency and the U.K. Financial Services Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe this suit is without merit,&#8221; Danielle Romero-
Apsilos, a spokeswoman for New York-based Citigroup, said in an
e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawrence Grayson, a spokesman for Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America, declined to comment. Jennifer
Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan, declined
to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Eldorado Trading Group LLC v. Bank of America
Corp. (BAC), 11-cv-3847, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey
(Newark). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liberty Mutual, Safeco Sue Goldman Alleging Securities Fraud &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. and Safeco Corp. sued Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) for &#8220;making misleading statements and
omissions&#8221; in a preferred-stock offering for Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp. (FMCC) in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs, which also include Peerless Insurance Co.,
said they invested $37.5 million in the offering of Freddie Mac
shares, which Goldman underwrote, according to a filing July 6
in federal court in Boston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman claimed Freddie Mac &#8220;already met its regulatory
capital requirements&#8221; and that the offering was made to
increase the mortgage company&#8217;s capital base, the plaintiffs
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The stated purpose for the offering was false,&#8221; the
plaintiffs said in the complaint. &#8220;Goldman knew or recklessly
ignored that Freddie Mac did not meet its regulatory capital
requirements, and Freddie Mac remained severely undercapitalized
even after the sale of the preferred stock.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The suit is without merit and we intend to contest it
vigorously,&#8221; Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based
Goldman Sachs, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insurers are seeking damages of more than $100 million
and a trial by jury. They said in the complaint that their
investments are &#8220;virtually worthless.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. v. Goldman Sachs 
Co., 11-11194, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts
(Boston). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blackboard Inc. (BBBB) Sued by Investor Over Providence Buyout Bid &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackboard Inc., an educational-software maker, was sued in
Delaware Chancery Court by an investor contending the company&#8217;s
stock is undervalued in a proposed $1.64 billion buyout by
Providence Equity Partners Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is being sold through &#8220;an unfair process and
for an unfair price,&#8221; shareholder Astor BK Realty Trust
contended in a complaint filed yesterday in Wilmington,
Delaware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Providence, Rhode Island-based investment firm agreed
July 1 to buy Blackboard, of Washington, for $45 a share in
cash, a 21 percent premium at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astor is seeking class-action, or group, status for the
lawsuit on behalf of common stockholders and an order to stop
the buyout or award damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Stanton, a spokesman for Blackboard, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a call seeking comment on the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Astor BK Realty Trust v. Chasen, Delaware
Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Reserves Right to Jury Trial in Lehman Lawsuit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), sued for $8.6 billion by bankrupt
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ), said it reserved its right to a
review of the case in U.S. District Court and a trial by jury,
according to a court filing yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is fighting Lehman&#8217;s suit in bankruptcy court in
Manhattan, saying it was protected by so-called safe harbor law
when it took collateral from the defunct firm in 2008. Congress
created the law to protect banks lending to faltering companies,
New York-based JPMorgan has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such issues aren&#8217;t usually decided in bankruptcy court,
according to JPMorgan. In yesterday&#8217;s filing, the bank said it
has a right to have the issues reviewed &#8220;de novo&#8221; by a
district court and to seek a jury trial &#8220;in any case,
controversy or proceeding related&#8221; to Lehman&#8217;s suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman claimed in the lawsuit filed last year that JPMorgan
demanded guarantees that fatally weakened the firm, and the
transactions weren&#8217;t eligible for safe-harbor protections.
Lehman demanded $8.6 billion in collateral, plus tens of
billions of dollars in damages from JPMorgan, the second-biggest
U.S. bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which lent $70 billion to Lehman&#8217;s brokerage
around the time of the September 2008 bankruptcy, sued Lehman
back, alleging it defrauded its lender into making the loan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, a district judge has taken over a $19 billion
lawsuit filed against JPMorgan by the trustee liquidating
Bernard Madoff&#8217;s firm. When asking the judge to take the case,
JPMorgan argued that it involved issues of common law and
federal law that a bankruptcy judge isn&#8217;t entitled to decide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lehman suit is Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 10-03266, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS Suits by Madoff Trustee May Be Handled by District Judge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A U.S. district judge said she will review lawsuits against
UBS AG (UBSN) by the liquidator of Bernard Madoff&#8217;s defunct firm, and
will probably take the case out of bankruptcy court to rule on
it herself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trustee Irving Picard sued UBS twice, demanding $2.6
billion and alleging the Zurich-based bank aided Madoff&#8217;s fraud
by setting up so-called feeder funds and agreeing &#8220;to look the
other way&#8221; at irregularities. U.S. District Judge Colleen
McMahon, who is handling Picard&#8217;s $19 billion suit against
JPMorgan Chase  Co., said the UBS case is related and raises
similar issues of whether Picard has a right to sue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a note to lawyers filed yesterday in court, McMahon gave
Picard until July 11 at 5 p.m. to explain on paper how she is
mistaken. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McMahon said in May that a bankruptcy judge isn&#8217;t entitled
to decide whether Picard has the right to sue New York-based
JPMorgan on behalf of the con man&#8217;s customers, and she would
handle that case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan argued that Picard was hired to liquidate the
Madoff firm, and wasn&#8217;t empowered by law to mount a class-action
suit to recover money on behalf of Madoff customers. Picard,
defending his suit, &#8220;misses the point,&#8221; the judge said. The
trustee last month trebled the amount of money he demanded from
the second-biggest U.S. bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UBS case is Picard v. UBS AG (UBS), 10-ap-4285, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan &#8216;Madoff&#8217; Suit Rightfully Dismissed, Court Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawsuit accusing JPMorgan Chase  Co. of conspiring with
Bernard Madoff to injure an investment company was rightfully
dismissed by a U.S. District Court, an appeals court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MLSMK Investment Co. accused New York-based JPMorgan of
violating U.S. racketeering law in conspiring with the Ponzi
scheme operator to harm investors. The plaintiff is barred from
making the claim by securities law, the higher court decided.
The ruling was filed by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MLSMK lost its $12.8 million investment with Madoff&#8217;s firm
when the con man was arrested in December 2008, according to the
filing. It sued JPMorgan on grounds that the company was
Madoff&#8217;s banker, using state and federal law to allege that
JPMorgan helped Madoff to &#8220;fleece&#8221; his victims while
benefiting from fees paid by Madoff, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones in Manhattan dismissed
the case, saying the suit didn&#8217;t adequately show any of the
facts the plaintiff was alleging. The appeals court last month
affirmed the judge&#8217;s dismissal of the state law claims,
including aiding and abetting the fraud, commercial bad faith,
and negligence. The latest ruling affirms dismissal of the
outstanding claim brought under federal racketeering law,
according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 73, is serving a 150-year sentence in a North
Carolina federal prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is MLSMK Investment Co. v. JPMorgan, 10-cv-3040,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Algosaibi Family Ordered by U.K. Court to Show Saudi Assets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia&#8217;s Algosaibi family and their company, which
defaulted in 2009, were ordered by a U.K. judge to disclose
their assets after admitting liability in a $250 million lawsuit
by HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) and four other banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahmad Hamad Algosaibi  Brothers Co. and more than a dozen
&#8220;wealthy&#8221; family members must provide lists of all assets
worth $50,000 or more by Aug. 4, including property in Saudi
Arabia, Justice Julian Flaux ruled yesterday in the High Court
in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Algosaibi, which had sought as many as six weeks to catalog
its Saudi possessions, was also told to reveal if any business
assets had been moved irregularly since June 16, when the family
dropped its defense during a trial on the banks&#8217; claims. The
company still hasn&#8217;t made a public offer to pay the banks, Flaux
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Saudi court order freezing Algosaibi&#8217;s assets in the
country &#8220;isn&#8217;t preventing the family from carrying on quite
expensive litigation all around the world,&#8221; Tim Lord, a lawyer
for London-based HSBC, said at the hearing. &#8220;It&#8217;s about time
they pay off these debts.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is part of a global dispute between Algosaibi and
one of Saudi Arabia&#8217;s richest men, Maan al-Sanea, who married
into the Algosaibi family and founded the Saad Group, which has
businesses ranging from construction to health care. Units of
Saad and Algosaibi, both based in the Saudi oil city of Al-
Khobar, defaulted after borrowing about $15.7 billion from more
than 80 banks. Algosaibi has sued al-Sanea in the Cayman
Islands, Saudi Arabia and New York, accusing him of heaping debt
on the company by taking out fraudulent loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Algosaibi, with interests including construction, beverage
bottling and finance, &#8220;remains willing to negotiate with banks
toward a fair and comprehensive resolution,&#8221; the law firm Baach
Robinson  Lewis Pllc in Washington said in a statement on
behalf of Algosaibi. &#8220;AHAB does not have the funds to pay the
massive amounts that were borrowed in its name.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The London case, stemming from the largest Saudi default to
come out of the credit crunch, includes HSBC&#8217;s $85 million
claim, British Arab Commercial Bank&#8217;s $19 million claim, Arab
Banking Corp.&#8217;s claims totaling $140 million and Credit Agricole
SA (ACA)&#8217;s $6 million claim. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, Mets Tactic May Cut Madoff Jackpot &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legal victories by owners of the New York Mets and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. may slash the $100 billion Irving Picard is seeking
on behalf of Bernard Madoff&#8217;s clients, undercutting bets traders
have made on victims&#8217; claims, Bloomberg News&#8217; Linda Sandler
reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard, liquidator of Madoff&#8217;s firm, has filed 1,000 suits
on behalf of Madoff investors. He sued JPMorgan Chase for $19
billion, equal to all the money lost by all investors in
Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme. He sued HSBC Holdings Plc and a dozen
feeder funds for $9 billion, and seeks as much as $59 billion --
including trebled racketeering charges -- from Bank Medici AG,
its founder, Sonja Kohn, and UniCredit SpA. (UCG) The Mets owners,
Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz, face a $1 billion suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks say that Picard is straining the limits of the
law as he tries to grab back money for victims of Madoff&#8217;s
fraud. They won initial victories by persuading a judge to
remove their dispute with Picard from bankruptcy court to higher
district courts, which will decide whether Picard exceeded his
powers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the suits are scaled back by this tactic, Madoff clients
will have a smaller pot of damages from which to recover losses,
and investors who bought some of their claims at discount may
lose the bets they made. Madoff claims are now trading at about
70 cents on the dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The general view is, Picard will have enough success with
his lawsuits to provide substantial recovery over and above what
has settled,&#8221; said Andrew Gottesman, who heads bankruptcy
claims trading at SecondMarket in Manhattan. &#8220;That&#8217;s what&#8217;s
driving pricing. If the trustee loses those lawsuits against the
banks, traders&#8217; sense of the risk involved would change.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main case is Securities Investor Protection Corp. v.
Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, 08-ap-1789, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign Bribe Sting Operation for Weapons Ends in Hung Jury &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. prosecutors&#8217; first foreign bribery case based on a
sting operation ended with jurors failing to agree whether four
security company executives sought corrupt deals from an agent
posing as a representative of Gabon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 12-member jury told U.S. District Judge Richard Leon in
Washington yesterday it had reached an impasse after six days of
deliberations. Leon decided to declare a mistrial rather than
sending the jurors back to continue deliberating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a close call, counsel,&#8221; Leon said in court. &#8220;What
makes it a particularly close call is the amount of time, money,
energy and effort&#8221; that went into this case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. prosecutor Joey Lipton said in court that the
government intends to seek a retrial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prosecution of the four is part of a 22-defendant
kickback conspiracy case stemming from the sting operation and a
fake $15 million weapons deal. It&#8217;s the biggest U.S. prosecution
of individuals for bribing foreign officials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors allege the men sought to funnel payments to
Gabon&#8217;s minister of defense in exchange for contracts to provide
guns, grenades and uniforms for the African country&#8217;s
presidential guard. The attempted payments violated the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defense lawyers accused the government of engineering the
conspiracy, breaking Federal Bureau of Investigation rules about
handling informants, and obscuring from their clients that the
deal involved a kickback payment by calling it a commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defendants -- John Wier III, Andrew Bigelow, Lee
Tolleson and Pankesh Patel -- have denied any wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laura Sweeney, spokeswoman for the Justice Department,
declined to comment, as did lawyers for the four defendants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Goncalves, 09-cr-00335, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan to Pay $228 Million to Settle Municipal Bid-Rig Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. agreed to pay $228 million to settle
federal charges that the bank conspired to rig the bidding on
investment contracts sold to state and local governments, the
Securities and Exchange Commission said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank, agreed to pay $177
million to settle federal and state charges and to return $51.2
million to municipal borrowers affected by the conduct, the SEC
said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department and the SEC for more than four
years have been investigating how banks and financial advisers
fixed the bidding on investments sold to municipalities.
Prosecutors say the conspiracy cost taxpayers by allowing banks
to pay governments below-market rates. UBS AG and Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) previously settled similar charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan &#8220;improperly won bids by entering into secret
arrangements with bidding agents to get an illegal &#8216;last look&#8217;
at competitors&#8217; bids,&#8221; Robert Khuzami, director of the SEC&#8217;s
Division of Enforcement, said in a statement. &#8220;Municipal
issuers and investors didn&#8217;t stand a chance against the
fraudulent strategies,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan &#8220;doesn&#8217;t tolerate anticompetitive activity or
other violations of law,&#8221; the bank said in a news release. The
charges were the result of former employees at a small part of
the company that has since been shuttered, the bank said. The
employees concealed their conduct from management, JPMorgan
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The firm assisted the government agencies in their
investigations and is pleased to have resolved this matter with
its regulators,&#8221; the statement said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo to Pay $125 Million Over Mortgage Securities &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) agreed to pay $125 million to settle
accusations by investors that the bank misled them about the
risks of mortgage-backed securities it sold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs in the consolidated group case, or class
action, include the General Retirement System of Detroit, New
Orleans Employees&#8217; Retirement System and other public pensions,
according to the settlement filed July 6 in federal court in San
Jose, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. home lender, and several
investment banks that underwrote the securities were sued in
2009 over alleged violations of securities laws in connection
with sales of mortgage pass-through certificates. The bank and
the underwriters deny wrongdoing, according to the court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The proposed settlement agreement is a negotiated
resolution as to all named defendants and is intended to avoid
the distraction and expense of litigation,&#8221; Ancel Martinez, a
Wells Fargo spokesman, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank still faces claims in state courts in California,
Illinois and Indiana filed by individual investors and federal
home loan banks seeking to rescind billions of dollars of
mortgage-backed securities purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a very favorable outcome and will be significant for
investors,&#8221; David Stickney, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said
in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re Wells Fargo Mortgage-Backed Certificates
Litigation, 09-1376, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
California (San Jose). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fisher&#8217;s Firm Told to Pay $376,000 on Investment Losses &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fisher Investments Inc., the firm run by Forbes magazine
columnist Kenneth Fisher, may have to pay damages of $376,075
for breaching its fiduciary duty to a retired investor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharyn Silverstein, 64, is entitled to out-of-pocket losses
she incurred as a result of Fisher Investments liquidating her
bond portfolio and investing 100 percent of the proceeds in
stocks, according to a copy of the interim arbitration award
obtained by Bloomberg News. Silverstein had invested with Fisher
in 2007 after multiple calls and visits from a Fisher outside
salesman, according to the award document. She had initially
contacted the firm after seeing a Fisher advertisement for a
complimentary book in USA Today, the document said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;She called Fisher to get a copy of a free book, with no
intention of doing business with Fisher, and ended up being
pressured and eventually persuaded, despite significant
resistance on her part and that of her husband, to turn over all
of her fixed-income securities to Fisher to be invested in
equities,&#8221; Karen Willcutts, the JAMS arbitrator for the case,
wrote in a 25-page interim award dated July 5. JAMS, based in
Irvine, California, is a private forum for arbitration and
mediation. Some investment adviser firm agreements include a
clause that parties must resolve any disputes through private
arbitration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The decision was completely wrong on the law and the
facts. With more than 25,000 clients, losing an arbitration once
every seven years is a record far better than any major
competitor, which underscores the integrity of our firm,&#8221; said
David Eckerly, group vice president corporate communications for
Woodside, California-based Fisher Investments. Kenneth Fisher is
the firm&#8217;s founder and chief executive officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Peiffer, a New Orleans-based attorney with Fishman
Haygood Phelps Walmsley Willis  Swanson, LLP, who represents
Silverstein, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China said it&#8217;s reviewing Google Inc. (GOOG)
and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s license applications to offer online
mapping services in the world&#8217;s largest Internet market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies&#8217; Chinese ventures, which submitted their
applications by the July 1 deadline, will be permitted to
continue their services while the review is under way, China&#8217;s
State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping said today in an e-mail
interview. The bureau didn&#8217;t say when it will make a decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, which withdrew its search engine in March 2010 to
avoid complying with China&#8217;s Internet censorship rules, competes
for online map services in the country with local rivals
including Baidu Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700) China has said it
will punish online map providers from this month that don&#8217;t
comply with May 2010 rules that prohibit operators from
publishing geographical data deemed sensitive by the government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mountain View, California-based Google, which has said
since March 31 that it&#8217;s discussing the matter with the Chinese
government, has no update on its online mapping service in
China, spokeswoman Jessica Powell said in an e-mail today.
Microsoft&#8217;s application is in process, Viola Wang, a spokeswoman
at the company&#8217;s MSN venture in China, said in an
e-mail. She said the company couldn&#8217;t provide guidance on how
long the application will be reviewed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some online map providers have published sensitive
information about China&#8217;s geography, posing dangers to national
security, Song Chaozhi, deputy director-general at the surveying
bureau, said in May 2010. Rules on online maps issued that month
helped address the risks, Song said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mapping Violations &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2008, online mapping services have committed more
than 1,000 violations including disclosure of confidential
information and mistakes in drawing the country&#8217;s borders, the
official Xinhua News agency had reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The licensing system aims to prohibit services that have an
&#8220;inadequate awareness of national security,&#8221; Xinhua said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baidu, Tencent, Sina Corp., Sohu.com Inc. (SOHU), and a Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)
venture in China were among the first recipients of online map
licenses in the country, the surveying bureau said last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, Google said the Chinese government is disrupting
its Gmail e-mail service and disguising the blockage as
technical issues on Google&#8217;s part. China&#8217;s Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Jiang Yu called that claim &#8220;unacceptable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google has been losing share in China&#8217;s search-engine
market since January 2010, when the U.S. company said it was no
longer willing to comply with Chinese regulations to self-censor
Web content. Two months later, the U.S. company shut its
Google.cn service and redirected Chinese users to a site in Hong
Kong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, owner of the world&#8217;s most popular search engine,
accounted for 19.2 percent of China&#8217;s search market by revenue
in the first-quarter, declining from 19.6 percent three months
earlier, according to research company Analysys International.
Baidu&#8217;s market share rose to 75.8 percent from 75.5 percent,
according to Analysys. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azentus Capital Management Ltd., a
Hong Kong-based hedge fund led by former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
proprietary trader Morgan Sze, increased assets to more than
$1.9 billion, said three people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azentus plans to stop accepting new money when the fund
hits $2 billion, said two of the people, who declined to be
identified because the information is private. It has &#8220;soft-
closed&#8221; the fund since its inception on April 1, taking
additional money only from existing and potential investors it
has been in talks with for some time, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azentus is benefiting from investor interest in large funds
staffed by teams with experienced traders as the European
sovereign debt crisis took a toll on industry performance.
Eurekahedge Hedge Fund Index slid more than 2 percent in May and
June combined, headed for the worst two-month performance in a
year, according to preliminary data from the Singapore-based
data provider. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a lot of global institutional money that wants
to get invested in Asia but there are relatively few billion
dollar plus funds,&#8221; said Paul Smith, chief executive officer of
Hong Kong-based asset manager and hedge fund distributor Triple
A Partners Ltd. &#8220;The Azentus launch provides an ideal asset
allocation opportunity for this type of investors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeting Biggest Funds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. and Europe-based institutions have driven recent money
flows into the global hedge fund industry, he said. They are
looking to allocate large sums of money and are targeting the
biggest managers because they are restricted from investing too
large a portion of any single fund out of risk concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azentus&#8217;s performance since fund inception on April 1 has
been &#8220;flattish,&#8221; with June&#8217;s number yet to be officially
announced, the three people said. The Eurekahedge gauge was down
1 percent in the same time period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Getting $2 billion invested in a rising market in Asia
would be very hard work,&#8221; said Smith. &#8220;Getting it invested in
sideways to down markets is very tough indeed. It will take a
while for Azentus to gain performance traction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sze, who is traveling, didn&#8217;t immediately reply to an e-
mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 45-year-old was a former global head of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
principal strategies proprietary trading desk, also known as
GSPS, people with knowledge of the matter said in March. The
bank&#8217;s largest internal hedge fund at its peak oversaw $3
billion of investments in Asia, they added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving Banks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sze was among proprietary traders who have left financial
services companies to start their own hedge funds as the U.S.
introduced the Dodd-Frank Act that restricts banks from making
bets with their own money in the wake of the worst financial
crisis since the 1930s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pierre-Henri Flamand, with whom Sze was once jointly
responsible for the GSPS team, left in March 2010 to start his
own hedge fund Edoma Partners LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ariel Roskis and Daniele Benatoff, former traders for GSPS
in London, have teamed up with Brummer  Partners to start
Benros Event Driven  Opportunistic Fund, which invests mainly
in European equities, debt and derivatives, Brummer  Partners
said on May 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London-based Benros Capital Partners, which manages the
fund, got an initial allocation of SEK2 billion ($316 million)
from Brummer  Partners, the largest Scandinavian hedge fund,
the Stockholm-based firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azentus, a global hedge fund focused on Asia, employs
strategies including event-driven, capital structure and
convertible bond arbitrage, distressed assets, volatility
trading, private securities and equity long-short, the people
said in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It raised $1.06 billion when it started trading on April 1,
the most by an Asia-based hedge fund startup since at least 2007,
three people with knowledge of the matter said in May. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) took over
the portfolio of DBS Partners LP, one of the largest independent
market makers for options on the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index,
after that firm declined to put up more collateral, according to
four people with knowledge of the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which had served as DBS&#8217;s clearing firm,
asked banks and brokerages late last week to submit offers to
close out about 575,000 options that Naperville, Illinois-based
DBS previously owned, said the people, who asked not to be named
because the information is private. That figure equals about 4.3
percent of the 13.5 million SP 500 contracts outstanding as of
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DBS co-founder Eric Wojcikiewicz, known as &#8220;Eji&#8221; among
traders at the Chicago Board Options Exchange, owned contracts
that would have cost about $470 million to unwind as of the end
of last week, said three people familiar with the portfolio.
When Goldman Sachs asked him for more collateral, he opted
instead to turn over his portfolio, two of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Eric was well-known as one of the largest players in the
pit with positions bigger than some of the banks&#8217;,&#8221; said Henry Schwartz, president of Trade Alert LLC, a New York-based
provider of options-market data and analytics. &#8220;With this guy
gone from SPX, you might not see as much liquidity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final Hours &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wojcikiewicz declined to comment, as did Michael DuVally, a
spokesman for New York-based Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under rules set by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, clearing firms such as Goldman Sachs Execution and
Clearing must determine the amount of risk that market-making
clients such as DBS have taken on through their investments.
They can then ask for more collateral or take a charge against
their own capital to reflect that amount of risk, according to
Michael Macchiaroli, an associate director in the SEC&#8217;s Division
of Trading and Markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the positions go down, they take the risk,&#8221;
Macchiaroli said in a telephone interview. He declined to
comment on the events at Goldman Sachs and DBS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Options are contracts granting their owners the right to
buy or sell a security, a commodity or an index&#8217;s cash value at
a set price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs put the contracts up for bids during the
final two hours of trading last week, just before the
Independence Day holiday weekend in the U.S., according to the
people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best Offer &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks and brokerages were seeking about $480 million, or a
$10 million premium, to take on the risk of closing out the
contracts. The best offer, at $457 million, came from another
Goldman Sachs unit, according to the people, meaning the bank
worked out at least part of the portfolio in-house. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a clearing firm takes over a client portfolio and then
passes it along to an affiliate, the company must follow CBOE
rules for such transactions, known as position transfers,
according to Gail Osten, a spokeswoman for the exchange. She
declined to comment on the DBS transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBOE Holdings Inc. (CBOE), owner of the oldest U.S. options
market, has the exclusive right to trade options on the
benchmark for American equities. SP 500 options were the third
most-traded U.S. contracts last year, according to data from
Chicago-based Options Clearing Corp., which clears and settles
all U.S. option trades on exchanges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four Friends &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DBS Partners was formed in March 1992 by four friends who
had attended the University of Pennsylvania, according to a
brokerage report that the firm filed with the SEC and a person
familiar with the firm. In addition to Wojcikiewicz, they
included Daniel Kerrane, Eric Bryant, and Kenneth Alpart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After attending Penn, located in Philadelphia, all four
went to work for Cooper Neff  Associates, this person said.
Cooper Neff, a Philadelphia-based options trading firm, agreed
to be acquired in 1994 by Banque Nationale De Paris, according
to Roy Neff, one of the founders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I remember him as a smart guy,&#8221; Neff said of
Wojcikiewicz in a telephone interview. &#8220;He was a physics person
and he added a lot to our mathematical modeling.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerrane died from cancer in 2002 at the age of 37,
according to an obituary published that November in the Chicago
Tribune and the person familiar with the firm. The two other
partners went to work elsewhere after DBS was formed, leaving
Wojcikiewicz as the firm&#8217;s last remaining principal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Floor Trader &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the 1990s, Wojcikiewicz worked on the floor of the
CBOE, where his identification tag had the initials EJI, the
people said. He later began making markets from an office in
Naperville, where his home is located. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DBS had derivative contracts with a market value of $753.4
million listed as assets on its balance sheet as of Dec. 31,
2001, the only year that it filed a brokerage report with the
SEC. Its liabilities included $708.6 million of derivative
contracts listed as financial instruments sold, not yet
purchased. Partners&#8217; capital totaled $19.3 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As a market maker and trader on various national
financial exchanges, the partnership is, in fact, in the
business of managing market risk,&#8221; DBS Partners said in the SEC
filing. &#8220;The partnership employs hedged, market-neutral trading
strategies and thus, in management&#8217;s opinion, market risk is
substantially diminished when all financial instruments are
aggregated.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s shareholders are in a
win-win situation as the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker considers
whether to spin off or sell its baby-food unit as part of a
corporate overhaul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, a comparable spinoff has
paid off at Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY), which got out of the
infant-formula business by distributing its stake in Mead
Johnson Nutrition Co. (MJN) in December 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mead Johnson has climbed about five times as much as
Bristol-Myers since the split, as depicted in the chart. The
companies went their separate ways 10 months after an initial
public offering of the unit&#8217;s shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s holders may fare even better if the company exits
baby food through a sale instead, according to Seamus Fernandez,
an analyst at Leerink Swann LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Demand would be high&#8221; and a sale would be relatively
straightforward, Fernandez wrote yesterday in a report. He
estimated that the unit&#8217;s price tag would be about $10 billion,
or 5 times sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone looking for a spinoff may have to set their sights
on Pfizer&#8217;s animal-health unit, the report said. The drugmaker
said yesterday that it would divest that business, along with
baby food, while keeping units that make consumer health-care
products and off-patent prescription drugs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY) expects its Cialis

prescription market, Wirtschaftswoche reported, citing Chief
Executive Officer John Lechleiter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cialis is ahead in markets including France, Italy, South
Africa and Australia, Lechleiter said in a report on the German
magazine&#8217;s website. The company has plans to sell the drug also
for other treatments, including prostatic hyperplasia, which
U.S. regulators are expected to give clearance for this year, he
told the magazine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lechleiter rejected reports that Lilly is thinking of
merging with other companies, including Bayer AG, the magazine
reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A U.S. House of Representatives
subcommittee will probe pipeline safety next week as Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM) works to clean up a 1,000-barrel July 1 oil spill in
Montana&#8217;s Yellowstone River. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and
Hazardous Materials said it will hold the pipeline safety
hearing July 14 in Washington. Congressman Denny Rehberg, a
Montana Republican, said on his Senate campaign website that he
had requested the hearing to examine the Irving, Texas-based
company&#8217;s pipeline leak near Laurel, Montana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have received 263 calls from the community,&#8221; Exxon
said in a statement yesterday, which said that about 500 people
are involved in the cleanup effort. &#8220;Our team is responding to
approximately 85 claims related to property, agriculture and
health.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Silvertip line, which was transporting about 40,000
barrels a day prior to the leak, runs 69 miles (111 kilometers)
from Elk Basin, Wyoming, to Exxon&#8217;s refinery in Billings,
Montana. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Valitor, a payment processor linked
to Visa Europe and MasterCard, said it didn&#8217;t know it would be
briefly channeling donations to WikiLeaks this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, based in Reykjavik, Iceland, said it suspended
an agreement with WikiLeaks&#8217;s payment provider, DataCell, when
it discovered it was collecting funds for the group. Visa
Europe, which runs the largest card network in the European
Union, said it stopped payments to WikiLeaks yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Valitor was not informed that DataCell would be
conducting these activities when their business agreement was
made,&#8221; the company said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London-based Visa Europe Ltd. and MasterCard in December
blocked WikiLeaks from using its network to collect funds from
donors. WikiLeaks, led by Julian Assange, publishes secret
documents, including confidential U.S. diplomatic and military
information. Purchase, New York-based MasterCard&#8217;s website was
attacked by hackers in retaliation as recently as last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DataCell Chief Executive Andreas Fink said in an e-mail
yesterday the company may have received &#8220;five-to-six digit
figures&#8221; in WikiLeaks donations before payments were halted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. energy company, said second-quarter profit rose from the
prior period on higher oil prices and wider refining margins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil and natural-gas production increased to the equivalent
of 2.733 million barrels a day in April and May, a 1.3 percent
increase from a year earlier, based on full-quarter results, 
the San Ramon, California-based company said in a statement. 
Chevron earned $6.21 billion in the first three months of this 
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is expected to report $7.1 billion in net
income for the April-to-June period, according to the average
estimate of six analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Chevron is
scheduled to disclose full second-quarter results on July 29. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SA (TLEVICPO), the world&#8217;s
largest Spanish-language broadcaster, reported a drop in second-
quarter advertising sales after a dispute with billionaire
Carlos Slim led to a slump in demand. The stock fell the most in
three months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broadcast division, Televisa&#8217;s largest unit, reported a
5.9 percent decline in sales to 5.48 billion pesos ($458
million), Mexico City-based Televisa said today in a statement
to the country&#8217;s stock exchange. Leaving out sales to Slim&#8217;s
businesses, the drop would have been 1 percent, Televisa said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slim&#8217;s companies stopped buying spots from Televisa this
year because of a disagreement over prices. The billionaire&#8217;s
land-line carrier, Telefonos de Mexico SAB, competes with
Televisa&#8217;s cable units for phone and Internet users, and the
companies filed antitrust complaints against each other this
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We would welcome them back as clients anytime,&#8221; Jose Baston, Televisa&#8217;s president of television and content, said
today on a conference call. The companies aren&#8217;t in talks to
reach an agreement, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second-quarter net income was 1.8 billion pesos, even with
a year earlier. Sales rose 4.7 percent to 15.1 billion pesos,
compared with the 15 billion-peso estimate of three analysts
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks slid, giving the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index its biggest two-day drop since
March, as concern grew Europe&#8217;s debt crisis will spread and
American lawmakers failed to agree on cutting the deficit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) fell more
than 3.2 percent, driving financial shares in the SP 500 down
the most since June 1, as Italian and Spanish government bonds
sank. Alcoa Inc. (AA) tumbled 2.9 percent before the aluminum
producer started the earnings season after the market close. All
10 SP 500 industries slumped, falling at least 0.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 retreated 1.8 percent to 1,319.49 at 4 p.m. in
New York, its lowest level since June 29. The gauge fell 2.5
percent over two sessions, the most since March 16. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average declined 151.44 points, or 1.2 percent,
to 12,505.76 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a combination of a worsening of the debt crisis in
Europe, and deficit and debt uncertainty in the U.S.,&#8221; said
Eric Teal, chief investment officer at First Citizens Bancshares
Inc. in Raleigh, North Carolina, which manages $4 billion. &#8220;The
markets will remain under pressure until the debt crisis in
Europe is perceived to be better contained.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 advanced 0.3 percent to 1,343.80 last week,
extending its climb from June 24 through July 8 to 5.9 percent.
That&#8217;s the biggest two-week increase since October 2009.
Equities have rebounded in July after the SP 500 tumbled 3.2
percent in May and June. The index was 10.39 points away from
its April 29 close, which was the highest level in almost three
years, before retreating at the end of last week as the nation
added 83 percent fewer jobs in June than economists forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bailout Funds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Euro-area countries may have to double their bailout fund
to 1.5 trillion euros ($2.1 trillion) to cover a crisis in
Italy, the European Central Bank said, according to German
newspaper Die Welt, citing unidentified &#8220;high-ranking&#8221; people
at central banks. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble
dismissed the report. The Financial Times cited unidentified
senior officials as saying European leaders are prepared to
accept that Greece should default on some of its bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. President Barack Obama said today he will continue to
press congressional leaders for &#8220;the largest possible deal&#8221; on
a package of significant deficit cuts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Now is the time to deal with these issues,&#8221; Obama said
at a news conference before resuming talks this afternoon with
bipartisan congressional leaders toward a compromise on reducing
deficits and raising the $14.3 trillion federal debt ceiling
before the government exhausts its borrowing authority on Aug.
2. &#8220;If not now, when?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial Companies &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial companies led losses among 10 groups in the SP
500, dropping 2.8 percent collectively. Bank of America
retreated 3.3 percent to $10.35, its lowest price since May
2009, and JPMorgan fell 3.2 percent to $39.43. Morgan Stanley (MS)
lost 3.2 percent to $21.58 and Citigroup Inc. (C) slipped 5.3
percent, the most since January, to $39.79. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The KBW Bank Index fell 2.8 percent as all 24 of its stocks
retreated. Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. home lender, dropped
2.5 percent to $27.59. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks will rise 15 percent over the next year, in part
because investors are able to look past the European debt crisis
and a U.S. unemployment rate stuck over 9 percent, Laszlo Birinyi said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Yes, we are aware that there are economic issues, there
are concerns and fears, but somehow to say that is to say the
market doesn&#8217;t know that. But the market does,&#8221; said Birinyi,
the president and founder of Westport, Connecticut-based
research and money management firm Birinyi Associates Inc.
&#8220;What I worry about are situations that the market doesn&#8217;t
understand,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Things like Greece and employment and
so forth, these are well within the scope of the market to
understand and discount.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcoa Reports &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcoa was the first Dow-average company to release second-
quarter results after-hours today. The largest U.S. producer of
the metal retreated 0.4 percent to $15.84 in trading following
the close of regular trading. The stock fell 2.9 percent to
$15.91 during normal hours as metal prices dropped on the London
Metal Exchange and Australia announced a new carbon tax. Twelve
companies in the benchmark SP 500, including JPMorgan,
Citigroup and Google Inc., will publish their earnings this
week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Undervalued Assets&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While SP 500 companies are poised to report the smallest
quarterly earnings increase since the equity bull market began
in 2009, growth for the measure is climbing back to its average
since the 1960s as valuations are stuck near credit-crisis
levels. David Kelly, who helps oversee about $445 billion as
chief market strategist for JPMorgan Funds, says that means
stock investors are buying an &#8220;undervalued asset.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy companies lost 2 percent as oil dropped after
Austria&#8217;s Finance Minister Maria Fekter said euro-area finance
ministers would discuss Italian debt issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest U.S. oil company, slumped
1.4 percent to $104.41 as crude for August delivery fell 1.1
percent to settle at $95.15 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the lowest level since July 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caterpillar Inc., the world&#8217;s largest maker of construction
equipment, dropped 2 percent to $108.16. Raw-materials producers
in the SP 500 lost 2.1 percent as a group, the second-most in
the benchmark index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM retreated 2.6 percent to $30.75 as European carmakers
declined after Renault forecast that its sales this year will
drop as much as 2 percent in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News Corp. had the biggest retreat in the SP 500, sliding
7.6 percent to $15.48. U.K. political leaders pressed Rupert
Murdoch to drop News Corp. (NWSA)&#8217;s bid to take full control of British
Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY LN) as the clamor over reports
of phone hacking at the News of the World newspaper intensified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further Declines &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arch Chemicals Inc. (ARJ) soared 12 percent to $47.37 after Lonza
Group AG, the world&#8217;s biggest maker of drug ingredients, agreed
to pay $47.20 per share for the maker of products that kill
micro-organisms. Lonza said it will pay $1.2 billion in cash.
Including debt, the acquisition values Arch at $1.4 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 may extend its drop to about 1,275, which is
near the gauge&#8217;s average level over the last 200 days, a level
monitored by analysts who study charts to make forecasts,
according to Katie Stockton, MKM Partners&#8217; chief market
technician. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market was extremely overbought from a short-term
perspective going into this week,&#8221; Stockton said in an
interview from Greenwich, Connecticut. &#8220;We probably have a few
more days of downside to go,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There&#8217;s support for
the SP 500 at around 1,275, which is the 200-day moving, so I&#8217;m
looking for a deeper pull-back.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration reached an
agreement with oil and gas companies including Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)
to begin a Superfund cleanup of Newtown Creek, a waterway
separating Brooklyn and Queens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The six parties responsible for cleaning up the
contaminated area -- Exxon; Chevron Corp.; BP Plc (BP/); Freeport-
McMoRan Copper  Gold Inc.; National Grid Plc (NG/); and the City of
New York -- will conduct a study determining the best options
for detoxifying the area, the Environmental Protection Agency
said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parties must pay EPA $750,000 for the agency&#8217;s prior
work at Newtown Creek and reimburse it for oversight costs. EPA
added the waterway to its list of the most hazardous Superfund
sites in September 2010. The water and sediment is contaminated
with pesticides, heavy metals and PCBs, or polychlorinated
biphenyls, a banned carcinogen, according to the EPA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Newtown Creek is one of the most polluted urban water
bodies in the country, and EPA is committed to making sure this
waterway receives a thorough cleanup,&#8221; EPA Regional
Administrator Judith Enck said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement announced today ensures that &#8220;the parties
responsible for the pollution, not the taxpayer, will foot the
bill,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EPA said it expects to identify more parties
responsible for contaminating the 3.5 miles (5.6 kilometers) of
Newtown Creek. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sediment, Water, Air &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation will begin within a few months, starting
with an analysis of contamination in the creek&#8217;s sediment,
surface water and surrounding air, according to the EPA. The
federal Superfund law seeks to make polluters pay for
eliminating environmental hazards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, now the
state&#8217;s governor, sued Irving, Texas-based Exxon Mobil, the
world&#8217;s largest oil company, over a Newtown Creek oil spill
first discovered in 1978. The company settled the case last year
for $25 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Exxon and London-based BP, companies
involved in the EPA agreement include Texaco, now owned by San
Ramon, California-based Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest U.S.
oil company after Exxon; Keyspan Corp., based in Brooklyn and
now a unit of London-based National Grid Plc, owner of natural-
gas and power networks in Britain and the U.S.; and Phelps Dodge
Corp., which was acquired by Phoenix-based Freeport-McMoRan
Copper  Gold Inc. (FCX), the largest publicly traded copper producer,
in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), in a
joint venture called Rockstar Bidco LP, won court permission to
buy the patent portfolio of Nortel Networks Corp. for $4.5
billion after outbidding Google Inc. (GOOG) in the biggest patent
auction in history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a joint hearing today, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Gross
in Wilmington, Delaware, and Ontario Superior Court Judge
Geoffrey Morawetz in Toronto approved the sale of more than
6,000 patents and applications related to wireless and Internet
technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This truly is a &#8216;wow&#8217; transaction,&#8221; said David H. Botter, an attorney for the main committee of Nortel&#8217;s unsecured
U.S. creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Nortel filed for bankruptcy in 2009, it began selling
its businesses, raising about $3 billion before the June patent
auction. The patent portfolio was the last major asset Nortel
had to sell, and will boost creditor recoveries. The sale should
close within 30 days, Lisa Schweitzer, a bankruptcy attorney for
Nortel said in court today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The winning group includes competitors-turned-partners of
Apple, such as Microsoft, Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM), Sony Corp. (6758),
Ericsson AB and EMC Corp., Nortel said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The auction, held June 27 to June 30, involved 19 rounds of
bidding and began with an opening bid from Intel Corp. (INTC),
Schweitzer said. Before the auction, Google signed a contract to
be the so-called stalking-horse bidder with a guaranteed offer
of $900 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breakup Fee &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That offer, which entitles the Internet search company to a
breakup fee of $25 million plus expenses, was exceeded by Intel
when the auction started and then followed by more offers, some
in writing, some made orally, Schweitzer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three companies and two groups competed in the first round
of bidding: Apple, Google, Intel, the initial Rockstar group
that didn&#8217;t include Apple, and Norpax LLC, a group led by
patent-buying company RPX Corp., according to court records
filed in Toronto. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minimum increase in the bids rose from $5 million to
$100 million after the second round of bids. After five rounds
of bidding, Apple joined Microsoft as part of the Rockstar bid
and Intel dropped out, according to Canadian court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google and Intel joined forces after eight rounds of
bidding and together stayed in the auction until the 19th round,
which was won by the Rockstar group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds Rise &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nortel&#8217;s bonds climbed after the auction results were
announced, with some selling for more than 100 cents on the
dollar. Nortel&#8217;s $450 million of 10.75 percent bonds that mature
in July 2016 closed today at 108.5 cents on the dollar,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. That&#8217;s down slightly
from its close on July 8, when bonds hit almost 109 cents on the
dollar, their highest close since the company sold the debt in
January 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nortel&#8217;s 6 7/8 bonds due in 2023 fell 5.45 percent today to
73.75 cents on the dollar, according to Trace. On July 1, the
day that Nortel announced the auction results, the bonds more
than doubled, from 33 cents on the dollar to 69 cents on the
dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy case is Nortel Networks Inc., 09-10138, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IPC index fell 0.4 percent to 36,359.49. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cemex SAB (CEMEXCPO MM), the largest cement maker in the
Americas, tumbled 2.4 percent to 9.50 pesos. Cemex had its
recommendation cut to &#8220;underperform&#8221; from &#8220;outperform&#8221; at
Credit Suisse Group AG, according to an e-mailed research note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genomma Lab Internacional SAB (LABB MM), the Mexican
producer of over-the-counter drugs, climbed 0.3 percent to 27.07
pesos. The stock&#8217;s 5 percent drop in the previous session wasn&#8217;t
backed up by any change in the company&#8217;s outlook and created an
&#8220;attractive buying opportunity,&#8221; Banco Santander SA wrote in
an e-mailed research note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SA (TLEVICPO) , the world&#8217;s largest

pesos. The company&#8217;s broadcast division reported a 5.9 percent
decline in sales in the second quarter to 5.48 billion pesos

even with a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wall Street banks are marketing
about $3.7 billion of bonds tied to property loans, wagering
investor demand for the debt will withstand mounting concerns
that the U.S. economic recovery is stalling and the European
crisis is spreading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Citigroup Inc. (C) are offering
$1.5 billion in bonds, while Wells Fargo  Co. and Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc (RBS) are selling $1.48 billion of securities,
according to people with knowledge of the sales. Deutsche Bank
AG (DBK) is marketing $685 million of notes tied to hotel mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are preparing as much as $10 billion in new sales of
commercial-mortgage bonds in the third quarter, according to a
July 8 report from JPMorgan Chase  Co. Even as the pipeline has
grown in the $700 billion market for debt tied to hotels,
offices and shopping centers, the U.S. unemployment rate has
increased to the highest level this year and credit markets have
been roiled by speculation that Europe&#8217;s debt crisis may engulf
Italy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top-rated securities linked to commercial real estate yield
209 basis points more than Treasuries as of July 8, according to
a Barclays Plc index. The spread has narrowed from 227 basis
points on June 24 after the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
halted its sales of mortgage bonds acquired in the rescue of
American International Group Inc., which had curbed demand for
debt ranging from high-yield bonds to securities linked to
property. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mortgage-bond deal from Goldman Sachs and Citigroup is
linked to 71 loans on 131 properties in states led by Texas,
Arizona and California, said a person, who declined to be
identified because terms aren&#8217;t public. The transaction from
Wells Fargo and RBS is linked to 76 loans on 132 properties in
states led by California, Wisconsin and New York. Both
securities may be sold as soon as next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hotel Debt &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank is selling debt linked to 168 hotels across
the U.S., said a person familiar with that offering. The
Marriott hotel franchise accounts for 60 percent of the pool.
Hilton properties are 17.5 percent, while Starwood accounts for
7.5 percent. The hotels are owned by Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
Whitehall Street real-estate unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offerings will bring 2011 sales of the securities to
$19.3 billion, compared with $11.5 billion in all of last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New World Resources Plc&#8217;s earnings
face &#8220;downside risks&#8221; after the largest Czech coking-coal
producer&#8217;s first-quarter profit missed estimates and the price
of the commodity peaked, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank rated NWR shares &#8220;neutral&#8221; with a 12-month
price estimate of 1,060 pence, analysts led by Vasily Nikolaev
in Moscow wrote in a report to clients dated today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While coking-coal imports to China, India and Latin America
help keep &#8220;tight&#8221; supply, the &#8220;price momentum is reversing as
the impact of floods in Australia is easing,&#8221; the analysts
said. Profit in the three months through March was 3 million
euros ($4.2 million), NWR said in May, missing the 21.5 million-
euro average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We do not view favorably the company&#8217;s high leverage to
coal prices, given healthy but softening seaborne coking-coal
prices,&#8221; the Goldman analysts wrote. &#8220;We see downside risks to
its 2011 earnings after weak first-quarter results.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock dropped 1.8 percent to 866 pence at its 4:30 p.m.
close in London. In Prague, NWR&#8217;s home market, it also retreated
1.8 percent to 237 koruna. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest

U.S. patents for the nerve-pain drug Lyrica. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apotex, based in Toronto, plans to market a generic version

&lt;p&gt;Fininvest SpA, the investment
company of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, was ordered to pay
Compagnie Industriali Riunite SpA more than 540 million euros
($770 million) by an Italian court. Fininvest said it will
appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will also have to pay interest and CIR&#8217;s court
expenses, an appeals court in Milan decided, according to the
text of the ruling released July 9 and obtained by Bloomberg
News. The decision is effective immediately, the court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marina Berlusconi, the premier&#8217;s daughter and Fininvest
president, called the decision a &#8220;bitter defeat for justice&#8221;
and &#8220;the umpteenth scandalous episode of frantic aggression
that has gone on for years against my father, by all means and
on all fronts, including entrepreneurial and economic.&#8221;
Fininvest will appeal the ruling, she said in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fininvest in October 2009 was ordered to pay 750 million
euros to CIR for bribing a judge during a takeover battle for
publisher Arnoldo Mondadori Editore SpA (MN) dating back to 1991.
Fininvest, which said at the time the ruling was &#8220;profoundly
unjust,&#8221; appealed and won a suspension of the court ruling,
which allowed the company to delay payment while its appeal went
through the courts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2009, Fininvest provided an 806 million-euro
bank guarantee, including interest and &#8220;ancillary costs&#8221; to
cover the damages owed to CIR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guarantee was provided by a group of banks including
Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP), UniCredit SpA (UCG), Banca Monte dei Paschi di
Siena SpA (BMPS) and Banca Popolare di Sondrio SCARL (BPSO), Ansa news agency
reported at the time. Compensation will be paid if Fininvest
loses the appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court said separately that Silvio Berlusconi
should be considered co-responsible for the civil charges tied
to the bribery ruling, Ansa reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caterpillar Accused of Demoting CPA Discovering Tax Dodge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) used offshore subsidiaries in Switzerland
and Bermuda to avoid about $2 billion in U.S. taxes from 2000 to
2009, boosting its earnings through a &#8220;tax and financial
statement fraud,&#8221; according to a Caterpillar executive&#8217;s
lawsuit, Bloomberg News&#8217; Peter S. Green reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, the world&#8217;s largest construction-equipment
maker, sold and shipped spare parts globally from an Illinois
warehouse while improperly attributing at least $5.6 billion of
profits from those sales to a unit in Geneva, according to the
suit filed by Daniel J. Schlicksup. He was a global tax strategy
manager for Caterpillar from 2005 to 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schlicksup, 49, sued in U.S. District Court in Peoria,
Illinois, in 2009, claiming he was moved to a job that limits
his career opportunities because he complained to superiors that
the &#8220;Swiss Structure&#8221; ran afoul of U.S. tax rules. He&#8217;s
seeking a court order to give him back his old job and prevent
any retaliation. He also seeks stock options that he claims were
wrongly withheld as well as legal fees and punitive damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His lawsuit, which calls the structure a &#8220;tax dodge,&#8221;
followed a request for job protection he filed with the U.S.
Department of Labor under provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
court records show. The law bars retaliation against corporate
whistleblowers. Schlicksup declined to comment for this story.
His attorney, Dan O&#8217;Day, declined to say whether Schlicksup has
taken his concerns to the Internal Revenue Service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caterpillar spokesman Jim Dugan said the company has
engaged in no wrongdoing, and its attorneys said in a court
filing that Schlicksup&#8217;s transfer wasn&#8217;t a demotion. Dugan
declined to comment on the suit&#8217;s specific allegations, saying
Caterpillar &#8220;complies with applicable tax laws and
regulations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magistrate Judge Byron G. Cudmore has ordered the pre-trial
exchange of evidence to continue, and according to court
records, a trial date has been set for Jan. 16, 2012, before
U.S. District Judge Michael M. Mihm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Schlicksup v. Caterpillar Inc., et al, 09-
01208, U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois
(Peoria). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commerzbank Unit, Eurohypo, Must Face QVT Fund U.S. Lawsuit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eurohypo AG, a unit of Commerzbank AG (CBK), must face a U.S.
lawsuit by QVT Fund LP over purported payments the bank owes QVT
and other investors in Delaware-based trusts owned by Eurohypo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delaware Chancery Court Judge Donald F. Parsons denied the
bank&#8217;s request to dismiss the complaint and ruled that the
issues in the case must be determined under Delaware law,
according to a court filing yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I conclude that the central questions before this court
require the application of Delaware law,&#8221; and Eurohypo&#8217;s
argument that the Delaware lawsuit will cause &#8220;inconvenience
and expense&#8221; because of a similar German proceeding &#8220;are also
unavailing,&#8221; Parsons said in the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit stems from a dispute over 2010 dividend
payments that weren&#8217;t made to QVT and other holders of trust
preferred securities which they claim they were entitled to
receive, according to court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maximilian Bicker, a spokesman for Frankfurt-based
Commerzbank, wasn&#8217;t immediately able to respond to an e-mail
seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eurohypo created the Delaware trusts in 2003 and 2005, and
raised $1.2 billion of &#8220;profit-dependent securities,&#8221; court
papers and company statements show. QVT, managed by New York-
based hedge fund QVT Financial LP, owns about $226 million of
the trust securities. QVT seeks about $68 million for the Trust
investors, about $14.1 million for itself, and &#8220;further
damages&#8221; to be determined at trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Having reaped the benefits associated with raising
capital from investors using Delaware entities, the defendants
now are unwilling to live up to their obligations,&#8221; QVT said in
the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank argues it wasn&#8217;t obligated to make dividend
payments to the Trust holders in 2010 because it wasn&#8217;t
profitable in 2009, and the payments are based on making a
profit in the previous year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is QVT Fund LP v. Eurohypo Capital Funding, CA5881
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expert-Network Founder Who Refused FBI Wire Expects Arrest &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Kinnucan, the expert-networking firm founder whose
public refusal of an FBI request to wear a wire presaged a dozen
insider-trading arrests, said he expects to be charged himself,
Bloomberg News&#8217; Patricia Hurtado reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kinnucan, who runs Broadband Research LLC in Portland,
Oregon, may have good reason to fear the worst. Federal
prosecutors in New York disclosed in court papers that they had
a court-authorized wiretap on his mobile phone in connection
with their case against Donald Longueuil, a former SAC Capital
Advisors LP portfolio manager who pleaded guilty to insider-
trading charges on April 28 in Manhattan federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter Shimoon, a former Flextronics International Ltd. (FLEX)
executive who pleaded guilty July 5 in federal court in New
York, said during his plea hearing that he had given Kinnucan
confidential nonpublic information about his own company, as
well as OmniVision Technologies Inc. (OVTI), Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Cisco
Systems Inc. (CSCO) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Am I a target? Yeah, absolutely,&#8221; Kinnucan said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;There&#8217;s a saying that the government
indicts who they investigate, so I have always assumed that I
was a target.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longueuil, Shimoon and Kinnucan have been swept up in the
biggest insider trading investigation in a generation, one that
has implicated hedge funds, technology firms and expert
networking firms like Broadband. Kinnucan denied he ever
received illegal tips on companies, and insisted the kind of
information he provided hedge fund clients was publicly
available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re trying to criminalize standard industry practices
here,&#8221; Kinnucan said. &#8220;The kind of information I provide to my
clients is exactly what is provided by large investment banks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kinnucan hasn&#8217;t been charged with a crime. Ellen Davis, a
spokeswoman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, declined
to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Walter Shimoon, 11-cr-00032, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countrywide Wages Victorious Tranche Warfare Against Investors &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors who sued over $351 billion in downgraded
Countrywide Financial Corp. mortgage-backed securities after the
2007 subprime market collapse may have to settle for less than 1
percent of what they initially sought, Bloomberg News&#8217; Edvard
Pettersson reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Senior Judge Mariana Pfaelzer in Los Angeles,
who narrowed the case to $2.6 billion in bonds and dropped
Countrywide parent Bank of America Corp. (BAC) as a defendant, has
gone further than other judges in scaling back such claims. Her
rulings in April and May show the difficulty of trying to hold
banks liable for billions of dollars in debt downgraded to junk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The recent court rulings provide encouragement for
Countrywide and Bank of America and could indicate that the
courts would limit or reduce the number of claims in these cases
or perhaps dismiss them in their entirety,&#8221; said Patrick
McManemin, a lawyer with Patton Boggs LLP in Dallas who has
worked on both sides of mortgage-securities cases and isn&#8217;t
involved in the Los Angeles litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countrywide, based in Calabasas, California, was once the
biggest U.S. residential home lender, originating or purchasing
about $1.4 trillion in mortgages from 2005 to 2007. The bulk of
them were sold to investors as mortgage-backed securities. Bank
of America acquired Countrywide in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Los Angeles lawsuit, filed last year and led by the
Iowa Public Retirement System, was, at $351 billion, the largest
in terms of securities at stake among dozens of cases brought
against lenders and underwriters. A hearing on Countrywide&#8217;s
next bid to have the claims dismissed is scheduled for Sept. 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case, like similar suits brought under the U.S.
Securities Act of 1933, isn&#8217;t part of an $8.5 billion settlement
announced June 29 between Bank of America and 22 institutional
investors in Countrywide mortgage-backed securities. That
accord, if approved, will resolve investors&#8217; claims that
Countrywide was required under contract to repurchase loans that
didn&#8217;t meet its underwriting guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Los Angeles case is Maine State Retirement System v.
Countrywide Financial Corp., 10-cv-00302, U.S. District Court,
Central District of California (Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RBS Asks U.K. Court to Block $100 Million U.S. Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) asked a U.K. judge to
limit the amount of e-mails it must turn over as it seeks to
halt Highland Capital Management LP&#8217;s $100 million U.S. lawsuit
over a failed bond transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBS is seeking a court order blocking the Dallas-based
hedge fund&#8217;s recent litigation in Texas. In that case, the bank
is accused of misleading a U.K. court last year in a lawsuit
over Highland&#8217;s failed collateralized debt obligation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highland was ordered in December by Justice Michael Burton
in London to pay RBS 19 million pounds ($30.5 million) over the
bond deal&#8217;s collapse, caused by the turmoil in the financial
markets in 2008. Burton awarded RBS about half of what it sought
after finding the Edinburgh-based bank had misled clients about
the CDO and offered deceptive evidence to the court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBS, which sued again in Britain to stop the Texas case,
argued July 8 in the High Court in London that the bank
shouldn&#8217;t have to provide the broad types of evidence Highland
affiliates are seeking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highland has separately appealed last year&#8217;s ruling,
claiming RBS&#8217;s behavior means it should pay less. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBS spokesman Michael Strachan declined to comment on the
case when reached by phone July 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mets Owners Again Seek Dismissal of Madoff Trustee&#8217;s Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owners of the New York Mets baseball team renewed their
request that a $1 billion lawsuit by the liquidator of Bernard
Madoff&#8217;s firm be thrown out after a judge said the trustee may
have erred in demanding money from them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz said July 7 in a court filing
that the trustee, Irving Picard, wasn&#8217;t entitled to take back
principal or so-called fictitious profit they made in Madoff&#8217;s
Ponzi scheme. Picard argued they should have investigated the
fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan agreed to
review the case, saying that judges have struggled with the duty
of inquiry into fraud for more than half a century, and it may
not have been the &#8220;governing law&#8221; for the Mets owners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard seeks the return of $700 million in principal and
$300 million in profit, saying the team&#8217;s owners had a duty to
investigate &#8220;red flags&#8221; warning of possible fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mets owners said the payments, made over 25 years,
&#8220;discharged the broker&#8217;s legal obligation to its customers,&#8221;
and couldn&#8217;t be treated as so-called fraudulent transfers, as
Picard tried to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The trustee can prove no such guilty knowledge, nor any
bad faith,&#8221; they said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. Katz, 11-cv-03605, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strauss-Kahn Faces Preliminary Paris Probe on Attempted Rape &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Paris prosecutor opened a preliminary investigation
July 8 into an attempted rape complaint by a French writer
against Dominique Strauss-Kahn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prosecutor will seek to determine whether there are
grounds for a full criminal probe into Tristane Banon&#8217;s claims
the former International Monetary Fund chief assaulted her in
2003 when she went to interview him, according to spokeswoman
Agnes Labregere-Delorme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strauss-Kahn, 62, stepped down from the IMF after being
charged with sexually assaulting a maid at a New York hotel in
May. He was released last week from home confinement and had his
bail returned after U.S. prosecutors uncovered evidence the 32-
year-old woman who accused him had lied about key aspects of her
life. Strauss-Kahn denies the claims in both cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Strauss-Kahn in France didn&#8217;t return calls for
comment. He has called Banon&#8217;s claims &#8220;imaginary&#8221; and asked
that a slander complaint against Banon be prepared, according to
a July 5 statement by his lawyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banon was an intern with magazine Paris Match in 2003 and
had just signed a contract for a book on politicians&#8217; regrets.
She met Strauss-Kahn in February for a follow-up interview at
his friend&#8217;s apartment in Paris, she said in an interview
published in the July 6 issue of L&#8217;Express. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strauss-Kahn turned off her tape-recorder and began
assaulting her, touching her breasts and putting his hands in
her mouth and underwear, she said, according to the magazine.
She kicked him and said &#8220;you&#8217;re not going to rape me,&#8221; then
ran out, got in her car and called her mother, the magazine
quoted her as saying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banon&#8217;s lawyer, David Koubbi, didn&#8217;t immediately return
calls for comment on the opening of the preliminary
investigation. Prosecutors received Banon&#8217;s complaint on July 6. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JJ&#8217;s Scios Unit Charged in Misbranding of Natrecor Drug &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson  Johnson (JNJ)&#8217;s Scios unit was charged by U.S.
prosecutors with misbranding the heart drug Natrecor because the
medicine&#8217;s labeling allegedly lacked adequate directions for
use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scios Inc. distributed misbranded Natrecor from Kansas
throughout the U.S. from August 2001 to June 2005, according to
a charging document filed July 7 in federal court in San
Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charge is a single misdemeanor count under the Federal
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, said Shaun Mickus, a spokesman for
New Brunswick, New Jersey-based Johnson  Johnson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With regard to the investigation that led to the
misdemeanor charge, the parties have reached an agreement that
is pending approval by the court,&#8221; Mickus said July 8 in a
phone interview. He declined to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charge carries a maximum fine of $200,000 or twice the
gain or loss resulting from the illegal conduct and unspecified
restitution, according to the charging document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joshua Eaton, an attorney with the Justice Department in
San Francisco, didn&#8217;t return a voice-mail message seeking
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department in 2009 joined two whistleblower
lawsuits accusing Scios of marketing Natrecor for unauthorized
uses. The practice cost the government-run health insurance
program Medicare &#8220;substantial amounts,&#8221; the department said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson  Johnson and Scios deny engaging in off-label
marketing of Natrecor, the company said in court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v Scios, 11-461, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JJ Suppressed Cancer Test Over Listerine Link, Suit Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson  Johnson, the world&#8217;s second-largest maker of
health-care products, was sued for at least $70 million by a
company that claims it interfered in a contract over
distribution of an oral cancer test. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oral Cancer Prevention International Inc., a private
company based in Suffern, New York, sued over a contract it
signed in February 2010 with OraPharma Inc., then a JJ unit.
OraPharma agreed to distribute OCPI&#8217;s Oral CDx Brush Test, which
identifies precancerous cells in the mouth, according to the
complaint filed in federal court in Trenton, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JJ, which also sells Listerine mouthwash, then grew
&#8220;extremely concerned about the implications&#8221; of a study
published in Australia that linked mouthwashes with a high
alcohol content to cancer, according to the complaint. JJ
didn&#8217;t want to &#8220;lend credence to the link between Listerine and
oral cancer&#8221; by selling both its mouthwash and OralCDx, the
complaint said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Johnson  Johnson induced OraPharma to breach the sales
agreement to suppress sales of and withhold from the public a
proven life-saving oral cancer prevention product in order to
protect the sales of its mouthwash, Listerine, which has been
linked to oral cancer,&#8221; said the complaint, filed July 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonnie Jacobs, a spokesman for New Brunswick, New Jersey-
based JJ, said the &#8220;company is confident that we have engaged
in proper business practices and we look forward to the
opportunity to resolve this matter through the legal system.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Oral Cancer Prevention International Inc. v.
Johnson  Johnson, 11-cv-3878, U.S. District Court, District of
New Jersey (Trenton). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil to Face Indonesia Human Rights Suit, Court Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) must face claims it aided and abetted
murder, torture and sexual assault by its security forces in
Indonesia&#8217;s Aceh province, a federal appeals court ruled,
reinstating a lawsuit thrown out by a lower court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 2-1 decision July 8, the U.S. Court of Appeals in
Washington said Exxon Mobil didn&#8217;t have corporate immunity from
claims filed by 15 Indonesian villagers under the Alien Tort
Statute. The court reversed the ruling of a trial judge who said
the villagers couldn&#8217;t use U.S. courts to sue over alleged
actions that took place in Indonesia and involved the Indonesian
military during a period of martial law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It would create a bizarre anomaly to immunize
corporations from liability for the conduct of their agents in
lawsuits brought for &#8216;shockingly egregious violations of
universally recognized principles of international law,&#8217;&#8221; Judge
Judith Rogers wrote in her 112-page opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Exxon Mobil spokesman, Patrick McGinn, said the company
has &#8220;fought these baseless claims for many years&#8221; and is
reviewing the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In two lawsuits consolidated for appeal, Indonesian
villagers claimed Exxon Mobil was responsible for the abuses
because they were committed by an Indonesian military unit
dedicated only to Exxon&#8217;s Aceh facility and under the company&#8217;s
direction and control. Exxon provided material support to the
unit by hiring mercenaries for training, advice and
intelligence, the villagers alleged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is John Doe VII v. Exxon Mobil Corp., 09-7125,

&lt;p&gt;Oakton Wins A$15 Million Settlement in Tenix Contract Fight &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oakton Ltd. (OKN), an Australian computer services provider, said
it won an A$15 million ($16.1 million) settlement in a contract
dispute with Tenix Solutions IMES Pty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither company admitted liability in the settlement,
Melbourne-based Oakton said in a statement to the Australian
Stock Exchange July 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oakton and Tenix sued each other in the Supreme Court of
Victoria, after Tenix canceled a contract Feb. 15, 2010, and
demanded A$19 million as compensation. Oakton countersued
claiming A$12 million in damages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Court Filings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dodgers Bankruptcy Suit Most Popular Bloomberg Docket &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Los Angeles Dodgers, which filed for bankruptcy
protection June 27, had the most-read litigation docket on the
Bloomberg Law system last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The filing came after Major League Baseball rejected a
television deal with News Corp. (NWSA)&#8217;s Fox Sports, leaving team owner
Frank McCourt unable to make payroll. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig said the 17-
year TV-rights deal, which McCourt valued at about $3 billion,
would harm the franchise in the long term. Baseball took over
the Dodgers&#8217; business operations about two months ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team listed assets of as much as $1 billion and debt of
as much as $500 million in a Chapter 11 petition filed in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is aiming to
sell Spanish residential mortgage-backed securities this year,
kick-starting a market shut since 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan wants to repeat its feat of reviving the U.K.
mortgage bond market in 2009 when it shepherded a 4 billion-
pound ($6.4 billion) sale for Lloyds Banking Group Plc, and
restarting Italian issuance with a deal for Banca Monte dei
Paschi di Siena SpA in November. Oldrich Masek, JPMorgan&#8217;s head
of securitized products origination for EMEA, said reopening
Spain&#8217;s market will be &#8220;our primary focus this year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spanish home loan-backed bonds may be a tough sell for a
country with Europe&#8217;s highest jobless rate, three years of
falling home prices and a five-fold increase in mortgage arrears
since 2007. Confidence in the nation was dealt a blow last week
when Moody&#8217;s Investors Service downgraded its neighbor Portugal
to junk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A deal &#8220;is a real challenge in the current market,&#8221; said
Luis Merino, a Madrid-based fund manager at La Caixa who helps
oversee 15 billion euros ($21 billion) including asset-backed
debt. A reopening of Spain&#8217;s mortgage bond market &#8220;would be one
of the most important milestones in the recovery of the Spanish
financial sector and the country&#8217;s economy,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spain&#8217;s banks have been the third-largest issuers of the
notes in Europe after the U.K. and the Netherlands, with 189
billion euros ($270 billion) outstanding, according to the
Association for Financial Markets in Europe. No Spanish
mortgage-backed securities have been sold publicly since a deal
by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA in July 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Housing Boom &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Spain has historically been a big securitization market
and Spanish banks need to raise funds,&#8221; JPMorgan&#8217;s Masek said
in an interview. &#8220;Secured funding is the most efficient way to
raise a large financing in a market with the problems of
peripheral Europe.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mortgage-backed securities helped finance a decade-long
housing boom in Spain before losses from subprime mortgage bonds
in the U.S. caused investors to shun hard-to-value assets. Banks
pool home loans and sell them to investors as bonds, allowing
lenders to raise capital more cheaply than by issuing unsecured
debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan arranged 17 asset-backed transactions totalling
19.3 billion euros in the first five months of the year, more
than any other bank, according to data compiled by Structured
Credit Investor, a financial information provider in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lloyds, BMPS &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The first deals in the Spanish ABS market are likely to
be offered as short-dated fast-pay senior tranches&#8221; to make
them more attractive to investors, London-based Masek said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s transaction for Lloyds opened the U.K. market
after it had been virtually shut since 2008, according to
Bloomberg data. As well as finding investors for the bonds, the
U.S. bank bought a 1.25 billion-pound portion of the deal and
provided a loan to Lloyds using the securities as collateral,
Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Italy, JPMorgan helped reopen the residential mortgage
bond market with a 995 million-euro transaction for Banca Monte
dei Paschi di Siena in November, the first public sale of the
debt since June 2007, JPMorgan data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPMorgan is possibly the best-placed player to reopen the
Spanish RMBS market, since not only are they able to arrange the
deal, but also to put in a lead order and provide financing,&#8221;
said Stefano Loreti, a senior portfolio manager at Cairn Capital
in London, who helps oversee more than $20 billion of asset-
backed securities. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t heard of any new issue Spanish
RMBS being marketed for a long time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher Fees &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bank arranging Spain&#8217;s first mortgage securitization
would get a significant increase in fees compared with pre-
crisis levels, according to Santiago Ruiz-Morales, who was
Credit Agricole SA&#8217;s head of asset-backed securities for Spain
and Portugal until 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the pre-crisis years, banks were organizing Spanish
RMBS transactions for fees ranging between 10 and 20 basis
points,&#8221; said Ruiz-Morales, now a partner at asset manager
Aguila Capital SL in Madrid. &#8220;Now, a new transaction would face
a huge increase in fees to reflect the higher marketing efforts
needed to get the deal done.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Cristina Alesci" date="Jul 11, 2011 12:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-11/goldman-erased-from-blackboard-buyout-after-tightening-terms.html"><headline>Goldman Erased From Blackboard Buyout After Tightening Terms</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) was left
out of financing Blackboard Inc. (BBBB)&#8217;s leveraged buyout after the
investment bank stiffened terms, another sign that private-
equity deals are becoming harder and more expensive to complete. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs increased the so-called flex on the portion
of the financing it originally agreed to provide Blackboard, the
education-software maker being acquired by Providence Equity
Partners Inc., according to people with knowledge of the deal.
The change would have given Goldman Sachs a bigger cushion if
credit markets moved against the New York-based firm before the
$1.64 billion deal closed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Providence balked at the new terms and the sale&#8217;s
announcement was put off while the firm lined up a new lender.
It&#8217;s the latest in a series of deals that have been delayed or
repriced as credit markets show signs of stress. New leveraged
loans fell 18 percent to $116.4 billion in the second quarter
from the first three months of this year, according to Standard
 Poor&#8217;s Leveraged Commentary and Data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A Greek sovereign debt default will most certainly lead
to risk contagion throughout the European banking system and
send shock waves through the global capital markets,&#8221; said
Michael Cerminaro, a co-founder of Sound Harbor Partners, a New
York investment firm that lends to middle-market companies.
Combined with a slowing U.S. economy, this &#8220;could put a damper
on deal activity over the near term.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising Risk &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stiffer terms from Goldman Sachs reflect concern at the
firm that credit markets are overheated and that risks are
rising as speculation swirls about sovereign defaults in Europe,
according to one of the people with knowledge of the firm&#8217;s
decision. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the
bank&#8217;s strategies are confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called flex gives lenders the ability to raise the
interest rate on a loan so long as it stays within a preset
range that the bank and borrower agree on. If credit markets
weaken, driving rates higher than the upper limit, a lender
could be forced to absorb the difference or hold the loan until
it can sell it at a better price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buyouts are typically financed with leveraged loans and
junk bonds, which carry some of the highest interest rates and
typically are among the first financing to be withdrawn when
credit tightens. While buyout activity more than tripled last
year to $95 billion, private-equity firms haven&#8217;t been able to
pull off the same kind of multibillion-dollar deals they
brokered before the credit crisis took hold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post-Crisis Deals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Del Monte Foods Co. is the biggest private-equity buyout
since the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008
prompted banks to shun financing for leveraged transactions. A
group led by KKR  Co. agreed to buy Del Monte for about $4
billion, plus $1.3 billion in debt, in November 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackboard managed to get $1.15 billion in debt-financing
commitments, according to a regulatory filing by the Washington-
based company, with Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) stepping in for Goldman
Sachs. Deutsche Bank was joined by Morgan Stanley and Bank of
America Corp. in providing a $700 million first-lien term loan,
a $100 million first-lien revolving line of credit and a $350
million second-lien term loan, according to the July 1 filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment. Officials at Blackboard and Providence Equity didn&#8217;t
return calls seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tighter Terms &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Blackboard deal follows two other buyouts crimped by
tighter terms. Another Providence Equity deal, SRA International
Inc., had to offer a bigger discount to sell its buyout loan.
The provider of technology and consulting services priced an
$875 million term loan at 95 cents on the dollar, less than the
initial 99-cent price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Lawson Software Inc. (LWSN), acquired July 6 by Golden
Gate Capital Corp. and Infor Global Solutions for $1.81 billion,
sweetened terms for loan buyers by boosting the yield and
cutting the maturity on the loan funding the buyout. Banks
including Credit Suisse Group AG sold almost all of the $440
million portion of a $1.04 billion buyout term loan for St.
Paul, Minnesota-based Lawson after declining the week before to
market that piece of the deal amid falling loan prices. The bank
group also included Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Royal Bank
of Canada and Deutsche Bank. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama is having
lunch at the White House today with four chief executives
representing the food, computer, shipping and railroad
industries to discuss the economy and job creation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guests include Scott Davis, chairman and chief
executive officer of United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS); Sam Palmisano,
chairman and CEO of International Business Machines Corp. (IBM); Matt Rose, chairman and CEO of BNSF Railway Co., and Clarence Otis
Jr., chairman and CEO of Darden Restaurants Inc. (DRI), according to a
White House e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agenda includes Obama&#8217;s efforts in recent weeks to link
job-training efforts to positions in the marketplace, urge
companies to work with community colleges and encourage schools
to offer courses and training to equip graduates with skills
that will land them a job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president on June 24 said he&#8217;s designating more than
$500 million for an effort with companies and universities to
speed technology development that will reinvigorate U.S.
manufacturing to meet global competition and create jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. unemployment in June unexpectedly rose to 9.2 percent,
the highest this year, the Labor Department reported on July 8.
Employers added 18,000 jobs, the weakest growth since September
2010. Payroll growth for May also was revised down, to 25,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
today released a letter from 470 CEOs urging Obama and Congress
to reach an agreement raising the government&#8217;s $14.3 trillion
debt ceiling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter also said the U.S. needs a &#8220;long-term,
predictable and binding&#8221; plan to reduce deficits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business Confidence &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As businesses make plans to invest and hire, we need
confidence that, in the absence of a crisis, our government will
not reverse course and return to large deficit spending,&#8221; the
letter said. &#8220;Now is the time for our political leaders to put
aside partisan differences and act in the nation&#8217;s best
interests.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama has frequently hosted lunches, dinners or meeting
with executives at the White House or elsewhere to solicit views
on the economy and jobs, such as a June 13 meeting of his Jobs
and Competitiveness Council in Durham, North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Los Angeles Dodgers paid the
lender temporarily financing the team while in bankruptcy a
$5.25 million fee that wasn&#8217;t properly disclosed, Major League
Baseball claimed in a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The filing is part of a dispute between baseball and
Dodgers&#8217; owner Frank McCourt over who will fund the team while
it tries to reorganize and exit bankruptcy. U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Kevin Gross on June 28 gave the team temporary approval to
borrow as much as $60 million from JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s
Highbridge Capital Management LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baseball officials said in a letter to Gross that it is
&#8220;critical&#8221; for them to examine any documents related to the
Highbridge fee because the Dodgers&#8217; have refused to let McCourt
be questioned under oath. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;MLB has been fully aware of the fee and the guarantee
since the hearing on the first day of the Chapter 11 process,&#8221;
Lyndsey Estin, a Dodgers spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed
statement. &#8220;This knowledge is furthermore reflected in MLB&#8217;s
opposition motion, which it filed on July 6.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commissioner Bud Selig has urged Gross to reject the
Dodgers&#8217; request to increase the Highbridge loan to $150
million. The Highbridge financing charges higher fees and a
higher interest rate that one offered by Major League Baseball,
according to baseball officials. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yell Group Plc (YELL), a U.K. classified
advertising publisher, rose as much as 24 percent after saying
it would provide online services to companies in partnership
with Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)
&#12288;&#12288;Yell will use Microsoft&#8217;s suite of cloud-computing tools,
including Office 365, to create a market for small- and medium-
sized businesses, according to a Regulatory News Service
statement. Yell, based in Reading, England, said results from
its online directory yell.com will appear on Bing, Microsoft&#8217;s
search engine.
&#12288;&#12288;The tie-up with Microsoft is part of a strategy to expand
Yell&#8217;s online operation as revenue from print advertising drops.
Company revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31 fell 12.4
percent from the previous year to 1.88 billion pounds ($3
billion).
&#12288;&#12288;About 1.3 million small- and medium-sized businesses in the
U.K., U.S., Spain and Latin America advertised using Yell Group
in the year ended March 31, according to the statement.
&#12288;&#12288;Anthony Carlisle, a media representative for Yell with
Citigate Dewe Rogerson Ltd., said the company aims to become &#8220;a
one-stop service to small and medium-sized businesses to connect
them with their consumers in the digital marketplace.&#8221; Yell
yesterday said it acquired Znode Inc., a software development
company which makes website for retailers.
&#12288;&#12288;Shares traded in London up 16 percent at 11 pence as of 11
a.m. The shares, which fell from a peak of 603 pence in February
2007 as the company struggled to deal with debt, earlier rose as
much as 24 percent to 11.75 pence, the highest since Jan. 27.
&#12288;&#12288;Rakesh Patel, an analyst at Goldman Sachs with a
&#8220;sell/neutral&#8221; recommendation on the company, said the deal
with Microsoft isn&#8217;t likely to reverse Yell&#8217;s fortunes.
&#12288;&#12288;&#8220;It&#8217;s the kind of stuff they should have been doing
already,&#8221; he said. The second issue is &#8220;how do they resolve
the debt,&#8221; Patel added, saying that refinancing is likely to
happen in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Richard Weiss" date="Jul 12, 2011  3:53 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-12/jpmorgan-leads-in-chemical-m-a-as-2011-may-be-record-correct-.html"><headline>JPMorgan Leads in Chemical M&amp;amp;A as 2011 to Challenge Record</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) took the lead
in advising on chemical mergers and acquisitions in the first
half as 2011 shapes up to be a potential record beater for deals
in the $2.5 trillion industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank, which replaced last year&#8217;s winner Deutsche
Bank AG (DBK), advised on five transactions valued at a combined
$19.14 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, based
on announced takeovers. Credit Suisse Group and UBS AG (UBSN) took the
No. 2 and No. 3 slots respectively, followed by Morgan Stanley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)&#8217;s $9.22 billion-acquisition of
lubricants maker Lubrizol is this year&#8217;s biggest deal in an
industry that&#8217;s drawing interest from buyout firms with renewed
access to credit as well as rivals. Cash holdings for the 167
companies in the Bloomberg World Chemicals Index swelled to
about $116 billion last year, an increase of 18 percent, as cost
cuts coincided with a global recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Momentum in the deal cycle is upwards,&#8221; said Bernd
Schneider, a consultant at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Frankfurt,
who advises on chemical deals. &#8220;2011 will definitely be a great
year. It may even become a record year for MA in chemicals.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pace will need to accelerate in the second half to beat
the existing $183 billion high of 2007, Bloomberg data shows. In
the latest deal to be announced, Lonza Group AG yesterday agreed
to buy Arch Chemicals Inc. for $1.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s tally includes working with Mosaic Co. when
investor Cargill Inc. sold shares in the potash maker and
advising DuPont Co. (DD) on its takeover of food-additives company
Danisco. Among the highest fees published this year is the $26
million paid by Lubrizol to Citigroup Inc. and Evercore Partners
Inc. amid the approach by Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Strategics Lead &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first half saw $60.26 billion in announced deals, an
increase of 41 percent. The average transaction size rose
similarly, to $271.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry remains largely fragmented industry, Schneider
said. The Bloomberg World Chemicals Index has returned 47
percent in a year, double the return of the broader Bloomberg
World Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Strategic buyers are taking the lead rather than
financial sponsors, reflective of a high level of CEO confidence
and the full recovery we have seen in share prices,&#8221; said Peter Hall, a partner at chemical adviser Valence Group, which has six
deals under its belt in the first six months of 2011. &#8220;Based on
our pipeline, MA activity in the sector is set to continue at a
high level for the coming months.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valence&#8217;s transactions include advising Bridgepoint Private
Equity Ltd.&#8217;s CABB on the purchase of KemFine from 3i Group Plc.
Other deals have involved Tessenderlo Chemie NV&#8217;s disposal of
PVC plastic operations to Ineos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deal Diversity &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The diversity of these deals and the sectors in which
they are involved demonstrate that in the current environment,
even relatively &#8216;difficult&#8217; businesses can be divested such is
the appetite amongst buyers,&#8221; Hall said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve managed to
deliver one of the first moves in many years in the much-talked-about consolidation of the European PVC sector.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disposals have attracted interest from buyers around the
world, including China, and targets will get more expensive,
said Hall. Higher prices aren&#8217;t necessarily a deal breaker as
CEOs are increasingly considering the long-term strategic
benefit of buying an asset, with less weighting placed on the
short-term savings from integrating acquired assets, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the next 12 months, Hall said he expects to see an
increasing number of the emerging-market players, especially in
China, gain the confidence to &#8220;pull the trigger&#8221; on
acquisitions, particularly where the target has world-leading
technology that can be applied in the domestic Chinese market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Multiples &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The multiples they have in some instances paid must be
evaluated against a backdrop of there being no immediate synergy
- so they have demonstrated their willingness to pay a market
entry multiple,&#8221; Hall said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand is coinciding with an expected increase in the
number of assets that are poised to be sold by private equity
firms, said Schneider. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are a lot of assets around held by private equity
for five years or more, some of them are overdue for an exit,&#8221;
consultant Schneider said. &#8220;Private equity investors need to
act now, and many assets are being prepared for a sale. Some
private equity investors seem to be under pressure to invest.
They are hungry for assets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spending by foreign visitors in

&lt;p&gt;Foreign consumer spending in the country from January to

change came from Russians, who increased their spending by
almost 81 percent, to 7.9 million euros. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rajat Gupta, the former Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) director, can proceed with a lawsuit claiming
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission violated his rights
when it filed an administrative action accusing him of passing
illegal stock tips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC initiated the administrative proceeding in
Washington on March 1, claiming Gupta passed information to
Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam about Goldman Sachs
and Procter  Gamble Co. (PG), where Gupta was also on the board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff ruled yesterday that Gupta,
who hasn&#8217;t been charged criminally, may argue that the agency
intentionally singled him out for unfair treatment in
retaliation for claiming his innocence. Rakoff said that all of
the other suits filed in the Galleon case, against 21 people and
seven companies, are in federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have the unusual case where there is already a well-
developed public record of Gupta being treated substantially
disparately from 28 essentially identical defendants, with not
even a hint from the SEC, even in their instant papers, as to
why this should be so,&#8221; Rakoff wrote in an opinion yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam was found guilty of 14 criminal counts of
conspiracy and securities fraud on May 11. He is awaiting
sentencing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Gupta v. SEC, 11-CV-1900, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIPC Opposes Attempt by Mets Owners to Dismiss Madoff Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Securities Investor Protection Corp. opposed a request
by the owners of the New York Mets baseball team to dismiss a $1
billion suit by the trustee liquidating Bernard Madoff&#8217;s firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trustee, Irving Picard, is suing Fred Wilpon and Saul
Katz and their firm, Sterling Equities, seeking the return of
$700 million in principal and $300 million in profit from
Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme. Picard claims the team&#8217;s owners had a
duty to investigate &#8220;red flags&#8221; warning of possible fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIPC yesterday asked U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in
Manhattan to let the suit go forward, arguing that Picard has
the legal authority to pursue the claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rakoff agreed this month to review the case, which Picard
filed last year in bankruptcy court. He said judges have
struggled with the duty of inquiry into fraud for more than half
a century and the duty may not have applied to the Mets owners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. Katz, 11-cv-03605, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strauss-Kahn&#8217;s French Accuser Makes Statement to Paris Police &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paris police took a statement yesterday from French writer
Tristane Banon, who has accused Dominique Strauss-Kahn of
attempting to rape her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banon met with the police yesterday, said Agnes Labregere-
Delorme, a spokeswoman for the prosecution, which began a
preliminary investigation on July 8 into her claim that the
former International Monetary Fund chief assaulted her in 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strauss-Kahn, 62, stepped down from the IMF after being
charged with sexually assaulting a maid at a New York hotel in
May. He was released from home confinement this month and had
his bail returned after U.S. prosecutors uncovered evidence the
32-year-old woman who accused him had lied about key aspects of
her life. Strauss-Kahn denies the claims in both cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banon&#8217;s lawyer David Koubbi declined to comment on her
police statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strauss-Kahn has called Banon&#8217;s claims &#8220;imaginary&#8221; and
asked that a slander complaint against her be prepared,
according to his lawyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of the alleged incident, Banon was an intern
with magazine Paris Match and had just signed a contract for a
book on politicians&#8217; regrets. She met Strauss-Kahn for a follow-
up interview at his friend&#8217;s apartment in Paris, she said in an
interview published in the July 6 issue of L&#8217;Express. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strauss-Kahn turned off her tape-recorder and began
assaulting her, touching her breasts and putting his hands in
her mouth and underwear, she said, according to the magazine.
She kicked him and said &#8220;you&#8217;re not going to rape me,&#8221; then
ran out, got in her car and called her mother, the magazine
quoted her as saying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EMG Shareholders Seek $8 Billion in Pipeline Damages &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholders of East Mediterranean Gas Co. will take legal
action against Egypt, seeking more than $8 billion in damages
for interruptions in natural gas supply through a cross-border
pipeline, a company official said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shareholders from Israel, the U.S. and Thailand agreed
on the action in the wake of three explosions in the past five
months that damaged the pipeline, which carries gas from Egypt
to Israel, Nimrod Novik, a member of the EMG board, said
yesterday. The company will pursue the claims through the
International Court of Arbitration, a dispute resolution service
run by the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The lawyers have advised the government of Egypt as well
as the United States and other relevant governments that this
process is under way,&#8221; Novik said in a telephone interview from
his office in Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv . &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Egypt restored gas exports to Israel last week at 20
percent of contracted amounts after a July 4 explosion disrupted
the network. Among the shareholders in EMG are Egypt National
Gas Co., Israeli businessman Yossi Maiman, U.S. billionaire Sam
Zell and PTT Pcl (PTT), Thailand&#8217;s biggest energy company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Sues Apotex Over Generic Version of Pain Drug Lyrica &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, accused Apotex
Inc. in a lawsuit of infringing two U.S. patents for the nerve-
pain drug Lyrica. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apotex, based in Toronto, plans to market a generic version
of Lyrica before the newest patent expires in 2018, Pfizer said
in a complaint filed July 8 in federal court in Wilmington,
Delaware. Pfizer claimed it &#8220;will be substantially and
irreparably harmed&#8221; by the alleged infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyrica generated more than $800 million in sales in the
first quarter for New York-based Pfizer, which is selling units
and trimming jobs in preparation for pending loss of patent
protection for its best-selling drug Lipitor, used to control
cholesterol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elie Betito, a spokesman for closely held Apotex, didn&#8217;t
immediately return voice and e-mail messages seeking comment on
the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Pfizer Inc. (PFE) v. Apotex Inc., U.S. District
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nakheel&#8217;s Ex-CEO Suing Developer for $3.7 Million in Dues &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nakheel PJSC&#8217;s former chief executive officer, Chris
O&#8217;Donnell, is suing the developer of palm-shaped islands off
Dubai&#8217;s coast for $3.7 million in unpaid dues, interest and
damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CEO, who quit last month after five years at the
developer&#8217;s helm, filed the lawsuit in the Dubai World Special
tribunal on June 22, according to a court filing dated June 22
and made available on the court&#8217;s website yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Donnell is seeking $3 million in long-term incentives as
well as $290,850 in losses tied to currency fluctuations. He is
also asking Nakheel to pay $180,000 in interest, calculated at
12 percent per year, the documents show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nakheel, which is restructuring $13 billion of debt, was
forced to cut hundreds of employees and cancel or delay property
projects after the global credit crisis caused demand in Dubai
to evaporate. Home prices in Dubai dropped more than 60 percent
from their peak in mid-2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former CEO was paid 3.8 million dirhams ($1 million) in
basic annual salary and was given a business class ticket to his
home country of Australia every year, the documents show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conrad Black Must Go Back to Prison by Sept. 6, Court Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conrad M. Black, the former Hollinger International Inc.
chairman and chief executive officer sentenced to serve an
additional year in prison, must report by Sept. 6, a federal
court in Chicago said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black&#8217;s original 6 1/2-year term was reduced to 3 1/2 years
last month by U.S. District Judge Amy J. St. Eve after the
former newspaper publisher successfully appealed two of three
mail fraud counts of which he was convicted in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;St. Eve, in an order dated July 5 and posted on the court&#8217;s
electronic docket yesterday, recommended that Black, 66, be
returned to the low-security prison at Coleman, Florida, where
he spent 29 months before being granted bail last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hollinger International was once the world&#8217;s third-biggest
publisher of English-language newspapers. Its publications
included the U.K.&#8217;s Daily Telegraph, Canada&#8217;s National Post and
the Jerusalem Post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black was originally found guilty for his role in the theft
of $6.1 million from the Chicago-based company now known as Sun-
Times Media Group Inc. Convictions overturned on appeal reduced
the total value of the theft to $600,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each court reviewing the case upheld the jury&#8217;s finding
that Black obstructed justice when he removed boxes from his
Toronto office that prosecutors said contained documents sought
by the U.S. government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Bureau of Prisons has final say on where Black
will serve the remainder of his punishment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Black, 05-cr-00727, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illinois &#8216;Jobs Now!&#8217; Stimulus Plan Upheld by Top State Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illinois Jobs Now!, the $31 billion economic stimulus
package of Governor Pat Quinn, was upheld by the state Supreme
Court in a ruling on the legality of the legislation that
created the program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court&#8217;s decision yesterday reversed a Jan. 26 ruling by
an intermediate-level appellate panel that held the legislation
creating the plan violated a state constitutional requirement
that bills be limited to a single subject. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What this means is our jobs recovery program can go
forward, full speed ahead,&#8221; Quinn said yesterday in a televised
press conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower-court&#8217;s ruling derailed projects approved by the
state legislature in 2009 and cast doubt on the future of
economic-development plans that were part of the stimulus
package. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among those plans were investments in state roads,
railways, schools and broadband Internet access, said Quinn, who
said he wanted to be &#8220;the builder governor.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The now-overturned decision had also blocked a revenue
stream generated by higher liquor taxes, privatization of the
state lottery and levies on video poker operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objecting to the tax increases, W. Rockwell Wirtz, the
owner of the Chicago Blackhawks hockey team, and his liquor
distributorship, Wirtz Beverage Illinois, sued to block the
program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wirtz group, in an e-mailed statement issued by outside
spokesman by Guy Chipparoni, said while it was disappointed by
the outcome, it respected the court&#8217;s opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our issue was not with the lawmakers, but the law,&#8221;
Chipparoni said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Wirtz v. Quinn, 111903, Illinois Supreme Court
(Springfield). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Citigroup
Inc. (C), which report earnings this week, are under pressure to
show that banks can increase revenue as the U.S. economic
recovery sputters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, set to announce results tomorrow, may say second-
quarter revenue declined 0.8 percent to $24.9 billion, according
to the average estimates of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Revenue at Citigroup, which reports results a day later, may
fall 10 percent to $19.9 billion, with more than half the
decline tied to assets the company has tagged for sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The street is going to be looking at revenue growth&#8221;
that will be difficult for banks to produce in the current
economic environment, Paul Miller, an analyst with FBR Capital
Markets, said in a phone interview. &#8220;You need the economy to
work, you need rates to go higher and you need to see continued
improvement in credit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boosting profit won&#8217;t be enough to impress investors,
according to analysts including Miller, a former examiner at the
Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. They already know that
fewer borrowers are defaulting, allowing banks to bolster profit
with funds that had been set aside for future loan losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, led by CEO Jamie Dimon, 55, may say second-
quarter profit climbed 6.2 percent from a year earlier to $5.09
billion according to the average estimate of analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. Citigroup may say profit rose 14 percent from the
same period last year to $3.07 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European banks such as BNP Paribas (BNP)
SA and Barclays Plc (BARC) may struggle to raise funds because
investors are concerned about the impact of the sovereign-debt
crisis spreading in the region, JPMorgan Cazenove analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two lenders, along with Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Credit
Agricole SA (ACA) and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS), are the most
at risk, the analysts, led by Kian Abouhossein, wrote in a note
to clients today. U.S. funds have been cutting their exposure to
banks in the euro area, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;U.S. investors in particular are getting more and more
worried about funding of European banks,&#8221; the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Central Bank executive board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said on July 11 that the link between sovereign risk and
bank risk is potentially &#8220;explosive.&#8221; The euro fell to a four-
month low against the dollar as the financial contagion spreads
to Italy from Greece, Ireland and Portugal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Losses on government bonds may also weigh on banks that
have lower core Tier 1 ratios, according to JPMorgan. Credit
Agricole, Societe Generale (GLE) SA, and UniCredit SpA (UCG) will need to
raise capital or sell assets, the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barton was notified by the U.S. Embassy that he won&#8217;t be

against Sporting Kansas, Orlando City and Columbus Crew,
Newcastle said in a statement on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&#8217;ll instead join up with Newcastle&#8217;s reserve team on its

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects to add Dimon&#8217;s title in second paragraph.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is winding down
its $154 billion mortgage portfolio to &#8220;close to zero&#8221; as the
bank works through mortgage losses and litigation over loan-
servicing and foreclosure practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which has reduced mortgage holdings by $19.3
billion in the past year, will continue shedding assets by about
as much as 15 percent a year &#8220;forever,&#8221; Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon told analysts on a conference call after the
New York-based company reported a 13 percent increase in net
income for the second quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s going to go down 10 or 15 percent a year until it&#8217;s
close to zero,&#8221; Dimon said in answering a question from Ed Najarian, the head of bank research at International Strategy
and Investment Group in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mortgage losses and litigation costs continue to weigh on
JPMorgan&#8217;s earnings. The company, the second-largest U.S. bank
by assets, added $1.27 billion to its litigation reserves,
mostly for mortgage-related issues, and took a $1 billion charge
in the second quarter to clean up some of its outstanding
foreclosure matters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon told reporters that the $1 billion charge covered
some of the costs to settle charges by U.S. and state officials
that the bank improperly foreclosed on borrowers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will take &#8220;some time&#8221; to resolve the mortgage problems
and the bank may face more expenses in the future, Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There have been so many flaws in mortgages that it&#8217;s just
-- it&#8217;s been an unmitigated disaster,&#8221; Dimon said. &#8220;We just
really need to clean it up for the sake of everybody. And
everybody is going to sue everybody else and it&#8217;s going to go on
for far too long a time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the bank will continue originating home-equity loans
at its current pace of $1 billion to $2 billion a quarter, home
loans &#8220;will never go back to where they were,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Crayton Harrison" date="Jul 14, 2011  6:31 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-14/televisa-falls-in-mexico-city-as-investors-see-slim-effect-take-profits.html"><headline>Televisa Falls in Mexico City as Investors See &#8216;Slim Effect,&#8217; Take Profits</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SA (TLEVICPO), the world&#8217;s
largest Spanish-language broadcaster, fell for the 10th time in
the past 11 trading days as investors responded to flat second-
quarter earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa fell 1.41 pesos, or 2.7 percent, to 50.97 pesos at
4 p.m. New York time in Mexico City trading, the biggest
percentage decline since April 7. The shares closed at their
lowest price since Oct. 4 and have fallen 13 percent since June
29, compared to a 1.1 percent decline for Mexico&#8217;s benchmark IPC
index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broadcaster reported second-quarter profit on July 11
of 1.8 billion pesos, matching a year earlier, on sales growth
of 4.7 percent. Broadcast sales fell 5.9 percent after a dispute
over pricing led billionaire Carlos Slim to pull his advertising
purchases from Mexico City-based Televisa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People focused a lot on the fact that net income was
flat,&#8221; said Enrique Gomez-Tagle, an analyst at HSBC Securities
Plc in Mexico City, in a telephone interview. &#8220;We already knew
the Slim effect, but maybe some people didn&#8217;t have it very well
understood.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa had said in February that Slim&#8217;s companies
represented 3.8 percent of its broadcast sales in 2010. Leaving
out Slim&#8217;s businesses, broadcast sales fell 1 percent from a
year ago, when Televisa also benefited from advertising spending
for soccer&#8217;s World Cup games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucio Aldworth, an analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
recommended yesterday that investors sell Televisa shares,
reducing his rating from &#8220;neutral.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peer Performance &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It will have trouble performing in line with its regional
peers given premium valuation and a softening outlook for its
broadcasting and pay-TV divisions,&#8221; Aldworth said in a research
note. He cited the loss of advertising from Slim and the World
Cup and a decline in Televisa&#8217;s share of the TV audience
weekdays during prime-time hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company reiterated its forecast this week for broadcast
sales growth this year of as much as 1 percent, and its results
generally beat analysts&#8217; expectations in most categories, Gomez-
Tagle said. The selloff in Televisa shares is an
&#8220;overreaction,&#8221; said the analyst, who recommends holding on to
the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The general view is that this wasn&#8217;t a bad result,&#8221; he
said. The shares would benefit from an agreement with Slim for
advertising or a better-than-expected economic recovery in the
U.S., he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa isn&#8217;t in talks with Slim&#8217;s companies for an
advertising agreement, Jose Baston, the company&#8217;s president of
television and content, said on a conference call this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have remained open to negotiate with them on market
terms whenever they are ready,&#8221; he said. A Televisa official
who can&#8217;t be named under company policy declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa investors may be collecting profits on an earlier
gain, Martin Lara, an analyst at Corp. Actinver SAB who
recommends holding the shares, said this week in an interview.
The shares gained 6.7 percent in June, compared to a 2 percent
increase in the IPC index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is taking
advantage of its stature as the most creditworthy of the largest
U.S. banks with its $1.75 billion sale of 30-year bonds, the
first from an American financial firm in almost six months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second-biggest U.S. bank issued the 5.6 percent notes
today to yield 140 basis points, or 1.4 percentage points, more
than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the last U.S. bank to sell
debt with such a long tenor, raised $2.5 billion of the
securities at a spread of 170 basis points on Jan. 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the least risky of the six-biggest U.S. banks
based on derivatives prices, tapped the corporate bond market as
issuance revived after being largely shut this month. The New
York-based lender&#8217;s better-than-expected earnings helped bolster
confidence in U.S. company debt even after Moody&#8217;s Investors
Service threatened to cut its rating on the world&#8217;s biggest
economy as negotiations over raising its debt limit faltered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Coming to the market with a 30-year bond right after
earnings is a show of strength,&#8221; said Pri de Silva, a New York-
based analyst at CreditSights Inc. &#8220;By doing it now, they&#8217;re
basically getting ahead of any potential uncertainty surround
Treasuries and the debt ceiling negotiations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous Offer &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its previous offering of 30-year debt, JPMorgan sold
$1.25 billion of 5.5 percent bonds on Oct. 14 that paid 165
basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg
data show. The debt traded yesterday at 102.5 cents on the
dollar to pay a spread of 115.2 basis points, according to
Trace, the bond price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan credit-default swaps, which investors use to hedge
against losses on the company&#8217;s debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, climbed 0.6 basis point to 89.4 basis points
after the company reported its highest half-year profit ever, at
$11 billion, according to data provider CMA. The contracts have
fallen from 114.3 basis points on Aug. 31, CMA data show.
investor confidence improves and rise as it deteriorates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading and investment-banking fees bolstered results at
JPMorgan as second-quarter net income rose 13 percent from a
year earlier, to $5.43 billion, or $1.27 a share, six cents
higher than the average estimate of analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank Swaps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on San Francisco-based Wells Fargo 
Co. (WFC) climbed 2.2 basis points to 98.7, contracts on Bank of
America Corp. rose 2.4 basis points to 171.5, and swaps on
Citigroup Inc. (C) increased 1.8 basis points to 149.6, the data
show. Contracts protecting the debt of Goldman Sachs were little
changed at 147.3 basis points and those on Morgan Stanley (MS)
climbed 1.5 basis point to 174.3, according to CMA, which is
owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in
the privately negotiated market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks have sold $240.5 billion of investment-grade
corporate bonds in the U.S. this year through yesterday, with 98
percent of offerings maturing in 10 years or less, Bloomberg
data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is able to issue 30-year debt because it&#8217;s &#8220;going
to generate $20-plus billion of profits in 2011 and 2012, and
has amongst the best balance sheets of all banks,&#8221; Joel Levington, managing director of corporate credit at Brookfield
Investment Management Inc. in New York, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Enticing Investors&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is taking advantage of a difference between
yields on 10-year Treasury notes and 30-year government bonds
that&#8217;s twice as big as the average over the last decade,
attracting investors as yields on investment-grade corporate
bonds hover at about the lowest this year, said Anthony Valeri,
market strategist at LPL Financial in San Diego. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a way of issuing debt at an attractive level while
recognizing the curve is enticing investors to buy longer-term
debt,&#8221; Valeri said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield gap widened to 130.1 basis points, compared with
a 10-year average of 63.8 basis points, Bloomberg data show.
Investment-grade corporate bonds yielded 3.72 percent, versus a
2011 low of 3.68 percent on June 1, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPMorgan seems to trade on their reputation, which is
obviously very good,&#8221; said James Leonard, an analyst at
Morningstar Inc. in Chicago. &#8220;There&#8217;s a belief that U.S. banks
have really gotten a lot of their problems behind them, as
opposed to the Europeans. Whatever their troubles are, they&#8217;re
very manageable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) rose the most
in eight months in New York trading after earnings beat
analysts&#8217; estimates and revenue unexpectedly climbed on gains
from underwriting stocks and bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares jumped as much as 4.1 percent after the New
York-based bank reported its highest half-year profit ever, at
almost $11 billion. Second-quarter net income increased 13
percent from a year earlier, to $5.43 billion, or $1.27 a share,
six cents higher than the average estimate of analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading and investment-banking fees bolstered results as
the retail bank labored under bad mortgages, low interest rates
and litigation over loan-servicing and foreclosure practices.
JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, was the
first of the six-largest U.S. banks to report earnings, topping
estimates for the 13th straight quarter, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;ve set a high bar for the rest of the industry in a
very difficult environment,&#8221; Michael Holland, who oversees more
than $4 billion in assets at New York-based Holland  Co., said
in an interview with Bloomberg Radio. The firm&#8217;s $26.8 billion
in revenue was &#8220;a blow-away number,&#8221; Holland said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cumulus Media Inc. (CMLS) increased the
interest rate and changed the structure on $2.04 billion in
loans it&#8217;s seeking to back the acquisition of Citadel
Broadcasting Corp. after lenders pushed back against the
original terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. broadcaster cut the size of the first-lien term
loan to $1.25 billion and is now offering a $790 million second-
lien portion, said three people with knowledge of the deal, who
declined to be identified because the transaction is private &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., which is arranging the transaction,
had to rework the financing after loan prices fell in June by
the most since May 2010 amid sovereign-debt concerns that could
threaten the global economic recovery and a growing pipeline of
transactions. Lenders are also demanding higher yields from
transactions such as Cumulus that don&#8217;t contain maintenance
covenants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market, with the reemergence of the Greece crisis and
worsening economic data, has shifted more neutral,&#8221; said Marc Gross, who helps oversee $3 billion in fixed-income funds as a
money manager at RS Investments in New York. &#8220;You needed a
little bit of a correction to help restore sanity to the market
and that&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening. Sanity is being restored to the
market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J.P. Hannan, chief financial officer at Atlanta-based
Cumulus, didn&#8217;t immediately return a call for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pricing Terms &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cumulus is offering lenders 4.25 percentage points to 4.5
percentage points more than the London interbank offered rate on
the seven-year, first lien-portion, with a 1.25 percent minimum
on the lending benchmark, the people said. The loan is expected
to price at 99 cents on the dollar, increasing the yield for
lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 7.5-year, second-lien loan will pay 6 percentage points
over Libor, with a 1.5 percent Libor floor, the people said. The
loan will price at 98.5 cents on the dollar. Commitments from
lenders are due at 12 p.m. New York time on July 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal was initially offered as a $2.04 billion term loan
that would pay 3.75 percentage points to 4 percentage points
more than Libor, with a 1.25 percent floor on the lending
benchmark, according to two other people familiar with the
transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cumulus offered to buy Citadel in a deal worth $2.4 billion
to expand its coverage and cut costs, the company said in a
March 10 statement. Cumulus&#8217;s leverage, or debt to earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, was
expected to be 5.7 times after the initial $2.04 billion deal
had been completed, according to an April 25 Moody&#8217;s Investors
Service report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call Protection &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first-lien loan will give lenders a one-year soft-call
protection of 101 cents, meaning Cumulus would have to pay 1
cent more than face value to refinance the debt during the first
year, the people said. The company will not be able to refinance
the second-lien portion during the first year, then can do so at
103 cents on the dollar in the second year, 102 cents in the
third year and 101 cents in the fourth year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 Index,
which tracks the 100 largest dollar-denominated first-lien
leveraged loans, has dropped 0.81 cents on the dollar to 94.72
cents on the dollar since March 10. The index declined 0.94 cent
in June. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), this year&#8217;s
top adviser on corporate takeovers, promoted Larry Slaughter to
co-head of its North American investment banking division,
replacing Jeff Urwin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slaughter, based in London and head of corporates for
Europe, the Middle East and Africa, will relocate to New York at
the end of the third quarter, according to a memo. A spokeswoman
for the second-biggest U.S. bank confirmed the appointment
today. He joins Kevin Willsey as head of the unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The promotion follows less than a month after Urwin was
appointed global head of investment banking. Slaughter, who
joined JPMorgan more than two decades ago, had helped oversee
European mergers  acquisitions and advised private-equity and
industrial clients, according to the memo. The spokeswoman
declined to say who will replace Slaughter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, based in New York, is the No. 1 adviser on global
MA this year, providing counsel on $282 billion in
transactions, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The firm
is working with ATT Inc. (T), the second-largest U.S. wireless
carrier, on its $39 billion bid for Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)&#8217;s T-
Mobile USA Inc. unit, the biggest transaction of the year,
Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slaughter has been based in London since 1992. He has
advised on the sale of Chrysler by DaimlerChrysler, moisturizer-
ingredient maker Cognis Holding GmbH&#8217;s sale to to BASF SE (BAS) and on
the acquisition of British drugstore chain Alliance Boots
Holdings Ltd. by KKR  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, the company said today that second-quarter net
income rose 13 percent, more than analysts projected, partly
because of surging profit at the investment-banking unit. Fees
from underwriting stocks and bonds boosted investment-banking
earnings to $2.06 billion, or 38 percent of the total. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, was
the most profitable bank in 2010, with a record $17.4 billion in
earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Rick Green" date="Jul 14, 2011  9:34 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-14/jpmorgan-has-2-5-billion-of-costs-tied-to-faulty-mortgages-forecolsures.html"><headline>JPMorgan Has $2.5 Billion of Costs Tied to Faulty Mortgages, Forecolsures</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) listed about
$2.5 billion in second-quarter costs tied to cleaning up faulty
mortgages and foreclosures as the industry tries to quell
concern over lending practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank added $1.27 billion to litigation reserves, mostly
for mortgage-related matters, and incurred $1 billion of
expenses tied to foreclosures, according to a slide show
accompanying today&#8217;s quarterly earnings report. Repurchase
losses were $223 million, according to the New York-based
company, which ranks second by assets among U.S. banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders are struggling to stanch losses tied to home loans
that were based on missing or wrong data about borrowers and
properties, and are facing probes of foreclosures that may have
used falsified documents. Some banks have bought back soured
mortgages sold to investors, with JPMorgan saying today it has
$3.3 billion in costs so far on repurchases from government-
backed firms such as Fannie Mae. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s additional litigation reserve may help cover
&#8220;fees and assessments related to foreclosure delays and
payments for other settlements,&#8221; including probes by the U.S.
Department of Justice and the state attorneys general, the bank
said. Litigation reserves also cover projected costs tied to so-
called private-label mortgage bonds that may have contained
faulty loans, the lender said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington Mutual &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reserves aren&#8217;t earmarked for liabilities from loans
made by Washington Mutual, the lender acquired after it
collapsed during the financial crisis. JPMorgan said those
liabilities are the responsibility of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., adding that the &#8220;FDIC has contested this
position.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outstanding balance of those loans related to
Washington Mutual was approximately $70 billion as of March 31,
with about $24 billion overdue by 60 days or more, according to
the company&#8217;s first-quarter regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s second-quarter net income climbed 13 percent to
$5.43 billion as investment banking profit surged and more
customers paid credit cards on time, the company said today. The
lender advanced $1.44, or 3.6 percent, to $41.06 at 9:31 a.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The bank declined 6.6
percent this year through yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Stephen Morris and Ben Martin" date="Jul 14, 2011  5:01 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-14/goldman-topples-deutsche-bank-in-europe-junk-bond-underwriting.html"><headline>Goldman Topples Deutsche Bank in Europe Junk Bond Underwriting</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) unseated
Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) as Europe&#8217;s top underwriter of high-yield bonds
in the first half. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The six-month income surge gives Goldman Sachs an edge as
high-yield issuance starts to slow amid Europe&#8217;s spreading
sovereign debt crisis. The U.S. bank underwrote 10.6 percent of
the record $54 billion of deals in the first half, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Deutsche Bank fell to second place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Underwriters made a lot of fees in the first half,&#8221; said
Janet Tavakoli, founder of Chicago-based Tavakoli Structured
Finance Inc., a financial consulting firm. &#8220;The high-yield bond
rally isn&#8217;t sustainable, certainly not in Europe. Now that we
have a lot of uncertainty and a little bit of panic in Europe,
investors are going to avoid these high-yield deals. You could
have impaired earnings for a long time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-yield issuance froze this week amid rising concern
European policy makers will fail to stave off a Greek default
and limit contagion to the rest of the region. Investors demand
50 basis points more than at the start of July to buy European
speculative-grade bonds, a premium to government debt of 620
basis points, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen some significant weakness in performance of
late in line with growth fears and the general risk-off trend as
a result of the Greek crisis,&#8221; said Suki Mann, London-based
senior credit strategist at Societe Generale SA. Mann expects a
decline in second-half issuance to 19 billion euros ($27
billion) from 26 billion euros in the first half. Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service tallied $58 billion of sales in the first half
and expects full-year volume to surpass 2010&#8217;s record $65
billion, according to a report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fees &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European underwriters, which don&#8217;t report fees on
individual deals, typically charge issuers at least 2.5 percent
of a high-yield borrowing, according to Tavakoli. High-yield, or
junk, debt is rated below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and
BBB- by Standard  Poor&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs reported $1.2 billion in revenue from debt
underwriting in 2010, flat to 2009. The bank was seventh among
European junk bond underwriters last year, Bloomberg data show.
It was last No. 1 in the second half of 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The high-yield product serves as a very good tool to help
us in client-acquisition efforts,&#8221; said Denis Coleman, head of
credit finance for EMEA at the New-York-based bank. &#8220;We have an
expectation of a longer-term shift in favor of institutionally
raised debt capital in lieu of more traditional bank finance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loan Surge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman managed 33 deals in the first half of the year,
including Boparan Group&#8217;s $1.1 billion sale of euro- and pound-
denominated bonds in April, Bloomberg data show. The bank also
managed a 250 million-pound ($400 million) issue for U.K. budget
clothing retailer Matalan Group Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank led a 67 percent increase in leveraged loans
in Europe, displacing Goldman Sachs as the top arranger.
Issuance of debt mostly used for private-equity led takeovers
jumped to $78 billion in the first half, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are living in times of volatility but we will continue
to see decent loan and bond volumes through the second half of
this year,&#8221; said Nick Jansa, European head of leveraged debt
and capital markets at the Frankfurt-based firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank helped Continental AG (CON), Europe&#8217;s second-
largest car-parts maker, cut its borrowing costs by arranging
565 million euros of loans to help refinance about 6 billion
euros of debt stemming from a 2007 acquisition of Siemens AG&#8217;s
VDO unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We felt that the timing was right because we didn&#8217;t know
how secure the market conditions would be in the course of 2011
and afterwards,&#8221; said Stefan Scholz, group treasurer of
Continental, based in Hannover, Germany. &#8220;Due to the euro-zone
sovereign crisis, it is not possible to predict.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s shareholders
deserve the kind of dividends paid by utilities, telephone
companies and cigarette makers, according to a hedge-fund
manager cited by Whitney Tilson, a managing director of T2
Partners LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manager recommended that the world&#8217;s largest software
maker more than double its annual payout, to $1.48 a share, in a
letter to Microsoft&#8217;s board last month. Tilson, whose funds also
own shares, published the correspondence on the Seeking Alpha
financial website two days ago without naming the writer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CHART OF THE DAY shows the projected dividend yield for
Microsoft since 2006, three years after the Redmond, Washington-
based company began making payouts. The chart also provides the
comparable yield on the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s 2.4 percent estimated yield as of yesterday
would have been 5.6 percent with the higher payout. The latter
figure is in line with projections for Pepco Holdings Inc. (POM), the
SP 500&#8217;s highest-yielding utility; ATT Inc. (T), the biggest U.S.
provider of phone service, and Altria Group Inc. (MO), the country&#8217;s
largest cigarette producer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unnamed manager, who wrote that his funds have owned
Microsoft since 2006 and had more than 11 million shares at the
time of the letter, called on the board to pay out all the cash
generated in the U.S. and available to investors as dividends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were three more recommendations made in the letter:
selling $40 billion of debt, buying back shares with funds from
the bond sale, and borrowing against cash generated outside the
U.S. for additional stock repurchases. The investor estimated
that Microsoft would reach the high $30s if all of them were
adopted. The stock closed yesterday at $26.63. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s Houston-based
trading unit made almost two-thirds of its $363.8 million in
profit this year from trading fuels such as gasoline, heating
oil and diesel, according to documents inadvertently sent from
the company by e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second-largest U.S. oil company had year-to-date profit
of $263.9 million from products trading in the Americas and
Atlantic region as of yesterday, compared with $99.9 million
from trading crude oil and liquefied petroleum gas, according to
an internal document about trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trading is &#8220;normal business activity within the
industry,&#8221; San Ramon, California-based Chevron said in an e-
mailed statement. The data released was meant for &#8220;internal
management reporting&#8221; and doesn&#8217;t directly translate into
publicly reported earnings, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Despite the embarrassment, competitors may still not find
this information all that useful,&#8221; said Gianna Bern, founder of
Brookshire Advisory and Research Inc. in Chicago and a former BP
Plc oil trader. &#8220;It&#8217;s more a question of controls and access to
information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;Sounds like a major blunder indeed.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron tried to recall the document, titled &#8216;&#8216;Houston
Daily Management Report,&#8217;&#8217; 6 minutes after it was distributed to
reporters from Bloomberg News, Dow Jones  Co. and Argus Media
Ltd. A third e-mail asked recipients to &#8216;&#8216;please delete the
information from the e-mail which was accidentally sent.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;Chevron is extremely disappointed that certain media
organizations chose to publish information after being alerted
it was an accidental release,&#8217;&#8217; the company said later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heavy Louisiana Sweet oil&#8217;s premium
slipped from a record high reached as Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) performs
maintenance on a pipeline segment in Louisiana that transports
the oil to refineries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The line was shut June 29 for scheduled hydrotesting,
Claire Hassett, a company spokeswoman, said in an e-mail
yesterday. The work will take place over the &#8220;next few weeks,&#8221;
she said July 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heavy Louisiana Sweet&#8217;s premium sank 75 cents to $23.50 a
barrel over WTI as of 4:09 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The grade traded at the highest premium
since at least 1991 yesterday at $24.25 a barrel greater than
the U.S. benchmark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light Louisiana Sweet&#8217;s premium rose 40 cents to $19.25 a
barrel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premiums for Mars
Blend and Poseidon added 75 cents $16.75 a barrel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Southern Green Canyon&#8217;s premium advanced $1.75 to $15.75 a
barrel, while West Texas Sour&#8217;s discount narrowed 5 cents to 75
cents. Thunder Horse&#8217;s premium was unchanged at $22.50. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premium for Syncrude was unchanged at $9.50. Syncrude
is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the tar sands
in Alberta. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce,
the country&#8217;s fifth-largest bank, agreed to buy a 41 percent
stake in American Century Investments from JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
for $848 million to expand its asset-management business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cash acquisition, the third-largest purchase by the
Toronto-based bank, will immediately add to earnings and
contribute 15 cents a share to profit in 2012, CIBC said today
in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchase may lead to further asset-management
acquisitions following a change in corporate structure in March
that placed Victor Dodig as head of the unit, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;American Century Investments is a platform for further
growth internationally,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer Gerald McCaughey told investors on a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CIBC fell 49 cents to C$74.13 at 4 p.m. in trading on the
Toronto Stock Exchange. The shares have fallen 5.4 percent this
year, the worst performer among Canada&#8217;s six biggest banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCaughey, 55, said the transaction will have &#8220;a positive
impact on our dividend increase plan,&#8221; without being more
specific. The lender is expected to boost its quarterly payout
by 3.4 percent to 90 cents a share in the fiscal third quarter,
according to Bloomberg Dividend Forecasts. The bank&#8217;s dividend
yield is 4.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth Stocks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kansas City-based American Century, founded in 1958, has
$112 billion in assets under management and was named the &#8220;Best
Large Mutual Fund Company&#8221; at the 2009 Lipper Fund Awards.
American Century&#8217;s majority shareholder is the Stowers Institute
for Medical Research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Century is known for its focus on growth stocks, or
shares in companies whose profit is expected to grow faster than
the broader market, fund industry consultant Geoff Bobroff said
in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growth-oriented American Century Ultra Fund (TWCUX) was once
considered the company&#8217;s flagship product, Bobroff said. Its
assets have fallen from $23.8 billion in 2004 to $6.5 billion as
of June 30. Ultra has returned 5.3 percent annually in the past
five years, beating 64 percent of competing funds, Bloomberg
data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;One has to puzzle over why CIBC would want a minority
stake, unless it saw the opportunity to either buy more or use
American Century as a platform for the entry of its own products
into the U.S.,&#8221; Bobroff said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s largest fund is the $9.25 billion Equity Income
fund, which has returned an annual average of 4.2 percent over
the past five years, beating 68 percent of similarly managed
funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About two-thirds of American Century&#8217;s assets under
management are weighted toward equities, CIBC said in its
presentation to investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment by CIBC is surpassed only by its purchase of
FirstCaribbean International Bank in 2006 and a MasterCard
portfolio from Citigroup Inc. last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CIBC has shed most of its U.S. businesses over the past
decade. In 2008, the lender sold part of its U.S. capital
markets businesses to New York-based Oppenheimer Holdings Inc.
It also closed an online-banking business known as Amicus in
2002. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Admittedly, we are a little surprised that CIBC is
allocating capital in the U.S.,&#8221; said John Aiken, an analyst at
Barclays Capital in Toronto, in a research note. &#8220;That said,
the acquisition is in asset management, which is far less risky
than wholesale or even retail banking.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BP Plc (BP/), Europe&#8217;s second-largest oil
company, came under pressure from analysts to follow
ConocoPhillips (COP) and spin off its refining business as the shares
struggle to recover from last year&#8217;s Gulf of Mexico spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ConocoPhillips said yesterday it will become two separate,
publically traded companies by the end of next June, lifting
shares as much as 7.7 percent, the biggest intraday gain in two
years. BP has dropped 30 percent since the blowout at the
Macondo well in April 2010 that triggered the worst U.S. spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That leaves BP trading at a 44 percent discount to the sum
of the parts of its business, compared with an average discount
of 27 percent for the world&#8217;s biggest oil companies, according
to Fred Lucas, an analyst at JPMorgan Cazenove. UBS AG and Bank
of America-Merrill Lynch also argued today that a refining
spinoff would unlock value in London-based BP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We first proposed that BP pursue an upstream-downstream
split back in 2006,&#8221; Lucas wrote in an e-mailed note. &#8220;The
pressure, both peer-group and shareholder-related, to revisit
this idea might have just increased several atmospheres.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Chief Executive Officer Robert Dudley has sold $25
billion in assets since the spill and plans to dispose of half
the company&#8217;s U.S. refining capacity to shore up the company&#8217;s
balance sheet. Dudley has signed exploration deals with India
and pursued an accord with OAO Rosneft in Russia that was
blocked by BP&#8217;s billionaire partners in the TNK-BP venture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP has no plans to spin off its refining business, company
spokesman Robert Wine said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marathon Oil &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conoco&#8217;s move yesterday followed Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO)&#8217;s
decision. Through yesterday&#8217;s closing price, Marathon&#8217;s spinoff
of its refinery network, completed June 30, has yielded
shareholders a 110 percent bonanza since it was announced in
January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If any company were to mirror this transaction, it might
be BP,&#8221; said Jon Rigby an analyst at UBS. &#8220;BP has
traditionally been strategically bold and it&#8217;s on a large net
asset value discount. The exploration and production and
refining and marketing businesses would be very material
companies in their own right and have critical mass, know-how
and brand.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OMV AG (OMV), Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) and Total SA (FP) are also well-
placed for spinoffs, BofA-Merrill Lynch analyst Alejandro Demichelis wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The first move could come from BP as its underperformance
and its wider discount to net asset value could force management
to act on this front,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apollo Global Management LLC&#8217;s
Trilegiant unit was sued by an Arizona man over claims it
conspired to defraud consumers with charges for product loyalty
services and membership clubs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juan M. Restrepo said in a complaint in federal court in
Tucson, Arizona, that he was unaware that Trilegiant charged
$10.99 to his Chase MasterCard account each month from May 2007
through to May 2011. Restrepo noticed the monthly charges in
April and claims he never authorized the charges, according to
the complaint filed July 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The charges were virtually unnoticeable because it was
embedded in all other ordinary charges that normally escape
close scrutiny of the ordinary consumer,&#8221; according to the
complaint, which seeks to represent other customers in a class
action, or group lawsuit. Chase Bank USA is also a defendant in
the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies are accused in the lawsuit of racketeering,
violating electronic communications privacy laws, violating
unfair trade laws and unjustly enriching themselves. Restrepo is
seeking a court order barring the companies from continuing the
alleged scheme plus unspecified damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike Bush, a spokesman for Trilegiant, didn&#8217;t immediately
return a call seeking comment after regular business hours
yesterday. Trilegiant is based in Norwalk, Connecticut,
according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom Kelly, a spokesman for JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), declined

&lt;p&gt;A year after President Barack Obama
signed into law the most extensive financial regulations since
the Great Depression, Wall Street so far is putting its
political money elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees of Goldman Sachs Group gave Republican
presidential candidate Mitt Romney $238,250 in the last three
months, more than workers at any other company, according to a
computer-assisted analysis of Federal Election Commission data.
Obama took in $10,113. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four years ago, employees of New York-based Goldman gave
$994,795 to Obama and $234,275 to Romney, according to the
Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based research
group. For both candidates, it was more than any other company&#8217;s
employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, Romney took in $2.1 million from donors
reporting a New York state address, where the financial industry
is headquartered, FEC data shows. Obama raised $1.3 million
during the same period. For the 2008 election, Obama raised
$50.5 million in the state; Romney raised $2.8 million,
according to the center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romney and Obama were among the candidates offering the
first looks at their presidential fundraising. Their FEC reports
cover donations through June 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dodd-Frank Birthday &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year ago this month, Obama signed into law new rules for
a financial industry, which is blamed for contributing to the
worst economic downturn since the 1930s. The measure was passed
over the objection of most congressional Republicans, and Romney
has criticized the law. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When investment bankers fled Silicon
Valley after the dot-com bust in 2000, Morgan Stanley (MS)&#8217;s Michael Grimes and his team stayed put on Menlo Park&#8217;s Sand Hill Road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&#8217;re now listed as the first underwriter on all the
hottest Web deals, including the initial public offerings of
LinkedIn Corp., Pandora Media Inc., Groupon Inc. and Zynga Inc.
Morgan Stanley is even in the running for the lead role in
Facebook Inc.&#8217;s IPO, which looked like it was a shoo-in for its
top rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) only a few months ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grimes, global co-head of Morgan Stanley&#8217;s technology
investment banking, meets regularly with investors in search of
the next Google Inc. (GOOG) or Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and has close ties to
venture capitalists at Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins Caufield
 Byers and Greylock Partners. He&#8217;s also an early consumer of
his clients&#8217; products, whether that means widening his circle of
contacts on LinkedIn&#8217;s network or spending hours building a
digital metropolis in Zynga&#8217;s &#8220;CityVille&#8221; game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He quickly and astutely connects with companies and teams
at that level because of his experience with the product, not
just at a transactional level as an investment banker,&#8221; said
David Sze, a partner at Menlo Park, California-based Greylock
and a board member at LinkedIn and Pandora. &#8220;Companies sense
that. They smell the authenticity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China Petrochemical Corp. agreed
with Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) to jointly assess shale-gas potential in
the southwestern province of Sichuan as the world&#8217;s fastest-
growing major economy seeks unconventional sources of energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sinopec Group, a unit of China Petrochemical, and Exxon&#8217;s
Sichuan subsidiary signed an agreement to survey the 3,643.59
square-kilometer (1,407 square-mile) Wuzhishan area, the Chinese
company said in its in-house newsletter today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China, estimated to hold more gas trapped in shale than the
U.S., will open new areas to exploration as PetroChina Co.&#8217;s
parent and Sinopec Group seek drilling technology through
partnerships and acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China National Petroleum Corp., PetroChina&#8217;s parent, agreed
in June to form a venture with Royal Dutch Shell Plc to improve
its drilling efficiency after taking 11 months to complete the
country&#8217;s first shale well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sinopec Group is &#8220;actively&#8221; seeking technology and
capital from its potential foreign partners to develop domestic
shale-gas resources, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government aims to sign contracts with Chinese
explorers this month to develop two blocks offered in the
country&#8217;s first auction, and a second sale is planned later this
year, Zhang Dawei, deputy director of oil and gas strategy
research at the Ministry of Land and Resources, said on July 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recoverable Reserves &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese shale may hold 1,275 trillion cubic feet of gas, or
12 times the country&#8217;s conventional natural gas deposits, the
U.S. Energy Information Administration said in April. China&#8217;s
&#8220;technically recoverable&#8221; reserves are almost 50 percent more
than the 862 trillion cubic feet held by the U.S., the EIA said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two countries account for 32 percent of the world&#8217;s
recoverable shale reserves of 6,622 trillion cubic feet,
according to EIA data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overseas explorers, barred from bidding in Chinese auctions
of shale areas, are in discussions to forge local ventures.
Chevron Corp. and BP Plc are in talks with China Petrochemical
and its unit China Petroleum  Chemical Corp. (600028) Norway&#8217;s Statoil
ASA is in negotiations to buy stakes in shale-gas assets in
China. Shell is currently exploring the Jinqiu block in
southwestern Sichuan province with CNPC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) sold $2 billion of five-year notes at a lower interest
rate than it got in December after reporting second-quarter
sales that beat analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider issued $2
billion of 1.95 percent notes that yield 65 basis points more
than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. IBM last raised five-year debt in December with $1
billion of 2 percent notes that paid a 55 basis-point spread,
Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher-than-estimated results at companies led by Armonk,
New York-based IBM helped bolster investor confidence in U.S.
corporate debt by the most this month. It said yesterday that
second-quarter sales were $26.7 billion, topping the $25.4
billion average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;IBM is showing that it has been a very positive quarter
for them,&#8221; said Jody Lurie, a corporate credit analyst at
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia. Today&#8217;s issuance
shows the company &#8220;taking advantage of a cheap rate,&#8221; she
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, dropped 2.9 basis points to a
mid-price of 96.1 basis points as of 4:59 p.m. in New York,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd. That&#8217;s the
biggest decline since June 30. The credit swaps index typically
falls when investor confidence improves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Taking Advantage&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proceeds may be used for general corporate purposes, IBM
said today in a regulatory filing. The company has $21.7 billion
in long-term debt and $8.5 billion of short-term debt as of
March 31, according to the filing. It&#8217;s raised $11.5 billion of
bonds in the past two years, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The company could be taking advantage of the market
conditions to refinance short-term debt to extend maturities and
management may want to add to its robust liquidity level to
provide additional cushion for shareholder rewards, buybacks,
dividends, while implementing its strategic growth
initiatives,&#8221; Lurie said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM plans to spend about $20 billion on dividends and $50
billion buying back stock through 2015, IBM said at an investor
meeting in March. Its quarterly payout will rise 15 percent to
75 cents a share, the company said in an April 26 statement. IBM
added $8 billion to its stock-repurchase plan, bringing the
total authorized by the board to $12.7 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re a company that people like to have, they are very
global,&#8221; Lurie said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debt Rankings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is graded Aa3 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and
a step lower at A+ by Standard  Poor&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors have shied away from longer-term bonds as the
combination of sovereign debt crises and U.S. Federal Reserve
actions to bolster the economy increase the likelihood of faster
inflation. The gap in relative yields on U.S. corporate debt due
in one to three years against that due in seven to 10 years
reached 74 basis points last month, the widest since 2001,
before narrowing to 73 basis points yesterday, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on the benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond may
rise to 4.8 percent by mid 2012 from about 4.3 percent
currently, according to the median estimate of 49 economists and
strategists surveyed by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Not many investors feel confident in jumping in on the
long end,&#8221; said Rajeev Sharma, a money manager in New York at
First Investors Management Co., where he helps oversee $1.5
billion of investment-grade debt. &#8220;Rates are still expected to
go up.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

York, rebounding from a three-week low. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average advanced 202.26 points, or 1.6 percent, to 12,587.42.
Nasdaq-100 Index futures contracts expiring in September climbed
0.7 percent to 2,405.25 at 5:07 p.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a combination of the good corporate earnings and the
market is looking for a relief rally from debt-ceiling and
deficit negotiations,&#8221; said Eric Teal, chief investment officer
at First Citizens Bancshares Inc. in Raleigh, North Carolina,
which manages $4 billion. &#8220;Obama&#8217;s support reduces the risk
there&#8217;s no deal by Aug. 2. It shows both sides are working hard
to get a deal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debt Worries &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 declined 4.3 percent through yesterday from a
three-year high in April amid speculation that the sovereign
debt crisis in Europe is spreading across the region and concern
that U.S. lawmakers will fail to reach a deal on raising the
nation&#8217;s debt limit before the Aug. 2 deadline. The drop has
left the gauge trading at 15 times reported earnings, the
cheapest this month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 has still rallied 96 percent since March 2009
as the Federal Reserve maintained a policy of record-low
interest rates and emergency stimulus to spur growth in the
world&#8217;s largest economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks extended gains as Obama embraced a $3.7
trillion debt-cutting plan by a bipartisan group of senators
that would combine tax increases and spending cuts, saying it
could end a congressional deadlock over raising the U.S.
borrowing limit. The news spurred optimism that lawmakers will
reach an agreement that will help the nation avoid default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is &#8220;a very significant step,&#8221; Obama said in
remarks at the White House. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings Season &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Positive earnings reports pushed shares higher earlier.
Among the 41 companies in the SP 500 that posted results since
July 11, 35 beat the average analyst estimate for per-share
profit, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nasdaq futures rallied after Apple reported profit in the
third-quarter was $7.79 a share, exceeding the $5.87 predicted
by analysts on average, as the Cupertino, California-based
company had record sales of iPhones and iPad tablets. The shares
rose 5.7 percent to $398.21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo! Inc., the most-visited U.S. Web portal, reported
after the U.S. market closed that sales fell short of estimates
as marketers shunned its pages in favor of rival sites. The
shares slipped 1.6 percent to $14.36. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, the biggest computer-services company, climbed 5.7
percent to a record $185.21, for the largest advance in the Dow
during regular trading. The Armonk, New York-based company
reported sales that beat analysts&#8217; estimates and lifted its
profit forecast amid buoyant demand for software. Second-quarter
revenue rose 12 percent to $26.7 billion. That topped $25.4
billion, the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology Rally &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology stocks were the best performers among 10 groups
in the SP 500, rising 2.7 percent, the most since July 2010,
following IBM&#8217;s better-than-estimated earnings. Microsoft Corp.
jumped 3.6 percent to $27.54, Intel Corp. climbed 3.5 percent to
$23.06, Oracle Corp. (ORCL) increased 3.7 percent to $32.64 and
Broadcom Corp. gained 6.2 percent to $34.68. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola rose 3.3 percent to $69.32. The world&#8217;s largest
soft-drink maker posted second-quarter earnings and sales that
exceeded the average analyst estimate, helped by sales in Latin
America and Asia. The company also said it plans to buy back at
least $2.5 billion worth of shares by the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman, Bank of America &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) slumped 0.7 percent to $128.49
after earlier falling as much as 3 percent. The fifth-biggest
U.S. bank by assets reported second-quarter profit that fell
short of analysts&#8217; estimates as fixed-income trading revenue
plunged 63 percent from the previous quarter. Net income was
$1.85 a share, compared with the $2.30 per share average
estimate of analysts in a survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America declined 1.5 percent to $9.57, the worst
performing stock in the Dow. The bank reported a quarterly loss
of $8.83 billion, the biggest in its history, as it booked more
costs tied to defective mortgages and revenue continued to
slide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homebuilders advanced after housing starts in the U.S. rose
more than forecast in June to the highest level in five months,
led by a surge in multifamily dwellings. D.R. Horton Inc.
climbed 5.7 percent to $11.93. Lennar Corp. (LEN) gained 6.6 percent
to $18.52. PulteGroup Inc. rose 3.5 percent to $7.18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Housing Starts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work began on 629,000 houses at an annual pace, up 15
percent from the prior month, figures from the Commerce
Department showed. The level of starts exceeded the most
optimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of economists.
Building permits, a sign of future construction, unexpectedly
climbed 2.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harley-Davidson Inc. (HOG) rallied 8.9 percent to $45.11, the
biggest gain in the SP 500. The largest U.S. motorcycle maker
reported a 37 percent increase in profit, beating analyst
estimates, as it boosted home market sales for the first time in
almost five years and said it will ship more bikes than
previously planned.                          &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News Corp. (NWSA) rose 5.5 percent to $15.79. Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Rupert Murdoch told U.K. lawmakers that he
wasn&#8217;t responsible for the phone-hacking scandal at New Corp.&#8217;s
News of the World newspaper, saying that the blame lies with the
&#8220;people that I trusted to run it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is considering elevating Chief Operating
Officer Chase Carey to chief executive officer to succeed
Murdoch, said people with knowledge of the situation. A decision
hasn&#8217;t been made, said the people, who weren&#8217;t authorized to
speak publicly. News Corp. shares dropped 17 percent from July 5
through yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mosaic Co. (MOS) gained 3.1 percent to $68.49. North America&#8217;s
second-largest fertilizer producer posted earnings and sales
that exceeded the average analyst projection. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors looking to trade options
on companies about to report quarterly results should consider
shares priced above $100, such as Netflix Inc. (NFLX) and Priceline.com
Inc. (PCLN), because the contracts tend to be underpriced, Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strangles, or purchasing calls and puts to bet on more
volatility, produced 8.4 percent returns before transaction
costs during the past 15 years for the high-priced stocks,
Goldman strategists led by John Marshall said in a report today.
That compares with 1.5 percent gains for a broader group of
equities, the note said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;High-dollar options appear to have been systematically
underpriced,&#8221; the strategists wrote. &#8220;Buying strangles on
companies with share prices over $100 ahead of earnings saw
positive returns in 11 of 15 years and five of the past eight
quarters.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs strategists studied the performance of
stocks and options following about 30,000 quarterly reports.
Transaction costs are also lower, with bid-ask spreads 25
percent tighter on high-priced options compared with the average
for all equities, they said. There are 44 companies in the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index with share prices at $100 or more,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based strategists recommended using a strategy
similar to a strangle, known as a straddle, on some companies
reporting this earnings season. A straddle buyer purchases a
call and put with the same strike price and expiration date,
while strangle buying involves purchasing a call option with a
strike price higher than the current stock price and a put with
a strike that is lower. Both strategies profit as volatility
increases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategists specifically recommended buying Chipotle
Mexican Grill Inc. (CMG) August $330 straddles, Priceline.com Inc.
August $515 straddles, Polo Ralph Lauren Corp. (RL) August $135
straddles and EOG Resources Inc. (EOG) August $100 straddles. On July
14, they had suggested purchasing Netflix Inc. August $300
straddles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world&#8217;s largest
soft-drink maker, said second-quarter profit rose 18 percent as
sales in Latin America and Asia gained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income advanced to $2.8 billion, or $1.20 a share, from
$2.37 billion, or $1.02, a year earlier, the Atlanta-based
company said today in a statement. Excluding some items, profit
was $1.17 a share, topping the $1.16 average of 14 analysts&#8217;
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent has built new plants in
emerging markets and pushed more profitable package sizes
overseas to help offset limited U.S. pricing gains this year.
Second-quarter net operating revenue climbed 13 percent in Latin
America and 15 percent in Coke&#8217;s Eurasia and Africa division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The surprise is not that international markets grew but
the rate at which they grew,&#8221; Philip Gorham, a senior equity
analyst for Morningstar Inc. in Chicago, said today in an
interview. &#8220;Coke is investing in distribution in emerging
markets and gaining points of sale.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola rose $2.20, or 3.3 percent, to $69.32 at 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
gained 5.4 percent this year, while PepsiCo Inc. increased 4.9
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total sales rose 47 percent to $12.7 billion, helped by
last year&#8217;s acquisition of the company&#8217;s largest distributor.
The average estimate of 11 analysts was $12.4 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volume sales in China grew 21 percent. The company is
attempting to boost profit there by introducing smaller packages
that fetch more revenue per ounce and are more affordable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;More Choice&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The consumer is telling us they want more choice,&#8221; Kent
said today in an interview. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been implementing this
successfully in Latin America and in parts of Eurasia but not
everywhere.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Japan earthquake and tsunami will cut full-year
earnings per share by as much as 5 cents, more than the 2 cents
to 4 cents forecast last quarter, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola boosted sales volume in North America by 4
percent, helped by new distribution of Dr. Pepper brands
acquired in Coca-Cola&#8217;s purchase of its largest bottler last
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said it will increase drink pricing in its
North American market by 3 percent to 4 percent in the second
half of the year after boosting it by 1 percent to 2 percent in
the quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola repeated a forecast that commodity costs for the
year may rise by as much as $700 million. The increase is fueled
by the higher cost of oil-based plastics used in bottles, as
well as rising costs for metals, sweeteners and fruit for juice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PepsiCo said in April it planned to raise prices on food
and beverages to help make up for higher costs for corn,
packaging plastic and other commodities. PepsiCo, which gets
about two-thirds of sales come from snacks, has said total
commodity costs may increase $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion this
year, from a base of $18 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is dropping out of
the bidding for Hulu LLC, the online video service put up for
sale by its media-company owners, according to a person with
knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, told Hulu
executives last week it wouldn&#8217;t continue into a second round,
said the person, who wasn&#8217;t authorized to talk publicly. The
person didn&#8217;t rule out Microsoft re-entering later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hulu bankers at Morgan Stanley (MS) and Guggenheim Partners met
in the past four weeks with Microsoft, which already rents and
sells films and TV shows through its Xbox video-game console, to
solicit an offer, people with knowledge of the situation said on
July 1. The bankers also met with Google Inc. (GOOG), Yahoo Inc., ATT
Inc. (T) and as many as eight other companies, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elisa Schreiber, a spokeswoman for Los Angeles-based Hulu,
declined to comment, as did Frank Shaw, a spokesman for
Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo would pay up to $2 billion for Hulu with four or five
years of exclusive access to current TV shows and older movies,
the Business Insider website reported, citing a person it didn&#8217;t
identify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hulu plans to offer suitors five years of access to shows
from its media-company owners, Walt Disney Co. (DIS), News Corp. (NWSA) and
Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)&#8217;s NBC Universal, including two years of
exclusivity, two people with knowledge of the situation said
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details of the rights, similar to terms Hulu&#8217;s owners
considered for an earlier share sale, and other financial data
will be provided to bidders who sign a non-disclosure agreement,
two people said. Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), based in Seattle, is unlikely
to bid without guarantees of access to shows, one person said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) has about
$1.5 billion to $2 billion in net risk to the five most troubled
nations in Europe, Chief Financial Officer David A. Viniar said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;On a net basis, our exposure is actually pretty modest&#8221;
to the five countries: Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and
Spain, Viniar said in response to an analyst&#8217;s question on a
conference call today. &#8220;Our gross exposure is not very big
either,&#8221; he added, without providing any figures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerns about European countries&#8217; creditworthiness have
accelerated in recent weeks, provoking questions about banks&#8217;
related risks. The cost of borrowing in Italy and Spain has
surged, with the Italian 10-year note yield jumping to 5.72
percent from 4.88 percent on June 30. Moody&#8217;s Investors Service
cut the ratings on Greek, Irish and Portuguese debt to junk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-biggest U.S. bank, said
last week that it had $15 billion of net risk in those
countries, which accounts for offsetting hedges and collateral.
Citigroup Inc. (C), the third-biggest bank, said it has at least $22
billion in loans, trading assets and other &#8220;exposure&#8221; to the
five countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) has about $3.2 billion at risk in the
five nations, Chief Financial Officer Timothy J. Sloan said on
the company&#8217;s second-quarter earnings call today. Most of that
is corporate debt rather than bonds issued by the countries
themselves, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s
largest company, is seeking partners to help develop a natural-
gas project in Indonesia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon is offering a 50 percent stake in its Kalimantan
coalbed-methane project, located in three exploration blocks,
the Irving, Texas-based company said in an announcement posted
today on Schlumberger Ltd.&#8217;s IndigoPool website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon said initial drilling on the blocks showed
&#8220;encouraging&#8221; results. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the U.S.
bank that makes most of its money from trading, reported second-
quarter profit that fell short of analysts&#8217; estimates as fixed-
income revenue plunged 63 percent from the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income climbed 77 percent to $1.09 billion, or $1.85
per share, from $613 million, or 78 cents, in the same period a
year earlier, the New York-based company said today in a
statement. That compares with the $2.30 per-share average
estimate of 23 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Earnings fell 38
percent if one-time costs are excluded from the 2010 results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fixed-income trading-revenue drop was more than twice
as large as at any other major U.S. bank. Overall trading
revenue at Goldman Sachs, led by Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, fell 47 percent from the first
quarter. JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s investment bank reported a
smaller-than-expected 17 percent decline in trading revenue last
week, while the same business at Citigroup Inc. (C) fell 21 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All the news is going to be about Goldman Sachs today
because people brought their numbers down and they still missed
those numbers,&#8221; Paul Miller, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets,
said in an interview on Bloomberg television. &#8220;The question is
going to be why were their revenues down much greater than their
competitors? Probably they were positioned differently.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

Moore" date="Jul 19, 2011  8:24 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-19/goldman-sachs-s-pay-pool-shrinks-9-to-8-44-billion-as-revenue-declines.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Pay Pool Shrinks 9% to $8.44 Billion as Revenue Declines</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) set aside
$8.44 billion for its compensation pool in the first six months
of 2011, 9 percent less than in the same period a year earlier
as revenue tumbled 11 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expense, which includes salaries, bonuses and benefits,
was enough to provide each of the firm&#8217;s 35,500 employees with
$237,662 for the six-month period, according to figures posted
today on the New York-based company&#8217;s website. A year earlier,
the firm set aside $9.3 billion for compensation, excluding a
$600 million one-time U.K. tax on bonuses, or $272,581 for each
of the 34,100 staff at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd C. Blankfein, 56, is among Wall Street firms seeking ways
to curb costs as revenue from trading equities and fixed-income
products drops for the second consecutive year. JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) reported last week that the compensation expense at its
investment bank was unchanged for the first half of the year
even though it employed 5 percent more workers and generated 6
percent more revenue than a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;ve continued to streamline some of their costs,&#8221;
said Douglas G. Ciocca, managing director at Kavar Capital
Partners LLC in Leawood, Kansas, which manages about $225
million in assets, including Goldman Sachs shares. He spoke
before the earnings were released. Still &#8220;you&#8217;ve got to make
sure you retain the top people.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s pay expense represented 44 percent of
revenue in the six-month period compared with 43 percent a year
earlier. The same ratio at JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bank was 38
percent in the first six months of 2011, down from 40 percent a
year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average compensation figures are derived by dividing the
overall compensation pool by the number of employees and don&#8217;t
represent individual workers&#8217; actual pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Simeon Bennett" date="Jul 19, 2011  5:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-19/glaxo-pfizer-aids-pill-may-dislodge-bristol-s-study-suggests.html"><headline>Glaxo-Pfizer AIDS Pill May Dislodge Bristol&#8217;s, Study Suggests</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;A drug developed by GlaxoSmithKline
Plc (GSK) and Pfizer Inc. (PFE) controlled HIV faster and more safely than
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY)&#8217;s Sustiva in a study, suggesting the
experimental medicine may one day be preferred to Bristol&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dolutegravir, a product of Glaxo and Pfizer&#8217;s ViiV
Healthcare joint venture, reduced HIV to undetectable levels in
90 percent of patients after 48 weeks, compared with 82 percent
of those who got Sustiva, according to results presented at an
AIDS meeting in Rome today. Dolutegravir also caused a
significantly lower rise in bad cholesterol than Sustiva, at
one-twelfth of the dose size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sustiva is one of three drugs in Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD)&#8217;s
Atripla, the world&#8217;s best-selling AIDS pill, and brought New
York-based Bristol $1.4 billion in sales last year. Today&#8217;s
results could signal that dolutegravir may supplant Sustiva,
also known as efavirenz, as a preferred treatment in first-line
therapy, Michael Saag, director of the Center for AIDS Research
at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It does raise the possibility of one day replacing
efavirenz as the most preferred agent,&#8221; Saag said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;impressive&#8221; results don&#8217;t mean dolutegravir has
proven it&#8217;s superior to Sustiva yet, though that may be shown in
a larger study, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sustiva is recognized by the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services as a component of preferred combination HIV
therapy regimens for patients who are new to treatment, said
Cristi Barnett, a Bristol-Myers spokeswoman, in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sustiva&#8217;s Data &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While it would be premature for me to speculate on any
future treatment guideline changes, Sustiva, as part of
combination HIV therapy, has accumulated extensive clinical
trial data and clinical experience for more than 12 years,&#8221;
Barnett said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers, led by Jan van Lunzen at the University
Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf in Germany, tested dolutegravir
in 205 HIV patients who hadn&#8217;t received treatment before. They
received one of three doses of either ViiV&#8217;s drug or Sustiva
once a day for 48 weeks. The doctors involved in the trial could
choose whether to combine the treatments either with Gilead&#8217;s
Truvada or ViiV&#8217;s Epzicom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dolutegravir reduced HIV to undetectable levels in 92
percent of patients after 16 weeks, compared with 58 percent for
a 600-milligram dose of Sustiva. By 48 weeks, 90 percent of
those on dolutegravir had undetectable virus, compared with 82
percent of those on Sustiva. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad Cholesterol &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients on dolutegravir, previously known as S/GSK1349572,
also got a bigger boost in their CD4 cells -- the immune-system
cells HIV infects and kills -- than those on Sustiva, and had a
fraction of the rise in bad cholesterol. Some HIV medicines have
been linked to an increase in cholesterol, which can lead to
heart attacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dolutegravir is in a class of AIDS drugs called integrase
inhibitors that work by blocking HIV&#8217;s ability to replicate.
Data presented at an AIDS meeting in Vienna last year showed
dolutegravir was also better at controlling HIV than Merck 
Co.&#8217;s Isentress, the only approved integrase inhibitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s delivering on everything that we&#8217;ve asked for it,&#8221;
said Garrett Nichols, Glaxo&#8217;s project leader for dolutegravir,
in an interview. Dolutegravir &#8220;holds the best promise for long-
term treatment success.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ViiV is now testing dolutegravir in the third and final
stage of patient studies usually required for regulatory
approval in the U.S. The drug was developed jointly with Osaka,
Japan-based Shionogi  Co. It&#8217;s also testing the drug with two-
drug combination Epzicom as a three-in-one pill against Atripla. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glaxo owns 85 percent of ViiV and Pfizer owns 15 percent.
The two companies split the profits accordingly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Studies &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate study, ViiV&#8217;s experimental drug lersivirine
showed similar efficacy to Sustiva in controlling HIV, with
fewer abnormal dreams and dizziness, but with more nausea and
headache side effects. The company is now completing the second
stage of human trials to get a better understanding of the drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For a new drug to be competitive and offer an advantage
over existing therapies it has to have at least equivalent
antiviral activity and be better tolerated, or at least as
tolerable,&#8221; Saag said. &#8220;The frequency of nausea in the phase
II is key to determining if it should be taken further.&#8221; Saag
has been a consultant for ViiV and is also a consultant for
Bristol and Gilead, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third trial tested an older ViiV pill, Selzentry, against
Gilead&#8217;s two-drug combination Truvada, when both were added to
Bristol&#8217;s Reyataz and Abbott Laboratories&#8217;s Norvir. Over 48
weeks, Selzentry lowered HIV to undetectable levels in 75
percent of patients, compared with 84 percent of those on
Truvada. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerging-market stocks rose, paced
by raw material producers and technology shares, after commodity
prices climbed and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) lifted
its profit forecast, fueling speculation earnings will withstand
the European and U.S. debt crises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Emerging Markets Index added 0.4 percent to
1,126.63 at 3:58 p.m. in Manila. The gauge dropped 1.2 percent
yesterday. India&#8217;s Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index climbed
0.8 percent, while Russia&#8217;s Micex index increased 0.5 percent.
China&#8217;s Shanghai Composite Index declined 0.7 percent, the
steepest loss in a week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services company, lifted
its full-year earnings forecasts after posting second-quarter
sales that beat analyst estimates. Catcher Technology Co. jumped
by the daily limit in Taipei after three brokerages raised their
share-price forecasts, while Realtek Semiconductor Corp. (2379) rallied
as Morgan Stanley upgraded the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Debt concerns in the U.S. and Europe are casting shadows
of doubt over the global recovery,&#8221; said Jonathan Ravelas, who
helps manage about $1.5 billion at Manila-based Banco de Oro
Unibank Inc. &#8220;Investors are looking for pockets of growth
amidst this growing uncertainty so there&#8217;s renewed interest in
sectors that will deliver earnings.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has lost 2.2 percent this
year, trailing a 1.8 percent gain in the MSCI World Index of
developed markets. Stocks in the index for developing equities
are valued at 10.8 times estimated profit, less than the
multiple of 12.5 times for developed countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe, U.S. Debt &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emerging-market index has retreated 6.7 percent since
May 2, when it reached the highest in almost three years,
dragged down by concern that Europe&#8217;s debt crisis will spread
and monetary tightening from China to India will curtail growth.
European Union leaders are trying to convince investors a second
Greek bailout agreement will be reached in a July 21 meeting,
while U.S. lawmakers are struggling to broker a deal on raising
the nation&#8217;s debt ceiling before an Aug. 2 deadline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catcher, which makes metal casings for Apple Inc.
computers, jumped 6.9 percent after Citigroup Inc. and Macquarie
Group Ltd. both raised their share-price estimates by 22
percent. Realtek Semiconductor increased 6.9 percent, the
sharpest gain since Sept. 3, after the chip designer was raised
to &#8220;equal-weight&#8221; from &#8220;underweight&#8221; at Morgan Stanley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM said second-quarter revenue rose 12 percent to $26.7
billion, topping a $25.4 billion average estimate of analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. The company raised its full-year earnings
forecast to at least $13.25 a share, compared with analysts&#8217;
average estimate of $13.21. Apple Inc. and Intel Corp. are among
other U.S. technology companies set to release results this
week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tata Consultancy, Samsung &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS), an Indian software company,
added 1.8 percent in Mumbai and Samsung Electronics Co., Asia&#8217;s
largest chipmaker, rose 1.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Korea Zinc Co. jumped 4 percent in Seoul, while Jiangxi
Copper Co. increased 0.9 percent in Hong Kong. Gold rallied for
a 12th day to a record high, copper gained for a third day in
London, while oil rose 0.8 percent in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Merchants Bank Co., the nation&#8217;s sixth-biggest
lender, lost 1.4 percent to the lowest close since June 20 amid
plans to raise as much as 35 billion yuan ($5.4 billion) in a
rights offer. The bank will offer 2.2 shares for every 10
existing shares held by investors at a price that will be set
later, it said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAIC Motor Corp., China&#8217;s biggest automaker, slid 2 percent
to the lowest level since June 22 in Shanghai after Sinolink
Securities Co. said more local governments may introduce
measures to limit car purchases. FAW Car Co., Volkswagen AG&#8217;s
partner for passenger cars in China, slumped 2.5 percent in
Shanghai. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s bid to ship
hundreds of tons of equipment to an oil-sands project in Alberta
hit another roadblock after a Montana judge said the company
can&#8217;t use a scenic highway through the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO), Exxon&#8217;s Canadian subsidiary, can&#8217;t use
its preferred route along highway 12 through the sparsely
populated state, spokesman Pius Rohleiser said yesterday in a
phone interview. The ruling doesn&#8217;t affect a permit to use an
alternative route, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shipment has been held up since April, when opposition
groups filed petitions with officials in Idaho and Montana.
Imperial Oil purchased about 200 equipment modules to be used in
the construction of a new bitumen mining and refinery plant at
its Kearl oil-sands project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re disappointed,&#8221; said Rohlheiser. &#8220;It&#8217;s a lengthy
ruling, and we&#8217;re going to study it before talking about the
next steps.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon and Imperial have permission to use the portion of
Highway 12 in Idaho, as well as permits to use an alternate
route on Interstate 90 and highway 95 through Idaho and into
British Columbia, avoiding Montana, said Rohleiser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trailer-load of pipes and boiler parts is parked at the
Lolo Pass hot springs on the Idaho-Montana border and watched
around the clock by two security guards. The shipment was halted
in April by authorities in both states after it clipped a wire
holding up an electrical tower, causing a local power outage for
several hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lolo Pass &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hold-up at Lolo Pass is forcing the company to consider
other routes, including the Canadian ports of Vancouver and
Prince Rupert, to bring the remaining modules from Korea. The
delays will cost the company tens of millions of dollars, said
Rohlheiser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With oil prices hovering near $100 a barrel, investment in
Canada&#8217;s oil sands is approaching $20 billion this year,
according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.
That growth made it difficult for Exxon to find local suppliers
near Edmonton when it tendered an offer for the equipment in
2008, said Rohlheiser. Sourcing the equipment from Asia was the
best alternative, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the equipment arrived at the Port of Lewiston, Idaho,
Exxon has fought opponents in its bid to use Highway 12, which
winds through the Bitterroot Mountains and follows the 1806
Lewis and Clark Trail. Opponents have highlighted the risks to
the scenic character of the route. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Narrow Strip&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Exxon did not understand that Highway 12 in Idaho is more
than simply a narrow strip of pavement,&#8221; said Linwood Laughy,
who lives in the Clearwater Valley along the proposed route, in
a telephone interview. &#8220;Many people care deeply about this
special place.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allowing more transportation of heavy equipment would ruin
the natural beauty of the region, Laughy said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opposition to Exxon&#8217;s plan includes local landowners and
residents as well as Idaho Rivers United, Friends of the
Clearwater and the Natural Resources Defense Council. The groups
filed a legal challenge in Montana and Idaho for temporary
restraining orders to stop the shipments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company on June 27 won a recommendation by an Idaho
Department of Transportation official to use that state&#8217;s
portion of Highway 12 leading to the border with Montana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first 33 modules, each of which is as tall as 30 feet
(9 meters) and 100 feet long, arrived from Korea at the port of
Vancouver, Washington, in October. From there, they were floated
up the Columbia and Snake Rivers to begin the final leg of their
journey along Highway 12 through Idaho and Montana to Alberta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The equipment is being dismantled and reduced in size to
make it easier to transport, Rohlheiser said. A test shipment
using the alternative route has already been transported along
Interstate 90 and Highway 95 to Alberta, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. energy company, paid $1.1 million for improperly claiming
royalty deductions on some U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil leases, the
Interior Department said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron repeatedly claimed transportation deductions even
though the department said the San Ramon, California-based
company isn&#8217;t eligible, the Interior Department said today in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron paid the fine July 14, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Democratic Republic of Congo is
in talks with Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) and Chevron Corp. (CVX) about
investing in the country&#8217;s budding hydrocarbons industry, Oil
Minister Celestin Mbuyu said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Central African nation wants to improve its oil and gas
output and infrastructure and is allocating blocks to companies
for exploration. San Ramon, California-based Chevron and Congo
are discussing gas production and treatment plans that may feed
into the company&#8217;s projects in neighboring Angola. Cohydro,
Congo&#8217;s state-owned oil producer, is seeking a cooperation deal
with Petrobras after signing a similar agreement on July 7 with
Korea National Oil Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petrobras officials will visit Congo in the coming weeks
&#8220;and then we&#8217;ll put together a proposal that I will present to
the government,&#8221; Mbuyu said in an interview in Kinshasa, the
capital, on July 15. A deal will likely include training and
transfer of expertise between the Rio de Janeiro-based company
and Cohydro, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congo currently produces about 25,000 barrels of oil per
day and plans to increase output through drilling near its
eastern borders with Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda, as
well as in its central basin and along the western coast
bordering Angola. The country is courting investment for
exploration, pipelines, distribution and storage, and data
gathering to help develop the industry, Mbuyu said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tropical Forest &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minister led a delegation of Congolese officials to
Brazil last month, where Petrobras shared its experience with
oil and gas operations &#8220;in tropical forest and coastal areas,&#8221;
the company&#8217;s press management office said yesterday in an e-
mailed response to questions. Congo is home to the world&#8217;s
second-largest tropical forest, after Brazil&#8217;s, some of which
has been divided up into oil blocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petrobras declined to comment on any ongoing discussions
with Congo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the second-largest U.S. energy company, signed an
agreement with Congo in November that will allow the company to
ship gas from Angola&#8217;s enclave of Cabinda to a new $9 billion
liquid-natural-gas plant in Soyo via a pipeline that cuts
through Congo&#8217;s narrow strip of Atlantic coastline. The Soyo
plant may be used to treat Congolese gas as well, and Chevron
has expressed an interest in looking at potential gas deposits
in Congo, Mbuyu said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company already has a 17.7 percent stake in a
concession off Congo&#8217;s coast that produced about 14,000 barrels
of crude per day in 2010, according to Chevron&#8217;s annual report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas Flaring &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congo is also burning gas as a by-product of its petroleum
production and Chevron has agreed to look into ways of capturing
the gas for market, Mbuyu said. Mbuyu met with Chevron officials
in May in the U.S., he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Chevron said in an e-mail today that the
company doesn&#8217;t comment &#8220;on negotiations regarding specific
business opportunities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron has delayed development of part of an offshore oil
block in Angola whose ownership is disputed by Congo, according
to the company&#8217;s annual report. Congo and Angola are still
working on an agreement over their maritime borders, Mbuyu said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A parliamentary decision on a new hydrocarbons code, which
would help regulate the industry, may be delayed by elections
scheduled for Nov. 28 of this year, Mbuyu said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TengizChevroil LLP, the Kazakh oil
venture led by Chevron Corp. (CVX), increased oil production 4 percent
in the first half from a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude output rose to 13 million metric tons, or 104 million
barrels, in the period from 12.5 million tons in the first half
of 2010, the Atyrau-based company said by e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The venture exports its oil via the Caspian Pipeline
Consortium to the Russian port of Novorossiysk on the Black Sea
and then by rail to Odessa and Feodosiya in Ukraine, as well as
to the Kazakh port of Aktau for onward shipment to Batumi and
Kulevi in Georgia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 2011, TengizChevroil plans to produce at least as much
as last year&#8217;s 25.9 million tons, or 207 million barrels, Linsi Crain, a company spokeswoman, said Feb. 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, holds 50 percent
of TengizChevroil. Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) has 25 percent, state-run
KazMunaiGaz National Co. owns 20 percent and Lukarco, owned by
Russia&#8217;s OAO Lukoil, 5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnson  Johnson and Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s
experimental Alzheimer&#8217;s treatment bapineuzumab didn&#8217;t raise new
safety concerns in study participants monitored over a longer
period of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers verified the compound&#8217;s safety and tolerability
beyond 78 weeks in people with mild to moderate Alzheimer&#8217;s
disease in an extension of a mid-stage trial. Results from an
interim analysis of the data are being presented today at the
Alzheimer&#8217;s Association International Conference in Paris. In
data released last year, bapineuzumab was linked to a side
effect similar to swelling of the brain when given at high
doses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The major finding is that there were no new safety
signals,&#8221; lead researcher Stephen Salloway, chief of neurology
and director of the Memory and Aging Program at Butler Hospital
in Providence, Rhode Island, said in an interview at the
conference. &#8220;The types of adverse events that we saw in phase
2, we saw at about roughly the same rate in the open
extension.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopes for a medicine to treat Alzheimer&#8217;s, which is the
most common form of dementia, hinge on bapineuzumab and a
similar drug being developed by Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly 
Co. (LLY) Both target beta amyloid plaque, considered by researchers a
main contributor to Alzheimer&#8217;s. At least a dozen potential
treatments designed to slow or stop amyloid plaques from forming
have failed in mid- to late-stage testing since 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Wait and See&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bapineuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed to
target beta amyloid in the brain. Monoclonal antibodies, which
have broken new ground in cancer treatment, are made in the lab
to mimic natural substances that stimulate a patient&#8217;s immune
system to attack disease-causing cells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I am going to take a wait-and-see approach&#8221; on
bapineuzumab, Marc Gordon, associate professor of neurology and
psychiatry at the North Shore LIJ School of Medicine, said in an
interview. &#8220;Just because you remove amyloid from the brain may
not necessarily correlate with an improvement in the condition.
The jury is out. We don&#8217;t have sufficient data from the phase 2
studies to draw any conclusions on efficacy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the 194 participants in the extension trial, some
received bapineuzumab for at least three years, some for at
least four years and others for five years, researchers said
today. Patients were administered bapineuzumab every 13 weeks
and there was no placebo group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic Treatment &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;fairly lengthy time period&#8221; is important because
bapineuzumab is being considered as a long-running treatment for
Alzheimer&#8217;s, said Salloway, who also is a professor at Brown
University&#8217;s Alpert Medical School. It&#8217;s not meant to be &#8220;just
a one-shot, for 18 months,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ninety-one percent of the participants reported side
effects, and about 24 percent of the individuals reported
adverse events that were considered to have a link or possibly
have a link with bapineuzumab. Most side effects were mild to
moderate, such as headaches. About 35 percent of the patients
reported serious adverse events, including convulsion, hip
fracture and swelling known as cerebral vasogenic edema, an
accumulation of water in the brain tissue, researchers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It continues to be unclear to us if these events are
harmful long-term or just short-term markers of drug efficacy,&#8221;
Marc Goodman, an analyst at UBS AG in New York, wrote in a July
14 note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side Effect &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vasogenic edema was the most commonly reported side effect,
occurring in 9.3 percent of participants, in line with previous
bapineuzumab studies, the researchers said. The risk of
developing vasogenic edema appeared to be lower after multiple
infusions of the drug, according to the investigators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It tends to occur early and doesn&#8217;t seem to occur later
in the treatment, so that&#8217;s very encouraging,&#8221; Salloway said.
&#8220;Most of the vasogenic edema changes occurred with the first
three doses, and then over time it&#8217;s a much lower rate. I don&#8217;t
think we&#8217;ve seen it at all after two years of treatment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer&#8217;s is a progressive illness that starts with mild
forgetfulness and eventually robs patients of memories and
independence. It afflicts about 36 million people worldwide, a
number that is expected to double by 2050, according to the
Alzheimer&#8217;s Association, an advocacy group based in Chicago.
Existing drugs temporarily ease symptoms and none cure the
condition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bapineuzumab is in the third and final stage of testing
generally needed for regulatory approval. Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) has
said it plans to seek U.S. regulatory approval of bapineuzumab
in 2012 or 2013. Final-phase results are expected for mid-2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are getting more familiar&#8221; with bapineuzumab and
trial results next year will give a &#8220;clearer answer on how well
the drug works and much more information about safety,&#8221;
Salloway said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telefonos de Mexico SAB, the
nation&#8217;s largest land-line phone company, said second-quarter
profit fell 12 percent as Grupo Televisa SA (TLEVICPO)&#8217;s cable units lured
users with packages of voice, TV and Internet service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income dropped to 3.15 billion pesos ($270 million), or
17 centavos a share, from 3.57 billion pesos, or 20 centavos, a
year earlier, Mexico City-based Telmex said yesterday. Sales
fell 2.9 percent to 27.6 billion pesos, beating the 27.3
billion-peso estimate of Andrew Campbell, an analyst at Credit
Suisse Group AG in Sao Paulo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telmex, controlled by billionaire Carlos Slim&#8217;s America
Movil SAB, is fighting in court to overturn the Mexican
government&#8217;s decision to deny it a license to offer television
service over its phone lines. Meantime, it&#8217;s selling a package
of services with satellite-TV provider Dish Mexico to keep
clients from switching to Televisa&#8217;s cable units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phone lines operated by Telmex fell to 15.3 million, a loss
of 308,000 from the previous quarter, including 113,000
disconnected lines that were no longer being used because they
had been dedicated to technical support for dial-up Internet
services. High-speed Internet subscriptions increased 112,000 to
7.57 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telmex gained 9 centavos to 9.41 pesos yesterday in Mexico

&lt;p&gt;Around the time readers first
learned of Sherlock Holmes&#8217;s turning to cocaine after a tough
case, two of the medical world&#8217;s great minds were getting a
serious buzz on for research, fun and abuse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These actual early cokeheads were Sigmund Freud (1856-1939)
and U.S. surgeon William Halsted (1852-1922), the subjects of
Howard Markel&#8217;s colorful study &#8220;An Anatomy of Addiction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the opening pages, we meet a young Halsted in May 1885
in a hospital dispensary. He &#8220;frantically searched the
shelves&#8221; for cocaine, shot up and then bolted from the
operating room where he was supposed to attend a compound
fracture. He fled to his Manhattan home and &#8220;sank into a
cocaine oblivion that lasted more than seven months.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug wasn&#8217;t cheap then either, but Halsted was the
scion of a dry-goods and insurance fortune. A jock and a dandy
at Yale, his medical interests surfaced only in his senior year
after some unrequired light reading in Gray&#8217;s Anatomy. Following
two years of study in Vienna and several German cities, Halsted
returned to the U.S. &#8220;a superbly trained surgeon, perhaps the
best of his generation,&#8221; Markel writes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in May 1885, we encounter Freud boasting in a letter
to his fiancee about &#8220;how a dose of pure cocaine vanquished his
migraine and inspired him to stay up until four in the morning
writing a &#8216;very important&#8217; anatomical study,&#8221; Markel writes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, reported fourth-quarter profit and sales that
exceeded analysts&#8217; predictions as it benefited from robust
demand from corporations and a lower-than-expected tax rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income in the fiscal period that ended in June rose 30
percent to $5.87 billion, or 69 cents a share, from $4.52
billion, or 51 cents, a year earlier, Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft said in a statement today. That beat the 58-cent
estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales rose to $17.4
billion, compared with the $17.2 billion average projection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporations, eager to upgrade aging fleets of computers,
are snapping up Microsoft&#8217;s Office business-productivity
programs and the company&#8217;s flagship Windows operating system.
That made up for weaker demand from consumers, who favored
smartphones and tablets sporting Apple Inc. and Google Inc.
software. Results were also boosted by Microsoft getting more of
its earnings in foreign countries that have lower tax rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a great finish to a fiscal year full of records,&#8221;
said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners LP in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said operating expenses in the year that started
July 1 will rise to $28 billion to $28.6 billion, reiterating an
April forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft was little changed in late trading after earlier
gaining 4 cents to $27.10 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq
Stock Market. The shares rose 2.4 percent last quarter, while
the Standard and Poor&#8217;s 500 Index fell 0.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ireland, Singapore, Puerto Rico &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said its tax rate fell to 7 percent from 25
percent a year earlier because more earnings were taxed at lower
rates in Ireland, Singapore and Puerto Rico, Microsoft said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal
statutory rate primarily due to a higher mix of earnings taxed
at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions,&#8221; Microsoft said in the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rate explains much of the reason why results surpassed
predictions, Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein said in an
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unearned revenue -- which comes from multiyear contracts
that isn&#8217;t recognized in the current period and indicates future
sales -- was also higher than analysts projected. That figure
was $17.1 billion, above the average estimate of $15.6 billion,
according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It implies a strong close to the end of the quarter from
a bookings perspective, and that&#8217;s going to flow into revenue in
the next couple of quarters,&#8221; said Tony Ursillo, an analyst at
Loomis Sayles  Co., which manages $162.3 billion, including
Microsoft shares. &#8220;The flywheel has a lot of energy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows PC Demand &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft saw higher demand for Windows PCs for
corporations than those for consumers, Klein said. That trend
will continue through the fiscal year that started July 1 as
companies continue replacing older machines, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company follows Intel Corp., the largest chipmaker, in
reporting robust buying by corporations. Intel forecast sales
for the current quarter yesterday that exceeded some analysts&#8217;
predictions, citing demand from companies that are upgrading
dated technology. Sales in Microsoft&#8217;s business unit, mostly
from Office software, rose 7.5 percent to $5.78 billion,
compared with the $5.7 billion analysts predicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales to large corporations were strong in part because
Microsoft sales representatives pushed to close deals before the
end of the fiscal year, as is often the case in the fourth
quarter, Klein said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales in Microsoft&#8217;s server software unit rose 12 percent
to $4.64 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer Weakness &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s consumer business, by contrast, is suffering
amid rivalry from Apple, and its Internet business is contending
with competition from Google and Facebook Inc., which have added
features that keep users engaged for longer stretches. Windows
revenue fell less than 1 percent to $4.74 billion, missing the
$4.8 million average estimate of analysts. That was the third-
straight quarter that the division missed analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer demand for Windows PCs was also crimped by
economic weakness in some parts of the world, Klein said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are macro-economic constraints on spending,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;We see it as specifically acute in netbooks, which
continue to drop roughly 40 percent. Certainly tablets are part
of it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple, which reported more quarterly profit than Microsoft
for the first time in 20 years in the March quarter, is
persuading customers to pass up new laptop computers in favor of
its iPad tablet. Apple said this week it sold 9.3 million iPads
in the June quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile Laggard &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 85 million PCs were sold worldwide in the same
period, research firm Gartner Inc. said. About 20 percent of the
iPads sold went to customers who would have otherwise bought a
Windows PC, Gillis estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is working on a successor to its Windows
operating system that can work on tablet-style computers
comparable to the iPad. Windows President Steven Sinofsky showed
a preview of the software in June. The he declined to say when
it would be available, except to note it &#8220;won&#8217;t be this fall.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Klein declined to provide specific sales numbers for
Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Phone, a revamped product released in
October to reverse share lost to Google and Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked whether mobile sales were disappointing, he said,
&#8220;Maybe a little.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile-software sales won&#8217;t reach &#8220;volume&#8221; until 2012,
Klein said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market continues to await evidence of Microsoft&#8217;s
ability to establish a presence in mobile,&#8221; said Josh Olson, an
analyst at Edward Jones  Co. in St. Louis. &#8220;Until Microsoft is
able to do that, I think the stock is going to continue to trade
in a very narrow band.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales in the entertainment and devices division, which
includes mobile software, gained 30 percent to $1.49 billion --
a sign of demand for Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox gaming console. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS)&#8217;s second-quarter
revenue from both investment banking and fixed-income trading
beat Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s for the first time on record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed-income trading generated $2.09 billion for Morgan
Stanley and investment banking brought in $1.47 billion, while
Goldman Sachs reported $1.6 billion and $1.45 billion,
respectively. New York-based Morgan Stanley has never
outperformed its larger rival in both those businesses
simultaneously in the 11 years it&#8217;s reported fixed-income
trading results, company filings show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, 53,
benefited as his firm took more risks while Goldman Sachs, led
by Lloyd C. Blankfein, 56, pulled back. Morgan Stanley rose the
most yesterday in more than two years on the New York Stock
Exchange after reporting a second-quarter loss smaller than
analysts estimated. Goldman Sachs dropped as much as 3 percent
after profit missed estimates on July 19, before paring that
decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s unusual to see them going in opposite directions,
Jason Tyler, senior vice president at Ariel Investments LLC,
said yesterday in an interview with Tom Keene on Bloomberg
Radio. &#8220;Usually you&#8217;ll see investment banking as a whole
trending in one way.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s average value-at-risk, or VaR, a measure of how much it could lose in the markets in a single day, rose to $145 million from $121 million in the first quarter, while Goldman Sachs&#8217;s fell to $101 million from $113 million. Close

&lt;p&gt;American International Group Inc. (AIG)&#8217;s

&lt;p&gt;The IPO from International Lease Finance Corp. may raise $2

&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported ILFC&#8217;s choice of banks
earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Tara Lachapelle and Joseph Ciolli" date="Jul 21, 2011  4:16 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-21/walter-energy-ceo-resigning-signals-60-takeover-gain-real-m-a.html"><headline>Walter Energy CEO Resigning Signals 60% Takeover Gain: Real M&amp;amp;A</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy Inc. (WLT)&#8217;s shareholders,
who lost almost $2 billion in three months on management turmoil
and disappointing earnings, may still be rewarded with a $4
billion windfall if the coal producer is acquired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investor Audley Capital Advisors LLP said this week the
southern Appalachia producer of steelmaking coal should explore
a sale following Chief Executive Officer Keith Calder&#8217;s
resignation after three months on the job. Walter Energy would
fetch as much as $192 a share, or a 60 percent premium to
yesterday&#8217;s close, based on the median earnings multiple paid in
coal deals since 1998, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the $12 billion price would mark the biggest takeover
of a coal producer, Walter Energy makes twice as much profit per
dollar of sales as the U.S. industry average, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. With metallurgical coal trading near a record
and the Birmingham, Alabama-based company&#8217;s shares down 15
percent from an all-time high in April, Walter Energy may lure
buyers from Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR) to Consol Energy Inc. (CNX),
according to Raymond James Financial Inc. It may also attract
steelmaker Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA, Davenport  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s really an obvious takeout candidate, especially
after their CEO resigned,&#8221; said Eric Green, a Philadelphia-
based fund manager at Penn Capital Management, which oversees
$6.5 billion and about 60,000 Walter Energy shares. &#8220;It would
be extremely attractive for an international steel or materials
company. There&#8217;s huge demand for met coal, and Walter&#8217;s is very
high quality.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Constructive Dialogue&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Monahan, a spokesman for Walter Energy, declined to
comment beyond the company&#8217;s July 19 response to Audley Capital.
The coal producer said it welcomes &#8220;constructive dialogue&#8221;
with all investors, is focused on creating long-term shareholder
value and will still be led by &#8220;an experienced senior
management team,&#8221; according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armel Leslie, a spokesman for London-based Audley Capital,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy, which has operations in Alabama&#8217;s Blue Creek
seam, gained mines in Canada when it purchased Vancouver-based
Western Coal Corp. in April for C$5.3 billion ($5.6 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metallurgical coal, also referred to as coking coal, is
used to forge steel, while the thermal form is used by utilities
to generate electricity. Walter Energy&#8217;s coking coal is
considered better quality because it&#8217;s purer and has a higher
heat rate, making it desirable for steelmakers, said Timothy Parker, who oversees $8.5 billion in natural-resource stocks at
T. Rowe Price Group Inc., part of the firm&#8217;s $509.9 billion
under management globally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Bee&#8217;s Knees&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s excellent coal,&#8221; said Baltimore-based Parker, whose
firm owned about 2.3 million shares of Walter Energy at the end
of March. &#8220;It&#8217;s really essential for steelmaking, so it prices
at a premium, especially because it&#8217;s very hard to find. It&#8217;s
the bee&#8217;s knees.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy was also one of more than 40 companies that
Bloomberg identified in March that met the acquisition criteria
Warren Buffett listed in his annual letter to shareholders.
Buffett typically prefers &#8220;simple&#8221; businesses with pretax
profit exceeding $75 million, &#8220;consistent&#8221; earning power, and
&#8220;good&#8221; returns on equity while employing little or no debt,
according to his report to Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Walter Energy has been a takeover candidate for
&#8220;several years,&#8221; the company became more vulnerable to a sale
after its CEO said he was stepping down just three months after
he took the position, according to Penn Capital&#8217;s Green. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Management Conflict &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calder, whose resignation is effective at the end of this
month, told the board of directors in a letter that he was
leaving due to differing opinions on management philosophy,
according to a June 30 statement from the company. Joseph B. Leonard, the interim chief from March 2010 to March 2011, will
be the interim CEO again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company missed analysts&#8217; earnings estimates three
quarters in a row and has faced operational problems at deeper
mines in Alabama. Since reaching a record April 8, the shares
fell 21 percent before Audley Capital&#8217;s letter was made public,
wiping out about $1.9 billion in market value, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The stock had gained 7.8 percent since the
investor&#8217;s letter was disclosed through yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy rose $5.51, or 4.6 percent, to $125.15 today
in New York, the highest closing price since May 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company should sell because it &#8220;now lacks the strong
leadership needed,&#8221; which is &#8220;weighing on the share price,&#8221;
Audley Capital, which owns 900,000 shares, or about 1.5 percent
of the company, said in a July 17 letter to the board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Headless Horseman&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy could fetch $240 a share in a takeover, based
on the 2012 earnings multiple that Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU) and
ArcelorMittal are offering for Macarthur Coal Ltd. (MCC), the letter
said. That would be double Walter Energy&#8217;s closing price of
$119.64 yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Walter has been the headless horseman before, and it&#8217;s
about to be the headless horseman again,&#8221; T. Rowe&#8217;s Parker
said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not totally shocking that some activists wanted to
shake the tree.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coal producers have sold for a median of 7.25 times
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
since 1998, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Applying
that multiple to analysts&#8217; estimated 2011 Ebitda of $1.66
billion, Walter Energy may draw a bid for its equity of $11.9
billion, or almost $192 a share, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s $4.4 billion more than the company&#8217;s market value of
$7.5 billion as of yesterday. Such a deal would also top Teck
Resources Ltd.&#8217;s almost $8.7 billion acquisition of Fording
Canadian Coal Trust in 2008 as the biggest in the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record Coal Prices &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While J. Christopher Haberlin, an analyst at Davenport,
estimates the company may fetch between $185 and $215 a share,
David Beard, an analyst at Iberia Capital Partners LLC, pegs a
takeover at about $160 a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coal producer&#8217;s profit margin of 25 percent in the last
12 months tops 10 of 11 U.S. industry peers with market values
greater than $500 million, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The group&#8217;s average margin was almost 13 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benchmark prices for steelmaking coal settled at $315 a ton
for the quarterly contract, according to UBS AG, the second-
highest level on record. They slipped 4.5 percent from the all
time high of $330 for the three-month contract that started
April 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices have surged amid global production disruptions,
including record flooding in Queensland, Australia, and labor
strikes in the face of robust demand from China and India. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Time to Sell&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Now is a good time to sell the company because of the
near-record prices for met coal, strong global demand and
constricted global supply,&#8221; said Davenport&#8217;s Haberlin, who&#8217;s
based in Richmond, Virginia. &#8220;The assets have more value now
than ever.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter has projected that coking coal production will
increase to 20 million metric tons in 2012 from sales of 7.2
million tons in 2010, prior to the Western Coal deal closing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s production growth, high-quality coal and
rising international demand may attract buyers in the coal
industry, including Consol Energy, a coal and natural-gas
company, and Alpha, the world&#8217;s third-largest producer of
steelmaking coal, said Jim Rollyson, an analyst at Raymond James
in Houston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consol Energy has a market value of $12.3 billion, while
Alpha of Abingdon, Virginia, is valued at $10.2 billion. Lynn
Seay, a spokeswoman for Consol Energy, and Ted Pile, a spokesman
for Alpha, said the companies don&#8217;t comment on speculation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rare Coal Quality &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quality of Walter Energy&#8217;s coal makes it attractive to
producers of steel, which is used in buildings and cars, said T.
Rowe&#8217;s Parker. Brazilian iron and steel manufacturer CSN, as
Siderurgica Nacional is known, is also a potential buyer,
according to Haberlin at Davenport. The company has a market
value of 25 billion real ($16 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fabio Rocha, a spokesman for CSN, didn&#8217;t respond to an e-
mail requesting comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Walter Energy may appeal to a variety of companies,
many firms in the mining industry are already in the midst of
acquisitions or recently completed deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alpha completed the $7.5 billion acquisition last month of
Massey Energy Co., the owner of the mine in West Virginia where
29 workers died in an April 2010 explosion. That may make Alpha
less likely to pursue another deal right now, said Iberia
Capital&#8217;s Beard, who&#8217;s based in New Orleans, Louisiana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steel manufacturer ArcelorMittal (MT) of Luxembourg and St.
Louis, Missouri-based coal miner Peabody announced on July 11 a
proposed acquisition of Macarthur that values the Brisbane,
Australia-based coal producer at A$4.7 billion ($5.1 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy Bidders &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the bidders are still trying to persuade
Macarthur, ArcelorMittal, with a $50 billion market
capitalization, or Peabody, at $16.5 billion, may potentially
bid for Walter Energy, said Davenport&#8217;s Haberlin, Raymond
James&#8217;s Rollyson and Penn Capital&#8217;s Green. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giles Read, a spokesman for ArcelorMittal, declined to
comment. Representatives for Peabody didn&#8217;t respond to phone
calls and e-mails requesting comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Clearly the market has worked in their favor in terms of
the strength in pricing of their commodity,&#8221; Raymond James&#8217;
Rollyson said. &#8220;Given the right circumstance, there will
probably be some interest in Walter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, said it has no plans to break up the company&#8217;s animal
health unit after Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY) expressed interest in buying
some of its products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lilly, which had $1.39 billion in sales from animal-health
products last year, is monitoring Pfizer&#8217;s plans to divest its
unit and will pursue assets deemed of interest, Chief Financial
Officer Derica Rice said today in a conference call. Pfizer
wants a sale or spinoff of the unit and doesn&#8217;t foresee breaking
it up, said Joan Campion, a company spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read said on July 7 he
is divesting the company&#8217;s animal health and nutrition units to
buy back shares and focus on developing new drugs. The units may
fetch $22 billion, according to Seamus Fernandez, an analyst at
Leerink Swann  Co. Pfizer&#8217;s animal health unit had sales last
year of $3.48 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While we are evaluating a variety of options including a
sale, spinoff or other transaction, we believe we will favor one
overall option rather than dividing assets and business
operations,&#8221; Campion said today in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s review of its options for the unit will take 12 to
24 months, Campion said. The company doesn&#8217;t plan further
announcements about the unit until 2012, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares rose 20 cents, or 1 percent, to $20.10 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Lilly rose
$1.15, or 3 percent, to $39.32, for the biggest single-day gain
since Jan. 19, 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evolving Situation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will watch how that situation evolves, and if there
are some assets that become available that we are interested in,
yes, we will pursue them,&#8221; Lilly&#8217;s Rice said in a conference
call with analysts. &#8220;It is very early to speculate&#8221; what type
of transaction Pfizer is seeking, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lilly isn&#8217;t likely to buy the unit outright, Fernandez said
in an e-mail. In order to maintain its quarterly dividend of 49
cents a share, which Rice has said Lilly will do, the company
would have to issue more stock and risk diluting earnings or use
so much cash that it would hurt the company&#8217;s credit ratings,
Fernandez said. The deal is also unlikely to be approved by
antitrust regulators, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I simply don&#8217;t think they are interested, and a $12
billion-plus deal would be a pretty big deal,&#8221; Fernandez wrote.
If another buyer emerges and faces regulatory hurdles, Lilly
might be able to purchase some assets from the acquiring
company, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lilly is interested in expanding its Elanco animal heath
unit&#8217;s offerings in vaccines and pet products, as well as
boosting its presence in Europe, Jeff Simmons, president of the
division, said in a June 29 telephone interview. Elanco&#8217;s
biggest product line is feed additives for cattle and poultry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are going to be opportunistic in animal health,&#8221;
Simmons said. &#8220;We are looking for additional assets. We are not
interested in acquiring for the sake of acquiring; it has got to
have a strategic element.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the largest U.S.
natural-gas producer since last year&#8217;s purchase of XTO Energy
Inc., is evaluating more acquisitions with an eye toward
expanding its gas holdings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon is assessing targets in more than a dozen gas-rich
shale-rock formations worldwide, Jack Williams, president of the
Irving, Texas-based company&#8217;s XTO unit, said yesterday in an
interview. The company has spent almost $3 billion to amass
shale leases in Texas, Pennsylvania, Arkansas and Louisiana
since closing the $34.9 billion purchase of XTO in June 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s desire for additional gas comes amid a series
of multibillion-dollar shale transactions. BHP Billiton Ltd.
agreed last week to pay about $12.1 billion for Petrohawk Energy
Corp. to expand its presence in U.S. shale. Since June 1,
companies including Exxon, Marathon Oil Corp. and Malaysia&#8217;s
Petroliam Nasional Bhd have announced at least $7 billion worth
of North American shale-gas deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon is also expanding its international shale-gas reach,
starting hydraulic fracturing on formations in Poland this year
and last week agreeing with China Petrochemical Corp. to jointly
assess the resource&#8217;s potential in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Williams said he favors so-called bolt-on transactions that
include gas fields adjacent to existing Exxon assets. Three
years after Exxon abandoned the Barnett shale in north Texas
because of lagging returns, XTO-operated wells in the region are
among the most profitable in the company&#8217;s portfolio, even after
a 67 percent slide in U.S. gas prices since 2008, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good Returns &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The economic returns are very good,&#8221; Williams said
during the interview in XTO&#8217;s offices in a 90-year-old bank
building in Fort Worth, Texas. &#8220;We&#8217;re running economics on
every individual well. We&#8217;re making sure each well makes
economic sense before we drill it. We&#8217;re not drilling anything
that&#8217;s losing money.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon has purchased shale fields that hold more than 10
trillion cubic feet of gas since the XTO transaction, the
company&#8217;s biggest purchase in more than a decade, Williams said.
Ten trillion cubic feet of gas is enough to supply U.S.
household demand for two years, based on Bloomberg calculations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon has risen 45 percent since the XTO deal closed on
June 28, 2010, outperforming the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 index and
U.S. crude oil futures, which increased 25 percent and 27
percent, respectively, through today&#8217;s close of trading. The
company gained $1.72, or 2.1 percent, to $85.02 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s Cash &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With $12.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents, Exxon has
no need for joint-venture partners to help finance its shale
projects, said Williams, whose previous assignments for Exxon
included overseeing Alaskan oil production from 2000 to 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rival gas producers such as Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) have
signed joint-venture agreements with international energy
companies including Total SA to secure financing amid a gas glut
that has depressed U.S. prices for the fuel. Benchmark gas
futures traded in New York have averaged $4.30 per million
British thermal units this year, 32 percent below the 2006-2010
average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would love to have a higher gas price, but we&#8217;re
pleased with the returns we&#8217;re seeing,&#8221; Williams said. &#8220;If you
get a good position in a play and you view that as capable of
providing attractive returns, why would you want to dilute that
by bringing somebody else in?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying Shale &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s post-XTO shale acquisitions have included the $695
million purchase of Ellora Energy Inc. in July 2010 and the
$1.69 billion transaction for Phillips Resources Inc. and TWP
Inc., a pair of closely held explorers active in the Marcellus
formation in Pennsylvania and neighboring states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XTO plans to drill 40,000 wells worldwide and more than
double gas production during the next decade, Williams said. In
the Barnett shale near Dallas, the company expects to drill
4,000 more wells in coming years to augment the 1,700 wells it
already operates in the region, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Barnett shale, where Houston billionaire George P. Mitchell pioneered the hydraulic fracturing and horizontal
drilling techniques in the late 1990s that triggered the shale-
gas boom, probably is less than 50 percent developed, Williams
said. That means it&#8217;ll take years of drilling before the region
begins to fade as a gas producer, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XTO has eight rigs drilling in the Barnett formation,
little changed since the merger with Exxon, Williams said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return to Barnett &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon abandoned the Barnett formation in October 2008 after
returns failed to meet expectations. The company sold its stakes
in gas fields and an 80-mile (129-kilometer) pipeline to closely
held Harding Energy Partners LLC of Dallas, which in turn sold
the assets to Chesapeake. Other big producers in the Barnett
include Devon Energy Corp. (DVN), EOG Resources Inc. (EOG) and Quicksilver
Resources Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s return to the Barnett region has been profitable,
thanks partly to XTO&#8217;s well designs, drilling expertise and
leases in some of the most prolific zones, Williams said. He
declined to provide specific figures for returns on investment
or per-well profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some of the best returns in the company are here in the
Barnett shale,&#8221; Williams said. &#8220;We have very good positions in
the heart of the play. Our drilling speed has doubled in the
past five years and our finding-and-development cost is 50
percent lower than it was five years ago.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnson  Johnson&#8217;s flood of product
recalls last year stemmed from poor management, staffing cuts
and breakdowns in integrating the consumer unit it bought from
Pfizer Inc. (PFE), JJ said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top executives at the world&#8217;s second-largest health-care
products company, though, aren&#8217;t to blame, JJ said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report by a special committee of JJ board members,     
filed in response to investor lawsuits, said the company&#8217;s
McNeil unit suffered from &#8220;an adversarial relationship&#8221; between
some quality-control and production staff as well as "an emphasis
on production volume&#8221; over compliance. The panel urged JJ&#8217;s 
board to create a new regulatory and compliance panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recalls have dogged JJ the past two years, led by the
withdrawal of more than 40 brands of children&#8217;s Tylenol, Motrin,
and other medicines with foul odors or faulty ingredients. The
New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company shut one factory for an
overhaul last year and signed a consent decree in March
expanding U.S. oversight at three plants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JJ&#8217;s consumer division &#8220;should have paid more attention
to&#8221; quality issues &#8220;and exercised more management oversight of
McNeil,&#8221; the committee said in a 122-page report filed in
federal court in Trenton, New Jersey. &#8220;With reduced central
oversight and tasked with implementing the Pfizer Healthcare
acquisition, some McNeil employees may have lost focus and
commitment to maintain quality standards.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawsuit Response &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report was a response to lawsuits filed by investors
last year who said JJ&#8217;s leadership missed a series of &#8220;red
flags&#8221; about the quality problems, as well as allegations of
kickbacks, illegal marketing of drugs and bribes paid to doctors
outside the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the lawsuits argue that JJ&#8217;s problems are systemic,
the lapses &#8220;were largely confined to McNeil,&#8221; the directors&#8217;
panel wrote. &#8220;There appears to be no single cause for the
developments at McNeil. Senior management never issued any
directives to the effect that quality should be sacrificed for
production; nor did anyone report to senior management that
McNeil was in jeopardy of significant regulatory intervention
because it was out of compliance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The committee found no evidence that Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer William Weldon engaged in or was aware of any
wrongdoing, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biggest Deal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JJ purchased New York-based Pfizer&#8217;s consumer health-care
unit in 2006 for $16.6 billion, in what was then the company&#8217;s
biggest acquisition. Pfizer is the world&#8217;s biggest health-care
company by sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of JJ gained 23 cents to $66.47 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have increased
7.5 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McNeil shut its Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, plant on
April 30 last year, the same day it pulled 136 million bottles
of over-the-counter children&#8217;s medicines tainted with metal
flecks or containing improper levels of ingredients. The list of
recalls has since grown to include contact lenses, artificial
hips, insulin cartridges and prescription drugs across JJ&#8217;s 250
subsidiaries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pfizer acquisition had &#8220;a major impact&#8221; on procedures
at McNeil, adding more than 3,000 product categories for the
subsidiary, the committee report said. JJ installed new
manufacturing lines at Fort Washington and a Las Piedras, Puerto
Rico, factory, &#8220;increasing the volume and complexity of their
operations and distracting&#8221; from quality improvements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leadership Shuffles &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, McNeil was going through successive
leaders in rapid order &#8220;who may not have had sufficient
understanding of what was taking place at the plant level,&#8221; the
committee said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At the plant level, there seemed to be a lack of
attention to product quality by some non-quality personnel,&#8221;
leading to friction with those responsible for compliance, the
committee found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2007 restructuring may have exacerbated the situation,
cutting staff at JJ&#8217;s corporate quality and compliance program
by 35 percent. The reshuffling took away the corporate
division&#8217;s authority to conduct unannounced audits at
subsidiaries. A &#8220;virtual hiring freeze&#8221; the following two
years also made it difficult for McNeil to add quality
reviewers, the report found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Averaging Scores &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An internal program to assess JJ factories gave Fort
Washington and Las Piedras low scores for their internal
auditing procedures in 2008 and 2009, the report said. But those
were averaged with better measures for other attributes and
corporate leaders learned only of the top-line, positive scores
for each facility, directors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the board&#8217;s audit committee received a routine
briefing from the consumer division in 2009, &#8220;there were no
sites in the red zone.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report was written by four independent directors asked
by the board to investigate the lawsuits&#8217; allegations. Charles O. &#8220;Chuck&#8221; Prince, the former Citigroup Inc. chief executive
officer, led the group, which included Anne Mulcahy, former CEO
of Xerox Corp.; William D. Perez, former CEO of Wm. Wrigley Jr.
Co.; and Michael M.E. Johns, chancellor of Emory University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the board was unaware of problems at McNeil as they
developed, senior management acted aggressively once the issues
came to their attention, the committee found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;No Red Flags&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The board and audit committee devoted substantial amounts
of time and effort to review compliance efforts,&#8221; they said.
&#8220;There were no red flags or indications of systemic failure
that were overlooked. As issues arose, they were appropriately
addressed and resolved -- often with the expenditure of
significant resources.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement today, JJ said its management &#8220;takes the
shareholder concerns and criticisms very seriously.&#8221; The full
board voted unanimously on July 18 to adopt the committee&#8217;s
recommendations, said Carol Goodrich, a spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Douglas Eakeley, an attorney for Lowenstein Sandler PC of
Roseland, New Jersey, conducted the investigation for the board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suing shareholders include the Minneapolis
Firefighters&#8217; Relief Association and the Hawaii Laborers Pension
Fund. They&#8217;ve asked a judge to order top executives and
directors to pay damages to the company for mismanagement and to
adopt new corporate governance procedures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An attorney for the shareholders, New York-based Jeroen van
Kwawegen, declined to comment in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) Derivative Litigation,
10-cv-2033, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey
(Trenton). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and
Citigroup Inc. (C) overhauled a $1.5 billion commercial mortgage-
bond deal after investors demanded more protection from losses
amid concern that ratings from Standard  Poor&#8217;s and Morningstar
Inc. didn&#8217;t accurately reflect the risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks boosted the buffer that protects AAA securities
from loan defaults by increasing the amount of lower-ranked debt
that is first to absorb losses, according to people familiar
with the transaction. The so-called credit enhancement on the
highest-graded debt has been raised to 20 percent from 14.5
percent, which was the least since sales of debt tied to
commercial property loans revived in November 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buyers are demanding better terms as banks have to unload
as much as $10 billion in real-estate loans they have been
stockpiling for sale as securities amid some signs that the U.S.
economic recovery is stalling. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup also
increased yields, after SP held a call with investors including
MetLife Inc. and CB Richard Ellis Investors LLC on July 18 to
address concerns that the credit enhancement levels were low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It really impairs the credibility rebuilding process to
have something like this happen so early in the cycle,&#8221; said
Harris Trifon, a debt analyst at Deutsche Bank AG. &#8220;Having to
carve out a new class says volumes about investors&#8217; perception
of the ratings agencies reliability. It shows that investors are
the ultimate arbiters of credit quality.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Koch Industries Inc. and Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM) are among companies that would benefit from almost
identical energy legislation introduced in state capitals from
Oregon to New Mexico to New Hampshire -- and that&#8217;s by design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The energy companies helped write the legislation at a
meeting organized by a group they finance, the American
Legislative Exchange Council, a Washington-based policy
institute known as ALEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The corporations, both ALEC members, took a seat at the
legislative drafting table beside elected officials and policy
analysts by paying a fee between $3,000 and $10,000, according
to documents obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opportunity for corporations to become co-authors of
state laws legally through ALEC covers a wide range of issues
from energy to taxes to agriculture. The price for participation
is an ALEC membership fee of as much as $25,000 -- and the few
extra thousands to join one of the group&#8217;s legislative-writing
task forces. Once the &#8220;model legislation&#8221; is complete, it&#8217;s up
to ALEC&#8217;s legislator members to shepherd it into law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is just another hidden way for corporations to buy
their way into the legislative process,&#8221; said Bob Edgar,
president of Common Cause, a Washington-based group that
advocates for limits on money in politics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A former JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
business banker pleaded guilty to using other people&#8217;s
identities to steal more than $1.1 million from the bank and its
customers, the Manhattan district attorney said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hao &#8220;Howie&#8221; Wang, 28, of Newark, New Jersey, pleaded
guilty today in New York state Supreme Court to grand larceny,
identity theft, falsifying business records, forgery and scheme
to defraud, the office of District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr.
said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The defendant took advantage of his access to the
confidential files and accounts of customers who entrusted their
money to JPMorgan Chase  Co.,&#8221; Vance said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang, who worked at a retail branch at 270 Park Avenue from
December 2007 to July 2008, was arrested at Newark Liberty
International Airport in New Jersey on Nov. 17 and indicted by a
grand jury in New York in December. Prosecutors said he operated
his scheme from February 2008 to February 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one instance, prosecutors said, he used the identity of
a person without his knowledge or authorization to obtain a
$100,000 loan from New York-based JPMorgan. Wang created fake
bank documents in the name of the victim, who wasn&#8217;t a JPMorgan
Chase customer, making it seem as if the person had opened the
account and applied for the loan, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Falsified Documents &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He transferred $90,000 of the stolen money into bank
accounts outside the U.S. and spent the rest through debit card
purchases and cash withdrawals, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several months later, in June 2008, Wang stole the identity
of an actual JPMorgan customer and falsified documents to create
a fake account in that person&#8217;s name, prosecutors said. Wang
then transferred $250,000 from the person&#8217;s authorized JPMorgan
Chase account into the fake account before sending $200,000 into
bank accounts outside the U.S. and used $46,000 to purchase an
Audemars Piguet watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February 2009, Wang stole the identities of two other
JPMorgan customers and used them to transfer $139,536 and
$700,000 from their bank accounts to accounts outside the U.S.,
prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remains in Jail &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of his plea agreement, Wang will be sentenced to
two to six years in prison and make full restitution, according
to Vance&#8217;s office. He could have faced as long as 25 years on
one of the grand larceny counts he faced had he been convicted
at trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang was ordered to return to jail pending his next court
appearance, for a pre-sentencing report, which is set for Aug. 4
before New York State Supreme Court Justice Michael Obus,
according to court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase spokeswoman Jennifer Zuccarelli didn&#8217;t
immediately return a voice-mail and an e-mail message seeking
comment on the plea. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) sold $2.75
billion of bonds after reporting second-quarter earnings that
lagged behind analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank issued 5.25 percent, 10-year notes that yield 230
basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The offering, which was increased by
$250 million, follows Morgan Stanley (MS)&#8217;s $2 billion sale yesterday
that included $1.5 billion of 5.5 percent, 10-year notes that
were priced at a 250 basis-point spread. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-largest bank in the U.S. by
assets, said on July 19 its net income in the quarter was $1.09
billion, or $1.85 per share, short of the $2.30 per-share
average estimate of 23 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Bond
investors shouldn&#8217;t be fazed by the disappointing quarter, said
Marilyn Cohen, who oversees $320 million as chief executive
officer of Envision Capital Management in Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re still Goldman and they still have an uncanny way
of making money,&#8221; said Cohen, who bought some of the bank&#8217;s
bonds after the earnings report. &#8220;Even though they are reviled
by the media and by most people on Main Street, the
institutional investor knows that Goldman has the ability to
crank it out every year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale was the bank&#8217;s first U.S. debt offering of at
least $500 million since April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds Fall &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s $3.85 billion of 3.625 percent notes due
February 2016 fell to 100.3 cents on the dollar on July 20 after
the earnings announcement, from 101.2 cents at the beginning of
the week, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The securities rose
to 100.5 cents at 10 a.m. today in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is joining banks raising money in the U.S.
bond market even as relative yields on their debt climb. Banks
issued at least $24.9 billion of debt this month through
yesterday, almost triple the $8.95 billion of sales in the same
period in June, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average spreads on bank bonds have increased 10 basis
points to 213 basis points, or 2.13 percentage points, since
June 30, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data.
The average yield has dropped to 3.78 percent from 3.83 percent
during the same period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs last issued 10-year notes in a size of at
least $500 million in July 2010, selling $750 million of
securities with a 5.2 percent yield, Bloomberg data show. The
bank issued $1.35 billion of five-year notes on April 28 in an
add-on to an existing offering. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) cut its
forecast for U.S. corn production to 13.104 billion bushels for
the 2011-2012 season. The bank lowered its estimate for yields
to 156 bushels an acre. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 12, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said the
crop would total 13.47 billion bushels with yields of 158.7
bushels. Corn inventories before the 2012 harvest may fall to
694 million bushels, Goldman said. That compares with the
government&#8217;s estimate of 870 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Temperatures in July in the U.S. Midwest have been very
elevated,&#8221; Damien Courvalin and Allison Nathan, New York-based
Goldman analysts, said today in a report. &#8220;We see clear upside
risk to our&#8221; three-month corn-price forecast of $5.90 a bushel,
the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corporate spending on computers and
software gathered steam last quarter, bolstering sales and
profit at Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Intel Corp. (INTC) and International
Business Machines Corp. (IBM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results from all three companies this week surpassed
analysts&#8217; predictions, with Microsoft saying yesterday that
sales climbed to $17.4 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter.
That topped the $17.2 billion average estimate of analysts.
Intel&#8217;s revenue forecast for the current quarter, released a day
earlier, also exceeded projections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies are replacing aging desktop machines and
equipping data centers to deliver computing over the Internet,
via the so-called cloud. That&#8217;s fueling demand for new versions
of Microsoft programs for businesses, more powerful chips from
Intel and technology services provided by IBM. It&#8217;s also making
up for sluggish PC buying from consumers in developed markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What Intel said was the enterprise was strong, and that&#8217;s
what you saw in the Microsoft numbers as well,&#8221; said Pat Becker Jr., a fund manager at Portland, Oregon-based Becker Capital
Management Inc. His firm holds Intel and Microsoft shares among
the $2.5 billion it has under management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income in the fiscal period that ended in June rose 30
percent to $5.87 billion, or 69 cents a share, Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft said in a statement yesterday. That
beat the 58-cent estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SA (TLEVICPO)&#8217;s Empresas
Cablevision SAB unit is seeking to lure subscribers from
Telefonos de Mexico SAB with a new high-speed Internet offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cablevision, which serves the Mexico City area, began
selling Internet this week at a download speed of as much as 3
megabits a second for 149 pesos ($13) a month. That compares
with an earlier offer of 2 megabits for 199 pesos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The carrier aims to take advantage of Telmex&#8217;s failure to
get a license to offer TV service by attracting clients with
video and Internet packages, said Jean Paul Broc, the cable
carrier&#8217;s chief executive officer. The promotion should bring in
40,000 customers this year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The more clients we have with more services, the harder
it will be for another provider to enter,&#8221; Broc said yesterday
in a telephone interview. &#8220;If Telmex gets TV someday, we&#8217;re
ready.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa gained 49 centavos yesterday to 52.15 pesos. The
shares have lost 18 percent this year before today. Cablevision
is one of three cable carriers controlled by the Mexico City-
based company, the world&#8217;s largest Spanish-language broadcaster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the offer will cut into Cablevision&#8217;s revenue per
subscriber, the greater number of subscribers will make the
discount worth it, Broc said. Cablevision had about 329,000
Internet customers at the end of last quarter, up 19 percent
from a year earlier. That gives it 22 percent of Internet
subscribers in the Mexico City area, Broc said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telmex doesn&#8217;t sell Internet service individually. The
company offers a package of phone and Internet service with a
speed of 2 megabits a second for 599 pesos a month. A similar
package from Cablevision, including the new Internet offer,
would be 403 pesos a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Network Upgrade &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Telmex official who can&#8217;t be named under company policy
declined to comment. The Mexico City-based company had 7.7
million Internet subscribers at the end of last quarter, up 10
percent from a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cablevision has almost completed a three-year, $450 million
plan to upgrade its network by extending fiber-optic cables
closer to clients&#8217; homes, Broc said. Internal surveys show the
investment is improving customers&#8217; perception of the quality of
Cablevision&#8217;s services, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s
biggest energy company by market value, will make a decision
soon on selling part of its retail business in Malaysia, the
Business Times reported, citing people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon could raise about 1 billion ringgit ($336.5 million)
by selling its network of 560 service stations in the Southeast
Asian nation, according to the newspaper. That compares with
Royal Dutch Shell Plc&#8217;s more than 900 gas stations in the
country and Boustead Holdings Bhd. (BOUS)&#8217;s 330, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Divesting the retail business would enable the Irving,
Texas-based company to focus on oil and gas exploration,
production and refining operations in Malaysia, according to the
report. Two calls to Exxon offices in Kuala Lumpur weren&#8217;t
immediately returned outside of business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will jointly invest more than 10 billion
ringgit in a production-sharing project with Petronas Carigali
Sdn., the exploration arm of state oil and gas company Petroliam
Nasional Bhd., Prime Minister Najib Razak said in January. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Ovitz, the former Hollywood
agent whose company was said to have created enemies &#8220;the way a
hurricane produces raindrops,&#8221; first met Gary Cohn over lunch
at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s headquarters in June 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two men, one the founder of the most powerful talent
agency in the entertainment business, the other president of the
most profitable securities firm in Wall Street history, have
been in daily e-mail contact since, Ovitz said. They talk by
phone three or four times a week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a trip to the Caribbean in December, Ovitz, now an
investor, visited Cohn on the Turks and Caicos Islands. Cohn,
50, a silver trader who worked his way up to the No. 2 position
at Goldman Sachs, &#8220;was always on the phone, off in a corner,&#8221;
Ovitz said. Cohn later told the former chairman of Creative
Artists Agency Inc. he had been working on the deal to sell $1.5
billion of shares in Facebook Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ovitz, who received a severance package estimated at $140
million when he was fired in 1996 after 15 months as president
of Walt Disney Co., said he&#8217;s impressed with Cohn. Any Goldman
Sachs director who doesn&#8217;t want him to succeed Lloyd Blankfein
as chief executive officer should have his &#8220;head examined,&#8221;
Ovitz said. &#8220;He&#8217;s a trader. He has that whole feel in his body
and brain and fingertips.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) hired Naoki Mita, a former Barclays Plc (BARC) commodities banker in Tokyo, to help
bolster its fuel, currency and metal hedging operations in
Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mita, 35, joined the corporate solutions division in Tokyo
on July 22, said Sachiko Hasegawa, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan
Securities Japan Co. He will be responsible for marketing the
second-biggest U.S. bank&#8217;s commodity and currency hedging
products to Japanese utilities, oil refiners and manufacturers,
a person with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s imports of dollar-denominated natural gas have
surged following a record earthquake and tsunami in March that
led to a shutdown of the nation&#8217;s nuclear reactors. The New
York-based bank is also targeting Japanese shipping companies
and trading houses including Mitsubishi Corp. (8058), the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Manufacturers will need more of these financial tools to
control production costs and sustain profit growth,&#8221; said
Makoto Imai, an assistant general manager and copper trader at
Sumitomo Corp. (8053), the country&#8217;s fourth biggest trading company by
market value. &#8220;Mita&#8217;s commodity experience will enable him to
quickly arrange and bring the financial services to customers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mita reports to managing director Takeo Kaneko in his new
position, according to the person. Tokyo-based Hasegawa declined
to comment on Mita&#8217;s duties or the unit&#8217;s marketing strategy. At
Barclays, Mita sold similar hedging products, and was with the
London-based bank for about five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utility Demand &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tokyo Electric Power Co. and Chubu Electric Power Co. are
among Japanese atomic-plant operators that boosted liquefied
natural gas imports to offset reductions in nuclear power
generation. The magnitude 9 earthquake and ensuing tsunami
triggered Japan&#8217;s worst nuclear accident at Tokyo Electric&#8217;s
Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant, about 135 miles (217 kilometers)
northeast of Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten regional power companies including Tokyo Electric used
about 31 percent more LNG in June and also increased thermal
power generation, according to data compiled by the Federation
of Electric Power Companies of Japan. The country&#8217;s LNG import
costs surged 24 percent in June to 60,712 yen ($777) a metric
ton from January, according to Finance Ministry data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper for delivery in three months surged 35 percent on
the London Metals Exchange to $9,655 a metric ton in the past
year. On the New York Mercantile Exchange Crude oil futures
gained 25 percent in the last 12 months to $99.05 a barrel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) cut its 2011
forecast for sales of bonds tied to commercial mortgages by as
much as $15 billion as volatile prices curb profitability for
Wall Street banks, impeding a recovery in the property market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan reduced its forecast to between $30 billion and
$35 billion, the New York-based lender said in a July 22 report.
It had projected in November as much as $45 billion in new
offerings for this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Securities tied to property loans have declined as Europe&#8217;s
fiscal crisis and a stalemate between U.S. lawmakers over
raising the debt ceiling roil markets. Banks sold $3 billion in
commercial-mortgage backed bonds last week at the highest yields
this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It has gotten harder to make money in the new issue
market,&#8221; according to JPMorgan analysts led by Ed Reardon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underwriters accumulate loans over several months to pool
for sale as securities. A drop in values before the debt is sold
means banks won&#8217;t receive as much cash as anticipated when the
loans were made. Jumps in spreads may cause lenders to pull back
as it&#8217;s difficult to protect against price swings, UBS AG
analysts said in a July 21 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. boosted spreads
on BBB bonds by 200 basis points to 700 basis points more than
benchmark swap rates on a $1.5 billion offering sold last week,
according to people familiar with the sales, who declined to be
identified because terms aren&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar debt rated BBB-, the lowest investment-grade
ranking, was sold to yield 295 basis points, or 2.95 percentage
points, over the benchmark in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trimming Deals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks have already begun to trim deals, with one offering
in the pipeline cut to $1.5 billion from $2.3 billion, according
to JPMorgan. Wall Street has arranged about $21.6 billion of
commercial-mortgage bond sales this year, compared with $11.5
billion in all of 2010, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pull-back could impede a recovery in commercial real
estate prices, particularly for properties that aren&#8217;t in the
large, coastal cities where insurance companies are focused.
Financial institutions like insurers that hold mortgages on
their books have been snapping up lending assignments on the
best properties, leaving Wall Street to lend more in smaller
cities on less stable properties, according to the UBS analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The revival of the CMBS market has been a component of the
stabilization,&#8221; of commercial real estate prices, the UBS
analysts led by Ross Nussbaum said. &#8220;A pullback from this
capital source would be a real concern as real estate values sit
at the intersection of cash flows,&#8221; and the cost and
availability of financing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maturing Loans &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of commercial-mortgage bonds peaked at $234 billion
in 2007, helping fuel a boom in property prices, Bloomberg data
show. Issuance plummeted to $12.2 billion in 2008 as souring
subprime-home loans infected credit markets. The market stayed
shut until November 2009, choking off funding to borrowers with
debt coming due. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concern that a wave of maturing loans could derail an
economic recovery prompted the Federal Reserve to include
commercial-mortgage bonds in its Term Asset-Backed Securities
Loan Facility, or TALF, one of the programs started to jumpstart
credit markets in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brother
Holdings Inc. in September 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About $158 billion commercial mortgages packaged into bonds
will need to be refinanced through 2014, according to Citigroup
data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) agreed to
buy 26.5 percent of Aksa Enerji Uretim AS (AKSEN), one of Turkey&#8217;s two
biggest power producers, for about $450 million, driving a
record gain in the utility&#8217;s shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will pay 5.05 liras ($2.94) a share to Aksa&#8217;s
parent company, Kazanci Holding AS, which will invest the
proceeds in power generation, Aksa Chairman Cemil Kazanci said
today by telephone. &#8220;The price isn&#8217;t certain and could change
at the closing of the transaction,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkey&#8217;s energy industry is luring international companies
as electricity demand is set to grow by an average 6.3 percent
over the next 20 years, Hasan Koktas, head of the energy-market
regulator, said June 15. Italy&#8217;s Ansaldo STS SpA won a 640
million-euro ($919 million) order for an 865-megawatt plant this
month. Austria&#8217;s Verbund AG (VER) and OMV AG, Germany&#8217;s RWE AG and
U.S.-based AES Corp. have also bought power assets in Turkey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs loaned Kazanci Holding $192 million as part
of the transaction, Kazanci said. The holding company pledged 43
percent of Aksa shares as collateral for the loan, which has a
maturity of a year and one week, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s offer represents a 22 percent premium to
Aksa&#8217;s volume-weighted average share price over the 20 days
through July 22, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Aksa
rose 33 kurus, or 8.7 percent, to 4.14 liras at the 5:30 p.m.
close in Istanbul, the biggest one-day gain since the stock
started trading in May 2010. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Reserve Bank of India will raise its benchmark
repurchase rate by a quarter percentage point to 7.75 percent at
a policy review tomorrow, according to 20 of 22 economists in a
Bloomberg survey. The rest expect no change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think the RBI&#8217;s language will still have a hawkish
bias, but will importantly recognize that domestic demand,
particularly investment demand, has slowed considerably, and
that there are headwinds to growth from the global environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to expect the RBI to hike by another 25 basis
points after July 26 in the remainder of 2011, with the next
hike likely by October...Inflation and inflation expectations
remain at levels so far above the RBI&#8217;s preferred target that
the central bank would want to err on the side of having done
too much rather than too little in its fight against
inflation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Reserve Bank of India will raise its benchmark
repurchase rate by a quarter percentage point to 7.75 percent at
a policy review tomorrow, according to 20 of 22 economists in a
Bloomberg survey. The rest expect no change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to expect a 25-basis point hike at the coming
policy meeting. However, we think this time around, the fall in
local growth data, along with a steady stream of poor economic
data globally, warrants some toning down of the RBI&#8217;s
hawkishness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe, if the RBI&#8217;s language is toned down, there is
likely to be a rally in bonds. However, the continuous supply in
bonds and the possibility of rate hikes should keep rallies
tactical and limited...We think 8.35 percent to 8.40 percent is
an attractive zone to buy 10-year bonds for cash investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If there is a less hawkish outcome from the RBI, then we
think bonds could easily breach 8.20 percent levels on the lower
side. We think the market would need confirmation that the
terminal repo rate is 7.75 percent to sustain lower yield
levels.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netflix Inc. (NFLX), the mail-order and
online film-rental service, agreed to carry programs by Grupo
Televisa SA, the world&#8217;s largest Spanish-language broadcaster,
as it expands into Latin America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multiyear deal calls for providing 3,000 hours of
programming a year, including the soap operas known as
telenovelas, Televisa said today in a statement to the Mexican
stock exchange. Netflix plans to start the service by the end of
the year, the Mexico City-based company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Televisa agreement and a three-year accord with TV
Azteca SAB give Netflix programs from Mexico&#8217;s two dominant
broadcasters, which represent almost all of the nation&#8217;s over-
the-air TV audience. Netflix is entering Latin America to add
sources of revenue and funds to acquire more film rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix, based in Los Gatos, California, fell $14.62, or
5.2 percent, to $266.91 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading after its third-quarter profit forecast trailed
analysts&#8217; estimates. Televisa dropped 21 centavos to 51.85 pesos
in Mexico City. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TV Azteca is providing 1,000 to 1,500 hours of telenovelas
and dramatic series to Netflix starting in September, an
executive for that Mexico City-based broadcaster said yesterday.
The executive can&#8217;t be named under company policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither broadcaster disclosed financial terms of their
agreements. Televisa said its programs being provided to Netflix
will be available a year after they&#8217;ve been aired on the
broadcast network. The agreement covers Latin America, including
Brazil, and the Caribbean, Televisa said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matthew Salem, head of commercial-
mortgage bond trading at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., has left the
bank, according to a person familiar with the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salem joined the New York-based firm from Morgan Stanley in
January 2006, according to records from the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-
based Goldman, declined to comment. Salem said he couldn&#8217;t
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets is cutting about
1,000 jobs after reporting a plunge in fixed-income revenue last
quarter that was bigger than analysts expected. The company&#8217;s
mortgage businesses were among those that produced
&#8220;particularly&#8221; lower revenues, Chief Financial Officer David A. Viniar said on a July 19 conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our mortgages results reflected the negative impact of
asset-price declines, reduced market liquidity and divergence
between our cash positions and corresponding hedges,&#8221; Viniar
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Citigroup Inc. sold $1.5 billion in
commercial-mortgage backed securities last week after
overhauling the deal to ease investor concern that the ratings
didn&#8217;t accurately reflect risks. The securities were issued with
the highest yields since sales of the debt revived in November
2009 as Europe&#8217;s debt crisis and debate over the U.S. debt
ceiling roiled markets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political wrangling over a plan to
reduce the deficit may cost the U.S. its AAA rating, adding $100
billion a year to government costs while dragging down economic
growth, according to Wall Street bond dealers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A U.S. credit-rating cut would likely raise the nation&#8217;s
borrowing costs by increasing Treasury yields by 60 to 70 basis
points over the &#8220;medium term,&#8221; JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Terry Belton said today on a conference call hosted by the Securities
Industry and Financial Markets Association. Standard  Poor&#8217;s,
which has given the U.S. a top ranking since 1941, reiterated on
July 21 that the chance of a downgrade is 50 percent in the next
three months and may cut the nation as soon as August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That impact on Treasury rates is significant,&#8221; Belton,
global head of fixed-income strategy at JPMorgan, said during
the call held by the securities industry trade group. &#8220;That
$100 billion a year is money being used for higher interest
rates and that&#8217;s money being taken away from other goods and
services.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has said the U.S. will
exhaust measures to avoid breaching its $14.3 trillion debt
threshold on Aug. 2. The government reached its borrowing limit
on May 16. President Barack Obama has threatened a presidential
veto of House Speaker John Boehner&#8217;s two-step plan slated to be
voted on tomorrow to raise the U.S. debt ceiling and cut $3
trillion in government spending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields Decline &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s Investors Service on July 13 put the U.S. on review 
for downgrade, while Fitch Ratings reiterated July 18 that it
would cut its rating on Treasury securities if the government&#8217;s
misses a debt payment. The &#8220;short-term&#8221; effect on Treasuries
of a downgrade would be about 5 to 10 basis points because few
asset managers would be forced to sell Treasuries, Belton said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on benchmark 10-year notes fell five basis points,
or 0.05 percentage point, to 2.95 percent today, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. That compares with an average of
4.03 percent since 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said today in Washington
he was told by credit-rating companies his deficit-cutting
proposal would not prompt a downgrade of U.S. debt. Boehner
yesterday offered a two-step plan would raise the U.S. borrowing
limit by up to $1 trillion and later by $1.6 trillion while
requiring larger spending cuts, according to Republican aides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reid Proposal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Standard  Poor&#8217;s has chosen not to comment on the many
and varying proposals that have arisen in the current debate,&#8221;
John Piecuch, a New York-based spokesman for SP, said in an e-
mail. &#8220;Any statement to the contrary is inaccurate,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reid&#8217;s proposal would cut $2.7 trillion in spending and
give Obama the full $2.4 trillion in additional borrowing
authority he seeks, enough to get through the 2012 elections.
Reid dropped Democrats&#8217; insistence on tax increases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nevada Democrat said today Boehner&#8217;s plan &#8220;gives the
credit agencies no choice but to downgrade U.S. debt&#8221; and that
the Senate will vote on his proposal soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If we&#8217;re in a situation in which the U.S. has effectively
lost some of its long-term credibility, particularly with
overseas partners who are big buyers of Treasuries, then that
does make it that much harder to get a long-term sustainable
budget situation in place,&#8221; Michael Hanson, senior economist at
Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York, said during the
conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. unemployment rate rose for a third straight month
in June to 9.2 percent, pointing to an economy lacking momentum
entering the second half of the year. Employers added 18,000
workers to payrolls, the fewest in nine months and less than the
most pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concern stemming from a credit-rating downgrade &#8220;is a
negative for growth, and that&#8217;s an environment in which
investment and hiring is lower than it otherwise would be,&#8221;
Hanson said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s Zyvox antibiotic can
cause potentially fatal central nervous system reactions in
patients who also take antidepressants that increase levels of
the brain chemical serotonin, U.S. regulators said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s Zoloft and Pristiq, Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY)&#8217;s Cymbalta and
GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)&#8217;s Paxil and Wellbutrin are among 29
psychiatric drugs that patients may need to stop taking
temporarily when they require treatment with Zyvox, the Food and
Drug Administration said today in a drug safety communication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zyvox, used to treat some types of drug-resistant bacteria
including MSRA or methicillin-related Staphylococcus aureus,
skin infections and nosocomial pneumonia, can interact with the
antidepressants to cause a toxic reaction known as serotonin
syndrome in which excess amounts of the chemical build up in the
brain, according to the FDA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some deaths among patients who suffered such a reaction
were reported to the FDA&#8217;s adverse-event database, the agency
said. Pfizer, based in New York, reported $1.18 billion in
revenue from Zyvox last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excess Serotonin &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confusion, memory issues, hyperactivity, excessive sweating
and muscle twitching are among the symptoms of excess serotonin
levels. Patients taking psychiatric drugs shouldn&#8217;t stop using
them without first consulting a health-care professional, the
FDA said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current U.S. package insert for Zyvox &#8220;already
includes prominent information regarding the potential for
serotonergic interactions, the risk of serotonin syndrome and
the need for careful observation of patients prescribed Zyvox
who are on such agents,&#8221; Kristen Neese, a Pfizer spokeswoman,
said today in an e-mail. The company hasn&#8217;t identified any new
safety signals related to those drug interactions, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In an ongoing commitment to ensure patient safety, Pfizer
continually monitors all relevant safety information including
information pertaining to the concomitant use of Zyvox and
serotonergic antidepressant medications,&#8221; Neese said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL), a week after reporting
record sales and profit, surpassed $400 a share for the first
time and is gaining ground on Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) to become the
world&#8217;s most valuable company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares rose $4.91 to $403.41 in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading. Apple has climbed 25 percent this year and 7 percent
since the company reported third-quarter results on July 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple, on the brink of bankruptcy when Chief Executive
Officer Steve Jobs reclaimed the top job more than a decade ago,
now has a bigger market value than Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Intel
Corp. (INTC) combined, fueled by new products such as the iPhone and
iPad. Shares are up from a stock-adjusted $5.48 on Sept. 16,
1997, the day Jobs returned after his 1985 ouster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It started with the Mac, then iPods, iPhones and now the
iPad,&#8221; said Giri Cherukuri, head trader for Oakbrook
Investments, which manages $2.7 billion, including Apple shares.
&#8220;It&#8217;s incredible.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock price gives Cupertino, California-based Apple a
market capitalization of about $374 billion, trailing by $41.6
billion the $416 billion value of Irving, Texas-based Exxon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple&#8217;s iPhone-fueled rise comes amid a reversal of
fortunes for rival makers of smartphones such as Research In
Motion Ltd. (RIMM) and Nokia Oyj, which have lost market share and
fired workers. Yesterday, RIM announced plans to cut 2,000 jobs
amid slowing sales. In April, Nokia said it would eliminate
7,000 jobs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
bought $225 million of claims on bankrupt Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) from a French insurance company last week, may
have paid 35 cents on the dollar, or less, a trading executive
estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The claims sold by CNP Assurances consisted of securities
issued by Lehman Brothers Treasury Co., a Lehman unit, according
to court filings this week. LBT claims are trading in the low
20s to the high 30s, while creditors of Lehman&#8217;s derivatives
unit are getting about 40 cents on the dollar and claims on its
commercial paper unit fetch 60 cents to 75 cents, said the
executive, who trades in the securities and declined to be named
because of company policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference in prices shows why the defunct firm&#8217;s
creditors fought with Chief Executive Officer Bryan Marsal to
improve their payout in a proposed $65 billion liquidation plan.
Marsal said July 1 that holders of more than $100 billion in
Lehman claims signed their support for his latest plan, which
allots more money to a group including Goldman Sachs, and less
to bondholders including Paulson  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big holders of LBT claims include Silver Point Capital LP
and Morgan Stanley. (MS) They combined with Goldman Sachs and other
large holders of claims on Lehman&#8217;s derivatives unit, Lehman
Brothers Special Financing, to promote a rival payout scheme to
Lehman&#8217;s and a second plan put forward by Paulson and the
California Public Employees&#8217; Retirement System, or Calpers.
Marsal said his plan was a &#8220;fair economic compromise&#8221; between
the two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bigger Claim &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CNP Assurance&#8217;s LBT securities bought by Goldman were part
of a bigger claim against Lehman of $687 million filed by the
seller, which also sold $101 million of LBT claims to Barclays
Plc, this week&#8217;s filings show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs spokesman Michael Duvally and CNP spokeswoman
Florence de Montmarin didn&#8217;t immediately respond to e-mails
seeking comment. Barclays spokesman Mark Lane declined to
comment. Both banks are active traders of Lehman claims,
according to court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman aims to confirm its plan by year-end and start
distributing a &#8220;significant&#8221; amount of cash shortly after,
Lehman&#8217;s bankruptcy lawyer Lori Fife of Weil Gotshal  Manges
LLP has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marsal aims to raise a total of $65 billion from the firm&#8217;s
assets in the next few years, to pay claims of more than $300
billion he has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman filed for bankruptcy in 2008 with assets of $639
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) offered to buy the
rest of India&#8217;s UTV Software Communications Ltd. (UTV) it doesn&#8217;t own
for as much as 20.1 billion rupees ($454 million), as the
world&#8217;s biggest media company seeks to expand in Bollywood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, which owns 50.44 percent of UTV, offered to buy all
remaining outstanding shares for no more than 1,000 rupees each,
the Mumbai-based company said in a statement today. That&#8217;s 11
percent higher than the closing price yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buyout will give the Burbank, California based company
control of UTV, which makes and distributes movies and produces
television programs, as rising incomes boost spending on
entertainment in Asia&#8217;s third-largest economy. Revenue from the
film industry in India may grow to 132 billion rupees in 2015
from 83 billion rupees last year, KPMG said in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Part of Walt Disney&#8217;s rationale for increasing its stake
in UTV is to get more of a foothold in the film industry,&#8221; said
Rohit Maheshwari, an analyst at KR Choksey Shares  Securities
Pvt. in Mumbai. &#8220;It&#8217;s the right time to do this because UTV is
one of the few players in the market that&#8217;s been really
successful at making movies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UTV rose 5.4 percent to 950.15 rupees at the 3:30 p.m.
close in Mumbai, the highest since December 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approvals Sought &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney will buy a 19.82 percent stake held by the founders,
UTV said in the statement. The remaining stake will be purchased
from public shareholders. The company&#8217;s board today approved
Disney&#8217;s proposal and UTV will seek permission from the
shareholders, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed delisting is subject to regulatory and
shareholders&#8217; approvals, Disney said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given the multiple stages and the nature of the process,
a successful outcome is uncertain,&#8221; Disney said. &#8220;In the event
Disney is successful in acquiring sufficient outstanding shares
of UTV to delist, Rohinton Screwvala, current CEO of UTV, will
sell his shares to Disney and become managing director of The
Walt Disney Company India.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg TV, owned by Bloomberg LP, is in a strategic
partnership with founders of UTV to operate Bloomberg UTV, a 24-
hour English language business and financial news network in
India. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Synthes Inc. (SYST), being bought by
Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) for $21.3 billion, sued a competing maker of
spinal-repair products, Globus Medical Inc., alleging
infringement of three U.S. patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synthes, a Swiss company based in West Chester,
Pennsylvania, contends Globus&#8217;s Independence, Coalition and
InterContinental Plate-spacer systems are using the protected
technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company &#8220;has suffered and will continue to suffer
damages and irreparable injuries&#8221; unless a court stops the
Globus infringement, Synthes lawyers said in papers filed July
22 in U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Delaware. Globus is
based in Audubon, Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson  Johnson agreed in April to buy Synthes in the
biggest purchase of the company&#8217;s 125-year history, to become
the leader in the $5.5 billion market for devices that treat
trauma victims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synthes has 50 percent of the market for sales of screws,
plates, bone grafts and other products to treat skeletal damage,
according to Navid Malik, an analyst with Matrix Corporate
Capital LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edward Joyce, a spokesman for Globus, didn&#8217;t immediately
return voice and e-mail messages seeking comment on the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Synthes USA v. Globus Medical Inc., 11-cv-652,
U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pronova, Teva Agree to Dismiss Patent Litigation in U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pronova BioPharma ASA and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc.
agreed to dismiss patent litigation in the U.S. District Court
in Delaware, according to a Pronova statement. Terms of the
agreement weren&#8217;t disclosed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit, filed in September 2010, is related to three of
Pronova&#8217;s U.S. patents pertaining oil purification. In dispute
were patents 7,732,488, 7,678,930 and 7,718,698. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lysaker, Norway-based Pronova said it still has another
patent-infringement dispute with Teva. That one is related to
Lovaza, its fish oil-based drug used to reduce triglycerides in
the blood. A ruling in that case is expected in the last quarter
of 2011, Pronova said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newly settled case against Teva is Pronova BioPharma
Norge AS v. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc., 1:10-cv-00800-SLR-
MPT, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IV Objects to Characterization of &#8216;Patent Troll on Steroids&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intellectual Ventures, the company founded by Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s former Chief Technology Officer Nathan Myhrvold,
objected its portrayal last week on the National Public Radio
program &#8220;This American Life.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The episode, titled &#8220;When Patents Attack,&#8221; looked at
patent litigation brought by patent-owning companies. At one
point Intellectual Ventures was characterized as a &#8220;patent
troll on steroids.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an e-mailed statement from Intellectual Ventures
spokeswoman Kasey Halmagyi, the Bellevue, Washington-based
company said it disagreed with what it said was the program&#8217;s
premise that patents have a negative effect on innovation. That
notion &#8220;flies in the face of centuries of evidence,&#8221; Halmagyi
said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point in the report, non-practicing entities --
companies that have patents, but do not produce products based
on those patents -- are characterized as being Mafia-like. IV
said in the statement that the program &#8220;uses some colorful and
dramatic devices&#8221; and that &#8220;some of the characterizations in
the piece are frankly absurd.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the people interviewed on the show were Peter N.
Detkin, who ran the IP litigation at Intel Corp. before he
became one of IV&#8217;s founders and vice chairman; John M. Demaris,
a former partner at Chicago&#8217;s Kirkland and Ellis and now the
owner of 4,000 patents he bought from Micron Technology Inc.;
and Michael C. Smith, a partner in Siebman, Burg, Phillips 
Smith LLP, who has litigated patent cases in Marshall, Texas on
behalf of both plaintiffs and defendants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith took &#8220;This American Life&#8221; reporters on a tour of an
office building near the courthouse in Marshall, Texas, that
houses many of the plaintiffs in cases tried in that court. He
called the building &#8220;ground zero&#8221; for companies that file
infringement suits and don&#8217;t make the products covered by their
patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the building was filled with empty offices that had
only a name plate on the door. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intellectual Ventures said in its statement that rather
than being a so-called troll, it provides &#8220;an efficient way for
patent holders to get paid for the inventions they own, and in
turn, for technology companies to gain easy access to the
invention rights they need now or may need as they enter new
markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intellectual Ventures completed a licensing agreement with
Chunghwa Picture Tubes (CGHD) Ltd., it said in a statement yesterday.
In addition to having access to 35,000 patents, the agreement
admits the Taoyan County, Taiwan-based company to what IV calls
its &#8220;IP for Defense&#8221; program, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program provides customers accused of patent
infringement &#8220;the ability to obtain patents from IV&#8217;s portfolio
to support counter-assertions, enabling more efficient
negotiations in order to reduce liabilities and achieve
favorable licensing terms,&#8221; according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myhrvold is a columnist for Bloomberg View, which is owned
by Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ogam Sues More than 40 Defendants in Texas Infringement Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ogam LLC, a company with a Longview, Texas address that
doesn&#8217;t appear to make any products, sued more than 40
defendants for infringing a patent for an image-display system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint filed July 21 in federal court
in Marshall, Texas, the defendants are accused of infringing
patent 5,825,427. The patent, which was issued in October 1998,
relates to the changed aspect ratio used in high-definition
television screens and other devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office&#8217;s online database of
patent assignments indicates that inventor Kenneth MacLeod of
Laguna Nigel, California, transferred the patent to Medici
Portfolio Acquisitions LLC in February 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medici transferred the patent to Ogam the same day,
according to the database. Medici and Ogam share the same
address. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint lists the model numbers of the various
television sets, digital picture frames, projectors and laptops
that allegedly infringe the patent. Among the manufacturers and
that were sued are 3M Co., Sony Corp. (6758), LG Electronics Inc., and
Toshiba Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ogam asked the court for money damages, attorney fees and
litigation costs. The company did not, as is often the case, ask
for a court order barring the manufacture or sale of the
allegedly infringing items. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Bloomberg data, Ogma has filed 22 patent-
infringement cases in the same court since Feb. 3, 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ogma is represented by Andrew W. Spangler of Spangler Law
PC of Longview, Texas, and James C. Otteson, David A. Caine,
Thomas T. Carmack and Xian Long of Agility IP Law of East Palo
Alto, California. All four lawyers from Agility previously
practiced at Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich  Rosati of Palo Alto. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Ogma LLC v. 3M Co (MMM), 2:11-cv-00328-TJW, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Texas (Marshall). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South African Brewery in Copyright Dispute With Games Company &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South African Breweries Ltd. is accused of copyright
infringement by a company that operates a system for interactive
team sports, South Africa&#8217;s Business Day reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boost Sports Africa claims the brewery&#8217;s &#8220;Be the Coach
Event&#8221; infringed its &#8220;Fan Challenge Sport,&#8221; which it said it
presented to the brewery on a confidential basis, according to
Business Day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sports group is seeking a licensing fee of 15 percent
of the revenue necessary to conduct the event, Business Day
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brewery said the concept underlying its event was
disclosed much earlier in a patent that predated the
presentation by Boost Sports Arica, according to Business Day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABC Sports Claims Pawlenty Campaign Ad Infringes Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s ABC Sports is claiming a television ad
promoting the presidential candidacy of former Minnesota
Governor Tim Pawlenty infringes its copyrights, the Boston Globe
Reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ad uses footage from the 1980 Olympics &#8220;Miracle on
Ice&#8221; hockey broadcast, according to the Globe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louise Argianas, director of rights and clearances for ABC
sports said the campaign would be receiving a cease-and-desist
letter, according to the Globe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pawlenty spokesman Alex Conant told the Globe that its
lawyers had checked the ad for compliance with copyright law and
that it &#8220;&#8216;fully complies with the fair-use doctrine.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sections of WHO Drug Guide Copied, Australian Publisher Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parts of a guide to pediatric drugs published by the World
Health Organization appear to have been copied from an
independently published guide for Australian doctors, The
Australian reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The publishers of the Australian Medicines Handbook sent a
letter to the WHO, a United Nations Agency, claiming that at
least 50 passages in the &#8220;WHO Model Formulary for Children&#8221;
are identical to those in the Australian book, according to the
Australian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical editors of the WHO publication told the Australian
there were &#8220;limited ways&#8221; in which the drug information could
be presented without deviating from the source material. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.N. health agency has told the Australian publishers
it will conduct a forensic comparison of the two publications,
according to The Australian. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brand Owners Can Buy XXX Web Addresses to Avoid Public Use &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies that would be too embarrassed with the new
&#8220;xxx&#8221; top level Internet domain names can buy their addresses
for between $200 and $300, the U.K.&#8217;s Telegraph newspaper
reported yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &#8220;sunrise&#8221; period in which brand owners can buy these
addresses before bidding is open to the public has been
extended, the Telegraph reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICM, the domain registry service selling the new &#8220;xxx&#8221;
domain names --  which are intended for adult-oriented content -
- told the Telegraph it has received about 900,000 inquiries
from those interested in acquiring an address with that domain
name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the creation of the XXX registry was originally
blocked by the Bush administration at the behest of conservative
Christian groups, ICM successfully appealed that decision and is
going ahead with the potential sales, according to the
Telegraph. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;White Rose&#8217; Infringer Will Send Profits to Military Charity &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trademark dispute between two rival breweries should have
been settled out of court and was the result of &#8220;Yorkshire
Pride,&#8221; a U.K. High Court judge said, and the BBC reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Samuel Smith Old Brewery in Tadcaster, North Yorkshire,
sued the Cropton Brewery of North Yorkshire, complaining about
the use of a white rose design on the label for its Yorkshire
Warrior beer, according to the BBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The white rose, a symbol of Yorkshire and registered by
Samuel Smith as a logo in the 1960s, was infringed by the
Cropton label, the high court ruled, and the BBC reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the court didn&#8217;t order damages, Cropton will
give its profits from the sale of Yorkshire Warrior to Samuel
Smith, which will donate the funds to a military charity, the
BBC reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LOCOG Trademark Policy Challenged by Plant-Display Company &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;InstaPlant, a U.K. company that uses computer technology to
create intricate plant displays, is challenging the London
Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games over
its trademark policies, Horticulture Week reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will offer two bedding displays featuring the
Olympic rings to anyone who can persuade the committee to back
down on its trademark rules, according to the publication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the committee told Horticulture Week that
it needed to make 2 billion English pounds ($3.26 billion) in
order to finance the games, and that InstaPlant was welcome to
try to become an official partner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Harnett, InstaPlant&#8217;s manager, said if the committee
doesn&#8217;t give someone permission to use the display, they &#8220;will
be left here to rot and that would be a shame,&#8221; according to
Horticulture Week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trade Secrets Law Invoked Over Medical-Device Price Comparison &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the public hospitals in Florida&#8217;s Broward County
would reveal the prices they paid manufacturers for pacemakers
and defibrillators, the Miami Herald reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hospitals claimed that Florida trade secrets laws
barred the release of that information, which was sought by the
Herald. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Annemarie Bridy of the University of Idaho, who
has written on the secrecy of cardiac-device prices, told the
Herald that hospitals&#8217; inability to compare prices &#8220;is driving
up the cost of healthcare for everyone.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Nexon, a spokesman for the Advanced Medical
Technology Association, said keeping the prices secret allows
manufacturers to offer discounts selectively in a &#8220;highly
competitive&#8221; marketplace, according to the Herald. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V), the world&#8217;s biggest
payments network, said fiscal third-quarter profit rose 40
percent, beating analyst estimates for the 14th straight period,
as consumers boosted credit-card spending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income for the three months ended June 30 climbed to $1
billion, or $1.43 a share, from $716 million, or 97 cents, in
the same period a year earlier, the San Francisco-based company
said today in a statement. Adjusted earnings per share, which
exclude the revaluation of the firm&#8217;s Visa Europe Ltd. put
option, was $1.26, three cents better than the average estimate
of 30 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Joseph W. Saunders  is
looking to expand abroad as new U.S. limits on debit-card swipe
fees charged to merchants threaten to crimp revenue growth at
home. Visa, which derived 59 percent of sales from the U.S. last
fiscal year, aims to generate more than half its revenue in
international markets by fiscal 2015, Saunders has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While the regulatory process generated headlines over the
past 13 months, the overwhelming majority of Visa&#8217;s revenues are
derived from products and geographies that are completely
untouched by these events,&#8221; Saunders, 65, said today during a
conference call with analysts and investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program
after buying back 13.7 million shares in the third quarter at an
average price of $77.36 for about $1.1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net revenue increased 14 percent to $2.32 billion, beating
analysts&#8217; estimates, as operating expenses rose 9.5 percent to
$977 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide Spending &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide spending on Visa debit and credit cards, adjusted
for currency fluctuations, climbed 13 percent from the same
period last year to $941 billion, the company said. Spending by
consumers outside their home countries surged 14 percent.
Processed transactions rose 11 percent to 13 billion. U.S.
credit-card purchases climbed 9.8 percent to $224 billion,
compared with a 5.9 percent rise in the same period last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa said in a July 6 regulatory filing that it expects
revenue growth for fiscal 2012 in the &#8220;high single-digit to low
double-digits range&#8221; -- down from a 2011 projection of 11
percent to 15 percent -- after the Federal Reserve capped debit
fees at about half of the current rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa and No. 2 network MasterCard Inc. (MA), based in Purchase,
New York, set swipe fees and pass the money to card issuers
including Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Grind Higher&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa climbed 34 cents to $88.09 at 5:32 p.m. in extended
New York trading. The shares have advanced 25 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Shares can continue to grind higher in the coming months
as investors get more comfortable with the post-regulatory
competitive environment,&#8221; JPMorgan analysts led by Tien-tsin Huang wrote in a July 25 research note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa&#8217;s net income was buoyed by a non-cash, non-operating
gain of $122 million related to the revaluation of the Visa
Europe put option, according to an investor presentation.
Excluding that, the company reported adjusted profit of $883
million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed last month limited debit interchange fees to 21
cents per swipe, while letting banks collect an additional 5
basis points of each transaction, or almost 2 cents based on the
average debit ticket of $38. The central bank conditionally
approved an additional 1-cent adjustment for banks that follow
certain fraud-prevention standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transaction Processing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule also requires card-issuers to give merchants the
choice of using at least two unaffiliated debit networks for
transaction processing, which will prevent networks from
negotiating exclusive deals with banks and threatens to erode
Visa&#8217;s lead in the U.S. Visa processed $1.05 trillion in U.S.
debit-card purchase transactions last year, more than triple
MasterCard&#8217;s $333 billion, company data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa handled 66 percent of 120.4 billion purchase
transactions worldwide last year, making it the largest payment
network, according to the Nilson Report, an industry newsletter.
MasterCard was second, with 25 percent, while Shanghai-based
China UnionPay Co. was third, with 4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Express Co. (AXP), which handled 3.9 percent of
worldwide purchase transactions and is also the biggest credit-
card issuer by purchases, reported a record $1.3 billion second-
quarter profit on July 20. MasterCard, based in Purchase, New
York, is set to report second-quarter results on Aug. 3. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geoff Lewis, Hong Kong-based head of
investment services at JP Morgan Asset Management, comments on
China&#8217;s effort to become a more consumption-driven economy and
the potential of shale gas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He made the comments today to reporters in Singapore: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;China we believe has made some reasonable progress toward
shifting its economy away from dependence on investment. In the
first half of 2011, consumption accounted for 48 percent of GDP
growth. That is up from 37 percent in the calendar of 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;China knows it is in its own best interest to move away
from export dependence at a relatively rapid rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They are doing more to remove their share of global
imbalances than you might say the U.S. administration with all
their checks and balances are achieving on the other side of the
Pacific. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think that it would be wrong to bet against Beijing at
this point.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On shale gas as an alternative energy: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Longer term, I think shale gas is going to offer an
alternative to oil for auto transport and heating purposes.
There is as much shale gas in Europe and there&#8217;s a ton of it in
Poland and it is a big changer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is going to reduce OPEC&#8217;s monopoly strength. It&#8217;s
going to reduce Russia&#8217;s bargaining power and it&#8217;s going to be a
lesson to smaller economies like Morocco, where you shouldn&#8217;t
put all your eggs into one basket as it depends 98 percent of
its exports on liquefied natural gas in Europe.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By James Paton" date="Jul 27, 2011  1:38 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-27/chevron-agrees-to-sell-wheatstone-lng-to-tokyo-electric-power.html"><headline>Chevron to Supply Tepco With Wheatstone LNG, May Sell Stake</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. energy company, agreed to sell Tokyo Electric Power Co. 3.1
million metric tons of liquefied natural gas annually from its
proposed Wheatstone project in Western Australia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fuel will be supplied for as long as 20 years, San
Ramon, California-based Chevron said in a statement today. The
oil and gas producer is also in talks to sell a stake in the
A$25 billion ($28 billion) venture to the Japanese utility known
as Tepco as part of the accord, Chevron said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a preliminary agreement signed in December 2009, Chevron
had said Tepco would buy 4.1 million tons of LNG a year and
purchase an 11.25 percent stake in Wheatstone. Colin Barnett,
premier of Western Australia, had at the time valued the fuel-
supply contract at A$90 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron calls the Wheatstone project and its A$43 billion
Gorgon LNG development in Australia the &#8220;centerpieces&#8221; of its
expansion plans. A final investment decision for Wheatstone
remains on schedule for 2011, it said today. The environment
regulator of Western Australia last month recommended approval
for the venture with &#8220;stringent conditions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron and Woodside Petroleum Ltd. are among suppliers of
Australian LNG that may benefit as countries put plans to build
nuclear reactors on hold after the March 11 earthquake and
tsunami crippled Tepco&#8217;s Fukushima Dai-Ichi atomic power plant,
analysts including Deutsche Bank AG&#8217;s John Hirjee have said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wheatstone Output &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wheatstone will initially produce 8.9 million tons of LNG a
year when it starts in 2016, Chevron said in March. The project
may eventually have as many as six units producing 25 million
tons of LNG annually, the company said last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), also a Gorgon partner, agreed
earlier this year to acquire an interest in Wheatstone. That
transaction left Chevron with 73.6 percent of the project and
gave The Hague-based Shell 6.4 percent. Apache Corp. has 13
percent and Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Co. 7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apache and Kuwait&#8217;s state-owned oil company agreed in 2009
to supply natural gas to Wheatstone in exchange for stakes in
the venture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron has initial agreements to sell Wheatstone LNG to
Kyushu Electric Power Co. and Korea Gas Corp. (036460) Kyushu also
intends to become a stakeholder, according to Chevron&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Yudith Ho and Chien Mi Wong" date="Jul 27, 2011  1:30 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-27/singaporean-investors-less-confident-about-outlook-jpmorgan-survey-shows.html"><headline>Singaporean Investors Less Confident About Outlook, JPMorgan Survey Shows</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Investor confidence in Singapore
fell on concern about the global economy, the debt crisis in
Europe and escalating debt debate in the U.S., according to a JP
Morgan Asset Management survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Singapore Investor Confidence Index Poll, designed to
reflect the outlook and behavior of experienced investors, fell
to 121 in the first half of 2011 from 134 in the second half of
last year, according to a statement handed out in Singapore
today. A number topping 100 on the index ranging from 0 to 200
indicates a positive outlook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This survey shows a dip in investor confidence, yet they
have been investing more in equities this year,&#8221; said Geoff Lewis, the Hong Kong-based head of investment services at JP
Morgan Asset Management. &#8220;The one takeaway I would like to
leave is that this is not the time for Singapore investors to
run away from the markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singapore&#8217;s economy shrank an annualized 7.8 percent in the
second quarter from the previous three months, the first decline
in three quarters, as manufacturing slumped, adding to evidence
the slowdowns in Europe and the U.S. are curbing growth in Asia.
The Government of Singapore Investment Corp., the nation&#8217;s
sovereign wealth fund, said yesterday the investment environment
is still challenging because of the uncertain recovery in
developed economies and inflation pressure in emerging markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Pare Investments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 502 investors who participated in the survey, 46
percent plan to invest more in next 6 months, compared with 60
percent in the previous survey, according to the statement. Of
the investors, who all have more than 5 years of continuous
investment experience and a minimum annual personal income of
S$60,000, 12 percent will pare down investment, compared with 6
percent in the last poll done at the end of 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decline in confidence is mainly the result of
macroeconomic events such as the Arab Spring, the U.S. and
European sovereign debt crisis and the Japan earthquake and
tsunami, said Brian Tan, the head of sales for JP Morgan Asset
Management&#8217;s retail business in Singapore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost half of the survey&#8217;s respondents said they will not
change their investment strategy while 18 percent will be more
conservative, compared with 10 percent in the December survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see a drop-off in terms of clients wanting to make
concentrated bets in certain areas, whether it&#8217;s an asset class
or a country,&#8221; Tan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflation Outlook &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fewer expect inflation to rise, with 38 percent
anticipating faster price increases, compared with 86 percent
previously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer prices in Singapore rose 5.2 percent last month,
the fastest pace since January, as food and housing costs
increased. Inflation may climb 4 percent to 5 percent this year,
higher than a previous forecast of 3 percent to 4 percent,
central bank Managing Director Ravi Menon said July 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city-state, which uses the exchange rate to manage
inflation, said in April it would allow further currency
appreciation, the third monetary tightening in a year. The
Singapore dollar has gained more than 13 percent against the U.S.
currency in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nation&#8217;s Straits Times Index (FSSTI) gained 7.4 percent in a
year as of yesterday, lagging behind the MSCI AC Asia Pacific
Index, which rose 18 percent in the same period. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. pulled its
&#8220;buy&#8221; rating on BMFBovespa SA (BVMF3), the operator of Latin
America&#8217;s biggest securities exchange, on concern a new
government tax on currency derivatives will erode trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BMF Bovespa fell 1.6 percent to 8.89 reais at 4:15 p.m. in
New York, the lowest since April 2009. That followed a 5.4
percent plunge yesterday sparked by the government&#8217;s creation of
a 1 percent tax on short dollar positions with a notional value
of more than $10 million in the futures market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s National Monetary Council, known as CMN, may
increase the derivatives tax up to 25 percent, according to the
government decree signed by President Dilma Rousseff. The
measure is the latest in a series of moves by Brazilian policy
makers to stem a 48 percent rally in the real since December
2008 that is crimping exporters&#8217; profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These measures are going to hurt the BMF,&#8221; Nathan Blanche, a partner and economist at Sao Paulo-based consulting
firm Tendencias Consultoria Integrada, said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;The most they can achieve is to drive these
operations to other markets, including Chicago.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of dollar future contracts traded on the BMF
Bovespa was 328,000 as of 4:22 p.m. New York time, according to
the exchange. Yesterday, a total of 374,766 contracts traded,
and 388,365 traded July 26. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Significant Threat&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While the details regarding how the CMN will use these
new powers are sparse, it represents significant threat for
government interference in the exchange&#8217;s operations, including
its ability to determine conditions for trades,&#8221; Goldman Sachs&#8217;
analysts including Carlos G. Macedo wrote. They cut the stock to
&#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;buy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil will begin collecting the new tax on bets against
the dollar in the country&#8217;s futures market on Oct. 5, according
to the Finance Ministry. Tax authorities need extra time to
develop a system for collecting the levy, the ministry said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian banks are hesitant to place new bets in the
dollar futures market because &#8220;they don&#8217;t know how this is
going to impact their positions,&#8221; said Mario Battistel, head of
currency trading at Fair Corretora de Cambio e Valores in Sao
Paulo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real fell 0.8 percent to 1.5678 per dollar after a 1.1
percent decline yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Light SA (LIGT3), Brazil&#8217;s second-biggest
electricity distributor, fell the most in more than two months
after having its recommendations cut at Banco BTG Pactual SA and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares dropped 2.5 percent to 28.19 reais at the close of
Sao Paulo trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time, the most since May
17. It was the second-worst performer on the Bovespa index. The
benchmark equity gauge rose 0.7 percent to 58,708.25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light was cut to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;buy&#8221; at Goldman Sachs
after it gained 14 percent this year through yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;From current levels we see less scope for the stock to
outperform,&#8221; Goldman Sachs&#8217;s analysts Francisco Navarrette and
Andre Gaeta wrote in a note to clients today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, a unit of Cia. Energetica de Minas Gerais, was
lowered to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;buy&#8221; at BTG Pactual. Light&#8217;s
higher leverage after the acquisition of Renova Energia SA may
limit dividend distribution for the next two years, analysts
including Antonio Junqueira wrote in a research note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light may issue 350 million reais ($224 million) of bonds
in the domestic market to finance the purchase of Renova
Energia, Chief Financial Officer Luiz Fernando Rolla said in an
interview July 11. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The heads of commercial mortgage
bond trading for Citigroup Inc. (C) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
have left the firms this week as the market is roiled by
sovereign debt crises and new deals are cut back or put on hold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warren Geiger left Citigroup, according to a statement
today from the New York-based lender. He joined from American
International Group Inc. in 2004, according to records from the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. His exit followed the
departure of Matthew Salem from Goldman Sachs, a person familiar
with the situation said earlier this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks were forced to pull a $1.5 billion commercial-
mortgage bond offering that had already been placed with
investors after Standard  Poor&#8217;s said yesterday it wouldn&#8217;t
rate the notes because of a discrepancy in how it graded the
transaction. SP&#8217;s decision came after investors pushed back on
deal terms and demanded higher yields on $3 billion of bonds
sold last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The CMBS market remains a challenge going forward and
we&#8217;re still at an early stage of the recovery,&#8221; said Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in New York in a
telephone interview. &#8220;The rating agencies are much more in
control than perhaps they were prior to the crisis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geiger&#8217;s departure is unrelated to the review by SP of its
ratings on the offering, Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a spokeswoman
for Citigroup, said today in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;The
suggestion that it is related is totally false,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planned Sale &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on commercial mortgage bonds have risen as investors
pull back amid a rush of offerings. Deutsche Bank AG and UBS AG
cut a planned sale of commercial-mortgage backed securities by
more than 36 percent to $1.4 billion, according to people
familiar with the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs, Citigroup deal won&#8217;t close as planned
because SP is reviewing its criteria for commercial mortgage-
backed securities and can&#8217;t provide a rating, the banks said in
a joint statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ratings company won&#8217;t give debt grades to any new
transactions that are based on certain criteria, New York-based
SP said in a separate statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ratings are a condition precedent to closing and
settlement,&#8221; Goldman Sachs and Citigroup said in their
statement. &#8220;Standard  Poor&#8217;s had previously informed Goldman
and Citi that they were prepared to rate&#8221; the transaction, they
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP Review &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP &#8220;is reviewing the application of our conduit/fusion
CMBS criteria in relation to the calculation of debt service
coverage ratios,&#8221; the risk assessor said in its statement dated
yesterday. &#8217;&#8217;The review was prompted by the discovery of
potentially conflicting methods of calculation.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks had overhauled the transaction after investors
demanded more protection from losses amid concern that ratings
from SP and Morningstar Inc. didn&#8217;t accurately reflect the
risks, people familiar with the matter said last week. They
placed the securities totaling $1.5 billion with investors last
week, according to people familiar with the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Citigroup boosted the buffer that
protects AAA securities from loan defaults by increasing the
amount of lower-ranked debt that is first to absorb losses, the
people said. The so-called credit enhancement on the highest-
graded debt was raised to 20 percent from 14.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peaked in 2007 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to hold the top-ranked
portion of bonds backed by commercial mortgages has risen 5
basis points to 214 basis points over Treasuries since June,
according to Barclays Capital data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than $21 billion of commercial-mortgage bonds have
been sold this year, compared with $11.5 billion in all of 2010,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales of the debt
peaked at $234 billion in 2007, helping fuel a boom in property
prices. Issuance plummeted to $12.2 billion in 2008 as souring
subprime-home loans infected credit markets. The market stayed
closed until November 2009, choking off funding to borrowers
with debt coming due. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) reported lower-
than-estimated second-quarter profit as production growth lagged
analysts&#8217; forecasts and refining earnings outside the U.S.
declined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per-share profit was 16 cents less than than the $2.34 a
share forecast, based on the average estimate of 18 analysts in
a Bloomberg survey. Net income rose 41 percent to $10.68
billion, or $2.18 a share, from $7.56 billion, or $1.60, a year
earlier, the Irving, Texas-based company said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon said second-quarter revenue climbed 36 percent from a
year earlier to about $125.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-U.S. refining earnings fell 20 percent from a year
earlier to about $622 million. Oil and natural-gas production in
the quarter rose 10 percent to about 4.4 million barrels of oil
equivalent a day, less than the 12 percent growth expected by
Philip Weiss, an analyst at Argus Research in New York. Exxon&#8217;s
gas output in Europe tumbled 18 percent and the company relied
on last year&#8217;s purchase of XTO Energy to boost U.S. gas
production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The earnings improvement is not as strong as some of its
peers, relative to last year,&#8221; said Brian Youngberg, an analyst
at Edward Jones in St. Louis who has a &#8220;hold&#8221; rating on Exxon
shares and owns none. &#8220;Part of that is attributable to the XTO
acquisition, which increases Exxon&#8217;s reliance on North American
natural-gas prices, which have remained weak compared to oil.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) plans to send out
information on its infant-nutrition unit to potential bidders in
September, kicking off an auction that may fetch as much as
$10.5 billion, said people with knowledge of the process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestle SA, Danone SA (BN) and Abbott (ABT) Laboratories have spoken to
financial advisers about the business, and are likely to bid,
said the people, who declined to be identified because the talks
are private. Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. (MJN) and Unilever, the
second-biggest consumer-goods company, may also examine offers,
they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A successful bidder would gain operations with sales
approaching $2 billion annually and baby-formula brands
including SMA Gold and Promil Gold. If Pfizer fails to fetch the
price it&#8217;s seeking for the infant-nutrition unit, it could spin
out the business into a separate company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The iron is definitely hot, and Pfizer would like to
strike,&#8221; said Damien Conover, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. in
Chicago, in a telephone interview. &#8220;There are some synergies
that these folks could have that would outbid what the market
would pay for the unit&#8221; as a standalone spinoff, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possible buyers are currently studying the industry to
assess its size and growth potential, said one of the people.
They are also working to determine how much rivals would want to
pay, the person said. Potential bidders and financial advisers
have been preparing for a sale after Pfizer said in February
that it was reviewing its businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer rose 6 cents, or less than 1 percent, to $19.36 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has
gained 29 percent in the past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Emerging Markets &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formula unit has generated interest because it serves
emerging markets like Asia, and because the products don&#8217;t vary
much region to region, unlike most consumer goods, said the
people. Because there are multiple competitors in those markets,
it&#8217;s unlikely that antitrust legislation would get in the way of
a deal, Conover said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our decisions on strategic alternatives will continue to
be driven by what creates the best after-tax value to our
shareholders,&#8221; Joan Campion, a spokeswoman for Pfizer, said in
a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen at Nestle, Danone, Abbott, Unilever and Mead
Johnson declined to comment on potential bids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Biggest Deal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pfizer sale would be the largest of a vitamin or
nutrition company in more than a decade, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The biggest deal in that sector was
Carlyle Group&#8217;s $3.8 billion acquisition of vitamin maker NBTY
Inc. last year, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestle (NESN) had 8.06 billion Swiss francs ($10 billion) in cash
and near-cash items as of Dec. 31, according to company filings.
Danone had 1.05 billion euros ($1.51 billion), while Abbott had
$3.65 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer acquired the infant-nutrition division in its $68
billion takeover of Wyeth less than two years ago. The unit may
fetch 16 times to 20 times earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization, estimated at $500 million to $525
million for 2010, people familiar with the situation said. That
would indicate a value of $8 billion to $10.5 billion, and the
price could be higher depending on this year&#8217;s performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit is forecast to have Ebitda of $550 million to $575
million on sales of about $2 billion for 2011, one person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By comparison, Mead Johnson trades at about 18.9 times last
year&#8217;s Ebitda of $776.8 million. Claudia Lenz, an analyst at
Bank Vontobel AG in Zurich, said Mead should have a higher
valuation than the Pfizer unit because Mead has better operating
margins and is more focused on the U.S., a key infant-formula
market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shedding Assets &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s nutrition business, which also makes vitamins for
pregnant women, accounted for about 3 percent of its $67.8
billion in total sales last year. Pfizer this month disclosed
plans to shed that operation, as well as the animal health
division, following a review of its businesses not tied to drug
discovery. The New York-based drugmaker is facing the loss of
exclusivity for its biggest product, the cholesterol pill
Lipitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. is advising on the animal health
business, while Morgan Stanley and Centerview Partners are
working on the nutrition unit, according to a statement from
Pfizer on July 7. JPMorgan also is seeking a role in advising a
potential suitor for the nutrition business, the people said.
Financial advisers are trying to get mandates to work with the
four likeliest bidders, especially Nestle and Danone, said the
people. Tasha Pelio, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two Teams &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be two teams of advisers from Morgan Stanley and
Centerview running the infant-nutrition process, one focused on
the sale of the unit and the other on a potential spin of it
into a separate company, said one of the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley and Centerview advisers have spent months
putting together stand-alone financial data on the infant-nutrition business while also assessing what companies could bid
and what antitrust issues companies such as Vevey, Switzerland-based Nestle could have, said one of the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said earlier this month that it doesn&#8217;t anticipate
making announcements about options for the assets until sometime
next year, and that any deal could take as long as two years to
complete. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s senior
executives view a potential downgrade of the U.S.&#8217;s credit
rating as &#8220;manageable,&#8221; Citigroup Inc. (C) said in a note to
investors today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup analysts led by Keith Horowitz wrote that they
met yesterday with Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer David A. Viniar, Co-Head of Securities Harvey M. Schwartz, and Co-Head
of Investment Banking David M. Solomon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Management noted that they have run through various
scenarios and implied the risk of a U.S. debt downgrade seems
manageable, with the important caveat that there is always the
possibility of more severe knock-on effects,&#8221; the note said.
New York-based Goldman Sachs &#8220;noted that collateral agreements
related to Treasuries are not dependent on Treasury ratings.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street firms including Goldman Sachs, the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, are preparing for a potential
downgrade of the nation&#8217;s AAA rating if politicians are unable
to agree on a plan to raise the debt ceiling and reduce the
budget deficit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks and other financial companies frequently use U.S.
Treasuries as collateral for loans in so-called repurchase-
agreements, or repos, and the prospect of a downgrade has raised
questions about whether such loans would become more expensive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs &#8220;has seen relatively limited reaction in
fixed-income markets and some negative moves in equities, which
reinforces the belief that the impacts are more likely to be
short-term as investors are not questioning the ability of the
U.S. government to actually repay their debt,&#8221; the note said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rules governing money-market fund investments in Treasuries
aren&#8217;t typically tied to credit ratings, according to the note.
If a fixed-income fund is required to maintain a minimum average
credit rating, they&#8217;re more likely to sell lower-rated debt,
such as bonds rated BBB or lower, to rebalance the portfolio,
the note said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stock-index futures erased
gains as Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) slumped after its earnings trailed
analysts&#8217; estimates and investor attention remained fixated on
Washington before a House vote on the debt ceiling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures on the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index were little
changed at 1,298.7 at 8:04 a.m. in New York. Dow Jones
Industrial Average futures retreated 1 point, or less than 0.1
percent, to 12,243 after climbing 0.5 percent earlier. Exxon
Mobil slipped 1.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) and Chevron
Corp. (CVX) are examining plans to expand the Malampaya natural-gas
project in the Philippines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partners are negotiating the second and third phases of
the project, which started pumping gas in 2001 to supply fuel
for power generation at the Batangas plant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They plan to &#8220;maximize the country&#8217;s clean energy
resources&#8221; supply, Shell&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer Peter Voser
told reporters on a conference call today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field, located in the province of Palawan, holds an
estimated 2.7 trillion cubic feet of gas. The partners, which
include the state-owned PNOC Exploration Corp. (PECB), may invest as
much as $1.5 billion in the hunt for more reserves, Energy
Secretary Rene Almendras said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Dakin Campbell" date="Jul 28, 2011 12:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-28/visa-profit-beats-estimates-as-credit-card-spending-increases.html"><headline>Visa Profit Beats Estimates as Credit-Card Spending Increases</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V), the world&#8217;s biggest
payments network, said fiscal third-quarter profit rose 40
percent, beating analyst estimates, as consumers boosted credit-
card spending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income for the three months ended June 30 climbed to $1
billion, or $1.43 a share, from $716 million, or 97 cents, in
the same period a year earlier, the San Francisco-based company
said yesterday in a statement. Adjusted earnings per share,
which exclude the revaluation of the firm&#8217;s Visa Europe Ltd. put
option, were $1.26, or 3 cents better than the average estimate
of 30 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Joseph W. Saunders is
looking to expand abroad as new U.S. limits on debit-card swipe
fees charged to merchants threaten to crimp revenue growth at
home. Visa, which got about 59 percent of sales from the U.S.
last fiscal year, aims to generate more than half its revenue in
international markets by fiscal 2015, Saunders has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While the regulatory process generated headlines over the
past 13 months, the overwhelming majority of Visa&#8217;s revenues are
derived from products and geographies that are completely
untouched by these events,&#8221; Saunders, 65, said during a
conference call with analysts and investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program
after spending about $1.1 billion in the third quarter to buy
back 13.7 million shares at an average price of $77.36. Revenue
increased 14 percent to $2.32 billion, beating analysts&#8217;
estimates, as operating expenses rose 9.5 percent to $977
million, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit, Debit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide spending on Visa credit and debit cards, adjusted
for currency fluctuations, climbed 13 percent from the same
period last year to $941 billion, the company said. Cross-border
volume, a measure of spending by consumers outside their home
countries, surged 14 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Processed transactions worldwide rose 11 percent to 13
billion as consumers continue to shift from cash and checks to
electronic payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. credit-card purchases climbed 9.8 percent to $224
billion, compared with a 5.9 percent rise in the same period
last year. Spending on debit cards in the U.S. advanced 11
percent to $295 billion, slower than the 21 percent expansion
Visa reported for the fiscal third quarter of 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said in a July 6 regulatory filing that it
expects revenue growth for fiscal 2012 in the &#8220;high single-
digit to low double-digits range&#8221; -- down from a 2011
projection of 11 percent to 15 percent -- after the Federal
Reserve capped debit fees at about half of the current rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Financial Impact&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa will bear &#8220;the majority of the financial impact&#8221; of
the new regulations in fiscal 2012, Saunders said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa and No. 2 network MasterCard Inc. (MA), based in Purchase,
New York, set swipe fees and pass the money to card issuers
including Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa has advanced 25 percent this year, closing at $87.75
yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. MasterCard, which is
set to report second-quarter results on Aug. 3, has climbed 35
percent in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Shares can continue to grind higher in the coming months
as investors get more comfortable with the post-regulatory
competitive environment,&#8221; JPMorgan analysts led by Tien-tsin Huang wrote in a July 25 research note. Huang has an
&#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on Visa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income was buoyed by a non-cash, non-operating gain of
$122 million related to the revaluation of the Visa Europe put
option, according to an investor presentation. Excluding that,
the company reported adjusted profit of $883 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Formula &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed last month limited debit fees to 21 cents per swipe
and will let issuers tack on 5 basis points of each transaction,
or almost 2 cents based on the average debit ticket of $38. The
central bank conditionally approved a 1-cent adjustment for
lenders that follow certain fraud-prevention standards. The new
fees are set to take effect Oct. 1, replacing a formula that
averages 1.14 percent of the purchase price, or about 44 cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new rule also requires card-issuers to give merchants
the choice of at least two unaffiliated debit networks for
transaction processing, which will prevent networks from
negotiating exclusive deals with banks and threatens to erode
Visa&#8217;s lead in the U.S. Visa processed $1.05 trillion in U.S.
debit-card purchase transactions last year, more than triple
MasterCard&#8217;s $333 billion, company data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa handled 66 percent of 120.4 billion purchase
transactions worldwide in 2010, making it the largest payments
network, according to the Nilson Report, an industry newsletter.
MasterCard was second, with 25 percent, and Shanghai-based China
UnionPay Co. was third, with 4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Express Co. (AXP), which handled 3.9 percent of
worldwide purchase transactions and is also the biggest credit-
card issuer by purchases, reported a record $1.3 billion second-
quarter profit on July 20. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors suing Bank of America
Corp. (BAC) and more than a dozen other underwriters to force the
buyback of $6.7 billion in downgraded mortgage securities have
defeated efforts by the banks in pretrial skirmishes to throw
out the cases or move them from state courts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Washington state judge in Seattle said in rulings over
the past two months that Bank of America, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) and other underwriters can&#8217;t cite faulty data from
appraisers or expired statutes of limitation to avoid Federal
Home Loan Bank of Seattle&#8217;s claims that there was false
information in offering documents for at least $3.9 billion in
securities it bought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America tried unsuccessfully today to persuade a
California state court judge that the statue of limitations had
expired on claims in a lawsuit seeking to make underwriters
repurchase $19 billion in mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the judge&#8217;s tentative ruling becomes final, it may open
the door for investors to access internal bank files and e-mails
about the loans in the pre-trial exchange of evidence,
strengthening their bargaining position in any settlement talks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At each milestone it puts additional pressure on the
defendant to settle,&#8221; said Isaac Gradman, an attorney and

securities consulting firm in Petaluma, California, that advises
clients on legal and contractual matters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Public Awareness&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nine securities dealers sued by the Federal Home Loan
Bank of San Francisco asked Judge Richard Kramer today to
dismiss the case. They said the home loan bank waited too long
to sue, should have heeded &#8220;public awareness&#8221; of the risks of
mortgage-backed securities and was warned in the offering
documents about potential problems with loan performance,
according to court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statute of limitations for seeking buybacks is two
years from when the bank knew or should have known about the
alleged false statements, Kramer said. The securities at issue
in the case date back to 2006. The lawsuit was filed last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The home loan bank, a sophisticated and central player in
the mortgage business, would &#8220;have had to be more than deaf,
dumb and blind&#8221; not to have known back in 2007 about the
problems with residential loans, said Stephen Hibbard, an
attorney for Bank of America, at today&#8217;s hearing in San
Francisco. &#8220;The information was out there in the world, and
this sophisticated plaintiff should have known.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statute of Limitations &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kramer, in his tentative ruling, rejected arguments by Bank
of America and other underwriters that the statute of
limitations under California law had passed. The Federal Home
Loan Bank will drop its federal securities-law claims if Kramer
adopts his tentative ruling that the bank waited too long to sue
under federal law, said David Grais, the bank&#8217;s attorney, at
today&#8217;s hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kramer hasn&#8217;t ruled on the underwriters&#8217; requests for
dismissal on other grounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Home Loan Banks of Seattle, San Francisco,
Pittsburgh, Chicago and Indianapolis, as well as companies
including Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW) and Allstate Insurance Co., are
pursuing lawsuits in state courts across the country under each
state&#8217;s so-called blue sky investor protection laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term blue sky came from the words of a judge in the
early 1900s who referred to speculative schemes backed by
nothing more than so many feet of &#8220;blue sky,&#8221; according to the
North American Securities Administrators Association website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue Sky &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the blue-sky laws, plaintiffs don&#8217;t have to prove
that there was a fraud committed, only that the defendants made
untrue statements, unlike in federal securities cases where it
must be shown that defendants knew their actions were
fraudulent, said Grais, a lawyer at Grais  Ellsworth in New
York who represents some of the home loan banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The burden of proof is less in the state cases,&#8221; said
William Black, law and economics professor at University of
Missouri and former litigation director at the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board, explaining why investors favor the venue over
federal courts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black said state court plaintiffs stand a better chance of
getting a judge who isn&#8217;t &#8220;hostile to the notion that someone
in a nice suit made a false representation selling securities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Halldin, a spokesman for Charlotte, North Carolina-
based Bank of America, declined to comment on today&#8217;s tentative
rulings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases take aim at investment banks that played a
central role in securitizing pools of home loans that were sold
to investors during the housing bubble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Quality &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In securitizations, a large number of loans are grouped
into a pool and sold to a trust which raises money for the
purchase by selling bonds, or certificates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underwriters purchase certificates from the trust and
sell them to investors. They gather statistics and data about
the loans&#8217; credit quality to include in documents filed with
regulators when the securities are offered for sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cash flow from the loans in the pool is the source of
funds to pay the holders of the certificates. Loans backing
these certificates that went into default were a key part of the
financial crisis in 2008 that helped send the U.S. into the
biggest recession since the 1930s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In more than a dozen cases filed in state courts since
2009, investors have alleged that the offering documents
prepared by the underwriters contained false or misleading
information about the loans, such as how much equity borrowers
had in their homes, the appraised value of the home and the
criteria used by lenders to decide whether borrowers should get
loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countrywide, IndyMac &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loans were originated or acquired by Countrywide
Financial Corp., IndyMac Bank, GreenPoint Mortgage Funding Inc.,
National City Mortgage and others, according to the complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countrywide, based in Calabasas, California, was once the
biggest U.S. residential home lender, originating or purchasing
about $1.4 trillion in mortgages from 2005 to 2007. The bulk of
them were sold to investors as mortgage-backed securities. Bank
of America acquired Countrywide in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuits are separate from group, or class-action,
cases pending in federal courts where some institutional
investors may have to settle for less than 1 percent of what
they initially sought because judges have scaled back or
dismissed claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state cases also aren&#8217;t covered by an $8.5 billion
settlement announced June 29 between Bank of America and 22
institutional investors in Countrywide mortgage-backed
securities. That accord, if approved, will resolve investors&#8217;
claims that Countrywide was required under contract to
repurchase loans that didn&#8217;t meet its underwriting guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cases Continue &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state court cases would continue under the terms of the
proposed settlement, Grais said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of Federal Home Loan Banks, including some that are
suing in state court, have said that Countrywide investors may
be owed more than three times what is offered in the
$8.5 billion settlement, according to a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underwriters moved the state cases to federal court,
claiming that the lawsuits shouldn&#8217;t be heard in state courts
because some of the loans involved were made by companies in
bankruptcy, according to court filings. Federal judges rejected
the argument and sent almost all the cases back to state courts,
according to court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judges in Seattle and Pittsburgh have refused to throw out
two of more than a dozen cases pending around the country
seeking buybacks of as much as $32 billion in securities. The
amount at stake in the Pittsburgh case is $2.8 billion. Motions
to dismiss in other cases are pending or haven&#8217;t yet been filed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Ratings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle, in one of 11
lawsuits it filed in Washington&#8217;s King County Superior Court
against underwriters, claimed that New York-based Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s offering documents made false representations about more
than half of the loans in a 2,793-loan pool that it bought in
2007 for $105 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The security, originally given the highest credit ratings
by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and Standard  Poor&#8217;s, has been
downgraded to junk status, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs claimed that the lawsuit should be dismissed
because it can&#8217;t be sued over statements in the offering
documents that came from other parties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington&#8217;s investor protection law holds underwriters
strictly liable for materially untrue or misleading statements,
&#8220;regardless of the ultimate source of those statements,&#8221; Judge
Laura Inveen said in a July 19 order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grais said the next phase of the case would be to seek
internal documents from the underwriters to learn what they knew
about the loans involved in the securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco case is Federal Home Loan Bank of San
Francisco v. Credit Suisse, CGC-10-497840, California Superior
Court, San Francisco County. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) must pay $70 million
for infringing an Alcatel-Lucent patent used in versions of
Microsoft&#8217;s Outlook program and two other applications, a
federal jury in San Diego said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcatel-Lucent, France&#8217;s largest maker of
telecommunications equipment, asked for as much as $75 million
in damages. Microsoft&#8217;s lawyers asked jurors to limit the award
to $5 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology, called the &#8220;Day patent,&#8221; was described in
court during the as involving a touch-screen form entry.
Microsoft argued it&#8217;s simply a &#8220;date-picker&#8221; function and
isn&#8217;t used with e-mail, the most popular function on Outlook.
Paris-based Alcatel-Lucent described the technology as a tool
that &#8220;plays a central role in the entire operation&#8221; of
Outlook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Alcatel-Lucent is obviously pleased with the verdict and
the jury&#8217;s recognition in the value of the Day patent that
Microsoft infringed,&#8221; Luke Dauchot, a lawyer for Alcatel-Lucent,
said after the verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A different jury in San Diego in 2008 found that Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft had infringed the patent and awarded
$358 million in damages. An appeals court, upholding the
infringement verdict, overturned the damages award, finding the
calculation lacked sufficient evidentiary support. The case was
sent back for retrial on damages only. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Genuine Apportionment&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to maintain that current law requires a
genuine apportionment of damages when the infringement is
directed to a small feature of a feature-rich product,&#8221; David Howard, Microsoft&#8217;s deputy general counsel, said in an e-mail
today. &#8220;We are reviewing the verdict in that light and
considering next steps.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dauchot told the jury in his closing argument the patent
was &#8220;pervasive in the affected programs and helped provide &#8220;an
easy, fast, reliable way of using Outlook.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He told jurors Outlook wouldn&#8217;t have been as popular
without the patent&#8217;s technology and that &#8220;Microsoft&#8217;s own survey
showed that Outlook is the most frequently used Microsoft Office
application by consumers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft attorney Juanita Brooks told jurors that Alcatel-
Lucent is trying to win money for a patent that is of little
significance to Microsoft because the company&#8217;s patent portfolio
was not making enough money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Lucent Technologies Inc. v. Gateway Inc., 07-
cv-2000 U.S. District Court, Southern District of California
(San Diego). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Joe Carroll" date="Jul 29, 2011  4:40 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-29/chevron-s-second-quarter-profit-increases-on-crude-rally.html"><headline>Chevron&#8217;s Second-Quarter Profit Hits Record on Crude Rally</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) said net income
climbed 43 percent to a second-quarter record as rising energy
demand and the Libyan civil war drove crude above $125 a barrel
for the first time in 2 1/2 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher crude prices triggered contractual clauses in some
nations that reduced the company&#8217;s share of output, pushing
Chevron&#8217;s worldwide production down 1.9 percent to the
equivalent of 2.69 million barrels of crude a day. The full-year
output estimate was lowered by 2.2 percent today to 2.73 million
barrels a day, due in part to the crude rally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron fell $1.01 to $104.02 at 4:22 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. Crude futures traded in New
York dropped by $1.74 to $95.70 a barrel, dragging down an index
of 13 oil companies by about 1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income for the second quarter rose to $7.73 billion, or
$3.85 a share, from $5.41 billion, or $2.70, a year earlier, San
Ramon, California-based Chevron said today in a statement. The
result was 23 cents higher than the average estimate from six
analysts in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit from oil and natural-gas sales jumped 51 percent to
$6.87 billion as the price Chevron received for each barrel of
output outside the U.S. rose to $107 from $71 a year earlier,
the statement said. With 74 percent of its oil output located in
countries other than the U.S., Chevron was able to capitalize on
the premium price for London-traded Brent oil, which increased
at five times the pace of U.S. crude prices this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global Demand &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Their international assets and oil fields really carried
the day,&#8221; said Gianna Bern, founder of Chicago-based Brookshire
Advisory  Research. &#8220;They have a lot of higher-priced Brent
barrels, and that&#8217;s what propelled these impressive results.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales rose 31 percent to $66.7 billion. Chevron had $13.3
billion in cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, according to
the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide demand for crude-based fuels such as diesel and
gasoline jumped by 740,000 barrels a day during the second
quarter, according to the International Energy Agency in Paris.
In Libya, home to Africa&#8217;s largest oil reserves, crude output
has tumbled 91 percent since the beginning of the year amid an
uprising against Muammar Qaddafi, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perdido Startup &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s full-year production estimate assumes an average
oil price of $111 a barrel, Vice Chairman George Kirkland sad
today during a conference call with investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the impact of price-sensitive production-
sharing contracts, the output target was reduced because of the
shutdown of a gas pipeline in Thailand and slower-than-expected
startup at the Perdido platform in the Gulf of Mexico, in which
Chevron holds a stake, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s refineries earned $1.04 billion during the
second quarter, a 7.1 percent increase, according to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron plans to spend $26 billion this year to drill for
oil, build gas-export terminals and repair refineries. Chief
Executive Officer John Watson has been trimming refining and
retail holdings to focus on higher-profit ventures such as deep-
water exploration in places such as the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), based in Irving, Texas, is the largest
U.S. oil company. Exxon yesterday reported a 41 percent rise in
net income for the second quarter, to $10.7 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG), facing a growing threat
of intellectual-property lawsuits, acquired a batch of patents
this month from International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) to bolster
its portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on July 11 and 12
recorded more than 1,000 patents assigned to Mountain View,
California-based Google by IBM. They cover a range of topics,
including microprocessing chips, regional databases and memory
fabrication and architecture, said Bill Slawski, president of
SEO by the Sea Inc., a Warrenton, Virginia-based research firm
specializing in search-engine optimization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Like many tech companies, at times we&#8217;ll acquire patents
that are relevant to our business,&#8221; Google said yesterday in an
e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Andrews, an IBM spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google&#8217;s Android mobile-operating system has been targeted
in at least six legal complaints, increasing its need for
intellectual property to defend the company against litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Among this collection of patents, there may be something
that can help Google in these lawsuits,&#8221; Slawski said in an
interview today. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t hurt to have a big patent
portfolio these days.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Vulnerable &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, the world&#8217;s largest Internet search company, aims
to curb abuses of the patent system. It&#8217;s calling on Congress
and the Federal Trade Commission to rein in lawsuits, and asking
the Patent and Trademark Office to take closer looks at patents
being used in litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The tech industry has a significant problem,&#8221; Google
General Counsel Kent Walker said in an interview earlier this
week. &#8220;Software patents are kind of gumming up the works of
innovation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google&#8217;s rivals have said the company is critical of the
patent system because it has few patents of its own and entered
a smartphone market where companies had been researching and
selling products for years before Android phones went on sale in
2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Android system is a free, open-source program that
relies on some nonproprietary features Google didn&#8217;t create and
allows outside developers to modify the code. That has left the
company vulnerable to claims that it built Android on the backs
of research done by other technology companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Fruit of Efforts&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The patent is the fruit of a company&#8217;s efforts,&#8221; Slawski
said. &#8220;It says you&#8217;ve given yourself a chance to develop
technology and then actually do something with it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, which had $39.1 billion in cash and short-term
investments as of June, put in an initial $900 million offer in
April to buy the patents of bankrupt phone-equipment maker
Nortel Networks Corp. It was outbid by a group that includes
Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), and Research In Motion Ltd., which
all make devices that compete with Android phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google fell $7.25, or 1.2 percent, to $603.69 at 4 p.m. New
York Time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have
climbed 1.6 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first youth baseball team from
Africa to advance to the Little League World Series has been
denied visas to enter the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of State said the Uganda team&#8217;s
documentation contained discrepancies and informed officials at
Little League headquarters in South Williamsport, Pennsylvania,
that their decision was final, league spokesman Steve Barr said
in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State Department spokesman Mark Toner said today at his
daily news briefing that denying the visas was &#8220;a very
difficult situation, but our consular officials are committed to
holding up U.S. law.&#8221; He said he couldn&#8217;t discuss individual
cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I can assure you that consular officers examined each of
these individuals and accorded them every consideration under
the law,&#8221; Toner said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toner said each player&#8217;s application was examined
individually and they were each interviewed. He said he didn&#8217;t
believe that consulate officials were concerned the Ugandan
players would try to stay after their visas expired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rev. John Foundation Little League team from Kampala,
Uganda, won the Middle East and Africa regional tournament with
a 6-4 win over the Arabian American Little League team from
Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, on July 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is unfortunate, as we were very much looking forward
to welcoming the first African team to the Little League
Baseball World Series,&#8221; Stephen D. Keener, president of Little
League Baseball and Softball, said in a statement. &#8220;We are
going to have to take a few days to evaluate all our options,
and decide how best to move forward.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Series begins in South Williamsport on Aug. 18

&lt;p&gt;Spotify, the European music-
streaming service that started in the U.S. two weeks ago, is
already getting a taste of the U.S. legal system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PacketVideo Corp. sued the company for patent infringement
July 27 in federal court in San Diego. PacketVideo sued Spotify
last month in the Netherlands over a European patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint, PacketVideo produces software
employed in media applications including those used for music
and video. According to the complaint, the company&#8217;s software
&#8220;is currently embedded in more than 260 million devices
worldwide and more than 320 different products.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Technology Officer Osama Al-Shaykh said in an
interview yesterday that PacketVideo acquired the patents in
2007 as part of its acquisition of Basel, Switzerland-based SDC
AG and waited to sue because &#8220;it took us a while to do our
homework before we strongly believed that there is an
infringement on our patents.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the company hopes the case can be settled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alison Bonny, a spokeswoman for Spotify, said by e-mail
that Spotify uses its own proprietary technology. &#8220;Spotify is
strongly contesting PacketVideo&#8217;s claim,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frederick Lorig, Steven Anderson and Christopher Mathews,
partners in the Los Angeles office of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart 
Sullivan, represent PacketVideo. Bonny declined to say who was
representing Spotify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is PacketVideo Corp. v. Spotify USA Inc., 11-cv-
1659, U.S. District Court, Southern District of California (San
Diego). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patents &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcatel Lawyer Calls Microsoft&#8217;s Infringement &#8216;Pervasive&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) engaged in infringement of an Alcatel-
Lucent patent that is &#8220;pervasive&#8221; in the software maker&#8217;s
Outlook program, said a lawyer for France&#8217;s largest
telecommunications equipment maker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It really is pervasive in Outlook, particularly in
Calendar,&#8221; Alcatel-Lucent lawyer Luke Dauchot told a jury in
federal court in San Diego in his closing argument yesterday. He
said the &#8220;Day patent,&#8221; as it was described during the trial,
&#8220;provided an easy, fast, reliable way of using Outlook.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dauchot said the technology also was infringed in
Microsoft&#8217;s Money and Personal PC applications. He told jurors
Outlook wouldn&#8217;t have been as popular without the patented
technology and that &#8220;Microsoft&#8217;s own survey showed that Outlook
is the most frequently used Microsoft Office application by
consumers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juanita Brooks, an attorney for Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft, told jurors that Paris-based Alcatel-Lucent is trying
sued over a patent that is of little significance to Microsoft
because the French company&#8217;s patent portfolio was not making
enough money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re trying to get tens of millions of dollars for a
feature that is one of tens of thousands in Outlook,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A different jury in San Diego federal court in 2008 found
that Microsoft had infringed the patent and awarded $358 million
in damages. While upholding the verdict, an appeals court
overturned the damages award, finding the calculation lacked
sufficient evidentiary support, and sent it back for retrial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s biggest software maker, had argued
on appeal that the damages were too high because the invention
is one of many features within a product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent involves a form entry that Redmond, Washington-
based Microsoft said is simply a &#8220;date-picker&#8221; function that
isn&#8217;t utilized with e-mail, the most popular function in
Outlook. Alcatel-Lucent described the technology as a pop-up

operation&#8221; of Outlook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Lucent Technologies Inc. v Gateway Inc., 07-cv-
2000 U.S. District Court, Southern District of California (San
Diego). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTC Didn&#8217;t Infringe FlashPoint Imaging Patents, Judge Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTC Corp. (2498), Asia&#8217;s second-biggest maker of smartphones,
didn&#8217;t infringe digital-imaging patents owned by closely held
licensing company FlashPoint Technology Inc., a U.S.
International Trade Commission judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FlashPoint failed to show HTC violated its patent rights
for imaging devices used in mobile phones, commission Judge Paul Luckern said in a notice posted on the agency&#8217;s website
yesterday. LG Electronics Inc., Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) and Research In Motion
Ltd. (RIM), which had also been targeted, settled with Peterborough,
New Hampshire-based FlashPoint before the judge could rule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision -- pending review by the full six-member
commission -- clears one of the cases HTC is involved in at the
ITC as companies including Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics
Co. use their patents to try to beat back competition in the
expanding smartphone market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTC, which makes phones such as the Droid Incredible and
EVO 4G that use Google Inc.&#8217;s Android operating system, said two
weeks ago that it was found to have infringed two Apple patents,
a ruling the company is appealing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Intellectual property plays an increasingly important
role in the development and implementation of new technologies,
and HTC has placed highest priority in IP protection,&#8221; Grace Lei, general counsel for Taoyuan, Taiwan-based HTC, said in a
statement yesterday about the FlashPoint case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute centered on technology related to the way
digital cameras operate, including focus and flash settings, and
automatic rotation of the image depending on how the camera is
held, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FlashPoint, whose founders include former employees of
Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s imaging business, said it developed its own digital
operating system for cameras, and ceased research in 2007 to
focus on licensing its patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies that license FlashPoint patents include Eastman
Kodak Co. (EK), Samsung Electronics, Hewlett-Packard Co., Nikon Corp.
and Apple, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ITC is quasi-judicial U.S. agency in Washington that
arbitrates trade disputes and has the power to block imports of
products found to infringe U.S. patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTC agreed this month to pay $300 million for S3 Graphics
Inc. after an ITC judge in a third case found that Apple&#8217;s
operating system for Mac computers infringed two S3 patents for
graphics technology. The operating system for the iPhone, iPad
and iPod touch didn&#8217;t use the S3 inventions, the judge said. HTC
also has a case against Apple at the commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In the Matter of Certain Electronic Imaging
Devices, Complaint 337-726, U.S. International Trade Commission
(Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LG Files ITC Complaint Against Siemens&#8217;s Osram Unit Over LEDs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LG Electronics Inc. (066570), accused last month of infringing
Siemens AG (SIE)&#8217;s patents for light-emitting diode technology, filed
a U.S. International Trade Commission complaint of its own on
July 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case targets Munich-based Siemens&#8217;s Osram unit and
involves similar LED technology, according to a notice posted on
the ITC&#8217;s website. While a copy of the complaint filed by Seoul-
based LG wasn&#8217;t immediately available, companies in these cases
typically seek to block U.S. imports of products they say
infringe patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute is over technology used in LED displays for TV
sets and monitors that require less energy than traditional
lighting. Osram last month filed complaints at the ITC and in
federal courts against LG and Samsung Electronics Co. over LEDs.
Samsung responded with its own ITC case against Osram, and LG
had submitted a complaint with the Korea Trade Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are well prepared,&#8221; Stefan Schmidt, a spokesman for
Osram, said about LG&#8217;s complaint in an e-mail. &#8220;Osram holds
around 8,000 LED-related patents globally and has a longstanding
tradition in handling patent rights.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ITC typically completes its investigations in 15 to 18
months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new case is In the Matter of Certain Light-Emitting
Diodes, Complaint No. 2837, U.S. International Trade Commission
(Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hollywood Studios Win U.K. Case Against BT Over Piracy Site &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News Corp. (NWSA)&#8217;s Twentieth Century Fox and five other Hollywood
film studios won a U.K. ruling forcing BT Group Plc, Britain&#8217;s
biggest Internet-service provider, to block access to a website
that promotes online piracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judgment in London yesterday is the first of its kind
and the studios said it could be used to obtain similar orders.
Fox, Universal Studios, Warner Bros., Viacom Inc.&#8217;s Paramount
Pictures and Sony Corp. (6758)&#8217;s Columbia Pictures were backed in the
case by the Motion Picture Association of America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling &#8220;is a victory for millions of people working in
the U.K. creative industries and demonstrates that the law of
the land must apply online,&#8221; Chris Marcich, a regional managing
director for the film association, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website, known as Newzbin, liquidated after losing a
related U.K. lawsuit last year, only to resurface with more than
700,000 members, the studios&#8217; lawyers said. They argued BT and
other ISPs must block the site altogether to prevent
infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;BT has actual knowledge of other persons using its
service to infringe copyright,&#8221; Judge Richard Arnold said in
the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While BT said it agreed Newzbin&#8217;s activities were illegal,
it argued that a court injunction would be inappropriate,
because the website isn&#8217;t a customer of the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is how you test the law,&#8221; BT spokesman Simon Milner
said outside court yesterday. The judgment &#8220;sets a helpful
precedent showing that you have to get a court order and prove
significant infringement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fox convinced a U.K. court in March 2010 that Newzbin
infringed its copyrights. The website went into liquidation to
avoid damages and has been revived as &#8220;Newzbin 2,&#8221; the movie
studios claimed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The judgment sends a clear signal that ISPs have a role
to play in protecting their customers from rogue websites that
exploit and profit from creative work without permission,&#8221; said
Geoff Taylor, chief executive officer of the British Recorded
Music Industry trade group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Incredible Hulk&#8217; Copyright Belongs to Marvel, Judge Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s Marvel Entertainment owns the rights to
the Incredible Hulk and X-Men comic-book characters, a federal
judge said, ruling against the heirs of the superheroes&#8217; co-
creator Jack Kirby. Stan Lee, who worked for Marvel as an
editor, is credited as co-author of the Hulk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The children of the late cartoonist didn&#8217;t have the legal
right to terminate the comic-book publisher&#8217;s copyrights for the
characters, U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in Manhattan
said yesterday in a court order. Marvel said it owned the rights
because Kirby was an employee of the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This case is not about whether Jack Kirby or Stan Lee is
the real &#8216;creator&#8217; of Marvel characters,&#8221; McMahon said in her
order. &#8220;It is about whether Kirby&#8217;s work qualifies as work-for-
hire under the Copyright Act of 1909.&#8221; The Kirby works &#8220;were
indeed works for hire,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision affects the rights to the characters in movies
as well as comic books. The 2008 Marvel-produced film &#8220;The
Incredible Hulk&#8221; grossed $263.4 million worldwide, according to
boxofficemojo.com. Burbank, California-based Disney bought
Marvel last year for $4.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, Kirby&#8217;s adult children sent 45 notices to Marvel
to terminate license renewals for the characters in comics
published from 1958 to 1963. Marvel sued in January 2010,
seeking a judgment that the termination notices were invalid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc Toberoff, a lawyer representing the Kirbys, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to messages seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirby, who died in 1994, also created or co-created the
Fantastic Four and the Avengers. His heirs said their father was
a freelance artist paid by the page who received no benefits
from Marvel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Marvel Worldwide Inc. v. Kirby, 10-00141, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trade Secrets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-HP Executive Sued by Former Employer Says Evidence False &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawyer for a former Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) sales executive
accused of stealing secret information, filed a letter in court
saying the evidence used against his client was &#8220;false and
fabricated.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adrian Jones, who left Hewlett-Packard to join Oracle Corp. (ORCL)
in February, was accused of downloading company information to
an external hard drive. In the letter, filed June 10 in
California state court, Jones said the drive was used by
Hewlett-Packard to do a backup and was never in his possession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard and Oracle are increasingly competing in
the market for server computers. Hewlett-Packard ousted Chief
Executive Officer Mark Hurd in August 2010, saying he had tried
to cover up a relationship with a marketing contractor. Hurd, a
friend of Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, joined Oracle as a co-
president. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The central allegation in HP&#8217;s employment lawsuit against
Adrian Jones has turned out to be complete fiction,&#8221; said
Deborah Hellinger, a spokeswoman for Redwood City, California-
based Oracle. &#8220;If they did it knowingly, then HP and their
lawyers should be sanctioned. If they did it mistakenly, then
they simply owe Mr. Jones an apology.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard said yesterday that Jones did store secret
company information, even if it wasn&#8217;t on that hard drive. He
returned other devices with sensitive files to the company, said
Michael Thacker, a spokesman for Palo Alto, California-based
Hewlett-Packard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Regardless of the device, Adrian Jones said he had no
confidential information,&#8221; Thacker said. &#8220;But he did, and he
had returned it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jones worked at Hewlett-Packard as a senior vice president
in its enterprise hardware group based in Tokyo, where he
oversaw the unit&#8217;s sales in Asia. He began seeking a job outside
Hewlett-Packard in the fall of 2010, according to the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, the company began a probe of Jones. Hewlett-
Packard said its investigation found he failed to disclose a
close personal relationship with a subordinate, arranged a pay
raise of about 97 percent for her and expensed travel to
Australia to see her with no legitimate business purpose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard asked for Jones&#8217;s additional computers,
including his home computer in Tokyo, an iPhone and his
girlfriend&#8217;s iPad, according to the letter. Jones received the
job offer from Oracle Feb. 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, Hewlett-Packard filed a separate lawsuit against
Oracle, claiming that the company went from partner to &#8220;bitter
antagonist&#8221; and had breached its contract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed June 15 in state court in San Jose,
California, cited Oracle&#8217;s hiring of Hurd and Oracle&#8217;s March
announcement that it would cease software development for
Hewlett-Packard servers that use Intel Corp.&#8217;s Itanium chip.
Oracle also has used &#8220;strong-arm tactics&#8221; in forcing customers
to &#8220;shift from HP&#8217;s Itanium server hardware to Oracle&#8217;s own
server hardware,&#8221; the suit said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That suit, which also cites libel claims, followed Hewlett-
Packard&#8217;s June 8 letter to Oracle demanding that the software
maker keep supporting the Intel chip, reiterating its concern
that the move will hurt customers and trammel competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Jones, 1-11-cv-198103,
California Superior Court, Santa Clara County. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCW Accuses Gundlach of Secret Plot to Steal &#8216;Entire Business&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for TCW Group Inc. told a jury yesterday that
former investment chief Jeffrey Gundlach plotted with colleagues
to steal the company&#8217;s trade secrets before he was fired and
started a rival money-management firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They tried to steal an entire business from TCW worth
hundreds of millions of dollars,&#8221; TCW lawyer John Quinn said in
his opening statement yesterday at a state court trial in Los
Angeles. &#8220;They secretly plotted to leave en masse.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCW, the Los Angeles-based unit of Societe Generale (GLE) SA,
sued Gundlach, 51, and three other ex-employees in January 2010,
a month after he was fired and more than half of TCW&#8217;s fixed-
income professionals had joined his firm, DoubleLine Capital LP.
TCW seeks $375 million in damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gundlach, who had worked at TCW for 25 years and who was
named Morningstar&#8217;s Fixed Income Manager of the Year in 2006,
said in a cross-complaint that TCW fired him to avoid having to
pay as much as $1.25 billion in future management and
performance fees for the funds his group managed. Gundlach has
since reduced his damages estimate to about $500 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DoubleLine&#8217;s lawyer, Brad Brian, said in his opening
statement yesterday that Societe Generale wanted to maximize its
investment in TCW and &#8220;they were not going to let Mr. Gundlach
stand in their way.&#8221; The company discussed terminating Gundlach
in August 2009, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While TCW knew it would lose business by firing Gundlach,
the company did it anyway because the lost business would be
compensated by reducing what was owed to him, Brian said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian also said Gundlach and the others didn&#8217;t use any
proprietary TCW information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial may have undesirable consequences for both sides,
said Geoff Bobroff, an independent fund consultant in East
Greenwich, Rhode Island. Gundlach, who has attracted $13 billion
in assets since his firm opened, may see damage to his
reputation, while TCW Group risks the disclosure of its inner
workings and details such as fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Trust Co. of the West v. Gundlach, BC429385,
California Superior Court, Los Angeles County. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comings and Goings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Litigator Leaving to Join Perkins Coie &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google&#8217;s head litigator, Timothy Alger, is leaving the
company to join the Palo Alto, California, office of Perkins
Coie. In a statement on its website, the firm said Alger would
become a partner in its litigation practice, focusing on new and
traditional media among other matters. According to the
statement, Alger had worked at Google since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lansdowne Partners Ltd., a London-
based hedge fund, sold its $850 million stake in Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS), the Sunday Telegraph reported, without saying where
it got the information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision was based partly on reduced proprietary
trading at Goldman Sachs stemming from regulation in the U.S.,
the newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lansdowne was among the top 20 investors in Goldman Sachs,
and the stake made up almost 10 percent of the hedge fund&#8217;s $10
billion under management, according to the Sunday Telegraph. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time Lansdowne sold shares of Goldman Sachs was
before the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008,
the paper said. &lt;/p&gt;
