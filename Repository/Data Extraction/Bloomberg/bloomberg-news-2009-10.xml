<p>U.S. coal producers led by Walter (WLT)
Energy Inc. surged after Alcoa Inc. reported better-than-estimated earnings, sparking optimism that coal demand will rise
as the economy recovers. </p>
<p>Walter, a southern Appalachian coal producer, jumped $4.04,
or 7.2 percent, to $59.99 at 12:31 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU), the largest
U.S. coal company, gained $1.26, or 3.2 percent, to $40.29. Arch
Coal Inc. (ACI), the second largest, rose 57 cents, or 2.5 percent, to
$23.40. </p>
<p>The group has had a lot of strength in the past week,
said Pearce Hammond, an analyst at Simmons  Co. in Houston.
The raw economic data is a large contributor. Of course Alcoa
is a material company and that is contributing to the
strength. </p>
<p>Patriot Coal Corp., the fourth-largest eastern U.S. coal
producer, added 46 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $12.78. Consol
Energy Corp. (CNX), the fourth-largest U.S. coal company, climbed
$2.34, or 4.9 percent, to $49.84. Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR),

$39.26. Massey Energy Corp., the fifth-biggest, gained $1.14, or
