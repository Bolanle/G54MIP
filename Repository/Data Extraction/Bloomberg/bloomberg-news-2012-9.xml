&lt;p&gt;Qatar National Bank SAQ (QNBK) has hired
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) to advise on its planned acquisition of a
majority stake in Societe Generale SA (GLE)&#8217;s Egyptian unit, Reuters
reported, citing sources it didn&#8217;t identify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Societe Generale, which owns 77.2 percent of Egypt&#8217;s
National Societe Generale Bank SAE (NSGB), is being advised by Morgan
Stanley (MS) on the sale, the newswire said, citing the sources. A

&lt;p&gt;Carlyle Group LP (CG), the world&#8217;s
second-largest private equity firm, and its partners hired
Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) to advise on
selling a stake in Turkish hospital chain Medical Park Saglik
Hizmetleri AS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares may be sold via a block sale or through an
initial public offering, Istanbul-based Medical Park said in an
emailed statement today. Proceeds will be used to finance new
projects, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical Park, which owns 16 hospitals and employs 10,000
people in Turkey, announced a plan on Aug. 16 to invest $300
million in four hospitals under the name Liv Hospital Group in
Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir over three years. The first of the
hospitals will be opened at the end of this year, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlyle, which has more than $156 billion in assets under
management globally, bought 40 percent of Medical Park in 2009
for $150 million. Turkish businessman Muharrem Usta, chairman of
the company, and Sancak AS of Turkey each hold a 30 percent
stake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Penti Stake &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlyle is one of three shortlisted potential buyers for a
minority stake in Turkish hosiery and swimwear maker Penti Corap
Sanayi  Ticaret AS, Kerim Kotan, managing director of sell-side
adviser Pragma Corporate Finance, said in an interview on Aug.
6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We want to complete the 30-percent stake sale in one or
two weeks,&#8221; Sami Kariyo, chairman and a major stakeholder at
Penti, said in a telephone interview today, declining to
identify the leading contender in the process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlyle bought 48 percent of Istanbul-based education group
Bahcesehir Kolejleri for an undisclosed price, it said in
January. The buyout firm also acquired 50 percent of TVK Gemi
Yapim Sanayii AS, a Turkish shipbuilder, in 2008. Carlyle may
have one or two acquisitions in the country this year, Can Deldag, co-head of the firm&#8217;s operations in Turkey, Middle East
and the Gulf, said on Feb. 16. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lung drug from Boehringer
Ingelheim GmbH and Pfizer Inc. (PFE) helped delay severe episodes in
asthma patients, researchers said today in two studies that may
result in broader use of the medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spiriva, known chemically as tiotropium and delivered by
the Respimat Soft Mist inhaler, cut the risk of a severe flare-
up by 21 percent when given in addition to standard treatments,
according to a company-sponsored study presented today at the
European Respiratory Society&#8217;s meeting in Vienna. The research
was published simultaneously in the New England Journal of
Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A standard treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, or COPD, Spiriva has been on the market for a decade
and had 3.15 billion euros ($3.96 billion) in sales last year.
Today&#8217;s results were a &#8220;valuable but intermediate step&#8221; toward
using drugs like Spiriva safely in asthma patients, Elisabeth
Bel, a pulmonologist at the Academic Medical Center in
Amsterdam, wrote in an editorial published alongside the trial
results today in the NEJM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A word of caution seems appropriate,&#8221; Bel wrote, adding
that the medicine may be risky for patients with a history of
heart problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Asthma Potential &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treating asthma may boost sales significantly for drugs
like Spiriva, including those from GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) and
Novartis AG (NOVN), Sam Fazeli, a London-based analyst for Bloomberg
Industries, wrote in a May report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Safety over longer time periods is the key question,&#8221;
Fazeli wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A review of five studies published last year in the British
Medical Journal found the use of Spiriva in mist form was
associated with a 52 percent increase in mortality risk.
Boehringer has said data from those trials is already
&#8220;appropriately reflected&#8221; in Spiriva&#8217;s label. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No patients died during the trials published today, and
adverse events were similar in patients who got the drug and
those who didn&#8217;t, the investigators wrote. The two identical
studies excluded people with unstable heart disease. They
divided a total of 912 patients into groups that got inhaled
steroid hormones and long-acting beta-agonists and groups that
took tiotropium alongside the other two types of drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Already Prescribing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m already prescribing tiotropium as an add-on therapy
to my patients,&#8221; said Richard Russell, one of the study&#8217;s U.K.-
based investigators and consultant chest physician at Wexham
Park Hospital. Still, &#8220;if people have a history of cardiac
disease and cardiac arrhythmia, I do not give them Spiriva using
a Respimat device.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results are important because tiotropium helped people
who were already getting drugs in high doses, and still had
flare-ups, said Huib Kerstjens, a professor at the University of
Groningen in the Netherlands and one of the study&#8217;s authors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;And still in this population where we have a problem, we
could reduce these exacerbations,&#8221; Kerstjens said. &#8220;That&#8217;s
meaningful to patients.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before the study, Kerstjens had prescribed tiotropium
off-label for asthma, he told reporters in Vienna today. The
next step is to see if tiotropium works in patients with more
moderate asthma, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boehringer is conducting a total of 11 final-stage clinical
trials on tiotropium in asthma, Jennifer Haddon, the Ingelheim,
Germany-based company&#8217;s respiratory medicine adviser, said in a
telephone interview. Haddon declined to give details on how soon
Boehringer might request regulatory approval to sell tiotropium
in asthma or on its sales potential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closely held Boehringer markets Spiriva for COPD patients
together with New York-based Pfizer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, won U.S. regulatory approval of its treatment for one
of the four most common types of leukemia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration cleared the drug, to be
known as Bosulif, for adults with previously treated chronic
myeloid leukemia who also have an abnormality known as the
Philadelphia chromosome, the New York-based company said today
in a statement. There are expected to be about 5,400 new cases
and 610 deaths from the blood cancer this year, according to the
American Cancer Society in Atlanta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bosulif will compete with Novartis AG (NOVN)&#8217;s Tasigna and
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY)&#8217;s Sprycel. Pfizer&#8217;s treatment is
expected to generate $171 million in sales in 2015, according to
the average estimate of six analysts compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Bosulif is an important new addition to the CML treatment
landscape,&#8221; Jorge Cortes, a professor of medicine at the
University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, and a lead
investigator of the Pfizer-sponsored study on the drug, said in
the company&#8217;s statement. &#8220;Despite recent advances, an unmet
need remains.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treatment is improving based on a better understanding of
the molecular basis of the disease, Richard Pazdur,&#160;director of
the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in the FDA&#8217;s
Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement
from the agency. The FDA designated Bosulif as an orphan drug,
meaning it treats a disease that affects fewer than 200,000
people. Bosulif is chemically known as bosutinib. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s Drugs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Pfizer&#8217;s third oncology drug approved in the past
13 months, preceded by Xalkori for lung cancer and Inlyta for
advanced kidney cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic myeloid leukemia produces an excess of white blood
cells. The disease is one of the four main types of leukemia and
accounts for 15 percent of all leukemia worldwide, according to
Pfizer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novartis&#8217;s Tasigna generated $716 million in sales last
year and Sprycel by Bristol-Myers, based in New York, made $803
million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gleevec, from Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis, is the
most-popular initial treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia with
$4.7 billion in sales last year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ariad Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ARIA), based in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, asked the FDA to review its chronic myeloid
leukemia drug ponatinib in July. Ariad said in a July 30
statement that it expects approval in the first quarter of 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ariad is seeking accelerated approval in patients with
resistant or intolerant chronic myeloid leukemia based on the
second of three phases of trials typically required for approval
on the condition the company proves ponatinib&#8217;s benefit in later
studies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uche Orji, the former Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) and UBS AG (UBSN) banker named to lead Nigeria&#8217;s sovereign
wealth fund, plans to make spending on local infrastructure a
key aim after local lawmakers opposed the fund&#8217;s creation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a crucial cornerstone of the mandate of the fund,&#8221;
Orji, 42, who also worked at JP Morgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and most
recently spent almost 16 years in the U.S. and Europe, said last
week in a telephone interview from New York. &#8220;This is not
saving money for savings sake, this is about impacting the lives
of people in a way that will be very fundamental for the future
of Nigeria.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigeria, Africa&#8217;s top oil producer and most populous
country, imports gasoline because of a lack of refining
capacity. Power cuts are a daily occurrence and cost the country
at least 3 percentage points of gross domestic product growth
annually, the Bureau of Public Enterprises said in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigeria&#8217;s 36 state governors challenged the creation of the
fund in a lawsuit at the Supreme Court, saying it violated a
constitutional requirement that all government revenue must be
shared among federal, state and local governments. They later
agreed to back plans to appoint the wealth fund&#8217;s board, while
planning to almost double the amount in the excess crude
account, which the wealth fund was originally to replace, to $10
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Expected Bargaining &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s &#8220;inevitable that there would be always be some
bargaining around it, but I don&#8217;t think we should assume that
this is going to be the case forever,&#8221; Gary van Staden, a
politcal analyst at NKC Independent Economists, said by phone
today from Johannesburg. &#8220;They&#8217;ve made agreements to get it off
the ground and then they&#8217;re going to be able to claw back some
of the concessions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orji was named head of the Nigerian Sovereign Wealth
Investment Authority, as the fund will be known, on Aug. 28. He
will have a first term of five years, Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said, and will work from Abuja. Nigeria&#8217;s crude
production of about 2.2 million barrels a day accounts for 95
percent of foreign income and 80 percent of government revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigeria&#8217;s sovereign wealth law requires the creation of
funds for infrastructure, the future generation and budget
stabilization, with each representing at least 20 percent of the
total. Savings through the fund will enable the West African
nation to build its infrastructure and also provide a buffer
against volatility in oil prices, Okonjo-Iweala said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Crucial Institution &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a crucial institution for the country and I think
it&#8217;s important that it went through a robust debate,&#8221; said
Orji. &#8220;Our country is making progress, it might not be visible
to people, but we&#8217;re building foundations and institutions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigeria&#8217;s economic growth accelerated to 6.6 percent in the
second quarter, from 6.2 percent in the previous three months,
the Central Bank of Nigeria said in a report yesterday. The
country has the capacity to generate about 4,000 megawatts of
power, about a tenth of South Africa&#8217;s installed base, with a
population that&#8217;s three times bigger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigeria is among the last members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries to set up a wealth fund, as it
battles to reduce corruption and safeguard cash generated from
crude production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund, signed into law by President Goodluck Jonathan in
May 2011, aims to replicate the long-term growth of funds such
as the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Orji said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overseas Acquisitions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m actually very close to many of the sovereign wealth
funds in the Middle East; I&#8217;ve known many of them for many years
and I&#8217;ve watched them grow,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It takes time for a
fund to build and get invested and contribute, but you have to
start somewhere.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates and home to
about 7 percent of the world&#8217;s proven oil reserves, set up its
wealth fund in 1976 to diversify its sources of income by
investing globally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wealth fund, known as ADIA, doesn&#8217;t invest in the
U.A.E. or typically in the Gulf Arab region, and had assets
valued at $328 billion at the end of 2008, according to the New
York-based Council on Foreign Relations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sovereign wealth funds such the Qatar Investment Authority
are boosting overseas acquisitions as oil prices hover near $100
a barrel. The country has taken a 12 percent stake in Swiss
miner Xstrata Plc (XTA) and last month bought a 22 percent stake in
Chinese private equity firm Citic Capital Holdings Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;ve run money and been part of a portfolio management
team and this isn&#8217;t any different,&#8221; Orji said, without giving
more details on plans. &#8220;All Nigerians must support it because
the signal it sends to the international community is huge.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) released a new
version of Windows for running corporate networks, trying to
take share from VMware Inc. (VMW) and gain ground as companies seek to
cut the cost of managing business programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows Server 2012 improves features for virtualization,
which allows companies to cut costs by using fewer server
computers in their data centers. More businesses are relying on
virtualization technology amid the shift to so-called cloud
computing, where information is managed and stored remotely,
rather than on local software and hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new program has already won over customers such as
Equifax Inc. (EFX) and Bank of Montreal, which tried out early
versions of the product, said Satya Nadella, president of
Microsoft&#8217;s server and tools division, in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker, wants to
boost sales of Windows Server by getting customers to set up so-
called private clouds, which are accessed from within a
corporate network, rather than the wider Internet. Forrester
Research Inc. forecasts spending on private clouds will top $20
billion in sales next year, allowing companies to get the
benefits of running applications on large pools of servers and
storage machines while keeping programs secure on their own
servers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They have to go into hand-to-hand combat with strong
competitors,&#8221; said Al Gillen, an analyst at IDC. &#8220;VMware is
very, very well established and has a very strong platform.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VMware rolled out its latest offering last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Competitive Offering &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft doesn&#8217;t break out annual sales of Windows Server,
which market research firm IDC estimated at more than $5 billion
in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Included in Windows Server is a program called a
hypervisor, a piece of software that lets companies run multiple
operating systems on a single server, helping cut costs. Many
customers will stick with their current hypervisor vendor when
setting up private clouds, Gillen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s a disadvantage for Microsoft, which had 26 percent
of the hypervisor market last year, compared to VMware&#8217;s 58
percent, according to IDC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the issue is that for years Microsoft didn&#8217;t have a
competitive hypervisor offering, so even companies using
Microsoft products for things such as e-mail and internal
company websites chose VMware when they wanted to use
virtualization software on fewer servers, Nadella said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Good Enough &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Microsoft is trying to get those customers back and
attract new ones, Nadella said. One such company is window-maker
Pella Corp., which mostly uses Microsoft programs yet chose
VMware for virtualization software in 2004. The company, which
plans to deploy Windows Server 2012, will save hundreds of
thousands of dollars in the costs of licensing the software
compared with what Pella paid VMware, Nadella said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The refrain was &#8216;hey we are good enough,&#8217;&#8221; Nadella said
about Microsoft&#8217;s previous appeal to VMware customers. &#8220;For the
first time we can claim we are better.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VMware executives said they&#8217;ve heard that before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is not a new strategy for Microsoft,&#8221; said former
VMware Chief Executive Officer Paul Maritz, in an interview on
Aug. 27. A former Microsoft executive until 2000, Maritz left
VMware on Sept. 1 to become chief strategist at EMC Corp. (EMC), which
owns 79 percent of VMware. &#8220;This is the third or fourth time
they&#8217;re coming to market saying, &#8216;Our product is now good
enough.&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equifax, which provides credit reports, is using Windows
Server 2012 to handle the data that enables lenders to verify
the employment status of people applying for credit or buying a
home. Next, the company will probably start using Windows Server
hypervisor software for virtualized networks and the company
plans to turn to Microsoft to build its first private cloud,
said Equifax&#8217;s Chief Technology Officer Bryan Garcia in an
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This one is really data center quality,&#8221; Garcia said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Akamai Technologies Inc. (AKAM)&#8217;s patent
claims over online content delivery networks against Limelight
Networks Inc. (LLNW) were revived by an appeals court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in
Washington ordered a lower court to reconsider whether Limelight
infringed the Akamai patent. In a related decision issued Aug.
31, the court reinstated claims McKesson Corp. (MCK) made against
closely held Epic Systems Corp. on a patent for a method of
communication between doctors and their patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue in both cases was whether a company can be liable
for infringing patents when various parties carry out parts of
an innovation. The ruling will affect disputes over software,
financial systems and medical diagnostic testing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Circuit, sitting with all active judges, heard
the Akamai and McKesson cases on the same day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Akamai case initially focused on whether Limelight
could be found liable for direct infringement when it didn&#8217;t use
all the steps. Instead, the majority said it wouldn&#8217;t address
that issue and ruled on whether Limelight could lose the case if
it were found to have encouraged others to use the invention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circuit Judge Richard Linn, in his dissent, said the
majority was extending patent law beyond what Congress and the
Supreme Court have&#160;allowed when it comes to indirect
infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Francisco-based McKesson sued Epic over its MyChart
software program, which is sold to hospitals and medical groups.
Health-care providers use the software to give patients a way to
access their records as well as scheduling and treatment
information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal judge rejected McKesson&#8217;s infringement claim,
saying that Epic didn&#8217;t perform all the steps covered by the
patent, nor did it control others to perform all of the steps.
McKesson&#8217;s patent 6,757,898 is for a method for a health-care
provider and patient to communicate with each other
automatically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Akamai Technologies v. Limelight Networks,
2009-1372, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
(Washington). The lower court case is Akamai Technologies v.
Limelight Networks Inc., 06cv11109, U.S. District Court,
District of Massachusetts (Boston). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The McKesson case is McKesson Technologies Inc. v. Epic
Systems Corp., 2010-1291, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit. The lower court case is McKesson Information Solutions
LLC v. Epic Systems Corp., 06cv2965, U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Georgia (Atlanta). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apple Sued by Alcatel-Lucent Trust Over Video-Compression Patent &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL) was sued by a trust associated with France&#8217;s
Alcatel-Lucent SA (ALU) over accusations it infringed a patent for
video-compression technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Apple&#8217;s products, including but not limited to the iPhone
4S, iPad 2 and the &#8216;new iPad&#8217; by virtue of the manner in which
they encode video, infringe one or more claims&#8221; of the patent,
Multimedia Patent Trust said in a complaint filed Aug. 29 in
federal court in San Diego. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trust seeks unspecified damages and a court order
stopping the alleged infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcatel-Lucent, based in Paris, set up the patent trust on
Nov. 28, 2006, two days before Alcatel&#8217;s purchase of Lucent
Technologies Inc. The trust previously sued Walt Disney Co. (DIS) and
DirecTV (DTV), among other companies, over video-compression patents.
Apple is also a defendant in a separate infringement case
brought in 2010 by Multimedia Patent Trust in San Diego. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristin Huguet, a spokeswoman for Cupertino, California-
based Apple, declined to comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Multimedia Patent Trust v. Apple, 12-02135,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of California (San
Diego.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Disney, DC Comics, Sanrio Sue Party-Entertainment Store &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Walt Disney Co. sued a Southern California provider of
birthday-party entertainment for trademark and copyright
infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-plaintiffs with Disney are Tokyo&#8217;s Sanrio Co. (8136), which is
famous for its Hello Kitty character, and Time Warner Inc.&#8217;s DC
Comics unit. The suit, filed Aug. 27 in federal court in Los
Angeles, claims Party Animals LLC of Marina Del Rey, California,
infringes intellectual property associated with licensed
characters belonging to the three companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Party Animals is accused of infringing by its distribution,
sale or rental of character costumers and related merchandise.
Among the characters claimed to be infringed are Mickey and
Minnie Mouse, Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Pluto, Goofy,
Hello Kitty and Dear Daniel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Party Animals website lists &#8220;look alike characters&#8221;
that include a &#8220;Green Guy,&#8221; &#8220;Princess Aurora,&#8221;
&#8220;Superheroes,&#8221; and a &#8220;Brown Dog.&#8221; According to a statement
on the company&#8217;s website, &#8220;Look-a-like characters are not
officially licensed. We do not use or have copyrighted or
licensed material, costumes or names.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owners of the licensed characters say they are harmed
by the actions of the party company, and asked for court orders
barring further infringement. Additionally they asked that the
company be required to surrender for destruction all offending
products and promotional material, and requested that they be
transferred the party company&#8217;s Internet domain name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The damages they seek are $200,000 for each infringed
trademark, and, if the court determines that infringement is
deliberate, for the damages to be increased to $2 million per
mark. They also asked that awards of damages and of profits
derived from the alleged infringement be tripled to punish the
defendants for their actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Party Animals didn&#8217;t respond immediately to an e-mailed
request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Disney Enterprises v. Jason Lancaster, 2:12-cv-
07347-DDP-JC, U.S. District Court, Central District of
California (Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DuPont Wins Order Barring Kolon From Selling Body-Armor Fiber &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DuPont Co. (DD), the inventor of Kevlar, won a ruling barring
Kolon Industries Inc.&#8217;s sales of a competing version of the
product used in protective clothing for police and the military
for the next 20 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Robert Payne in Richmond, Virginia, in
an Aug. 20 order barred Kolon from selling products in the U.S.
made with its para-aramid fiber after a jury found last year
that the South Korean manufacturer stole trade secrets relating
to the Kevlar fiber and should pay more than $919 million in
damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The judge&#8217;s order sends a clear message to Kolon and
others that they cannot benefit from the theft of our trade
secrets,&#8221; Thomas Powell, a DuPont spokesman, said in an e-
mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DuPont, based in Wilmington, Delaware, is expanding Kevlar
production to meet rising demand for armor and lightweight
materials that reduce energy use. The company opened a $500
million plant in South Carolina last year to boost output of the
material for use in products such as tires, auto parts and
fiber-optic cables. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Kolon is disappointed with the court&#8217;s rulings and does
not believe an injunction, of any scope, is warranted either
legally or factually,&#8221; Jeff Randall, a lawyer for the company,
said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;Kolon will immediately file a
motion to stay the order.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jurors in federal court in Richmond found in September
2011 that Gyeonggi-based Kolon and its U.S. unit wrongfully
obtained proprietary information about Kevlar by hiring some
former DuPont engineers and marketers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DuPont sued Kolon in February 2009 alleging it stole
confidential Kevlar data. DuPont began selling the bullet-
resistant fiber in 1965 and it&#8217;s used in body armor, military
helmets, ropes, cables and tires. Kolon began making its own
version of the para-aramid fiber in 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jurors found Kolon got access to Kevlar secrets by hiring
Michael Mitcher, a former DuPont engineer who also had served as
a Kevlar marketing executive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his order, Payne note that jurors concluded Kolon
executives &#8220;willfully and maliciously misappropriated&#8221; Kevlar
secrets and the company engaged in &#8220;unlawful conduct.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, Kolon is barred for a period of 20 years from
&#8220;manufacturing, using, marketing, promoting, selling,
distributing, offering for sale or soliciting customers for any
para-aramid product,&#8221; the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is E.I. du Pont de Nemours  Co. v. Kolon
Industries Inc. (120110), 09-cv-00058, U.S. District Court, Eastern
District of Virginia (Richmond). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Penn Settles Trade Secrets Case With Sloan-Kettering Head &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trade secrets litigation involving the president of New
York&#8217;s Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, the University of
Pennsylvania, and two biotech companies has settled, according
to an Aug. 31 joint statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suits were related to research conducted by Dr. Craig
Thompson, the president of Sloan-Kettering, that was funded by a
$100 million donation from the Leonard and Madlyn Abramson
Family Cancer Research Institute at the University of
Pennsylvania. The university and the foundation accused Thompson
of allegedly breaching an agreement with the foundation by
failing to disclose his discoveries to the institute, instead
providing the information to a company he founded and publishing
it in an international journal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terms of the settlement weren&#8217;t disclosed. The parties said
in a statement that Thompson&#8217;s company, Agios Pharmaceuticals
Inc., has entered into a collaboration agreement with the
University of Pennsylvania covering the development of
diagnostic products to detect the metabolism of come cancers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two cases are Trustees of the University of
Pennsylvania v. Thompson, 12-cv-1330, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan), and Leonard and
Madlyn Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute v. Thompson,
11-09108, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lowered
earnings growth forecasts for China&#8217;s companies and Credit
Suisse Group AG cut the nation&#8217;s stock index targets as the
economy slows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profits for companies in the MSCI China Index (MXCN) may increase
1.8 percent this year and 8.6 percent in 2013, compared with
previous growth estimates of 6 percent and 12.3 percent, Helen Zhu and Timothy Moe, analysts at the U.S. bank, wrote in a
report dated yesterday. Credit Suisse lowered its 12-month
target for the index to 60 from 70, analysts Vincent Chan and
Peggy Chan said in a report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third-quarter &#8220;earnings growth may not yet show a clear
inflection point,&#8221; Goldman&#8217;s Zhu and Moe wrote. &#8220;We expect
further earnings cuts in the coming months, albeit at a slower
rate, as current revision sentiment is very weak already.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) has retreated 6.8 percent this
year on concern two reductions in borrowing costs and bank
reserve ratios this year will fail to halt a decline in economic
growth. China&#8217;s economy grew 7.6 percent in the three months
through June, the slowest pace since 2009, as Europe&#8217;s debt
crisis hurt exports and a crackdown on property speculation
damped domestic demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing shrank for the first time in nine months in
August as new orders contracted and output rose at a slower
pace, according to the Purchasing Managers&#8217; Index released by
the statistics bureau on Sept. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Growth Target &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings per share for companies in the MSCI China Index of
mainly Hong Kong-listed Chinese companies rose 2 percent in the
first six months of 2012, slowing from 28 percent growth in the
same period a year earlier, according to the Goldman Sach
report. China&#8217;s economy may risk missing the government&#8217;s 2012
growth target of 7.5 percent, according to Lu Ting, head of
Greater China economics at Bank of America Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI China lost 0.4 percent to 52.65 as of 1:49 p.m. in
Hong Kong, taking its drop this year to 0.7 percent. The
Shanghai Composite Index dropped 0.5 percent to 2,049.86. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks so-
called H shares traded in Hong Kong, has slumped 7 percent this
year. It fell 0.5 percent to 9,238.53. The Credit Suisse
analysts lowered their target for the Hang Seng gauge to 12,000
from 13,000, based on an assumption of &#8220;flat&#8221; earnings growth
in the next three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lower Valuations &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For stocks to rise, &#8220;we will need either a stabilized
global economy or the Chinese government&#8217;s macro policy
addressing stimulus or structural reform,&#8221; the analysts said.
They downgraded China&#8217;s banking stocks to market weight from
overweight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai Composite trades at 9.3 times estimated
profit, near the lowest level since January, while the Hang Seng
China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) is valued at 7.7 times, 41 percent lower
than its seven-year average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The Hang Seng gauge trades for 1.25 times book value,
compared with its seven-year average of 2.28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks may rebound in the next three-to-six months on
valuations, according to Credit Suisse&#8217;s analysts. Current
earnings forecasts have already factored in weak economic
conditions, Minggao Shen and Ben Wei, analysts at Citigroup
Inc., wrote in a report dated yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Further policy easing looks inevitable after weak August
data, cost pressure will be lessened and restocking before year-
end is possible, all contributing to a better earnings
outlook,&#8221; Shen and Wei said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) investors
overreacted to a $5.8 billion trading loss during the first half
of this year and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon is doing a
&#8220;great&#8221; job, former CEO William B. Harrison said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was disappointing to all of us that we had that kind
of loss, but the important thing is to put it into perspective,
which the market didn&#8217;t do very well,&#8221; Harrison, 69, said today
in an interview on CNBC. &#8220;A lot of people overreacted to it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, is under
investigation by at least 11 agencies, including the U.S.
Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission, for
the loss at the London chief investment office. The firm&#8217;s
market value has dropped by about $28 billion since Bloomberg
News first reported on April 5 that the lender had amassed an
illiquid position on credit derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrison, who retired from JPMorgan in 2006 after four
decades at the New York-based bank, said companies and employees
need to be able to make occasional mistakes and that he
&#8220;couldn&#8217;t be more proud&#8221; of that job that Dimon, 56, is doing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPMorgan came through the financial crisis as we all know
without making a significant mistake,&#8221; Harrison said. &#8220;It&#8217;s
extraordinary that Jamie and team were able to manage it that
way.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nokia Oyj (NOK) shares tumbled the most in almost three months after the introduction of two Lumia smartphones with Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s (MSFT) new Windows Phone software failed to impress investors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The stock fell 13 percent to 1.99 euros in Helsinki, the biggest one-day decline since June 14. The stock had rallied 96 percent from an 18-year low on July 18 through Aug. 27 in anticipation of the new phones. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nokia is counting on its partnership with Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft to help boost sales and return the company to profitability after falling behind rivals. The Espoo, Finland-based company has identified the U.S. as a market where it has to win back users and gain momentum in its global comeback bid. The question is whether the new phones break enough ground, said Geoff Blaber, an analyst at CCS Insight. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The challenge Nokia will face is that consumers will struggle to see how the hardware has really stepped forward from the previous generation of products,&#8221; the London-based Blaber said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nokia Chief Executive Officer Stephen Elop, who unveiled the new phones at a news conference in New York, also didn&#8217;t provide details on price, carriers or availability, beyond saying they will go on sale in the fourth quarter. The Lumia 920 has a 4.5-inch (11-cm) screen and an 8.7-megapixel camera with a so-called floating lens that uses software for image stabilization. The Lumia 820, whose screen measures 4.3 inches, has an 8-megapixel camera without the optics software. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Important Step&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Today is a very important step, and there are more important steps ahead,&#8221; Elop said in an interview. &#8220;There&#8217;s no single turning point. We need to succeed with this and take it to the next step.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The announcement of the Lumia models gives Nokia a brief head start before two top rivals present their own newest handsets. Motorola Mobility, a unit of Google Inc. (GOOG), is planning to unveil one of the first full-screen phones in the U.S. later today in New York, according to a person familiar with the plan. Apple Inc. (AAPL), maker of the iPhone, is planning its own introduction on Sept. 12. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The U.S. is very important,&#8221; Elop said. &#8220;These trends we&#8217;ve seen in our industry have been starting here and moving east.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Chip Technology &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another potential liability: The 920 runs on a Qualcomm Inc. Snapdragon S4 chip, a model that has two processing cores. The latest phones from Samsung Electronics Co., LG Electronics Inc. and Huawei Technologies Co. have four cores. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re introducing a dual-core processor in a world dominated by quad-core,&#8221; CCS Insight&#8217;s Blaber said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 920, shown at the conference today in a bright yellow casing, has software called City Lens that allows users to hold the phone camera up to see the names of restaurants and shops overlaid on the surfaces of buildings. Users can tap a building for more details and can call to make reservations. Nokia&#8217;s maps software has similar augmented reality software that shows customers nearby points of interest when they hold the phone up after setting their route. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The phone, which can recharge wirelessly, also comes in red and gray. Its touch screen is sensitive enough to detect fingers through gloves, Kevin Shields, a Nokia senior vice president, said at today&#8217;s event. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Junk Status &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nokia, whose credit rating was cut to junk this year by the three biggest rating companies, has announced more than 20,000 job cuts and closed production and research sites in an attempt to put the company on profitable footing. Nokia, whose U.S. market share peaked at 32 percent in 2001, accounted for about 2 percent of smartphone purchases in the second quarter, according to Strategy Analytics. The iPhone and devices using Google&#8217;s Android software combined for about 90 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The growth of the $219.1 billion smartphone market has aided Nokia. Even as momentum slowed to the lowest in almost three years, global smartphone shipments climbed 32 percent to 146 million units in the second quarter, according to Strategy Analytics. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Lumia sales have been dwarfed by competitors, early shipments have exceeded some analysts&#8217; estimates. Nokia sold 4 million of the devices globally in the second quarter, doubling from the first quarter and beating the 3.8 million analysts on average projected. Nokia is expected to sell 3.4 million Windows-based phones this quarter and 5.9 million in the fourth quarter, Sandeep Deshpande, a London-based analyst at JPMorgan Chase  Co., said last month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Transitional Period&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nokia will go through a &#8220;transition period&#8221; in the third quarter, with Lumia 900 handset sales slowing as consumers look ahead to the new models, Elop said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Microsoft has seen shipments of Windows Phones more than double, they remain tiny. Its 5.4 million units sold in the second quarter represent a 3.5 percent share of the market, according to research firm IDC. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nothing in the space is going to change dramatically overnight,&#8221; said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Gartner Inc. &#8220;What Microsoft and Nokia need to do is continually show evolution and innovation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Scott Moritz in New York at  smoritz6@bloomberg.net; Adam Ewing in Stockholm at  aewing5@bloomberg.net; Dina Bass in Seattle at  dbass2@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Nick Turner at  nturner7@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s Eric Batchelder, a managing director who advised energy and power
companies, left to join Royal Bank of Canada (RY)&#8217;s investment-
banking unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batchelder joined RBC Capital Markets LLC as a managing
director last week, spokeswoman Elisa Barsotti said. He will
focus on investment banking for &#8220;master limited partnerships,&#8221;
companies that mainly manage oil and gas pipelines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batchelder had worked at New York-based Goldman Sachs since
at least 2002, according to the Finra website. He was promoted
to managing director, the company&#8217;s second-highest rank behind
partner, in 2011. The records show he remains based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batchelder helped advise Louis Dreyfus Highbridge Energy
LLC last year on the $1.9 billion sale of a collection of plants
and pipelines in Texas and Louisiana to partnerships controlled
by Energy Transfer Equity LP. (ETE) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batchelder also advised on fundraising efforts for Longview
Power LLC, which built a $2 billion coal-fired power plant in
West Virginia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sparkspread.com reported earlier this year that Batchelder
was leaving Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doug McGregor, co-head of RBC Capital Markets, said in an
interview in December that the unit was slowing its expansion
after more than doubling headcount during the previous five
years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group (GS), Lockheed Martin
Corp. (LMT) and Boeing Co. (BA) gave a total of $1.3 million to the host
committees funding the Democratic and Republican conventions
four years ago. This time, they aren&#8217;t on either party&#8217;s donor
lists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&#8217;re among the companies that are opting out of funding
the party&#8217;s quadrennial presidential nominating sessions at
which thousands of delegates and elected officials are inundated
with products and pitches by corporations seeking to elevate
their political profiles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With extra scrutiny of the mingling of delegates and
special interests, some companies may have decided they didn&#8217;t
want the attention, said Sheila Krumholz, executive director of
the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based research
group that tracks campaign contributions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For the corporations to transfer funds from their general
treasuries to the conventions may be of less value than in
past years,&#8221; Krumholz said. &#8220;There&#8217;s too much of a
spotlight.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some companies are back in the convention business,
including ATT Inc. (T) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), according to lists of
donors released by both host committees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Goldman Sachs contributed $250,000 to the
Denver host committee for the 2008 Democratic convention and
$255,000 to the Minneapolis-St. Paul committee for the
Republican gathering, according to the Campaign Finance
Institute, a Washington-based research group that studies
convention giving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goldman Giving &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Goldman employees are the largest company source of
campaign contributions to Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney&#8217;s campaign and were the biggest for President Barack Obama four years earlier, the company is sitting out the
conventions this time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are operating in a constrained spending environment,
so we&#8217;ve had to cut back in a number of areas,&#8221; said David Wells, a spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lockheed Martin, the world&#8217;s largest defense contractor,
and Chicago-based Boeing, the world&#8217;s largest aerospace company,
also have decided not to give to either convention host
committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their decisions come just months before $1.2 trillion in
automatic spending cuts over a decade -- half of which would
affect the Defense Department -- are scheduled to kick in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Defense Cuts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reductions are required by the 2011 agreement to raise
the U.S. debt limit. The cuts, also known as sequester, were
designed to force Congress to find alternative deficit-reduction
proposals. Lawmakers, so far, haven&#8217;t agreed on such a plan.
Both Obama and Republican vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan, a
Wisconsin congressman, backed the debt-limit agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed Martin gave $200,000
in Denver and $150,000 in Minneapolis-St. Paul to help finance
the partisan festivities. This year, company officials simply
attended the conventions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We take a bipartisan approach in participating in the
political process and engaging with federal, state and local
political leaders committed to national security, homeland
security, education and technology issues,&#8221; said Jennifer Whitlow, a spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boeing also decided not to contribute to the host
committees this year, according to a spokesman, Tim Neale, after
giving $225,000 to the Democratic host committee and $200,000 to
the Republican committee in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A class-action suit against Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) over mortgage-backed securities was revived by
a federal appeals court in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors in 17 securities offerings, led by the NECA-IBEW
Health and Welfare Fund, sued Goldman Sachs over securities
backed by pools of residential mortgages originated by National
City Mortgage Co., Countrywide Home Loans, Washington Mutual
Bank and others, according to an opinion by the court today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum dismissed the
suit in 2010, ruling that NECA, which purchased certificates
from only two of the offerings, lacked standing to represent
investors in the other 15. A three-judge panel of the appeals
court reversed that ruling today. The court also reversed
Cedarbaum&#8217;s ruling that NECA failed to claim a sufficient loss
from the investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We hold that plaintiff has class standing to assert the
claims of purchasers of certificates backed by mortgages
originated by the same lenders that originated the mortgages
backing plaintiff&#8217;s certificates, because such claims implicate
&#8216;the same set of concerns&#8217; as plaintiff&#8217;s claims,&#8221; U.S. Circuit
Judge Barrington Parker said in the opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment immediately on today&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is NECA-IBEW Health and Welfare Fund v. Goldman
Sachs  Co., 11-2762, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) was sued by
German lender DZ Bank AG over $188.6 million in mortgage-backed

bank over mortgage bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs made material misrepresentations about loans
that were bundled into the securities, DZ Bank said in a filing

and negligent misrepresentation, the lender said. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Matt Robinson and David Holley" date="Sep 07, 2012 12:43 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-07/hovnanian-escapes-abyss-as-jpmorgan-says-buy-corporate-finance.html"><headline>Hovnanian Escapes Abyss as JPMorgan Says Buy</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Hovnanian Enterprises Inc. (HOV), the
homebuilder that faced a 91 percent chance of default last
October as seen in derivatives trades, is winning over
bondholders by reducing debt as housing prices improve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average market value of the family-run company&#8217;s bonds
surged 30 percent to $1.2 billion as of Sept. 5 from $910
million on Sept. 30, 2011, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data. The builder&#8217;s probability of default in five
years dropped to 43.5 percent yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hovnanian&#8217;s tactic of buying land even as housing prices
were falling is paying off as the market rebounds and the
company has the raw materials to meet demand. A recovery in the
home sector has bolstered the balance sheets of those builders
that survived the worst financial crisis since the Great
Depression as Red Bank, New Jersey-based Hovnanian reported a
surprise profit yesterday with a 36 percent gain in revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you weathered that storm and still come out whole,
who&#8217;s to say you can&#8217;t continue doing so,&#8221; Jody Lurie, a
corporate credit analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in
Philadelphia, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;Provided that it
doesn&#8217;t get as bad as things were in &#8217;09 they should be fine. I
think that&#8217;s the mentality about them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s $121 million of 8.625 percent bonds due
January 2017 traded at 85 cents on the dollar Sept. 5 to yield
13.2 percent, up from 33 cents Oct. 3, according to Trace, the
bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. Hovnanian had $1.55 billion in long-term debt as of
July 31, down 44 percent from $2.74 billion in 2008, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Improving Fundamentals&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re pleased that the market recognized the improving
fundamentals that we&#8217;ve been posting,&#8221; Larry Sorsby, chief
financial officer, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s clear
to us that the industry is in a period of recovery. We&#8217;ve
bounced off the bottom.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., which had an &#8220;underweight&#8221; rating
on the company&#8217;s bonds as recently as July, upgraded New
Jersey&#8217;s largest homebuilder to &#8220;overweight&#8221; yesterday.
Improvement in housing, the strength in the high-yield bond
market and the potential for refinancing have improved the
company&#8217;s outlook, analysts Susan Berliner and Richard DeGaetani
wrote in a research note to clients. An &#8220;overweight&#8221;
recommendation means the position is expected to outperform
benchmarks during the next three months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Refinancing Debt &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve been saying all year that they&#8217;ve showed a
willingness to cut the costs when they need to,&#8221; Martha Ucko,
an analyst at CreditSights Inc., said in a telephone interview.
&#8220;It was a risky world for a while but the housing market is
looking like it has stabilized with another big leg down in
volumes unlikely and they&#8217;re getting pretty close to
profitability.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company may refinance its $797 million of 10.625
percent first-lien notes due October 2016, which become callable
for the first time on Oct. 15 at 108 cents on the dollar, said
Michael Kim, a fixed-income analyst at CRT Capital Group LLC in
Stamford, Connecticut. The securities traded at 107 cents on the
dollar today, the highest since May 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Refinancing the first lien notes with lower coupon debt
would benefit liquidity and provide further support to the rest
of the capital structure, including the unsecured bonds,&#8221; Kim
said in a telephone interview. &#8220;There&#8217;s certainly more optimism
around their survival in having the liquidity on hand to get
through the next couple of years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Default Risk &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps tied to Hovnanian debt have declined
to 16.6 percent upfront, according to data provider CMA, which
is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market. That&#8217;s in addition
to 5 percent a year, meaning it would cost $1.66 million
initially and $500,000 annually to protect $10 million of
Hovnanian&#8217;s debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those prices imply that the market perceives a 43.5 percent
chance the company will default within five years, based on an
expectation that investors would recover 14.5 percent of face
value of the company&#8217;s bonds if it failed to meet its
obligations, the data show. That&#8217;s down from 60.5 percent at the
end of 2011 when it implied 85 percent odds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blackstone Deal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors are accepting the lowest relative yields for debt
of the nation&#8217;s biggest homebuilders since 2007. So-called
spreads at 4.74 percentage points on debt of borrowers from D.R.
Horton Inc. (DHI), the largest U.S. homebuilder by volume, to Toll
Brothers Inc. (TOL) have tightened six times faster than the overall
high-yield market since February, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackstone Group LP (BX)&#8217;s GSO Capital Partners LP agreed to
acquire a group of housing development sites from Hovnanian in
July with plans to sell them back to the homebuilder under a
$125 million deal, causing the company&#8217;s bonds to surge 4.3
cents on the day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GSO agreement is a &#8220;sizeable liquidity source&#8221; that
will &#8220;enable Hovnanian to buy enough land to grow the
company,&#8221; JPMorgan wrote in a July report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income for the three months ended July 31 was $34.7
million, or 25 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $50.9
million, of 47 cents, a year earlier, Hovnanian said yesterday
in a statement. The average estimate of 10 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey was for a loss of 14 cents a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Housing Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ara Hovnanian is president and chief executive officer of
the company his father founded in 1959. Hovnanian, New Jersey&#8217;s
largest builder, has operations in 18 states including, Arizona,
California, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky and
Maryland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homebuilders, along with lenders, real-estate firms and
investment banks that bundled mortgages made to the least
creditworthy borrowers into securities, contributed to a run-up
in housing prices that peaked in July 2006. Prices plummeted 35
percent from then until the market low in February, according to
the Standard  Poor&#8217;s/Case-Shiller index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home prices in 20 U.S. cities climbed in June for the first
time since a tax credit boosted sales in 2010. The SP/Case-
Shiller index increased 0.5 percent from June 2011 after falling
0.7 percent in the year to May, a report from the group showed
last month in New York. The last 12-month increase took place in
September 2010. Nationally, prices jumped last quarter by the
most in more than six years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Housing Recovery &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purchases of new homes rose more than projected in July to
match a two-year high, Commerce Department data showed last
month. Previously-owned house sales rebounded from an eight-
month low, the National Association of Realtors reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A U.S. housing recovery will take longer than investors
anticipate, said Vicki Bryan, an analyst at research firm Gimme
Credit LLC in New York. Many investors are too optimistic and
have pushed up prices on the bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m encouraged that the housing market is improving and
gaining traction but they&#8217;ve already priced in years of
improvement,&#8221; Bryan said in a telephone interview. &#8220;Not all
the homebuilders are equipped to sustain themselves for years
and years of slow sales, for the years it takes for the housing
market to recover.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MF Global Holdings Inc. (MFGLQ) agreed on new terms to use cash collateral of its largest lender, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), and seeks court permission to extend its use of the money until March 31. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An agreement between the company&#8217;s Chapter 11 trustee, Louis Freeh, and the New York-based bank would extend a prior deadline of Sept. 30, according to papers filed today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. It would also increase to $750,000 from $500,000 the fees and expenses for which JPMorgan is entitled to be reimbursed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, JPMorgan would receive a payment of $606,062 to reduce the bank&#8217;s claim within five days of the agreement&#8217;s approval by the court. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;No other terms of the Final Cash Collateral Order shall be deemed amended, waived, or otherwise modified,&#8221; lawyers for MF Global wrote in the filing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In December, when U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn in Manhattan first approved the company&#8217;s request to use about $21 million in JPMorgan&#8217;s cash collateral, he overruled objections from customers who said the money might be part of th funds missing from their segregated accounts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Asset Lien &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, agent to a $1.2 billion pre-bankruptcy loan to MF Global, agreed at the outset of the bankruptcy case to let it use $26 million under an agreement that gives the bank a lien on all of MF Global&#8217;s assets. Freeh said in court papers that the money, exactly $25.3 million, is presumed to be that of the company, not that of customers. About $4 million is set aside to cover fees. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;MF Global Holdings, once run by former New Jersey Governor and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Co-Chairman Jon Corzine, filed the eighth-largest U.S. bankruptcy after a wrong-way $6.3 billion trade on its own behalf on bonds of some of Europe&#8217;s most indebted nations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Customers may face a $1.6 billion gap, according to James Giddens, the trustee liquidating the company&#8217;s brokerage. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;MF Global Holdings&#8217; Oct. 31 bankruptcy filing listed assets of $41 billion and debt of $39.7 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The brokerage case is Securities Investor Protection Corp. v. MF Global Inc., 11-02790, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The parent&#8217;s bankruptcy case is MF Global Holdings Ltd., 11-bk-15059, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Tiffany Kary in New York at  tkary@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: John Pickering at  jpickering@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.K. regulators plan to improve how
banks, brokerages and other companies protect clients&#8217; funds,
particularly when the investment firm fails. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. Financial Services Authority said yesterday it
will incorporate &#8220;lessons learned from recent insolvencies such
as Lehman Brothers International and MF Global, and is intended
to assess the industry&#8217;s appetite for change.&#8221; It is seeking
industry and customer input on how to amend the rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plans include overhauling rules on the treatment of
margin assets posted by failed companies on their derivatives
trades and amount to &#8220;the most radical change in the client-
assets regime in over 20 years,&#8221; the FSA said in an e-mailed
statement. &#8220;Today&#8217;s proposals will go a long way to ensure
confidence in U.K. markets is maintained.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSA stepped up enforcement of client-money rules after
the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008. The New
York-based bank&#8217;s former U.K. unit failed to segregate billions
of dollars of client funds from its own accounts, leaving
creditors with competing claims that resulted in years of
litigation. The issue has resurfaced in the administration of MF
Global Holding Ltd.&#8217;s U.K. unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator levied its largest fine at the time, 33.3
million pounds ($53 million), in 2010 against JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM)&#8217;s London unit for not properly separating an average of $8.6
billion of client money over seven years. Last year, it fined
Barclays Capital Securities Ltd. 1.12 million pounds for failing
to put as much as 752 million pounds-a-day in client money into
protected accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency is seeking views on various ring-fenced money
sub-pools. The plans are partly driven by changes to EU law, the
FSA said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;EU&#8217;s Basel Implementation Criticized by Australian Regulator &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australian regulators have warned that the European Union
may be failing to correctly implement Basel bank capital rules,
as part of an international check into whether the EU is
faithfully applying the standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, or APRA,
sent a note to international supervisors highlighting
shortcomings with draft EU legislation to implement the so-
called Basel III accord in the 27-nation bloc, said Othmar
Karas, a member of the European Parliament responsible for bank
capital rules. The note is a contribution to a peer-review
process of how well the EU is introducing the measures, and was
discussed at a Sept. 5 meeting in Brussels between EU officials
and lawmakers, Karas said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global regulators agreed on the Basel measures in 2010 as
part of their response to the financial turmoil of 2008.  They
would more than triple the core capital that lenders must hold
to protect themselves from insolvency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basel Committee Chairman Stefan Ingves announced last year
that the group would probe how nations applied the Basel III
rules, scheduled to be phased in from 2012 to 2019, through a
peer review process and on-site inspections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;APRA was among a group of regulators responsible for
probing the EU, which has yet to adopt its final implementing
rules for Basel III. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Turkey Won&#8217;t Charge Withholding Tax on Sukuk, Treasury Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkey won&#8217;t charge a withholding tax on the Islamic bonds,
or sukuk, which it&#8217;s planning to sell to foreign investors this
month, the Treasury said in an e-mailed response to questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkey has hired HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA), Citigroup Inc. (C) and
Liquidity House, a unit of Kuwait Finance House (KFIN), to help study
options for the country&#8217;s first sale of Islamic sukuk bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Treasury in Ankara will hold meetings with investors in
the Middle East and Asia between Sept. 10 and Sept. 13, it said
in a statement on its website Sept. 5. The securities will be
denominated in dollars, according to two bankers involved in the
issue, who declined to be identified in advance of the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand for the Turkish sukuk may be about $1 billion,

AS (ASYAB), the country&#8217;s biggest bank complying with Islamic laws on
interest, said in an interview with Bloomberg HT television in
Istanbul Sept. 5. Bank Asya plans its own first sale of the
bonds in a &#8220;short time,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parliament in Ankara passed a law in February last year
reducing the withholding tax on a sukuk to 10 percent and
exempting the sales from value-added, stamp and corporate taxes,
putting them on par with non-Islamic bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Said to Face Escalating Senate Probe of CIO Losses &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s wrong-way bets on derivatives are
the focus of an escalating probe by a U.S. Senate panel led by
Carl Levin that has grilled executives from banks including
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and HSBC Holdings Plc, three people
briefed on the inquiry said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations is seeking
testimony from people who worked in or helped lead JPMorgan&#8217;s
chief investment office, according to the people, who declined
to be identified because the inquiry isn&#8217;t public. The unit&#8217;s
London staff lost at least $5.8 billion this year on the botched
bets, which were large enough to shift markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tara Andringa, a spokeswoman for Levin, didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to a message seeking comment, and Joe Evangelisti at
JPMorgan declined to discuss the panel&#8217;s inquiry. &#8220;As always,
the company has fully cooperated with all regulatory and
governmental requests around this matter,&#8221; Evangelisti said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the nation&#8217;s largest bank by assets, has lost
more than $22 billion in shareholder value since Bloomberg News
first reported on April 5 that it amassed a large and illiquid
position in credit derivatives in the unit&#8217;s London office.
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56, has since overhauled
the division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate panel is unencumbered by many of the political
restraints faced by other congressional committees. As a
permanent fixture in a chamber whose members only have to run
for office every six years, the panel has more resources and can
pursue longer inquiries in greater depth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Car Loan Rules Spur Indonesian Shariah Lending: Islamic Finance &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesian consumer-finance companies are turning to
Shariah-compliant lending after regulators tightened rules on
non-Islamic loans for buying cars and motorcycles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance (ADMF), the nation&#8217;s largest,
started a business complying with the Muslim faith in July and
expects it to eventually account for as much as 20 percent of
operations, Sylvanus Gani Mendrofa, head of the corporate
secretary division, said in an Aug. 28 interview in Jakarta.
Shariah lenders PT Amanah Finance and PT Al Ijarah Indonesia
Finance said loans will grow at least 30 percent per annum in
the next few years, faster than the 23 percent growth for the
whole industry during the past five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders must receive deposits of at least 25 percent of the
value of cars and 20 percent for motorcycles, the finance
ministry said in March. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ambow Trading Halted on Company&#8217;s Probe Into Unit&#8217;s Schools &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading in Ambow Education Holding Ltd. (AMBO) was halted after
the private tutoring services provider said it will start a
probe into its units following a report by China&#8217;s state
television. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s Central Television said on Sept. 3 that Ambow&#8217;s
one-on-one education unit exaggerated staff training results and
that the schools&#8217; registrations with industry regulators were
incomplete, according to a statement by Ambow posted Sept. 5.
Ambow said it will start an investigation into the issues
&#8220;immediately,&#8221; discipline the persons involved and take
corrective steps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s not the company&#8217;s policy to encourage staff to
exaggerate training results, Ambow Chief Strategy Officer Jenny
Zhan said in a phone interview from Beijing. &#8220;The company&#8217;s
investigation on the CCTV allegations is still ongoing, which
doesn&#8217;t mean we admit everything the TV report said,&#8221; she said,
adding the company will publish a statement after the
investigation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-UBS Trader Adoboli&#8217;s $2.3 Billion Trading-Loss Trial to Begin &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kweku Adoboli, accused of unauthorized trades that cost UBS
AG (UBSN) $2.3 billion, will go on trial next week charged with fraud
and false accounting in one of the highest-profile banking cases
ever heard in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since being released on bail three months ago, Adoboli, 32,
has worked on his defense at the office of his law firm, Bark 
Co. He is facing an eight-week trial in criminal court to decide
whether he caused the largest unauthorized trading loss in
British history at UBS&#8217;s investment bank a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is charged with falsifying records on exchange-traded
fund transactions and other documents needed for accounting
purposes as early as October 2008, according to his indictment.
Prosecutors also charged him with fraud for abusing his senior
trader position &#8220;by causing or exposing UBS Bank to losses
intending thereby to make a gain for himself.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.K., fraud charges carry a maximum sentence of 10
years in jail, and seven years for false accounting. Adoboli is
facing two counts of each. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim Harris, Adoboli&#8217;s lawyer, said he was unable to comment
on the case before trial, which is scheduled to start Sept. 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The U.K. criminal process is ongoing and will run its
course,&#8221; UBS spokesman Richard Morton said in an e-mailed
statement. &#8220;UBS is not a party to the case and therefore has no
further comment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;UBS Sued by U.S. Regulator for $1.1 Billion in Faulty MBS Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS AG (UBS) is being sued by the U.S. regulator of credit unions
for improper sales of $1.1 billion in faulty securities that
contributed to two firm failures, the National Credit Union
Administration said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit accuses the UBS Securities LLC unit of the
Zurich-based bank with selling residential mortgage-backed
securities that were &#8220;all but certain to become delinquent or
default&#8221; soon after the sale, according to NCUA&#8217;s complaint
dated Sept. 6. Two wholesale credit unions -- U.S. Central
Federal Credit Union and Western Corporate Federal Credit Union &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks are marketing $2.25 billion of
U.S. commercial-mortgage bonds as investors gird for the largest
wave of new deals since the market&#8217;s peak five years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Citigroup Inc. (C) are offering
$967 million of securities linked to office buildings, shopping
malls and hotels, according to people familiar with the offering
who asked not to be identified because terms aren&#8217;t public. UBS
AG (UBSN) and Barclays Plc are preparing about $1 billion of similar
debt, while Bank of America Corp. (BAC) is offering $280 million of
bonds backed by extended-stay hotel properties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders are looking to sell as much as $8 billion in
commercial-mortgage backed securities in coming weeks after a
two-month rally, according to Deutsche Bank AG. September
issuance will probably be the biggest monthly volume since sales
revived after coming to a halt amid the 2008 credit seizure,
Deutsche Bank analysts led by Harris Trifon said in a Sept. 5
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As long as the deals are of decent credit quality, there
will be enough demand to absorb the new issuance,&#8221; Credit
Suisse Group AG analysts led by Roger Lehman said in a Sept. 5
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top-ranked bonds tied to commercial-property loans are
yielding 143 basis points more than Treasuries, the lowest
spread since at least January 2008, Barclays data show. That&#8217;s
down from a more than three-month high of 210 basis points, or
2.1 percentage points, on June 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders have arranged about $20.5 billion in commercial-
mortgage bonds this year, compared with $28 billion in 2011,
Bloomberg data show. Credit Suisse forecasts as much as $45
billion in 2012 issuance. Sales are down from a record $232
billion in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, is considering cutting 2012 bonuses for
senior managers including Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon,
according to the Wall Street Journal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s board of directors is weighing the cuts after
botched bets on derivatives, the newspaper reported today,
citing people close to the discussions whom it didn&#8217;t identify.
Joe Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market value of New York-based JPMorgan has dropped by
$20 billion since Bloomberg News first reported April 5 that the
firm amassed a large and illiquid position in credit derivatives
at its chief investment office in London. The bank lost $5.8
billion on the trades during the first six months of this year
and has said it could lose as much as $7.5 billion total while
closing out the position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, who was awarded $23 million in salary and bonuses
for his performance in 2011, said previously it&#8217;s up to the
board whether his pay will be reduced when an internal task
force concludes an investigation into the botched trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The board, as an independent group, is still guiding this
task force and will come to its own conclusions,&#8221; Dimon, 56,
said on a July 13 conference call with analysts and investors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan and India will ease visa
restrictions for their citizens to boost business travel and
trade across their border as part of their push for peace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s Foreign Minister S.M. Krishna signed the visa
agreement in Islamabad Sept. 8 during a three-day visit. The
change will let businessmen from both countries obtain multiple
entry visas, exempting them from a police reporting requirement.
Tourist visas will also be issued for the first time, according
to the state-run Pakistan Television. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement was signed after Krishna held talks with his
Pakistani counterpart Hina Rabbani Khar for the second time
since peace talks resumed last year. Five years of talks that
strengthened trade, transport and cultural links were halted
following the attacks on Mumbai in 2008 by Pakistani gunmen, in
which 166 people died. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the resumption, the nuclear-armed neighbors who have
fought three wars have made progress normalizing their economic
links. Any resolution to long-standing territorial disputes such
as Kashmir remains hobbled by distrust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We should move forward without being held hostage to the
past,&#8221; Khar said during a joint press conference with Krishna
in Islamabad on Sept. 8. &#8220;We do need simultaneous progress on
all tracks to sustain the momentum.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan is on schedule to normalize trade with India,
removing all restrictions by December this year, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, India&#8217;s then Home Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram
said the arrest and interrogation of a man suspected of helping
organize the Mumbai attacks showed he had received some kind of
state support from Pakistan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;False Rumors &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India accused Pakistan last month of fueling false rumors
that people from India&#8217;s northeast were being attacked after
deadly ethnic clashes between indigenous tribes and Muslim
migrants in the state of Assam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Terrorism poses a continuing threat to peace and
security,&#8221; Krishna said in his prepared remarks without giving
a firm date for the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh&#8217;s
expected visit to Pakistan. &#8220;I think the visit will take place
at an appropriate time when the atmosphere is ripe and when he
feels that something worthwhile will come out of his visit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singh&#8217;s trip would be the first by an Indian premier since
January 2004 when former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
visited Islamabad for talks with then Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there has been little progress in addressing core
issues between the nations, &#8220;diminishing malice is becoming the
defining characteristic&#8221; of relations, Bahukutumbi Raman, a
retired Indian intelligence officer and security analyst, wrote
in an analysis Sept. 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their joint communique, the foreign ministers said the
countries were committed to fighting terrorism and would carry
on the process of peace talks &#8220;with a view to resolving all
outstanding issues&#8221; and establishing good neighborly relations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They agreed to hold further talks on Kashmir, a partitioned
state claimed in full by both India and Pakistan and the cause
of two of their three wars. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) may announce a 15
percent increase to its quarterly dividend later this month,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg, as the world&#8217;s largest
software maker faces a growing cash position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s board typically holds its annual meeting to
set the dividend in September and has boosted the payout in each
of the previous two years, including a 25 percent increase last
year. Analysts estimate the software maker will raise the
dividend by three cents to 23 cents a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s cash and short-term investments as of June 30
surged to more than $63 billion, from $52.8 billion a year
earlier, just before the last dividend increase. While another
boost would benefit investors, the company&#8217;s ability to increase
the payout is constrained because most of its cash is held
overseas and would be taxed if it were brought back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The board is likely to consider factors such as available
onshore cash&#8221; in making its decision, Heather Bellini, an
analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said in a research note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;One benchmark the company and the board look to when
determining the dividend increase is the growth in the prior
year&#8217;s operating income,&#8221; wrote Bellini,  who is expecting a 2
cent, or 10 percent, higher dividend. &#8220;As such, given that
operating income only grew 3 percent in fiscal 2012 versus 12
percent in fiscal 2011, we also would expect the dividend
increase to moderate from the 25 percent increase.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Smaller Boost &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Wootton, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft, declined to comment. The company has increased the
dividend regularly since it began payouts in 2003 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About $54 billion of Microsoft&#8217;s cash and equivalents was
held overseas and &#8220;would be subject to material repatriation
tax effects&#8221; if the company were to shift it back to the U.S.
for uses such as the dividend, the software maker said in a July
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A smaller increase could disappoint some investors since
Microsoft options have a 3-cent dividend priced in to them,
Bellini said, citing calculations by Goldman&#8217;s options
strategists. Currently Microsoft has a dividend yield of 2.6
percent, less than more than half of the companies in the Dow
Jones Industrial Average. Still its yield is larger than many of
its technology rivals such as Oracle Corp. (ORCL) and International
Business Machines Corp. (IBM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bellini also said she doesn&#8217;t expect a significant number
of shares to be repurchased in the current fiscal year.
Microsoft has about $8.2 billion remaining in the last share
buyback program approved by the board, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg dividend forecasts look at seven criteria,
including dividend history and public estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s shares have increased 18 percent this year. The
shares fell less than one percent to $30.74 at the close in New
York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New bank regulations and capital
requirements are &#8220;structural&#8221; changes to the industry that are
more to blame for declining profits than the U.S. economic
slump, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The operating environment is unlikely to change any time
soon, and we see shareholders of challenged banks becoming more
demanding in asking management teams to lay out a path to
unlocking value in the near term,&#8221; analysts led by Richard Ramsden in New York wrote in a report published today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their view contrasts with Goldman Sachs Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, who said in November, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
think we can conclude that the slowdown is secular rather than
cyclical change.&#8221; Goldman Sachs, based in New York, is the
fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than half of the top 25 U.S. banks aren&#8217;t earning
enough to cover their cost of capital, leading to stock prices
that are &#8220;significantly lagging previous global recoveries,&#8221;
according to the note. &#8220;The vast majority of the reduction
relative to pre-crisis levels is attributable to structural
issues like deleveraging and regulatory reform.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, the sixth-biggest U.S. bank, and similar
firms could improve returns by shrinking businesses like fixed-
income trading and distressed-mortgage investing that require
high levels of capital, according to the note. Using that
capital to buy back shares instead &#8220;could be meaningfully
accretive to shareholders,&#8221; the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CVC Capital Partners Ltd. and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) have proposed a debt-for-equity swap at
Nine Entertainment Co. that would hand control of the Australian
media company to its creditors, said two people with knowledge
of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the proposal, Nine&#8217;s senior lenders, including
private-equity firms Apollo Global Management LLC (APO) and Oaktree
Capital Group LLC (OAK), would control about 70 percent of the
restructured company, said the people, who declined to be
identified as the details are private. So-called mezzanine debt
funds managed by New York-based Goldman Sachs would hold most of
the remainder, while CVC would keep a small stake, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CVC&#8217;s Asia-Pacific unit is proposing the plan ahead of a
February deadline to refinance a A$2.8 billion ($2.9 billion)
loan it took on when buying Nine. The buyout firm would lose
most of the about A$1.9 billion of equity it put into Nine,
which owns one of Australia&#8217;s three commercial free-to-air
television networks, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for London-based CVC and Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to messages seeking comment. The Australian
Financial Review reported the proposal earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CVC last week agreed to sell Nine&#8217;s Australian magazine
unit to Germany&#8217;s Bauer Media Group for more than A$500 million,
according to a person familiar with the matter. The sale is part
of CVC&#8217;s push to reduce Nine&#8217;s debt, an effort that also
included an unsuccessful attempt to sell the Ticketek agency,
according to people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nine, which also owns half of the NineMSN digital business,
reported A$415 million in earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and goodwill amortization for the year through June
2011, CVC said on Dec. 8. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Retail Federation said
it will try to block a settlement of as much as $7.25 billion
with Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) over the fees they charge
stores when customers pay with credit cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Washington-based group, which represents more than
9,000 retailers, said the proposed settlement of merchants&#8217;
price-fixing claims does nothing to prevent Visa and MasterCard
from raising the so-called swipe fees in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents of the deal will be able to file papers formally
seeking a judge&#8217;s approval ahead of an Oct. 19 deadline, lawyers
for the plaintiffs said today in federal court in Brooklyn, New
York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will try to find the most forceful way we can to let
the court know that this deal is so unfair that it needs to be
rejected at the outset,&#8221; Mallory Duncan, the group&#8217;s general
counsel, said today in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement, which must be approved by a federal judge,
would put to rest about seven years of litigation over
allegations that San Francisco-based Visa and Purchase, New
York-based MasterCard conspired to fix the fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At today&#8217;s hearing on the status of the settlement, U.S.
Magistrate Judge James Orenstein rejected a request for
information made by a lawyer, Jeffrey Shinder, who is
representing some of the objecting groups, including the
National Cooperative Grocers Association and the National
Association of Convenience Stores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Premature&#8217; Request &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orenstein said Shinder&#8217;s request seeking full access to the
court record in the case was &#8220;premature.&#8221;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K. Craig Wildfang, a lawyer for the plaintiffs who is
advocating for the settlement, said after the hearing that he is
&#8220;absolutely&#8221; confident the deal will move forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is not really the way class actions get resolved,&#8221;
he said about NRF&#8217;s opposition. &#8220;We don&#8217;t really take a vote.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trish Wexler, a spokeswoman for the Electronic Payments
Coalition, which favors the settlement, said that the NRF and
other groups have &#8220;political ulterior motives&#8221; for opposing
the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Senator Richard Durbin&#8217;s office has told retailers
that they may lose out on legislative opportunities to rein in
credit-card fees if they support the settlement. Durbin, a
Democrat from Illinois, secured the inclusion of limits on swipe
fees for debit cards in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, trimming
revenue for the largest U.S. banks by about $8 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Possible Competition &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opposition may also be related to recently announced
efforts to establish payment networks that may compete with Visa
and MasterCard, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a conference call on July 25, Visa Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Joseph W. Saunders told investors that he
expected a federal judge to grant preliminary approval to the
settlement this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa executives &#8220;remain confident&#8221; that the settlement
will be approved, Chief Financial Officer Byron Pollitt said
today at an investor conference in Las Vegas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re getting a lot of noise, and I think we will
continue to have a lot of noise with regards to the merchants&#8217;
side not being happy with the suit or the settlement,&#8221; Pollitt
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant
Discount Antitrust Litigation, 05-md-01720, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO) is spicing up its
struggle with PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) for dominance in India, the company&#8217;s
fastest growing major market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s biggest soft-drinks maker is reviving RimZim, a
&#8220;masala soda&#8221; flavored with cumin and other spices shelved
after its 1993 takeover of local rival Parle Group. Coke is
bringing back old brands and expanding distribution networks as 
part of a $5 billion drive in India, where its sales per capita 
are one-seventh the global average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola has struggled to replicate the global success of
its eponymous cola, which trails Pepsi in India as well as Thums
Up -- another Parle acquisition. Brands appealing to local
tastes and investment in Parle&#8217;s old bottling and logistics
systems are crucial to meet Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent&#8217;s target of doubling worldwide revenue this decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To be first to reach out to the entire mass of India is a
virgin opportunity,&#8221; said Ankur Bisen, associate vice
president, at Technopak Advisors Pvt., a Gurgaon, India-based
firm that advises consumer companies. &#8220;There are still many
pockets that most of these soft drinks have not gone to.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dilapidated infrastructure means Coca-Cola is only reaching
about one in five, or 1.7 million, of the potential outlets.
That&#8217;s higher than PepsiCo, which says it has 1.2 million and
wants double that in five years. Coke says it aims to be in at
least one in three outlets within three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s 1.2 billion people on average consume 12 Coca-Cola
beverages a year, compared with a global figure of 92. With
about 350 million people aged under 15 -- more than the combined
populations of Brazil and Mexico -- and the changing lifestyle
that goes with economic growth and urbanization, the potential
for the Indian beverage industry is &#8220;unlimited,&#8221; said Arun Kejriwal, a director of advisory firm Kejriwal Research 
Investment Services Pvt. in Mumbai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;$7.5 Billion &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s market for soft drinks is expected to expand to
$7.2 billion in 2015 from $3.1 billion in 2010, according to
Euromonitor International. China&#8217;s will rise to $79 billion from
$40.2 billion in the same period, the London-based researcher
estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets outside the U.S. are increasingly important as
consumption of fizzy drinks there declines. The volume of
carbonated soft drinks sold in the U.S. fell 1 percent in 2011
to about 9.27 billion cases, the lowest level since 1996,
according to trade publication Beverage Digest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 80 percent of operating income at Coca-Cola came from
outside North America last year. PepsiCo got 55 percent of its
pretax income outside the U.S., according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Indian Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola said in July that Indian sales by volume in the
second quarter of this year jumped 20 percent. Its share of the
Indian carbonated-beverage market rose to 60 percent last year,
from 55 percent in 2005, Euromonitor data shows. PepsiCo&#8217;s share
declined to 37.2 percent from 41 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atlanta, Georgia-based Coca-Cola quit India in 1977 after
the government demanded companies reveal ingredients in their
products -- which would have forced Coke to hand over its secret
cola formula. It returned in 1993, four years behind PepsiCo.
Both companies have been dogged by accusations that their drinks
were contaminated with pesticides and their bottling operations
depleted water tables. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PepsiCo hasn&#8217;t ceded ground easily. Gautham Mukkavilli, who
heads its India business, estimates sales grew &#8220;double digits&#8221;
in 16 of the past 22 quarters. Like its competitor, PepsiCo is
boosting distribution and relaunching brands purchased in the
1994 takeover of 105-year-old Indian soft-drinks maker Duke 
Sons Ltd. for an undisclosed amount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepsi has re-introduced Duke&#8217;s Masala Soda brand, and is
testing a spiced lemonade under its 7-Up brand called Nimbooz
Masala Soda, Mukkavilli said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;National Network &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, in Parle, Coca-Cola acquired 54 bottlers and a
national distribution system. Duke was focused on the western
state of Maharashtra, said Harish Bijoor, whose Harish Bijoor
Consults Inc. in Bangalore advises companies on brands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coke CEO Kent on a June visit to New Delhi said the company
and its local partners plan to spend $5 billion in India by
2020, part of which will be on new trucks, refrigerators and
bottling plants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emphasis will be on Coke&#8217;s &#8220;distribution network, to
make it stronger, and on its advertising and marketing, so that
it can reach more people,&#8221; said Sananda Mukhopadhyay, an
analyst at Netscribes Inc., a consultancy company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PepsiCo has spent $1 billion in India over the past four
years and hasn&#8217;t announced any new investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thums Up &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parle also gave Coca-Cola India&#8217;s two favorite drinks at
that time. Sales of Thums Up, a cola with a stronger flavor and
more carbonation than others, grew 15 percent in 2011, the
company said in its annual report, and had a 5.9 percent market
share. Maaza, a mango drink, accounted for 5.5 percent of non-
alcoholic beverage sales after an 11 percent jump last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thums Up finally lost its top spot last year -- to Coca-
Cola&#8217;s Sprite, which held a 6.1 percent share of the market.
Leveraging off its bigger distribution network, Sprite outsells
7-Up by more than two-to-one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola is now preparing to resurrect a lime beverage
acquired with Parle called Citra -- selling it at a price 30
percent below Sprite&#8217;s to take on cheaper local brands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola&#8217;s trademark Coke held a 3.2 percent market share
in India, behind Pepsi&#8217;s 5.4 percent, according to Euromonitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s standard-bearer accounted for 49 percent of
worldwide sales by volume, according to Coca-Cola&#8217;s annual
report for 2011. That&#8217;s down from 51 percent in 2009. Growing
concerns over obesity and diabetes are also shifting consumers
to juices and less sugary drinks globally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nostalgic Taste &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six decades after Coca-Cola first branched out into new
beverages with its orange-flavored soda Fanta, the company has
more than 500 brands worldwide, tailored to local tastes,
according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Rimzim, I loved it!&#8221; said Nikhil Kumar, 29, New Delhi-
based managing director at The Storytellers Pvt., a public-
relations company. &#8220;For me and my friends, it will be
nostalgic, it&#8217;ll bring back some memories. It&#8217;s a really good,
typical Indian drink.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sprint Nextel Corp. (S), poised to
potentially acquire the smaller competitors in the U.S. wireless
industry, may have success going after a prepaid carrier like
MetroPCS (PCS) Communications Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That kind of deal would be easier to complete than trying
to buy T-Mobile USA Inc., a larger carrier that ATT Inc. failed
to acquire last year, Jason Armstrong, a Goldman Sachs analyst
in New York, said yesterday in a report. Sprint&#8217;s soaring stock
price, which has more than doubled this year, is stoking
speculation that some kind of deal will happen, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprint&#8217;s balance sheet, particularly its $21 billion in
gross debt, would make an acquisition of T-Mobile USA
impractical, Armstrong said. Either MetroPCS or Leap Wireless
International Inc. (LEAP), another pay-as-you-go carrier, are the more
probable takeover candidates, he said. Sprint and T-Mobile USA
also could form a network-sharing agreement, letting them
compete more effectively with Verizon Wireless and ATT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Sprint takeover of T-Mobile is &#8220;aspirational,&#8221; rather
than likely, said Armstrong, who has a neutral rating on the
shares. &#8220;A smaller prepaid-centric deal may be the more logical
route for now if Sprint determines to pursue MA.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprint and T-Mobile rank a distant third and fourth in the
U.S. wireless industry, with a combined 27 percent of the
revenue generated by national carriers, according to Goldman
Sachs. Verizon ranks first, with 37 percent, and ATT is second,
accounting for 35 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott Sloat, a spokesman for Overland Park, Kansas-based
Sprint, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprint shares fell 2.9 percent to $5 at the close in New
York, breaking a four-day streak of gains. The stock has climbed
114 percent in 2012. MetroPCS, up 16 percent this year, rose 3
percent to $10.06 today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) and Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s
bapineuzumab, an experimental drug that failed to help
Alzheimer&#8217;s symptoms in a study, showed signs of reducing
physical damage in the brain, according to a deeper analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medicine lessened a measure of nerve cell damage in the
brain and the buildup of amyloid plaque, hallmarks of
Alzheimer&#8217;s, in people who are genetically predisposed to the
disease, the research found. Test results released last month
showed that bapineuzumab and a similar drug from Eli Lilly 
Co. (LLY), solanezumab, didn&#8217;t improve patients&#8217; memory or thinking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s report at a medical meeting in Sweden renews hope
that medicines designed to attack amyloid may be beneficial when
given before irreparable harm occurs to brain cells, said Reisa
Sperling, a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School.
U.S.-funded studies testing the theory in high-risk people are
being planned and may take three to five years to complete. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The disease begins 10 to 20 years before there are any
symptoms, and now we are better at detecting some of those
changes,&#8221; said Steve Salloway, director of Neurology and the
Memory and Aging Program at Butler Hospital and professor of
neurology at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.
&#8220;Drugs like this that lower amyloid will probably have their
greatest impact earlier on. We have to test that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer gained less than 1 percent to $24.17 at the close in
New York while JJ also rose less than 1 percent to $68.20.
Pfizer has increased 32 percent in the past 12 months, while JJ
has advanced 7.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Profit Delayed &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drugs to slow the progression of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease could
have created a market worth $20 billion, said Barbara Ryan, an
analyst with Deutsche Bank, in a June note to clients. It will
take years for additional studies to determine if the drugs
prevent disease when given earlier, eating into their patent
lives. A positive result would create an even larger market as
more people take the medicines for longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research led by New Brunswick, New Jersey-based JJ was
presented at the European Federation of Neurological Societies
meeting in Stockholm. Two additional clinical trials conducted
outside the U.S. by New York-based Pfizer were halted last
month. The companies are still studying a version of the drug
that&#8217;s given as a shot, rather than intravenously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings are weak and at best suggestive that targeting
amyloid may be beneficial, said Erik Gordon, a professor at the
University of Michigan&#8217;s Ross School of Business, in an e-mail.
While the idea that amyloid is a trigger for Alzheimer&#8217;s disease
is popular, it hasn&#8217;t been proven, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Slimmest Threads&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are so desperate, given the failures in Alzheimer&#8217;s,
that we cling to the slimmest threads,&#8221; Gordon said. &#8220;Trials
that are failures but not total failures are considered
successes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are about 5.4 million Americans with Alzheimer&#8217;s
disease, and the number is expected to surge as the population
ages, according to the Alzheimer&#8217;s Association. The only drugs
available currently for the condition temporarily treat its
symptoms, rather than slowing or reversing it the brain-wasting
disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One study involved about 1,100 people with mild-to-moderate
Alzheimer&#8217;s who had a gene known as ApoE4 that puts them at risk
for the condition and leads to increased amyloid buildup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients getting bapineuzumab had significantly less
amyloid in the brain on advanced imaging tests and lower levels
of phospho-tau in their spinal fluid, a marker of nerve cell
injury, said Sperling, who led one of the studies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Brain Fluid &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug didn&#8217;t appear to slow brain shrinkage, the study
found. About 15 percent of patients getting bapineuzumab
developed a condition marked by fluid leaking into the brain
from blood vessels, compared with 0.2 percent of placebo
patients. Most had no symptoms, and many were able to resume
taking the drug after a break in treatment. Seizures were also
more common in the drug-treated patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six bapineuzumab patients developed cancer and died,
compared with none of those getting a placebo, the study found.
A panel of safety experts reviewed the cancer finding and looked
at the results of other studies as well. No one cancer stood out
and the increased risk ebbed when the data from all the research
was collated, Sperling said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bapineuzumab is affecting the brain at the intended target
and may influence the biology of the disease, Sperling said.
Declining levels of phospho-tau, also a chemical sign of
Alzheimer&#8217;s progression that is measured in cerebral spinal
fluid, are compelling, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Earlier Treatment &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have seen that in people who are already in advanced
stages of Alzheimer&#8217;s, it&#8217;s very hard to move this disease,&#8221;
said Maria Carrillo, the Alzheimer&#8217;s Association&#8217;s director of
medical and scientific relations. &#8220;The scientific community is
recognizing that the potential we are looking for, a delay in
the disease progression, may come if we go earlier.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors are getting new tools that allow them to peer into
the brain to detect Alzheimer&#8217;s disease based on amyloid buildup
that starts years before symptoms. Amyvid from Indianapolis-
based Lilly won U.S. approval earlier this year to help spot the
protein deposits that previously were found only during autopsy.
General Electric Co., based in Fairfield, Connecticut, says it
will file for a similar product by the end of 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers haven&#8217;t yet analyzed the data to determine
whether patients with the mildest symptoms, presumably earlier
in the disease process, fared better than those with moderate
levels of dementia, Salloway said. Additional analysis for
biological markers of the disease also is under way, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Second Study &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second study, involving 1,331 patients without the
ApoE4 gene, included two different doses of bapineuzumab. The
researchers found no differences in amyloid buildup, phospho-tau
or brain volume, Salloway said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients getting the higher dose had lower phospho-tau
levels and there was a trend in the imaging scans for less
amyloid buildup in the brain, Salloway said in a telephone
interview. The risk of fluid buildup and bleeding in the brain
and seizures rose in conjunction with the drug dose, though
there weren&#8217;t more cancer deaths in bapineuzumab patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While patients in the study were considered to have mild or
moderate dementia, it&#8217;s important to fully understand what that
means, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s mild in the degree of dementia, but it&#8217;s not mild in
terms of what is happening in the brain,&#8221; he said. &#8220;To be
diagnosed with dementia, you have to have significant impairment
and neuronal injury.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that amyloid triggers a cascade of events that
damage the brain is the leading hypothesis for the cause of
Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, said Ronald Petersen, a neurologist at the
Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now researchers need to determine if stopping the amyloid
earlier will improve the health of patients, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is encouraging, but the proof is in the pudding down
the road here,&#8221; he said in an interview. &#8220;Now we need to
determine if it has a biological effect that leads to
prevention.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A trading loss that almost sent
Knight Capital Group Inc. (KCG) into bankruptcy may spur regulatory
changes to protect against future errors by &#8220;knuckleheads,&#8221;
Knight Chief Executive Officer Thomas Joyce said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knight was rescued by an investor group after a computer
malfunction caused a $440 million trading loss on Aug. 1. The
mistake resulted from Knight software that wasn&#8217;t properly
installed as the market maker prepared for a new NYSE Euronext (NYX)
program meant to attract retail investors, Joyce said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators and market participants may examine whether
trading curbs that focus on sudden price moves for individual
stocks and exchange-traded funds should also consider volume,
Joyce said. A review of the so-called clearly erroneous
execution policy, which spells out when trades can be canceled
by exchanges, is also likely as the securities industry assesses
the Knight error, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s no reason to put a firm at risk because some
knucklehead or series of knuckleheads at the firm made a big
mistake,&#8221; Joyce said today at a Barclays Plc conference in New
York. &#8220;If there&#8217;s an error, you should be able to fix an
error.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) was hired to review
Knight&#8217;s development process and is expected to deliver a report
to Knight&#8217;s board in the next three months, Joyce said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clients Return &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the company&#8217;s share of volume in equities and ETFs
plunged on the day of the Aug. 1 error, &#8220;Knight has largely
regained market share, and we did it within two weeks,&#8221; Joyce
said. Resolving trading problems and getting new financing is
&#8220;all for nothing if the clients don&#8217;t return,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jersey City, New Jersey-based company received a $400
million cash infusion through the sale of convertible equity a
week after the trading loss. Shares outstanding nearly doubled
to 181.7 million as Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF), one of the brokerages
which arranged the bailout, converted almost all of its
preferred stock this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knight had $510 million in cash as of Aug. 31, up from $365
million on June 30, according to today&#8217;s presentation. The
company chose equity over debt because it would result in &#8220;a
much healthier balance sheet,&#8221; Joyce said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Deeply Embarrassed&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joyce, who is also chairman of Knight, said he was &#8220;deeply
embarrassed&#8221; his company&#8217;s Aug. 1 fiasco added to mishaps such
as Nasdaq Stock Market&#8217;s botched initial public offering of
Facebook Inc. that helped fray retail investors&#8217; confidence in
markets. A software bug that went undetected led Knight to
generate orders &#8220;unrestricted by volume caps,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 90 percent of clients using Knight&#8217;s market-
making and broker-dealer services are again trading with the
firm, Chris Allen and Joe Recendez, analysts at Evercore
Partners Inc. (EVR), wrote in a Sept. 5 note. More than 70 percent of
institutions have also returned, with more expected after
&#8220;internal credit reviews&#8221; are conducted this month, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knight shares rose 1.1 percent to $2.70 today in New York
trading. The stock is down 74 percent since the day before the
software error. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading curbs implemented after the May 6, 2010, flash
crash in which the Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU) plunged 9.2
percent before recovering, temporarily halt stocks if they fall
10 percent within five minutes. Joyce said regulators may
consider extending the so-called single-stock circuit breakers
to securities experiencing unusual trading volume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I do think we will have a regulatory review of volume
circuit breakers and a regulatory review of how one handles an
error,&#8221; Joyce said. &#8220;Make no mistake -- this was an error.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NYSE &#8216;Hamstrung&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the New York Stock Exchange was willing to consider
canceling more trades for stocks listed on its market during
Knight&#8217;s problems on Aug. 1, the Securities and Exchange
Commission nixed the idea due to transaction-voiding rules
enacted after the May 2010 plunge, Joyce said. The regulations
&#8220;hamstrung&#8221; NYSE, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kill switches, or mechanisms that enable an exchange or
broker to shut off all trading from a firm, are also likely
prospects as regulators and industry participants review
problems such as the Knight technology glitch, Joyce said. He
cautioned that stopping all trades from a firm when a problem
occurs in one business segment could hurt clients operating
through another unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Biggest Issue&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-held industry concerns about &#8220;regulatory risk&#8221; and
the damage that government agencies can do to the businesses of
banks and brokers may have been supplanted by fears of
operational risk like the incident that nearly crippled Knight,
Joyce said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I was mistaken,&#8221; Joyce said. &#8220;Regulatory risk was not
our biggest issue.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knight will announce a new chief risk officer soon,
according to Joyce. The person will be responsible for market,
credit and operational risk, and the company will add staff to
support the changes being made, he said. Financial firms need to
focus on operational-risk issues at the board, management and
governance levels, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, trading mistakes can&#8217;t be eradicated
completely by efforts to avoid errors, Joyce said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s any great way you can unearth
somebody&#8217;s mistake ahead of time,&#8221; Joyce said. &#8220;People do
stupid things and it&#8217;s sad and I wish we could regulate against
that, but I don&#8217;t see that completely happening.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knight will soon shift to thinking strategically about the
company&#8217;s businesses after fixing problems identified in the
wake of the August loss, Joyce said. He added that the company
aims to be smarter and stronger after what he described as the
&#8220;most dramatic&#8221; event in Knight&#8217;s history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The present moment is a good one to reassess not just
technology but all of Knight&#8217;s operations and offerings,&#8221; Joyce
said. &#8220;Everybody will have to go through a bit of a burden of
proof to make sure that the businesses they have are utilizing
capital properly and that priority No. 1 remains taking care of
our clients properly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The zloty rallied to the strongest
level in two weeks after JPMorgan Chase  Co. raised its view on
the Polish currency and the country sold debt yesterday at a
record-low yield. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The zloty jumped as much as 0.6 percent to 4.0973 per euro,
the highest since Aug. 28, and traded at 4.0970 as of 4:16 p.m.
in Warsaw. The yield on 10-year bonds fell two basis points to
4.81 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan raised its stance on the zloty to neutral from
underweight. The government sold notes maturing in 2023 at a
record-low yield of 3.175 percent, Deputy Finance Minister
Wojciech Kowalczyk said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. The
demand reached $8 billion, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poland&#8217;s $2 billion sale of bonds yesterday showed &#8220;large
foreign interest&#8221; in the country&#8217;s debt by overseas investors
which should &#8220;sustain good sentiment on local markets,&#8221;
economists at Bank Pekao SA (PEO) including Marcin Mrowiec in Warsaw,
said in an e-mailed note to clients today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The zloty&#8217;s appreciation today has extended its advance to
9.1 percent this year, the fourth-steepest appreciation among
more than 20 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The zloty has become more attractive because of the
&#8220;diminishing concerns surrounding the current account deficit
and bond valuations,&#8221; George Christou and Laura Bierer,
strategists at JPMorgan, said in an e-mailed report today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors in Treasuries remained
bullish this week, betting that the prices of the securities
will rise while cutting neutral positions, according to a survey
by JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proportion of net longs was at 8 percentage points in
the week ending yesterday, according to JPMorgan. The figure is
down from 10 percentage points in the previous week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The percent of outright longs rose to 23 percent, up from
21 percent the previous week, and the most since July 23, the
survey said. The percent of outright shorts, or bets the
securities will fall in value, rose to 15 percent from 11
percent, reaching the most since June 18, the survey reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors cut neutral bets to 62 percent from 68 percent,
the survey reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year note rose two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.68 percent at 7:56 a.m.
in New York. The yield rose 12 basis points last week. It
touched a record low of 1.379 percent on July 25 and reached a
2012 high of 2.4 percent on March 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan doesn&#8217;t disclose the number of clients in the
survey. Srini Ramaswamy, a JPMorgan strategist in New York,
wasn&#8217;t immediately available to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael C. Keats, a former managing
director in Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s legal department, joined
law firm Kirkland  Ellis LLP as a litigation partner this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keats, 43, was associate general counsel in the litigation
and regulatory proceedings group at Goldman Sachs, which he
joined in 2007, according to a statement on the law firm&#8217;s
website. He was previously a securities and global enforcement
partner in O&#8217;Melveny  Myers LLP&#8217;s New York office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;His experience at Goldman Sachs during a period of
extraordinary change and enforcement activity on Wall Street
will be a tremendous asset to our clients,&#8221; Jeffrey C. Hammes,
chairman of Kirkland&#8217;s global management executive committee,
said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the most profitable securities firm in Wall
Street history before converting to a bank in 2008, paid $550
million last year to settle a fraud accusation from the
Securities and Exchange Commission and was accused by the U.S.
Senate&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of misleading
clients. The Justice Department said last month that it wouldn&#8217;t
pursue criminal charges against New York-based Goldman Sachs
related to information uncovered by the Senate subcommittee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank, named Carlos Hernandez head of investor services and
announced new leadership for the corporate and investment bank
division formed in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hernandez, who had run equities, takes over a business that
combines the New York-based firm&#8217;s prime-brokerage, financing
and securities-services units, JPMorgan said today in a memo
obtained by Bloomberg News. Tim Throsby, who led equity
derivatives, will take over as head of equities, according to
the memo, the contents of which were confirmed by Jennifer Zuccarelli, a company spokeswoman. The Wall Street Journal
reported the appointments earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shook up its top management in July following a
$5.8 billion trading loss in its chief investment office, naming
Daniel Pinto and Mike Cavanagh to lead the corporate and
investment bank. That division combined the investment bank,
corporate bank and treasury and securities-services units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which made more revenue from fixed-income trading
than any other bank in the world last year, won&#8217;t have heads of
fixed-income, a role previously held by Pinto and Matt Zames,
now co-chief operating officer of the company. Troy Rohrbaugh
will lead the rates, foreign-exchange and public-finance parts
of fixed-income, while Guy America will run credit trading and
Matt Cherwin will head securitized products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blythe Masters will continue to run commodities trading,
and also will lead regulatory affairs for the corporate and
investment bank, reporting to Barry Zubrow. James Kenny will
head emerging markets and the special opportunities group. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the largest computer services provider, has bolstered its
social networking tool for companies by integrating e-mail and
adding a news feed with Twitter Inc. and Facebook Inc. (FB) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enhanced product, called Connections, enables streaming
from social networks alongside business capabilities, such as
document authorization, reporting expenses and reviewing e-
mails, IBM said in a statement today. The Armonk, New York-based
company is also adding more tools to the mobile version of the
service, including location tracking, said Alistair Rennie,
general manager of social business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You need to have a platform that is really social,
powered by very deep analytics and ready to integrate business
information into the stream in real time,&#8221; Rennie said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s an area we&#8217;re fairly serious about
investing in.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is betting the enhanced service, which features
analytical tools, will gain customers in the face of increasing
competition from companies including Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM) and
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), which in July bought Yammer Inc., a Facebook-
like corporate networking tool. Social network services will
help IBM make $16 billion from business analytics by 2015, the
company has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connections will also integrate tools IBM gained through
acquisitions, tying in capabilities from Kenexa Corp. (KNXA), a maker
of Web-based human-resources and recruiting services, which it
is buying for about $1.3 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s service, which debuted in 2007, now counts Primerica
Inc. (PRI), the life insurer formerly owned by Citigroup Inc. (C),
Colgate-Palmolive Co. (CL) and Bayer AG among its users. Connections
works for both internal communication and for interacting with
customers, Rennie said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is opening offices in Manila and Sao Paolo to support
customers in emerging markets using social network tools, the
company also said today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. economists are
trying their hand at &#8220;nowcasting&#8221; to measure the health of the
world economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new index, produced by economists led by New York-based
Bruce Kasman, calculates global growth by combining purchasing
manager indicators, retail and auto sales, industrial production
and capital goods shipments as data are published each month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gauge explains 85 percent of the variation in worldwide
expansions from the start of 2000 to the second quarter, the
economists said in a Sept. 5 report. A previous measure based on
PMI data from multiple countries had a 67 percent success rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The index &#8220;is a remarkably good tracker of global real
gross domestic product growth,&#8221; they wrote. &#8220;The addition of
new information over the quarter yields a marked improvement in
the forecasting accuracy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their measure points to 2 percent global growth in the
current quarter, about the same as JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s official
estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embracing nowcasting, which Kasman and colleagues define as
tracking current-quarter growth rather than forecasting future
quarters, is a mounting trend, say economists including Marta
Banbura of the European Central Bank and Lucrezia Reichlin of
Now-Casting Economics Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The traditional approach is limited since it does not
provide a framework for the reading of the flow of data as they
become available,&#8221; the two economists said in a paper published
this month by the London-based Centre for Economic Policy
Research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * * &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current floor for oil prices averaging about $90 a
barrel may become a ceiling over the next decade as new sources
of supply are tapped, according to Edward Morse, head of
commodities research at Citigroup Global Markets in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. companies are now spending six times what they were a
decade ago to find and develop oil and gas, while Canada has
access to oil sands producing 2 million barrels a day. Like the
U.S., Brazil, African nations and &#8220;perhaps&#8221; even China are
probing deep-water resources, Morse wrote in a Sept. 12 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking advantage of such supplies becomes attractive when
oil costs more than $75 a barrel, meaning so long as it does
supply will outpace consumption on a sustained basis for the
first time in more than 20 years, said Morse, a former U.S.
State Department adviser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * * &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who let Eastern Europe be flooded with investment, helping
create the region&#8217;s subsequent recession? That&#8217;s the subject of
a study by International Monetary Fund economists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data from about 20 countries in the region show it received
a capital inflow that at the 2007 peak equaled 15 percent of
regional gross domestic product, IMF economists Ruben Atoyan,
Albert Jaeger and Dustin Smith wrote in a Sept. 11 working
paper. That was three times the relative size of flows into all
other emerging economies combined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still &#8220;in a state of ferment&#8221; is the question of whether
the subsequent asset bubbles were the fault of greedy investors,
unfocused regulators or free-spending governments. In any case,
tighter fiscal policies wouldn&#8217;t have stemmed inflows, the
economists conclude. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While forceful countercyclical fiscal policies could have
slowed down capital inflows, this would not have been effective
in countering inflows of the magnitude faced by some of the
countries,&#8221; the researchers wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * * &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consumption choices of the poor may be doing little to
lift them out of poverty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s the finding of a study published this week in
Economic Journal by Omer Moav of the Hebrew University of
Jerusalem and Zvika Neeman of Tel Aviv University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Poor families around the world spend a large fraction of
their income consuming goods that do not appear to alleviate
poverty, while saving at low rates,&#8221; Moav and Neeman wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They cited reports that found median spending on festivals
runs as high as 10 percent of income in some regions of India
and that black households in South Africa spend on average a
year&#8217;s income on an adult&#8217;s funeral. At the same time, the very
poor spend as little as 2 percent of their income on their
children&#8217;s education and don&#8217;t eat well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While cultures or social norms could influence spending
decisions, Moav and Neeman concluded the people are committing
&#8220;conspicuous consumption&#8221; by meeting their society&#8217;s
expectations regardless of income. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the lender
that plunged as much as 24 percent in the month after disclosing
a multibillion-dollar trading loss, has erased that decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s stock climbed 3.7 percent to $41.40 yesterday in
New York, eclipsing the $40.74 closing price of May 10, when
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon announced what was then a
trading loss of about $2 billion at the chief investment office
in London. The loss this year now stands at $5.8 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wrong-way bets on derivatives are the focus of an
escalating investigation by a U.S. Senate panel and at least 11
agencies, including the Justice Department and Securities and
Exchange Commission. The stock remains 6.6 percent below the
April 5 close, when Bloomberg News first reported the lender had
amassed an illiquid position on credit derivatives, and is the
second-worst performer in the 24-company KBW Bank Index. (BKX) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Though the loss was quite large, it was a loss that was
not systemic to their investment-securities portfolio or their
capital-markets operations,&#8221; said Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at
RBC Capital Markets who rates the shares outperform. &#8220;The
bigger picture for the company has and continues to improve.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) has
stopped offering two-year contracts to its most junior
investment bankers, typically new college graduates, ending a
quarter-century practice, a company spokesman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyst-level recruits at Goldman Sachs&#8217;s investment
banking and investment management divisions for 2013 aren&#8217;t
receiving the contracts, which typically ended with either a job
offer at the firm or a move to graduate school or another
company, said David Wells, a spokesman in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will continue to provide the skills and time needed to
understand our hiring and developing the careers of analysts in
our banking and investment management divisions,&#8221; Wells said.
&#8220;Making this change allows us to emphasize the longer-term
career opportunities available at the firm.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-year contracts will continue to be used for analyst-
level employees in the sales and trading and research divisions,
Wells said. He declined to say how many people are employed in
the analyst programs. The Wall Street Journal reported the
recruitment policy change earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street firms have been seeking ways to reduce employee
costs, even at the most junior levels. The practice of providing
junior bankers with automatic annual pay increases came under
review at firms including Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) and Goldman
Sachs earlier this year, people familiar with the deliberations
said in January. &lt;/p&gt;

Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical Co. (600267) plans to hire 600 people in
China by the end of the year, its chief executive officer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hisun-Pfizer Pharmaceuticals Co., is seeking employees for
manufacturing, research and development, commercial and support
functions such as finance, Chief Executive Officer Kevin Xiao
said in a phone interview yesterday. Hisun-Pfizer aims to have
about 1,000 employees in the world&#8217;s most populous nation by
December, and around 1,500 by the end of 2013, Xiao said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are trying to attract appropriate people for the
positions,&#8221; said Xiao, who was previously a general manager at
New York-based Pfizer&#8217;s China business. &#8220;So far, in the sales
force, we have more Pfizer people, but in manufacturing, it&#8217;s
the other way around.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, holds a 49 percent
stake in the venture, while Zhejiang Hisun holds the rest. The
companies signed the framework agreement for the venture in
February during Chinese vice-president Xi Jinping&#8217;s visit to the
U.S. Xi and former U.S. Secretary of Commerce John Bryson
attended the signing ceremony, the companies said in a statement
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The venture has a total investment of $295 million and
registered capital of $250 million, the companies said. The
venture will offer products for cardiovascular disease,
infectious disease, oncology, and mental health, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These are two totally different companies -- one state-
owned, the other one a big multinational,&#8221; Xiao said. &#8220;We need
to balance the foreign and local culture, practice and mindset.
That&#8217;s a pretty big challenge for us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-biggest
U.S. oil company, agreed with YPF SA (YPFD), the nationalized Argentine
oil producer, to develop oil and natural-gas wells in the
country&#8217;s Vaca Muerta shale formation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YPF and San Ramon, California-based Chevron also agreed to
study the recovery of oil from aging wells through new
technologies, the Buenos Aires-based company said today in an e-
mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is the first step for a long relationship,&#8221; YPF
Chief Executive Officer Miguel Galuccio said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galuccio on Aug. 30 unveiled three types of partnerships to
tap the Vaca Muerta shale formation, a Connecticut-size area in
southern Argentina that contains at least 23 billion barrels of
oil. YPF is seeking financial and strategic partners and
operators for its $37.2 billion business plan to boost
production, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spain&#8217;s Repsol SA said it plans to take legal action
against the development accord. The Argentine government seized
51 percent of YPF from Repsol in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Repsol will take legal action against this agreement,
which our legal team is currently studying,&#8221; Kristian Rix, a
Repsol spokesman, said today in a telephone interview from
Madrid. &#8220;We will not let third parties benefit from illegally
confiscated assets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shale Agreements &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Craig, a spokesman for Chevron&#8217;s operations in Africa
and Latin America, declined to comment on Repsol&#8217;s legal action
in an e-mail. Pablo Dorfman, a YPF spokesman, declined to
comment in an e-mail statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repsol is seeking as much as $10 billion in compensation
from the government takeover. The Madrid-based company still
owns a 12 percent stake in YPF, making it the second-biggest
shareholder behind the Argentine government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shale accord with Chevron is the third obtained by YPF
since it was seized by the government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galuccio said on Aug. 30 the company had signed a $500
million deal with local businessman Eduardo Eurnekian to develop
wells in Vaca Muerta. It also said it had signed a deal with
Bridas Corp., a joint venture between China&#8217;s Cnooc Ltd. and
Argentina&#8217;s Bulgheroni family, without elaborating on how much
money was involved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YPF and Chevron didn&#8217;t provide additional details on
today&#8217;s accord. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron has had an ongoing, collaborative relationship
with YPF since the early 1990s,&#8221; Craig said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seeking Investors &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The YPF-Chevron development accord was signed by Galuccio
and Ali Moshiri, Chevron&#8217;s president for Africa and Latin
America exploration and production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YPF&#8217;s American depositary receipts slid 2.7 percent to
close at $12.75 in New York trading. Chevron added 0.6 percent
to $117.25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YPF plans to start next week a two-week trip to the U.S.
and Europe seeking financial and strategic investors for its
five-year business plan, a YPF official briefed on the matter,
said yesterday. Galuccio and YPF Chief Financial Officer Daniel
Gonzalez will meet with Exxon Mobil Corp. and Apache Corp. as
well as other producers during an oil conference in Houston on
Sept. 18-21, the official has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other stops include New York, London, Los Angeles and
Boston. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) raised
Argentine bonds to overweight from marketweight, saying debt
prices already reflect investor concern about capital controls
and nationalizations and that economic growth could quicken. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Argentina&#8217;s economy has touched bottom and is in the
process of benefiting from both a cyclical lift and a more
comfortable balance of payments position that should extend into
2013,&#8221; Vladimir Werning, a JPMorgan economist in New York,
wrote in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While government intervention &#8220;will continue to generate
headline risk,&#8221; it is already reflected in asset prices,
Werning said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government is scheduled to release second-quarter
growth figures on Sept. 21. The economy probably expanded 0.5
percent in the quarter from the year-earlier period, according
to the median forecast from 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While raising Argentine debt to overweight, JPMorgan cut
Venezuela to marketweight after a four-month rally in the
securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to own Argentine
government dollar debt over U.S. Treasuries fell 24 basis points
to 846 basis points at 6:20 p.m. in Buenos Aires while
Venezuela&#8217;s bond spread rose 10 basis points to 956 basis
points, according to JPMorgan&#8217;s EMBIG index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bolivia&#8217;s cultivation of the coca
leaf, the raw material used to produce cocaine, dropped roughly
12 percent in 2011 from 2010, according to a survey published
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The national coca monitoring survey by the United Nations
Office on Drugs and Crime and Bolivia&#8217;s government showed that
the area under cultivation decreased to 27,200 hectares from
31,000 (105 square miles from 120), marking the first such
decline in the Andean nation since 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey&#8217;s release follows last week&#8217;s publication of a
U.S. government report that found Bolivia had &#8220;failed
demonstrably during the previous 12 months to adhere to their
obligations under international narcotics agreements.&#8221; Bolivian
President Evo Morales, a former coca farmer, rejected the U.S.
position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If they want authority in the fight against drug
trafficking, why doesn&#8217;t the U.S. eliminate the market in the
U.S.?&#8221; Morales said Sept. 15 in the state of Potosi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Presidential Memorandum also listed Venezuela and
Myanmar as having failed to fight the drug trade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coca leaf has an important role in indigenous Bolivian
religion and culture, and the government accepts cultivation of
77 square miles of coca leaf for traditional uses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bolivia expelled the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration
in 2008, and withdrew in 2011 from a UN convention that limits
chewing the coca leaf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data published by the U.S. Office of National Drug Control
Policy also note a decrease in 2011 from 2010, but said
potential cocaine production increased due to more efficient
production techniques. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), fighting over
$6.3 billion it says Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. owes it, was
sued by the defunct investment bank as it seeks to reject $2.2
billion in derivatives obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A U.S. bankruptcy judge should rule on the &#8220;overstated&#8221;
demands by the bank, which never supplied supporting documents
for its claims, Lehman said in a filing in federal court in
Manhattan. Lehman is seeking unspecified damages from the
biggest U.S. bank, as well as money due from JPMorgan under the
derivatives contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The JPMorgan entities&#8217; derivatives claims should be
reduced or disallowed,&#8221; Lehman said in the Sept. 14 filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The derivatives claims also feature in Lehman&#8217;s $8.6
billion suit against JPMorgan, which was the main short-term
lender to Lehman around the time of its 2008 collapse during the
credit crisis. Now out of bankruptcy, Lehman is gathering money
for its second payment to creditors on Oct. 1. It has said it
expects to pay creditors 18 cents on the dollar by 2016 or so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Lehman lost a bid to persuade a judge to revise
his ruling on the $8.6 billion suit against JPMorgan, which
alleges that the New York-based lender helped cause its collapse
by taking collateral for its loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Payment Demands &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck dismissed some of the
investment bank&#8217;s claims that might have brought creditors
hundreds of millions of dollars, according to Lehman. Peck told
Lehman it has other ways of obtaining money from JPMorgan, such
as fighting the bank&#8217;s payment demands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a phone call and e-mail
seeking comment on the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank, which loaned Lehman&#8217;s brokerage $70 billion
around the time of the bankruptcy, has denied causing the firm&#8217;s
collapse. After giving Lehman almost $700 million to settle part
of the $8.6 billion suit, it continues to fight most of Lehman&#8217;s
allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peck ruled in April that Lehman cannot claim money from
JPMorgan for securities transactions governed by so-called safe
harbor law, devised to protect banks dealing with weak
companies. Lehman is entitled to pursue the remaining &#8220;complex,
fact driven causes of action,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history in
September 2008, listing $613 billion in debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. v. JPMorgan Chase
Bank NA, 12-01874, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan). The earlier case is Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. v. JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 10-03266, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) is creating three
teams and hiring executives in Brazil to oversee risk and
containment at its Frade field as it challenges a ban on
operations and lawsuits because of a spill, a person familiar
with the hirings said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second-biggest U.S. oil company is hiring about 16
people in coming months for Brazil, including five executives,
said the person, who can&#8217;t be named because the hirings aren&#8217;t
public. The positions include managers for the teams, a deputy
country manager and an asset development manager for the
offshore Frade project where the spill occurred in November, the
person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3,000-barrel leak at Frade prompted federal prosecutors
to sue Chevron for a total of 40 billion reais ($20 billion) for
harming the environment, as well as environmental criminal
charges. The San Ramon, California-based company voluntarily
suspended operations in Brazil in March following a second leak
at the field off the country&#8217;s southeastern coast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil will fine Chevron 35 million reais for the spill,
Magda Chambriard, the head of Brazilian oil regulator ANP, said
today in Rio de Janeiro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, a court ordered Chevron and Transocean Ltd. (RIG),
owner of the rig used at Frade, to suspend all operations in the
country. Last week the ruling was upheld by the Superior Justice
Tribunal, the country&#8217;s second-highest court, and may be
appealed at the Federal Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;All Legal Means&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron will &#8220;seek all legal means at our disposal&#8221; to
overturn the ban, the company said in a Sept. 12 statement after
the court order was upheld. Transocean said in a separate
statement it has many ways to contest the injunction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kurt Glaubitz and Jim Craig, spokesmen for Chevron, didn&#8217;t
respond to e-mails and telephone messages seeking comment on the
hirings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frade is Chevron&#8217;s sole operating field in the country. The
company voluntarily halted about 60,000 barrels a day of output
at Frade in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron gained 0.7 percent to $118.08 at 1:17 p.m. in New
York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carlyle Group LP (CG), the second-
largest private-equity firm by assets, appointed Robert Mancini
from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) as co-head of its infrastructure
fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mancini, 54, is a managing director at Goldman Sachs and
also chief executive officer of Cogentrix Energy LLC, a power
producer that Carlyle agreed to acquire from Goldman Sachs on
Sept. 7, the Washington-based buyout firm said today in a
statement. Mancini will join Carlyle after the completion of the
acquisition during the fourth quarter, Carlyle said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlyle is expanding investments into energy and
infrastructure beyond its joint venture with Riverstone Holdings
LLC, the New York-based private-equity firm that partnered with
Carlyle starting in 2000. Riverstone, founded by two former
Goldman Sachs executives, is raising money without Carlyle for
the first time as it seeks $6 billion for a new energy fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Bob&#8217;s wealth of experience in leading the acquisition,
development and operation of power generating facilities will
play a significant role as we pursue an active program of
acquiring and developing power projects across North America,&#8221;
Robert Dove, whom Mancini will join as the fund&#8217;s co-head, said
in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlyle Infrastructure Partners, which began investing in
September 2006 with $1.1 billion, had a negative 5 percent net
internal rate of return at the end of the second quarter.
Investments in the fund include Illinois Central School Bus LLC
and ITS Technologies  Logistics LLC, which lifts containers
onto and off of trains and trucks, according to Carlyle&#8217;s
website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlyle&#8217;s acquisition of Goldman Sachs-backed Cogentrix
includes five coal and solar power projects in Florida,
Virginia, Colorado and California. The deal, whose value wasn&#8217;t
disclosed, also included Charlotte, North Carolina-based
Cogentrix staff. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new wave of experimental vaccines is the medical community&#8217;s latest hope against a powerful staph infection that kills more people in the U.S. than skin cancer and costs as much as $8 billion a year to treat. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK), two of the world&#8217;s biggest drugmakers, and NovaDigm Therapeutics Inc., a closely held biotechnology company, are each testing novel vaccines to halt methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, long a dangerous infection in hospitals and nursing homes and which is now increasingly finding its way into daycare centers, schools and prisons. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The vaccines are in early studies and years away from possible approval. Two other drug companies have already tried and failed to make an effective vaccine, most recently Merck  Co. (MRK) in 2011. Still, as infections spread, doctors are eager for a vaccine that works. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s very clear we need a vaccine, and we need it soon,&#8221; said Robert Daum, a pediatrics professor at the University of Chicago and principal investigator at the school&#8217;s MRSA Research Center, in a telephone interview. &#8220;The challenge is, we don&#8217;t really know what makes people immune to staph infections.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mostly benign Staphylococcus aureus bacteria live widely on people&#8217;s skin and in their nasal passages. About 1 percent of those with the bacteria carry MRSA, a toxic form of the illness that enters the bloodstream and is resistant to most treatments. MRSA, which kills more than 11,400 Americans a year, can enter the body through a cut, a sore, a catheter or a breathing tube. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Not &#8216;Optimal&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once infected, patients are typically treated with powerful antibiotics. The more these therapies are used, though, the more likely it is that the bacteria will develop resistance to them as well. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Are they optimal? No,&#8221; said Frank Lowy, a pathology professor at Columbia University in New York, in a telephone interview. Thus the need for an effective vaccine. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each of the experimental vaccines being developed take a different tack toward their goal of snuffing out the bacteria. Pfizer&#8217;s and Glaxo&#8217;s products attack on several biological fronts at once, following the model of HIV drug cocktails, while NovaDigm&#8217;s sparks an immune system response to kill the bug before it enters the body. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In hospitals, a vaccine would be used for patients going into surgery or those with compromised immune systems, Daum said. Beyond hospitals, people could get routine vaccinations to help protect them against proliferating staph bacteria in places like daycare centers for children and gym locker rooms. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Prevented Suffering &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;For Jeanine Thomas, a vaccine could have prevented years of suffering. The Chicago-based former marketing executive and avid tennis player slipped on ice and broke her ankle in December 2000. During surgery to repair the joint Thomas was infected with MRSA, leading to months of complications, organ failure and near death, she said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;People don&#8217;t see this as an immediate threat to them,&#8221; Thomas, who founded the advocacy group MRSA Survivors Network in 2003, said in an interview. &#8220;But it&#8217;s a secret and silent killer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Daum, a pediatrician who was one of the first doctors to identify MRSA&#8217;s growth in hospitals and the community in a 1998 report in the Journal of the American Medical Association, has said that if such a vaccine could be made to work, it should become part of the regular pediatric vaccine schedule. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;MRSA Data &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even without a vaccine, better awareness and prevention efforts have helped reduce the amount of invasive MRSA in hospitals and other acute-care facilities in the U.S. by 20 percent, to 67,000 cases in 2010 from 82,000 in 2007-2008, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The greater problem now is in public places beyond hospital doors. Incidences of staph in the community, which first appear as skin infections, &#8220;increased rapidly during the past decade&#8221; to about 13,800 cases in 2010 and are likely to keep rising, according to the Atlanta-based agency. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;MRSA kills more than 11,400 Americans a year, according to the CDC&#8217;s 2010 report, compared with about 9,200 who die annually from melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The spread of staph infections is a global concern, and thus a potential global market for any successful vaccine. In Europe, for example, infections are spreading, said Carmen Pessoa da Silva, a London-based medical officer with the World Health Organization. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are really facing a very rapid increase in these figures, and this is a reason for concern for all of us,&#8221; she said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Early Research &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new vaccines from New York-based Pfizer, London-based Glaxo and NovaDigm Therapeutics, in Grand Forks, North Dakota, are in the first phases of a three-step system of research required for U.S. marketing approval. While the earliest testing is primarily designed to check safety, it often provides clues about a treatment&#8217;s effectiveness. Typically, it takes years to complete all three test stages, and many fail. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pfizer has two vaccines in early trials, one an updated version of the original, said Emilio Emini, the drugmaker&#8217;s chief scientific officer for vaccine research. The hope is that these treatments will spur action by either three or four separate antigens in the body, substances that activate immune system cells that are part of the body&#8217;s natural defenses against outside invaders. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Results from the Phase 1 study of the three-antigen compound will be presented next month at the Infectious Diseases Society of America meeting in San Diego, while a Phase 2 study of the four-antigen vaccine may be reported next year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s Targets &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &#8220;feeling in the field right now is that a vaccine that&#8217;s driven to one specific immunological target is probably going to be insufficient,&#8221; Emini, based in Collegeville, Pennsylvania, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While he declined to estimate the potential market size for an approved vaccine, he said the company&#8217;s focus now is to target hospital-based infections. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;GlaxoSmithKline is also evaluating a four-component vaccine, Melinda Stubbee, a spokeswoman for the company, said in an e-mail. The drugmaker has completed its first-stage trial and is evaluating the results, Stubbee said. She declined to give a time line for further development steps. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The experimental product from NovaDigm Therapeutics, aims to spur patients&#8217; immune systems to recognize MRSA infection on the skin, before it spreads within the body, and send out T cells, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cooke said during an interview. Two Phase 1 trials showed the therapy, dubbed NDV-3, was safe in humans, he said, and earlier studies in mice found it created a protective layer of white blood cells around a skin wound infected with MRSA. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Immune Responses &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mice without the vaccine had infections spread deeper into the skin level, he said. &#8220;We have had really excellent immune responses.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other scientists are working on alternative solutions that wouldn&#8217;t require a vaccine. Menachem Shoham, an associate professor of biochemistry at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, is attempting to outwit the bacteria rather than kill it by ending its ability to create the poisonous toxins it produces. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The research doesn&#8217;t seek to &#8220;wipe out the bugs, just disarm them of their deadly weapons,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Resistance occurs when drugs fall short in their drive to eliminate diseases, giving weakened or left-over cells the chance to adapt biologically in ways that allow them to continue their growth. &#8220;Since the survival of the bugs isn&#8217;t threatened by our approach the likelihood of resistance development is small,&#8221; Shoham said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Ryan Flinn in San Francisco at  rflinn@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Reg Gale at  rgale5@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;Desperate Housewives&#8221; of
Wisteria Lane have a new address: Istanbul&#8217;s Gul street. In
Russia, Peg and Al Bundy of &#8220;Married With Children&#8221; have
morphed into Gena and Dasha, who inhabit an apartment in
Yekaterinburg rather than a suburban home near Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For decades, American situation comedies and dramas dubbed
into other languages have been standard fare on TV screens
worldwide. Today, broadcasters in Turkey, Russia, and elsewhere
are instead padding their prime-time schedules with locally
produced versions of shows licensed from U.S. studios. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Istanbul housewives -- named Yasemin, Nermin, Elif,
Zelis and Emel and known as &#8220;Desperate Women&#8221; -- star in the
eighth-most watched series on Turkish TV courtesy of Walt Disney
Co. (DIS), which owns global rights to the show. Sony Corp. has remade
&#8220;Married With Children&#8221; a dozen times for international markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Right now we see that in the Middle East, the TV world
has an exploding appetite for everything,&#8221; said Andrea Wong,
president of international production at Sony Pictures
Television. (6758) &#8220;Turkey is a key market and Israel is being
explored, as is India.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reality- and game-show concepts have been sold in multiple
markets for many years -- think &#8220;Survivor&#8221; or &#8220;Who Wants to
be a Millionaire?&#8221; Now, media companies say, increased
availability of free and paid channels on satellite and cable
systems in emerging markets have spawned a growing appetite for
localized versions of American dramas and sitcoms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research In Motion Ltd. (RIMM) and
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) reached a licensing deal to give the struggling
BlackBerry maker the rights to use Microsoft file-memory
technology in its smartphones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology standard, known as exFAT, will help users
transfer large multimedia files between their smartphones and
desktop computers, the companies said today in a joint
statement. Financial terms of the deal weren&#8217;t disclosed.
Microsoft has similar agreements with electronics makers
Panasonic Corp. (6752), Sony Corp. (6758) and Canon Inc. (7751) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIM is adding features to its BlackBerry phones in a bid to
stop customers from fleeing to Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPhone and devices
built on Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Android software. Early next year the
Waterloo, Ontario-based company plans to release the first
BlackBerry 10 phones, which have a faster Web browser and the
ability to run multiple applications at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIM rose 2.3 percent to $7.42 at the close in New York. The
stock has lost 69 percent of its value in the past year. Shares
of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft were little changed
today, at $31.18. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) director Raymond Gilmartin, former chief executive officer of Merck  Co., will
leave the software maker&#8217;s board, reducing the size to ten
directors. The company also raised its dividend by 15 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gilmartin is retiring after 11 years of service and won&#8217;t
seek re-election to the board at the company&#8217;s 2012 annual
meeting, Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said today in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft increased its quarterly dividend by 3 cents to 23
cents, payable to shareholders of record on Nov. 15. The world&#8217;s
largest software maker has increased the payout in each of the
previous two years, including a 25 percent boost in 2011.
Microsoft&#8217;s cash and short-term investments as of June 30 surged
to more than $63 billion, from $52.8 billion a year earlier,
just before the last dividend increase. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s David A. Viniar, the longest-serving chief financial officer of a major
Wall Street firm, will retire at the end of January and be
replaced by Harvey M. Schwartzfrom the sales and trading unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viniar, 57, will join the New York-based bank&#8217;s board of
directors when he retires, the company said in a statement
today. Schwartz, 48, will assume oversight of operations,
technology and finance as well as co-head of the firm-wide risk
committee, the company said. Schwartz has worked at Goldman
Sachs since 1997. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have sought Harvey&#8217;s advice on risk judgments and
market knowledge for a long time and I know he will be an
outstanding chief financial officer,&#8221; Viniar said in the
statement. &#8220;I look forward to continuing to contribute to
Goldman Sachs as a member of our board of directors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was the most profitable securities firm in
Wall Street history before converting to a bank in 2008. Viniar
helped steer the firm through the financial crisis and guided
the company through its initial public offering in 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm plans to appoint more independent directors to the

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) hired former CBS
Corp. (CBS) television executive Nancy Tellem to oversee content
produced for the company&#8217;s Xbox entertainment console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tellem, who was president of CBS Network Television
Entertainment Group, has joined Microsoft as entertainment and
digital media president, according to a statement today from the
Redmond, Washington-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appointment highlights Microsoft&#8217;s increased emphasis
on delivering movies, sports and television shows through the
Xbox 360, a gaming console about to enter the seventh year since
its release. It has more than 65 applications that connect to
such services as Netflix, Hulu Plus and Time Warner Inc. (TWX)&#8217;s HBO
GO. Xbox Live&#8217;s 44 million subscribers spend on average 80 hours
a month consuming online video, said Phil Spencer, corporate
vice president of Microsoft Studios. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The box has really evolved into a platform for creators
and consumers to find all the content they love,&#8221; Spencer said
in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tellem, who will head a new production studio in Los
Angeles, will examine Microsoft&#8217;s portfolio of games for sources
of content, and also will mine Hollywood for movies, television
shows and Web content, she said, speaking in the same interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s all about creating compelling content,&#8221; Tellem said.
&#8220;We&#8217;re opening our doors to all types of talent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the executives declined to discuss specific budgets
for such content, Spencer said the company plans to make a
significant commitment since &#8220;being state-of-the-art and
extremely high-quality is critical to gaining consumer mind
share.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tellem oversaw network entertainment at CBS until 2009,
when she stepped down to become an adviser to Chief Executive
officer Leslie Moonves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft was little changed at $31.18 at the New York

&lt;p&gt;The former head of Myanmar&#8217;s state-
owned oil company defended it against criticism from Nobel
laureate Aung San Suu Kyi as U.S. explorers scout the country&#8217;s
oil and gas blocks for the first time since 1997. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise, known as MOGE, is run by
technocrats who reported to government ministers and had no
authority to approve contracts, according to San Lwin, a former
managing director of the organization. Suu Kyi in June urged
governments to restrict partnerships with MOGE until it abides
by international rules for transparency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s just a puzzle,&#8221; San Lwin, who is now a consultant
to Cnooc Myanmar Ltd., said in an interview in Yangon last week,
referring to Suu Kyi&#8217;s criticisms. &#8220;MOGE alone doesn&#8217;t have the
authority to sign a production-sharing contract. How can you say
MOGE is not transparent?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myanmar is preparing to offer more oil areas to become
self-reliant in energy and help fuel an economy that the Asian
Development Bank said may grow as much as 8 percent a year for
more than a decade. President Barack Obama in July authorized
U.S. companies to invest in Myanmar for the first time in 15
years and said energy firms must report ventures with MOGE
within 60 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ConocoPhillips, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Chevron Corp. (CVX)
were among Western oil companies that sponsored an energy forum
in Yangon this month. Myanmar&#8217;s government plans to join the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative to increase
investor confidence, Deputy Energy Minister Htin Aung told a
Euromoney conference in Naypyidaw on Sept. 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Future Bids &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bidding for onshore and offshore blocks will take place
&#8220;at the appropriate time,&#8221; Htin Aung said, without
elaborating. &#8220;As Myanmar&#8217;s upstream petroleum sector has now
started entering the international community, it will need time
to make many considerations before launching any more
international bidding rounds.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixty two of the country&#8217;s 101 exploration blocks remain
open for investment, including 34 onshore, eight in shallow
water and 20 in deep water, Htin Aung said. Myanmar awarded nine
of 18 areas offered last year to companies such as Thailand&#8217;s
PTT Exploration  Production Pcl (PTTEP) and Petroliam Nasional Bhd.,
Malaysia&#8217;s state oil company, known as Petronas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron declined to comment on whether it would bid for
blocks in Myanmar, saying in a statement that it &#8220;actively
pursues new business opportunities globally that meet our
criteria for investment&#8221; and avoids discussing specifics.
Shell, which doesn&#8217;t operate in Myanmar, issued a similar
statement in response to e-mailed questions, saying &#8220;commercial
sensitivities&#8221; prevent it from commenting. India&#8217;s Oil 
Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) will probably bid on the blocks, according to
D.K. Sarraf, managing director of overseas unit ONGC Videsh Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Power Shortage &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myanmar plans to use new discoveries for its own growth,
after President Thein Sein took power a year ago following about
five decades of military rule. Frequent power outages sparked
protests earlier this year as only about a quarter of the
population has access to electricity, according to an ADB report
released last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country meets about a third of its crude oil demand and
half of its natural gas needs, while exporting about 80 percent
of gas produced to neighboring Thailand, according to Htin Aung.
China National Petroleum Corp., China&#8217;s biggest energy producer,
is building oil and gas pipelines across Myanmar to access
Middle Eastern crude and pump offshore gas to landlocked areas
in southern China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suu Kyi, who spent 15 years under house arrest, joined
Parliament for the first time in April after her party won 43 of
44 seats it contested in by-elections. She is now traveling in
the U.S. on a 17-day tour in which she will be awarded the
Congressional Gold Medal, America&#8217;s highest civilian honor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Lacks Transparency&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MOGE &#8220;lacks both transparency and accountability at
present,&#8221; Suu Kyi told a press conference in Geneva in June.
Governments should not allow partnerships with MOGE unless it
adheres to standards such as the International Monetary Fund&#8217;s
code of good practices on fiscal transparency, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myanmar founded MOGE in 1963 after nationalizing the assets
of Burmah Oil Company, a U.K.-based firm that was eventually
acquired by BP Plc. Foreign companies must partner with MOGE to
operate in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Although some people have raised questions about
transparency, they actually have a fairly functioning regulatory
system, which can be understood,&#8221; Christopher Drew, country
manager for Twinza Oil Ltd., told an investment forum last week
in Naypyidaw, referring to the Energy Ministry. &#8220;It sometimes
takes a little while but there is nothing really hidden.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PTTEP, Daewoo &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During San Lwin&#8217;s five-year tenure as head of MOGE, he
negotiated contracts for blocks with PTTEP and Daewoo
International Corp. (047050) as part of a committee that included Energy
Ministry officials. Once terms were agreed, they were presented
for approval to the energy minister, attorney-general, Myanmar
Investment Commission and finally the Cabinet, San Lwin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the past, there may be some partiality,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;But right now it is not a major problem for interested parties
to get the same treatment. Anyone who can provide better terms
and conditions, they can get the block.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to this year, Chevron was one of the few U.S.
companies operating in Myanmar through its 2005 purchase of
Unocal Corp., which invested in a gas field and pipeline before
a 1997 ban on new investment. Total SA operates the project, in
which MOGE has a 15 percent stake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not Convinced &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon Billenness, a Chevron shareholder who has pressed the
company to disclose all payments to the Myanmar government,
remains unconvinced that the country has changed for good. While
applauding moves to free some political prisoners, Billenness
said companies should urge authorities to release all detainees,
strike peace agreements in areas with ethnic minorities and
ensure free and fair national elections in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;On the transparency issue, I&#8217;ll believe it when I see
it,&#8221; Billenness, who is also part of the Business and Human
Rights Group at Amnesty International USA, said by phone. &#8220;When
the Burmese government has successfully joined EITI, then I will
know they are serious about revenue transparency.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourteen countries now comply with the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative, which began in 2002 as part
of efforts to ensure natural resource revenues benefit the poor.
The government must sign up for the initiative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil and gas sector has accounted for 77 percent of the
$3.8 billion in foreign investment Myanmar attracted from 2005
to 2010, according to the ADB. Natural gas exports increased to
about $3 billion last year and are set to rise in 2013 as more
gas fields and pipelines become operational, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gas Revenue &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While revenue from gas exports over the past five years
helped boost international reserves to $9.9 billion, little
showed up in government accounts, according to the IMF. A
managed float of the exchange rate in April will boost gas sales
in the current fiscal budget to 17 percent of total revenue, up
from less than 1 percent a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money earned from gas sales went straight to government
coffers and not the pockets of MOGE officials, San Lwin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I use a 20-year-old car and drive myself around,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;These days if someone is doing something wrong, it will
show up on the Internet.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s Wyeth unit must face
a class action by investors claiming the drugmaker hid negative
data on Pristiq, an anti-depressant marketed as the first non-
hormone menopause treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan today granted a
request by two pension funds to sue on behalf of all investors
who bought Wyeth common stock from June 26, 2006, through July
24, 2007. The plaintiffs claim Wyeth misled them by failing to
disclose information about Pristiq&#8217;s effects on the heart and
liver, which delayed the drug&#8217;s approval by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit was filed in 2007 by the City of Livonia
Employees&#8217; Retirement System. The plaintiffs, led by the
Pipefitters Union Local 537 Pension Fund, say Wyeth stock
dropped $5.70 after the company disclosed the negative effects
publicly. The investors are seeking unspecified damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drug company, acquired Wyeth in
2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The court&#8217;s decision is limited to preliminary procedural
issues,&#8221; Chris Loder, a spokesman for the New York-based
company, said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;The opinion does not
address the merits of the case.&#8221; He said the company will fight
the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is City of Livonia Employees Retirement System v.
Wyeth, 07-cv-10329, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will be
allowed to move a set of protected murals from a building in the
City of London financial district, a decision that may clear the
way for the investment bank&#8217;s new European headquarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vote by the City&#8217;s council gives a Goldman Sachs unit
the option to develop an office building at 70 Farringdon
Street, about a minute&#8217;s walk from its existing London
headquarters on Fleet Street. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planning permission for a 54,400-square-meter (585,500-
square-foot) office development at the Farringdon Street site
was first granted in 2005 and renewed in September 2011. The
murals, nine semi-abstract ceramic panels by artist Dorothy
Annan, were listed for preservation last year and &#8220;incorporate
stylistic images of telecommunications equipment,&#8221; according to
documents given to council members in advance of the vote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs had been &#8220;somewhat concerned that their
development may be scuppered&#8221; by having to keep the murals in
place, Peter Rees, chief planning officer for the City of
London, told council member&#8217;s today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joanna Carss, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in London,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The murals will initially be stored and may eventually be
displayed near the Guildhall School of Music, about a mile from
the Farringdon Street site, the documents provided to the
council said. Goldman Sachs&#8217; new office building is unlikely to
be a suitable location for the murals &#8220;at least in the view of
the developers,&#8221; Rees said at the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Sewer Overload&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs bought an adjoining site at Plumtree Court in
February, according to documents filed with the U.K.&#8217;s Land
Registry. An application is expected for a &#8220;comprehensive
redevelopment&#8221; of the sites, the City of London said in the
documents provided to the borough&#8217;s council. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will have to show how it plans to &#8220;reduce
the risk of sewer overload in this area&#8221; during development,
the City of London told the New York-based bank&#8217;s planning
adviser DP9 Ltd. in an Aug. 30 letter. The area is a &#8220;flood
risk hotspot,&#8221; according to the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vibrations during construction may also lead &#8220;to water
main bursts and or sewer collapses,&#8221; the City wrote. The
borough released the letter following a request by Bloomberg
News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s London Property unit had assets of 73.7
million pounds ($120 million) through December and paid 103.4
million pounds for a development site this year, according to a
filing with Companies House in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese Estates Holdings Ltd., controlled by Hong Kong
billionaire Joseph Lau, bought River Court, part of Goldman
Sachs existing European headquarters, from a group of Irish
investors advised by Warren Private Clients Ltd. for about 280
million pounds last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European Union regulators are
preparing an antitrust complaint over Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s failure
to comply with a settlement to give users a choice of web
browsers, according to two people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#8217;s no set timing for the European Commission to send
the statement of objections, said the people who asked not to be
identified because the complaint isn&#8217;t public. A statement of
objections lists alleged violations of competition rules and is
a precursor to possible fines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in July
that Microsoft may have misled regulators by failing to display
a browser choice screen to users of the Windows operating system
since February 2011. The world&#8217;s largest software company blamed
a technical error for not showing the screen to some users and
offered to extend until March 2016 a commitment to show it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has already been fined 1.68 billion euros ($2.2
billion) in EU antitrust probes, including an 899 million-euro
penalty for failing to obey an order to share data with
competitors. The Redmond, Washington-based company agreed to
offer access to rival browsers as a part of a 2009 settlement to
repair its relationship with the bloc&#8217;s regulators. It told
regulators last December that it was complying with its
commitments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s press office in Brussels declined to comment
beyond a July statement in which the company expressed its
regret that the error occurred and understood that regulators
may penalize it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Technical Error &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said it only learned in July that it didn&#8217;t
offer its browser choice software to some 28 million computers
running Windows 7 Service Pack 1, or 10 percent of the computers
that should have received it. It blamed a technical error and
said it has already started distributing a fix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the terms of Microsoft&#8217;s 2009 pledge, consumers who
buy personal computers were given a choice of the 12 most widely
used browsers to install in addition to, or instead of,
Microsoft&#8217;s Internet Explorer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any fines for Microsoft may take into account repeat
offenses, Almunia said in July in a reference to the EU&#8217;s 2008
penalty for the company&#8217;s failure to obey an earlier EU
decision. That ruling also ordered it to provide information to
software developers to make compatible products. EU antitrust
fines are usually capped at 10 percent of yearly revenue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) has selected
Standard  Poor&#8217;s to rate its planned $1.5 billion commercial
mortgage bond offering, breaking the stranglehold Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service has had on the market for 14 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction is set to be offered to investors next week
without a rating from Moody&#8217;s, according to a person familiar
with the deal who declined to be identified because the
transaction hasn&#8217;t been announced. Elizabeth Seymour, a
spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street banks have been bypassing SP&#8217;s ratings for
commercial-mortgage bonds since the company derailed a $1.5
billion sale by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. last
year by pulling its grades on the securities. Since then, SP
hasn&#8217;t rated a so-called conduit deal composed of loans from
multiple borrowers, the biggest part of the market, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. JPMorgan&#8217;s offering was reported
earlier today by the Wall Street Journal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand for commercial-mortgage backed securities is surging
as investors seek riskier assets with the Federal Reserve saying
it&#8217;s likely to hold its benchmark lending rate near zero at
least through mid-2015. Yields on debt linked to shopping malls,
skyscrapers and hotels reached a record low 2.19 percent
yesterday, according to the Barclays Investment Grade CMBS
index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street banks have issued about $3.83 billion in
commercial-mortgage backed securities this month, Bloomberg data
show. Issuance will likely surpass $40 billion this year,
Jefferies Group Inc. analysts said in a Sept. 11 report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Lloyd C. Blankfein, chief
executive officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), said he would
invest in real estate as central banks around the world focus on
avoiding deflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I accept that invitation to have higher asset prices, and
so I would go long more the real assets,&#8221; including real
estate, Blankfein, who turns 58 tomorrow, said in a discussion
today with Royal Bank of Canada (RY) CEO Gordon Nixon, at an event
hosted by the Canadian Club of Toronto. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bank of Japan (8301) today joined the Federal Reserve and
European Central Bank in acting against threats of an economic
contraction five years after the U.S. mortgage meltdown derailed
the global economy. The BOJ expanded its asset-purchase fund by
10 trillion yen ($127 billion). The Fed said last week it would
buy $40 billion a month of mortgage debt in a third round of so-
called quantitative easing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The central banks are obviously putting a real penalty on
holding cash and are trying to incentivize everybody into going
into higher assets,&#8221; Blankfein said. &#8220;They may be
unsuccessful, but I tell you if more inflationary expectations
seeped into the world, that would be very positive today for the
economic system.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein said he would &#8220;follow the will of the central
banks,&#8221; which are trying to avoid deflation even at the risk of
spurring inflation. &#8220;They want asset prices to inflate,&#8221; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the most profitable securities firm in Wall
Street history before converting to a bank in 2008, announced a
new round of cost-cutting in July after reporting the lowest
first-half revenue in seven years. In a research report last
week, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s bank analysts said the industry&#8217;s decline
in profit has been driven primarily by increased capital
requirements and regulation, rather than the economic slowdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein&#8217;s discussion today follows appearances at the
Economic Club of Washington, the St. Petersburg International
Economic Forum, the Chicago Club and on MSNBC earlier this year.

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With much of the expected developments now past us, our

&lt;p&gt;A majority of U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission members are seeking a study of money-market
regulations after Chairman Mary Schapiro&#8217;s bid to advance new
rules failed last month, a person familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC Republican commissioners Daniel Gallagher and Troy
Paredes, together with Democrat Luis Aguilar, sent a letter
Sept. 17 to Schapiro and SEC Chief Economist Craig Lewis
reiterating a call for an analysis of whether certain rules
could disrupt money-market funds and short-term credit markets,
said the person, who asked not to be identified because the
matter isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Nester, an SEC spokesman, declined to comment
immediately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The request for the study comes about three weeks after
Schapiro canceled a vote on staff proposals for new money-market
rules, saying that the SEC &#8220;will not act&#8221; because three of the
five commissioners didn&#8217;t support them. Schapiro, backed by the
Federal Reserve, has worked to make money funds more stable in
the wake of the collapse of the $62.5 billion Reserve Primary
Fund in September 2008, which triggered a wider run on money
funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schapiro&#8217;s Aug. 22 announcement canceling the vote marked a
victory for the mutual-fund industry, which lobbied against new
rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Report &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Australia Pension Fund Body Calls for High-Frequency Trading Ban &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australian regulators should consider banning high-
frequency trading in the equities market, according to Industry
Super Network, an organization promoting the country&#8217;s $A1.3
trillion ($1.37 trillion) pension funds industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-frequency trading, in which computer algorithms are
used to buy and sell stocks in fractions of a second, can
exacerbate slumps in the stock market and undermine investor
confidence, the organization said on its website. ISN represents
Australian pension funds that have about 5 million individual
members, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strategies that use computer algorithms to buy and sell
shares are being scrutinized globally amid concern that they can
destabilize markets and make them less equitable. The Australian
Securities  Investment Commission is considering altering rules
on market structure, which include regulations on algorithms and
high-frequency trading. Submissions for the consultation to ASIC
closed Sept. 14 and proposals are expected next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-frequency and algorithmic trading has come under
scrutiny by regulators since May 6, 2010, when about $862
billion was erased from stock values in 20 minutes before share
prices recovered from the plunge. A trading malfunction at
Knight Capital Group Inc. (KCG) last month led to a $440 million
trading loss at the market-making firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASIC is currently assessing draft rules on market
structure, which include regulations on algorithms and high-
frequency trading, and will publish new rules and a regulatory
guide in October. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fannie Mae Audit Finds BofA Wasn&#8217;t Overpaid for Servicing Rights &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fannie Mae (FNMA) didn&#8217;t give Bank of America Corp. special
consideration in agreeing to pay more than $500 million to
transfer servicing of 384,000 mortgages to firms more likely to
prevent foreclosures, a U.S. auditor said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the taxpayer-owned company paid more than legally
required to Bank of America and 12 other lenders when it spent
$1.5 billion for servicing rights on 1.1 million loans from 2008
to 2011, the Federal Housing Finance Agency&#8217;s inspector general
said in a report released yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transfers were part of a Fannie Mae initiative to cut
losses on mortgages at greatest risk of default. Bank of America
ultimately got $421 million in the 2011 deal because some of the
loans were paid off or refinanced by the time it was completed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction drew attention because it came after Fannie
Mae had received $1.3 billion from Bank of America to settle
claims over defaulted mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fannie Mae, based in Washington, and smaller rival Freddie
Mac of McLean, Virginia, have been operating under U.S.
conservatorship since they were seized by regulators amid
soaring losses in September 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audit found Fannie Mae paid lenders more than required
in most transactions because it wanted to negotiate a smooth
transfer. Holders of the servicing rights could have tried to
sell them elsewhere if Fannie Mae offered the minimum price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inspector general criticized Fannie Mae&#8217;s method of
computing the value of the loans and suggested that the FHFA
should step up its scrutiny of the servicing transfer program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Greenlee, FHFA&#8217;s deputy director of enterprise
regulation, said the program was intended to help borrowers stay
in their homes, not just to save money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FHFA inspector general released a second audit
yesterday concluding that the agency should strengthen efforts
to ensure Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are better prepared for the
failure of the banks that sell and service loans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Volksbanken Wins EU Approval for State Aid, Restructuring Plan &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oesterreichische Volksbanken AG (VBPS), the lender partially
nationalized by Austria, won European Union approval for
government support after it agreed to a restructuring plan that
will refocus its business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Under the restructuring plan, the bank will limit the
scope of its activity to its core role of providing liquidity
management services and intermediation in accessing capital
markets&#8221; to Austrian credit cooperatives, the European
Commission said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volksbanken since 2009 received government capital
injections of 1.25 billion euros ($1.6 billion), the commission
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Iceland Neglected U.K., Dutch Icesave Clients, Watchdog Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iceland violated European Union law by failing to take
measures to ensure U.K. and Dutch depositors were compensated
for their losses from the collapse of Landsbanki Islands hf,
regulators told a court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iceland has a duty under EU law to guarantee a minimum
compensation within a time limit and how this is achieved is up
to the government, the European Free Trade Association&#8217;s court
was told yesterday. Neither a &#8220;force majeure,&#8221; nor financial
considerations could justify Iceland&#8217;s failure to ensure
adequate compensation, the EFTA Surveillance Authority told the
Luxembourg-based court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. and the Netherlands ended up compensating their
citizens and are now demanding that Iceland repay the full
amount, with interest. The surveillance authority, the agency in
charge of supervising Iceland&#8217;s compliance with European rules,
sued the island in December over its failings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iceland rejected the authority&#8217;s arguments that it violated
EU law by not honoring $5.4 billion in depositor guarantees on
accounts held by British and Dutch savers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Landsbanki, which had sought to attract foreign depositors
through high-yielding Internet accounts that saved it the
trouble of opening subsidiaries abroad, collapsed in October
2008 with the rest of Iceland&#8217;s debt-laden banking industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is: E-16/11, EFTA Surveillance Authority v.
Iceland. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Gracie Says Officials Moving Closer to Working Bail-In Regime &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Gracie, director of the Bank of England&#8217;s special
resolution unit, commenting on banking policy, said, &#8220;We are
moving closer to an operational bail-in regime. A number of
outstanding challenges remain, but these challenges are largely
surmountable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He made the remarks in a speech delivered Sept. 17 at a
British Bankers&#8217; Association conference in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important, Gracie said, that &#8220;bail-in follows the
creditor hierarchy, secured claims are protected and netting
arrangements are respected. And bail-in, like the other
resolution tools, can only be used when it is necessary to do so
in pursuit of clearly defined public interest objectives.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dutch Say Financial Stability, Antitrust Rules Should Be Aligned &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caretaker Dutch Finance Minister Jan Kees de Jager said
competition and financial stability interests should both be
sufficiently safeguarded in state aid restructuring plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Netherlands will discuss the subject with the European
Commission, also taking into account European Union proposals
for common bank supervision, he said in a letter to parliament. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Comings and Goings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;FSA Warned Barclays on Diamond&#8217;s Appointment as CEO in 2010 &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Services Authority warned Barclays Plc (BARC) in
2010 that the Libor scandal could make it withdraw approval for
Robert Diamond&#8217;s appointment to run the bank, contradicting
Marcus Agius&#8217;s version of events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hector Sants, who stepped down as head of the U.K.
financial regulator in June, warned Agius the FSA could &#8220;re-
assess&#8221; Diamond&#8217;s suitability for the post after the
investigation was complete, he wrote in an internal e-mail made
public by lawmakers on Parliament&#8217;s Treasury Committee today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agius, who resigned as chairman of Barclays in July, had
told the panel of lawmakers that the Libor probe hadn&#8217;t been
raised by the FSA as a barrier to Diamond&#8217;s promotion. Diamond
quit after the London-based bank was fined a record 290 million
pounds ($470 million) for manipulating the London interbank
offered rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Barclays spokesman in London declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Citigroup Executives Leave Bank After Loan-Fraud Settlement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Citigroup Inc. (C) executives are departing after federal
prosecutors named them earlier this year in a mortgage-insurance
fraud case that resulted in a $158.3 million settlement and an
admission of wrongdoing by the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeffery Polkinghorne, a senior risk manager at the
CitiMortgage division, is leaving after 16 years of &#8220;dedicated
service,&#8221; according to an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg
News and confirmed by Mark Rodgers, a spokesman for the New
York-based bank. Donald Houghtalin, a compliance officer at the
unit, has already left, he said in a phone interview. Neither
man was sued by the government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both were among CitiMortgage executives named in a suit
against Citigroup filed by the U.S. Justice Department earlier
this year which claimed the lender saddled taxpayers with losses
after falsely declaring defective home loans fit for a federal
insurance program. The government alleged that some bank
officials pressured other employees to change reports on faulty
loans. Citigroup paid to settle the claims in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polkinghorne, who was in charge of loan quality, will
continue to work for Citigroup until the end of September,
according to the memo. He declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. accused Citigroup of violating requirements of a
Federal Housing Administration program that allowed the bank to
decide which home loans would be federally insured against loss.
The lender, the third-biggest in the U.S., admitted to falsely
stating that some loans met FHA and U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. joined a false-claims lawsuit filed by Sherry
Hunt, a whistle-blower and CitiMortgage quality-control vice
president. She said that executives buried her findings on
defective loans into 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dell Inc. (DELL) unveiled three computers
based on Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s new Windows 8 software, including a
tablet sporting a 10-inch screen for corporate users, a notebook
that weighs less than four pounds and an all-in-one desktop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dell&#8217;s Latitude 10 tablet, set to debut this year for
business users, features Intel Corp. (INTC)&#8217;s Atom chip and runs
Windows 8, which is designed to work better with tablets. The
company&#8217;s fall lineup will also include the Latitude 6430u
laptop, a thin and light Ultrabook design, and the OptiPlex
9010, which houses its electronics, power supply and 23-inch
touch screen inside one chassis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dell and other personal-computer makers are counting on
Windows 8 to jog anemic growth as consumers and businesses
increasingly opt for Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPad and other tablets. Global
PC shipments this year may increase just 1 percent to 367
million units, market researcher IDC said last month, down from
a previous projection of 5 percent growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dell, whose own PC sales declined 14 percent in the fiscal
second quarter, said its Windows 8 tablet for businesses will be
available this year. No. 1 PC maker Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) has said
its Windows 8 tablet for businesses may not be available until
January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re already sampling to customers -- we will ship this
year,&#8221; said Neil Hand, a Dell vice president of product
marketing, at a demonstration of new Windows 8 devices in San
Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Device Options &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Latitude 10 includes options for a longer-lasting
battery and a dock featuring additional ports for connecting to
printers, screens and other equipment Hand said. The 6430u
Ultrabook features a 14-inch screen, replaceable battery and
optional wireless docking system for use in an office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The all-in-one OptiPlex 9010 desktop machine can be placed
on a desk or mounted on a wall, Hand said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month at a Berlin trade show, Dell showed off several
other devices based on the new Windows operating system. The
Round Rock, Texas-based company previewed a tablet based on
Windows RT software -- a version of Windows designed for chips
running ARM Holdings Plc (ARM)&#8217;s technology -- as well as an Intel-
based convertible Windows 8 tablet that flips around to reveal a
keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dell shares fell 1.3 percent yesterday to $10.57 at
yesterday&#8217;s close in New York. The stock has fallen 28 percent
this year. &lt;/p&gt;

Moore" date="Sep 19, 2012  6:11 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-19/goldman-sachs-s-schwartz-to-succeed-viniar-as-firm-s-cfo.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Schwartz to Succeed Viniar as Firm&#8217;s CFO</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief Financial Officer David A. Viniar, who guided the firm through its 1999 initial public offering and the 2008 financial crisis, will end his 32-year career as an employee in January. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Viniar, whose 12 years in the role make him the longest- serving CFO on Wall Street, will be succeeded by Harvey M. Schwartz, 48, one of three global co-heads from the sales and trading division, the New York-based bank said in a statement yesterday. Goldman Sachs will add Viniar, 57, as well as some independent directors to the 10-member board, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the most profitable securities firm in Wall Street history before converting to a bank in 2008, has climbed 33 percent this year in New York trading, and the U.S. Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission have dropped probes into the company. Viniar told an analyst last year he wouldn&#8217;t leave until a sense of calm was restored. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve always worried what would happen when David Viniar left,&#8221; said Jim Rothenberg, who runs Los Angeles-based Capital Group Cos., a Goldman Sachs client and its second-biggest shareholder, after the bank&#8217;s own employees. &#8220;Every change gets people somewhat nervous, but I don&#8217;t know that there&#8217;s a better individual there to take over this function.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Viniar, during a conference call with investors after his retirement was announced, said he&#8217;s comfortable leaving now because the firm is in &#8220;very good financial shape.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are performing as well as we could given the operating environment,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Public Face &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Viniar served under Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 57, and his predecessor, Henry M. Paulson, who left in June 2006 to become U.S. Treasury Secretary under then-President George W. Bush. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Under both executives, Viniar served as the most public face of the firm, speaking to analysts and investors about quarterly results and at conferences. Meredith Whitney, the analyst and founder of Meredith Whitney Advisory Group LLC, said in a note to investors yesterday that Viniar &#8220;set the gold standard for CFOs across the industry.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The move may indicate that Goldman Sachs management feels it&#8217;s past the worst of the financial crisis and the legal scrutiny that followed, including a $550 million settlement with the SEC over claims that the firm misled investors in a mortgage-linked security, said Benjamin B. Wallace, an analyst at Westborough, Massachusetts-based Grimes  Co. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Blankfein&#8217;s Tenure &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;d assume it&#8217;s been a rather stressful couple of years there,&#8221; said Wallace, whose firm doesn&#8217;t own Goldman Sachs stock. &#8220;There will obviously be some questions about when Lloyd is going to step down as well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blankfein is scheduled to speak today at an event hosted by The Canadian Club of Toronto. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Viniar&#8217;s role has been broader than at some other companies, leading people familiar with the matter to say last year that they weren&#8217;t sure one executive could assume all of his duties when he left. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Schwartz said he will follow Viniar in taking on responsibility for the entire administrative side of the firm -- known as operations, technology and finance or by its nickname, &#8220;The Federation&#8221; -- because regulatory changes make it important to coordinate all those areas. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any material changes to the way we want to operate the business,&#8221; Schwartz said on yesterday&#8217;s conference call. &#8220;He&#8217;s a pretty tough act to follow.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Team Continuity &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Viniar said there aren&#8217;t any changes expected in his team, which includes Treasurer Elizabeth &#8220;Liz&#8221; Beshel Robinson, who joined the company in 1990 and was trained by him to handle the firm&#8217;s financing and liquidity. Robinson and Sarah Smith, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s controller and chief accounting officer, are among deputies that were viewed as potential successors to Viniar, people familiar with the matter said last year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;ll be relying on the staff extensively,&#8221; Schwartz said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be relying on them as much as David has.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Schwartz graduated from Rutgers University in 1987 and earned a master&#8217;s degree in business administration from Columbia University in 1996. He joined Goldman Sachs&#8217;s commodities sales and trading unit J. Aron in 1997 and spent most of his career in sales, except for two years in the financing group that advises corporate clients on debt and equity financing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His start at J. Aron is similar to that of Blankfein and Chief Operating Officer Gary D. Cohn, 52, who both began their Goldman Sachs careers in that business. By contrast, Viniar joined the investment-banking department in 1980 and was promoted to CFO after serving as deputy chief financial officer under then-CFO John A. Thain. Before that, Viniar oversaw the firm&#8217;s treasury and controllers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Schwartz&#8217;s Career &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Schwartz became co-head of the securities division in February 2008, giving him oversight of the company&#8217;s biggest business by revenue. Isabelle Ealet, 49, the French-born former commodities chief who helps run securities from London, and Pablo J. Salame, 46, the New York-based Ecuadoran citizen who has experience overseeing equities, credit and emerging markets, will be left in charge of the business after Schwartz&#8217;s move. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In his new post, Schwartz will receive a base salary of $1.85 million as well as a bonus, Goldman Sachs said in a filing today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Lot of Credit&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Viniar, who was awarded $11.85 million in salary and bonuses for 2011, held about 1.83 million shares of Goldman Sachs stock as of March 26, according to the firm&#8217;s annual proxy filing. His holding is valued at more than $219 million, based on yesterday&#8217;s closing price of $119.88 a share. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I will continue to be a large stockholder for many years to come,&#8221; Viniar said in response to an analyst&#8217;s question about whether he planned to sell any of his shares when he leaves. &#8220;I&#8217;m confident that Harvey as a CFO will continue to get the stock price higher.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Viniar will get &#8220;a lot of credit&#8221; for managing the firm&#8217;s risk through the financial crisis and helping the company emerge in a strong position relative to peers, Roger Freeman, an analyst at Barclays Plc&#8217;s investment-banking unit in New York, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s obviously not fair to credit one person for that but everything they&#8217;ve done, he&#8217;s been on top of,&#8221; Freeman said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Christine Harper in New York at  charper@bloomberg.net; Michael J.

&lt;p&gt;A U.S. Senate committee memo said Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) used aggressive international tax maneuvers to avoid billions of dollars in taxes over the past three years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The committee memo, released for a hearing today in Washington, said Microsoft used transactions with subsidiaries in Puerto Rico, Ireland, Singapore and Bermuda to save at least $6.5 billion in taxes. The committee also revealed that Hewlett- Packard Co. (HP) has used a series of short-term internal loans that allowed the company to tap its offshore cash for domestic operations without paying taxes, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat and chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, didn&#8217;t accuse the companies of acting illegally, though he said he was &#8220;highly dubious&#8221; that HP was in compliance with the tax law. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Such financial maneuvers &#8220;may be in your temporary interest as a corporation,&#8221; Levin told Bill Sample, Microsoft&#8217;s corporate vice president for worldwide tax, at the hearing. &#8220;It increases your profits and reduces your taxes, but there&#8217;s a heavy cost to the United States,&#8221; Levin said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Levin and the panel&#8217;s top Republican, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, sent the memo to committee members. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Coburn described the moves as &#8220;properly legal tax avoidance&#8221; by companies taking advantage of a tax code that needs an overhaul. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our report is about the symptoms of the disease, not the real disease,&#8221; he said at the hearing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Global Business &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The report describes the ways companies can move profits outside of the country and keep them there to avoid U.S. taxes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We comply with U.S. and foreign tax laws,&#8221; Sample said at the hearing. &#8220;That is not to say that the rules cannot be improved.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S.-based companies owe U.S. taxes on profits they earn around the world. They receive credits against that liability for taxes paid to foreign governments, and they don&#8217;t have to pay U.S. taxes until they bring the money home. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The gap between the 35 percent U.S. corporate tax rate and lower tax rates in the rest of the world gives companies an incentive to book profits outside of the U.S. Levin said technology companies can easily move intangible assets such as patents outside of the U.S. with intra-company transactions at low prices. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Hard to Value &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those intangible assets are hard to value, and disputes about the correct price for such intra-company transactions are common. When foreign subsidiaries in low-tax countries pay too little, either up front or over time, they can get annual profits paid to them out of proportion to what they paid. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The high-tech industry is probably the number-one user of these offshore entities to transfer intellectual property,&#8221; Levin said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In questioning Sample, Levin outlined how Microsoft uses transactions within the company, all with its own money, to assign about 47 percent of its income from U.S. sales to a Puerto Rico subsidiary, and how it shifts some income from around the world to a Bermuda subsidiary that has no employees. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Levin&#8217;s investigators sent letters to companies and used subpoenas to get information that companies don&#8217;t typically disclose. He said they focused on Microsoft and HP to show patterns that are common across U.S. companies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;IRS Enforcement &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Levin attributed such tax avoidance in part to a lack of enforcement by the Internal Revenue Service, gaps in IRS regulations and &#8220;loopholes&#8221; created by Congress. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Levin emphasized HP&#8217;s use of loans to tap its offshore cash. The loans, the report said, are structured to comply with the letter of tax rules that allow short-term loans from subsidiaries in Belgium and the Cayman Islands to the parent company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although long-term loans would trigger tax consequences, the alternating-loan program provided a potential continuous stream of money for HP. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The memo, citing company documents, said as much as $5 billion was available to the parent company in 2008 and that the company borrowed from $6 billion to $9 billion in 2010. HP holds $29.1 billion in untaxed earnings outside the U.S., according to the company&#8217;s most recent annual filing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fiscal Calendars &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;IRS rules allow companies to take loans from foreign subsidiaries without tax consequences within a given fiscal quarter. The Belgian and Cayman subsidiaries have different fiscal calendars. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company developed a schedule that allowed loans from the Belgian subsidiary within its fiscal quarters, and then loans from the Cayman subsidiary with a calendar that covered the periods when the Belgian subsidiary was crossing from one quarter to the next. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lester Ezrati, a senior vice president for tax at HP, said at the hearing that the company did have gaps in its borrowing from the foreign subsidiaries. He also said the IRS didn&#8217;t raise concerns when it examined the loans during a recent audit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;HP has fully complied with U.S. tax law, the company said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are disappointed to see what appears to be a politically motivated attack on one of America&#8217;s largest employers,&#8221; it said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Richard Rubin in Washington at  rrubin12@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Jodi Schneider at  jschneider50@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;
</body></entry><entry author="By Kasia Klimasinska" date="Sep 20, 2012  4:39 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-20/jpmorgan-power-trading-business-faces-suspension-ferc-says.html"><headline>JPMorgan Power-Trading Business Faces Suspension, FERC Says</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission has accused J.P. Morgan Ventures Energy Corp. of
misleading regulators and said its authority to sell electricity
might be suspended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FERC issued an order today that directs the unit of New
York-based JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) to show that it didn&#8217;t violate
FERC regulations and explain why its authorization to sell
electric energy and related services at market-based rates
should not be suspended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That can be more serious than a penalty, that could be
more serious than disgorging profits,&#8221; said Susan Court,
principal at SJC Energy Consultants LLC in Arlington, Virginia,
and a former FERC enforcement director. &#8220;That could entail a
lot more money than just paying a penalty.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The order is part of FERC&#8217;s effort to increase transparency
and eliminate manipulation of the electricity market. The agency
is investigating JPMorgan&#8217;s power trading in California and the
Midwest. That investigation came to light when FERC went to
court seeking internal e-mails from JPMorgan, saying the bids
from the company might have resulted in at least $73 million in
improper payments to generators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FERC Chairman Jon Wellinghoff has pledged to expand
oversight of the multibillion dollar energy-trading business. In
February, the agency created a division within its enforcement
office to police the markets where electricity is bought and
sold by power generators and utilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;California Grid &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute stems from requests in 2011 by the California
Independent System Operator, a grid operator, for information
about JPMorgan&#8217;s energy profits. JPMorgan told the operator that
the matter should be referred to FERC, even though FERC directed
CAISO to get the information from the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan eventually provided the information, though said
it was doing so voluntarily even as FERC told the company it was
obliged to comply, according to the order posted on FERC&#8217;s
website today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The order &#8220;preliminarily finds that JPMorgan may have
omitted material information or submitted misleading
information&#8221; four times in communications with FERC, the
California grid operator and that agency&#8217;s Department of Market
Monitoring, according to FERC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan must respond within 21 days of the order being
published in the Federal Register. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wholesale Markets &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power companies can sell wholesale energy at market-based
rates, or cost-based rates, which are usually lower. FERC, which
grants the authority to sell electricity at market-based rates,
does so assuming that &#8220;a company&#8217;s behavior will not involve
fraud, deception or misrepresentation,&#8221; the commission said
today in the order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Thus, the commission has repeatedly emphasized that
companies failing to adhere to the commission&#8217;s rules and
regulations are subject to suspension or revocation of their
market-based rate authority,&#8221; according to the order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to prove market manipulation, but filing a
false document that&#8217;s material -- that&#8217;s not so hard to prove,&#8221;
SJC Energy&#8217;s Court said. &#8220;Either you did it or you didn&#8217;t.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to
comment because the company hadn&#8217;t seen the FERC order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street firms have been players in energy trading at
least since the late 1990&#8217;s, when many states restructured their
power markets. In so-called deregulated markets, buyers bid for
electricity from power generators. Consumers then purchase the
power from their local utility. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nigeria&#8217;s bond market is taking off as the world&#8217;s biggest underwriter of emerging-market debt adds securities from Africa&#8217;s largest oil producer to its benchmark index. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yields on 10-year naira-denominated notes have dropped 372 basis points since Aug. 15, when JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) said it plans to add the bonds to its GBI-EM Index from Oct. 1, compared with a three basis-points average increase for securities in the measure. Nigeria&#8217;s economic outlook is improving as policy makers remove restrictions on foreign investment, control inflation and steady the currency, Giulia Pellegrini, JPMorgan&#8217;s sub-Saharan Africa economist, said in an interview two days ago. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Adding Nigeria to the index may lure about $1 billion to the country and increase trading in the $36 billion local debt market, according to JPMorgan. The naira, devalued twice by the central bank since 2008, has risen 2.9 percent this year to 157.76 against the dollar, the best among the 23 most-traded African currencies tracked by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The inclusion &#8220;could be a potential game changer,&#8221; said Morten Bugge, chief investment officer at Kolding, Denmark-based Global Evolution (SXGFMFI), which oversees $1 billion and owns Nigerian debt. &#8220;It&#8217;s a money machine if the currency remains stable. It&#8217;s a pretty strong story.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Getting Exposure&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oil accounts for 95 percent of the West African nation&#8217;s foreign-exchange income and 80 percent of government revenue. Nigeria is Africa&#8217;s second-largest economy after South Africa, which has 1.45 trillion rand ($176 billion) of debt on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, the size of Russia&#8217;s ruble market. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s GBI-EM Index may include Nigerian debt maturing in 2014, 2019 and 2022 in a gradual inclusion starting Oct. 1 and finishing by year-end, according to an Aug. 15 note to clients. The bonds, with a market valuation of $3.2 billion as of August, may represent about 0.59 percent in the index. About $170 billion of assets are benchmarked to the JPMorgan index, according to Pellegrini. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yields on the nation&#8217;s 16.39 percent debt due January 2022 rose six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, yesterday to 12.37 percent, after hitting a record low of 12.05 percent on Sept. 17, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yields on South Africa&#8217;s notes due in 2021 rose three basis points to 6.66 percent as of 1:25 p.m. in Johannesburg, while the average in JPMorgan&#8217;s GBI-EM broad diversified index fell by two to 5.89 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Record Lows &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nigeria&#8217;s seven-year borrowing costs dropped to a record low at a monthly debt auction yesterday. Yields on the 30 billion naira of notes maturing June 2019 plunged 324 basis points from the last sale in August to 12.9 percent, the Debt Management Agency said in an e-mailed statement today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nigeria may not be a South Africa yet, but it&#8217;s certainly going towards that direction,&#8221; Pellegrini said by phone from London. The country&#8217;s &#8220;considerable yield premium will also make a number of investors very interested in getting exposure to Nigeria.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The inclusion will increase foreign investments into Nigeria and may strengthen the naira, the Debt Management Agency said in a statement on Aug. 16. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Central bank Governor Lamido Sanusi lifted a requirement last year for foreign investors to hold local-currency debt for at least one year to attract capital. The removal of the restriction has been key to luring investors and improving liquidity, said Pellegrini. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Corrupt Bankers &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sanusi, who was named Governor of the Year in the world by The Banker magazine in 2011 for weeding out corrupt bankers, has raised benchmark interest rates 6 percentage points since 2010 to a record 12 percent. While annual inflation dropped to an eight-month low of 11.7 percent in August, it&#8217;s still above the central bank&#8217;s target of 10 percent. Policy makers kept rates on hold Sept. 18. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Foreign reserves have increased 33 percent to $40.8 billion since hitting a two-year low last October, helped by a 20 percent jump in the nation&#8217;s benchmark Bonny Light crude blend from this year&#8217;s low in June. Nigeria&#8217;s debt amounted to 18 percent of its gross domestic product at the end of 2011, compared with an average of 38 percent of developing countries, according to the International Monetary Fund. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;External Buffers &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The country&#8217;s external buffers are gradually being restored,&#8221; Razia Khan, the London-based head of Africa research at Standard Chartered Plc, wrote in a Sept. 18 note to clients. &#8220;It is all important that this process continues for Nigeria to be able to safeguard both price stability and growth should these be put to the test by weaker oil prices in the future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A former British colony, Nigeria is rated B+ at Standard  Poor&#8217;s, along with Venezuela and Zambia, four steps below investment grade. The daily trading of naira amounts to as much as $200 million, according to Citigroup Inc. (C) About $14 billion of South Africa&#8217;s rand changes hands daily, according to a 2010 survey by the Bank for International Settlements. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kieran Curtis, who helps oversee $4 billion in emerging- market debt at Aviva Investors Ltd. in London, said the naira isn&#8217;t cheap and the yields of Nigeria bonds aren&#8217;t high enough to compensate for risk that prices could accelerate. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While inflation has cooled this year, it has ranged from a record of 15.6 percent in February 2010 to a low of 4.2 percent in April 2007, the year that Bloomberg began tracking the data. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Currency Devalued &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The naira lost about a quarter of its value between 2008 and 2009 when the regulator started restricting the supply of foreign exchange after oil prices plummeted. The currency was devalued again in November last year when the central bank changed its trading range to 3 percent above or below 155 per dollar, weaker than the previous midpoint set at 150. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nigeria&#8217;s benchmark stock index plunged 84 percent in 2008 after the West African nation&#8217;s banking crisis. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have some way to go before we get very comfortable with sub-Saharan credit outside South Africa,&#8221; said Curtis in a telephone interview. &#8220;When the currency band isn&#8217;t held, you can lose a lot of money very quickly. We want a big margin for error.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nigeria is still plagued by corruption and is placed 143rd out of 182 countries in a global Corruption Perceptions Index released in December by Transparency International, the Berlin- based anti-graft watchdog. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Terrorist Attacks &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The West African nation is also grappling with an Islamist militant group called Boko Haram in the north of the country. The insurgents, whose name means &#8220;Western education is a sin,&#8221; has claimed responsibility for hundreds of attacks over the past two years on churches, government buildings and the killing of police, soldiers, officials, and Muslims who disagree with its goals of creating an Islamic state. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sanusi, 51, fired the chief executive officers of eight lenders, pumped 620 billion naira into ailing banks and created a state-owned company to buy bad debt to push the country through its banking crisis in 2009. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Policy makers have since tightened regulations for lenders, reduced subsidies on gasoline and set up a sovereign wealth fund that will help build infrastructure and save oil revenue. The economy of Nigeria, Africa&#8217;s most populous country, will probably expand 6.8 percent next year as agricultural output and crude production increases, Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said in an interview on Aug. 10. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;More Bullish&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;As average yields in emerging markets fell to record lows in July, investors started allocating funds to bonds in &#8220;some exotic countries,&#8221; including Nigeria, Ghana, Sri Lanka and Guatemala, according to Citigroup. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The New-York based bank recommended its clients buy six- month Nigerian bills on Aug. 9, saying the yields are attractive as the currency remains stable. Citigroup became &#8220;more bullish&#8221; on Aug. 16 following JPMorgan&#8217;s announcement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rising oil revenue and capital inflow will help the naira stay within the central bank&#8217;s target band over the next six months, according to Bank of America Corp. The bank scrapped its call on Sept. 6 for the central bank to raise the interest rates two more times to support the naira. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We like Nigeria,&#8221; said Stuart Culverhouse, chief economist at Exotix Ltd. in London, who recommends buying six- month Nigerian bills. &#8220;Nigeria over the past 10 years has made a big stride in terms of reform. They cannot be complacent in this environment but they have a strong starting point.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Ye Xie in New York at  yxie6@bloomberg.net; Chris Kay in Abuja at  ckay5@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editor responsible for this story: Vernon Wessels at  vwessels@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European antitrust regulators may
open a new investigation into whether Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) can avoid
giving a choice of browsers in a new version of its Windows
operating system for tablet computers, the bloc&#8217;s competition
chief said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will need to look at this,&#8221; Joaquin Almunia, the
European Union&#8217;s competition commissioner, told Bloomberg News
following a speech at an antitrust conference in New York today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows RT, the version of the software for tablets and
other devices that run on chips designed by ARM Holdings Plc,
prohibits any browser except for Internet Explorer, according to
a May blog post by Mozilla Corp., maker of the rival Firefox
browser. The software is to be introduced Oct. 26. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re confident that our updates to the Windows family of
products -- Windows 8, Windows RT and Windows Phone -- will
offer customers additional choice in a very competitive
market,&#8221; Robin Koch, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft, said in an e-mail. &#8220;We are working with the
commission to answer any questions it may have.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft agreed with EU regulators in 2009 to offer a
choice of browsers to users running its Windows operating
software for five years to settle an antitrust case alleging it
unfairly tied Internet Explorer to Windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Technical Error &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest software maker in July offered to
extend its commitment until March 2016 after the EU&#8217;s antitrust
agency said the company failed to comply with the settlement to
show the browser screen to some users. The company expressed
regret for what it said was a technical error that meant the
browser selection wasn&#8217;t shown on about 28 million computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU regulators are preparing an antitrust complaint over
Microsoft&#8217;s failure to comply with the browser-choice
requirement under the 2009 settlement agreement, two people
familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News Sept. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almunia said a review of the tablet software would be a new
matter that would be handled separately from the existing probe,
in which Microsoft admitted it had failed to comply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has already been fined 1.68 billion euros
($2.2 billion) in EU antitrust probes, including an 899 million-
euro penalty for failing to obey an order to share data with
competitors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Pope, a managing director
in loan sales at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), is leaving the firm,
according to two people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pope, who joined the bank in 1999, is departing almost two
years after being promoted to the firm&#8217;s second-highest ranking
after partners, said the people who declined to be identified
because the move hasn&#8217;t been made public. Pope and Tiffany
Galvin, a spokeswoman in New York, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, has
reduced its staff by almost 10 percent from the end of 2010 as
its revenue from sales and trading declined. Pope joins other
managing directors in corporate debt who have left in the past
12 months, including Courtney Mather, who headed U.S. loan
trading, Buckley Ratchford, who ran global bank loan trading and
distressed investing and Stephen Hickey, who led global
leveraged finance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank said in July that it plans to eliminate $500
million from annual expenses, mostly from compensation, after
reporting its lowest first-half revenue since 2005. It employed
32,300 people at the end of June compared with 35,700 in
December 2010, according to the bank&#8217;s filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer David A. Viniar, who will end his
32-year career at Goldman Sachs in January, said on a July 17
conference call with investors that the firm expected to reduce
&#8220;people-related&#8221; costs by shifting to a &#8220;more junior and less
senior weighted head count going forward.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harvey M. Schwartz, one of the firm&#8217;s three global co-heads
from the sales and trading division, will take over as chief
financial officer, the New York-based bank said on Sept. 17. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bill Clinton has a favorite Robert Rubin story. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s 1999, and the Cabinet has gathered to discuss the business of the American people. Except no one can focus because the impeachment crisis is raging, and even the most veteran Washington power players are, for lack of a better term, freaking out.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was amazing what he did,&#8221; says Clinton of Rubin, his then-Treasury Secretary. &#8220;He often didn&#8217;t say much, and I was stunned when he wanted to speak. He just sat there and in about three minutes summed up the whole thing in a very calm way, and had an incredibly positive impact on the attitude of the Cabinet," as reported in Bloomberg Businessweek's Sept. 24 issue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;He said, &#8216;What we&#8217;ve got to do is get up tomorrow and go back to work, just like we did today, make good things happen, and trust the system and trust the American people. It&#8217;s going to be fine.&#8217; And oh my God, you would&#8217;ve thought that somebody had gone around and lifted a rock off everybody&#8217;s shoulders.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rubin&#8217;s knack for spreading wisdom and tranquility has been the defining trait of his professional life. Whether economies across Asia are contaminating each other like kids on a school bus or the Mexican government rises one morning and decides to devalue the peso, Rubin&#8217;s hooded eyes and perpetually mussed gray hair give him the air of an ancient Galapagos tortoise. Whatever nastiness politics or the global economy may throw at him, he abides. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Constant Demand &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This legendary stillness, combined with decades of economic and market expertise, keeps Rubin in constant demand. Since 2007 he&#8217;s been the co-chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, where he maintains a disheveled office and employs his longtime assistant. He&#8217;s considered the intellectual father of the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution, which examines the relationship between government spending and unemployment. He&#8217;s a regular participant at the annual Bilderberg Meetings (so secretive they make Davos look like an American Idol taping) and a member of the Harvard Corporation, the discreet board that runs his alma mater. He also meets regularly with congressmen and foreign leaders and has access to the Obama administration through Timothy Geithner and other proteges. In 2010 he joined Centerview Partners, an advisory investment banking boutique, as a counselor to founders Blair Effron and Robert Pruzan. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Pivotal Role &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s enough to keep a 74-year-old plenty busy. But not enough to shake questions about just how wise and thoughtful Robert Rubin really is, especially on the fourth anniversary of a financial crisis in which he played a pivotal, under-examined role. Rubinomics -- his signature economic philosophy, in which the government balances the budget with a mix of tax increases and spending cuts, driving borrowing rates down -- was the blueprint for an economy that scraped the sky. When it collapsed, due in part to bank-friendly policies that Rubin advocated, he made more than $100&#160;million while others lost everything. &#8220;You have to view people in a fair light,&#8221; says Phil Angelides, co-chair of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, who credits Rubin for much of the Clinton era prosperity. &#8220;But on the other side of the ledger are key acts, such as the deregulation of derivatives, or stopping the Commodities Futures Trading Commission from regulating derivatives, that in the end weakened our financial system and exposed us to the risk of financial disaster.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) asked China to stop
the alleged use of pirated versions of its Office software by
China National Petroleum Corp. and three other state-owned
companies, three people familiar with the situation said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s biggest software company filed its complaint
against CNPC, China Post Group, China Railway Construction Corp.
and Travelsky Technology Ltd. (696) last month to a government panel
led by Vice Premier Wang Qishan, said the three people, who
asked not to be identified because the filing isn&#8217;t public.
Microsoft alleged that more than 40 percent of Office and
Windows server client software used by CNPC, parent of China&#8217;s
largest company by value, is unlicensed, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft spokesman Charles Shen said he didn&#8217;t immediately
have any information on the filing. Liu Weijiang, a Beijing-
based spokesman at CNPC, said the company hadn&#8217;t heard about
Microsoft&#8217;s complaints. Liu declined to comment on whether CNPC
used pirated versions of the Office software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xu Zhaohui, who is in charge of hardware and software for
China Post, said Microsoft&#8217;s allegations were &#8220;inaccurate.&#8221;
The company, which delivers mail, received a complaint from
Microsoft within the past month and has sent a written response,
Xu said by telephone yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Piracy Rates &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft alleges that 84 percent of China Railway
Construction&#8217;s Office software is unlicensed along with 97
percent of its Windows server client software, according to the
complaint, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those estimates &#8220;greatly exaggerated&#8221; the use of
unlicensed software by China Railway Construction, the company
said in an e-mailed response supplied by Kevin Mao, an outside
public relations representative for the listed unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We do not rule out the possibility some subsidiary units
may have used unauthorized software, but it certainly is not
such a large proportion,&#8221; China Railway Construction said in
the statement. &#8220;The company attaches great importance to this
matter, and we are holding an internal inquiry.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls to the Travelsky headquarters number listed on its
website weren&#8217;t answered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer met Wang in
Beijing in May, and the vice premier pledged to crack down on
software piracy, the official Xinhua News Agency reported at the
time. In a speech at Peking University during the trip, Ballmer
said intellectual property protection in China is &#8220;weak,&#8221;
making it hard to sell legitimate software. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The German Foreign Ministry
summoned Belarus&#8217;s ambassador to protest the denial of visa
applications three days before parliamentary elections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limits to press and travel freedom are a &#8220;notably negative
signal&#8221; before the Belarus election, the Foreign Ministry in
Berlin said in an e-mailed statement today. The former Soviet
republic is holding the election on Sept. 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The government has no understanding why election
observers -- including a delegate from the German Bundestag --
and journalists were denied visas in connection with the
upcoming parliamentary election in Belarus,&#8221; the ministry said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entry into Belarus by the German lawmaker, regime critic
Marieluise Beck, and a Lithuanian legislator were denied as
&#8220;undesirable,&#8221; Belarus Foreign Ministry spokesman Andrei
Savinykh told Interfax news agency yesterday. Calls placed to
the ministry in Minsk seeking comment were unanswered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beck told the Minsk-based Belapan news agency that the
denial of her visa is &#8220;further proof that the elections are a
farce.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A promising future in academia and
business beckoned Majid Abbasi. His research on how welding
affects the properties of steel earned him a doctorate from
Brigham Young University and a job offer from the University of
Alabama. He was also seeking to patent and commercialize a
technique he&#8217;d invented to improve cleaning of contact lenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he made a fateful move that shattered those prospects:
he visited his parents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Abbasi went home to Iran on vacation in December, the
U.S. government has barred him from returning. The State
Department twice denied him visas, saying it had reason to
believe he would engage in espionage, sabotage or prohibited
export of sensitive information. Alabama withdrew its offer.
Because of U.S. sanctions on trade with Iran, the startup that
licensed his contact lens concept can&#8217;t pay him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My first reaction was the famous American slang: Holy
Cow, seriously? I&#8217;m a scientist and avoid politics,&#8221; Abbasi,
31, wrote in an e-mail. &#8220;Sabotage, espionage, technology
transfer are baseless, unfair labels. I do not appreciate such
labels.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbasi&#8217;s work isn&#8217;t sensitive, faculty members at Alabama
and Brigham Young said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Majid was a gem everyone in the department knew and
enjoyed being around,&#8221; said Tracy Nelson, a professor of
mechanical engineering at Brigham Young. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Visas &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As growing tensions and sanctions over Iran&#8217;s nuclear
program spill into academia, Abbasi&#8217;s plight is becoming more
common. At least half a dozen Iranian graduate students in
engineering who were slated to attend universities such as
Michigan State, Southern Illinois, South Carolina, Pittsburgh
and Northwestern this year couldn&#8217;t come because the U.S.
rejected their visa applications under the same espionage
clause, Bloomberg News has found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visa denials run counter to the policy of the Obama
administration, which has reached out to Iranian students and
has said that its sanctions are designed to hurt Iran&#8217;s regime,
not its people. The U.S. eased travel restrictions for some
Iranian students in May 2011, and opened a &#8220;virtual embassy&#8221;
in Tehran in December to foster communication. Enrollment of
Iranian graduate students at U.S. universities more than tripled
to 4,696 in 2010-2011 from 1,475 in 2004-2005, according to the
Institute of International Education in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More Barriers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You -- the young people of Iran -- carry within you both
the ancient greatness of Persian civilization and the power to
forge a country that is responsive to your aspirations,&#8221;
President Barack Obama said in a March 2011 message marking the
Iranian New Year. &#8220;Your talent, your hopes, and your choices
will shape the future of Iran, and help light the world. And
though times may seem dark, I want you to know that I am with
you.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, more Iranian students are likely to face further
barriers to entering the U.S. under legislation Obama signed
last month. It ordered the Secretary of State to deny visas to
any Iranians seeking to take coursework to prepare for careers
in Iran&#8217;s energy industry, nuclear science, nuclear engineering
or a related field. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate Banking Committee drafted the provision.
Chairman Tim Johnson, a South Dakota Democrat, &#8220;wanted to make
sure we weren&#8217;t inadvertently allowing technology or knowledge
transfer&#8221; that could undercut U.S. sanctions prohibiting
assistance to Iran&#8217;s oil industry and nuclear program, committee
spokesman Sean Oblack said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The State Department approved the restriction, said Jamal
Abdi, policy director of the National Iranian American Council,
an advocacy group in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Upper Hand&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a tug of war inside the State Department between
supporters of outreach to the Iranian people and those who want
to broaden sanctions,&#8221; Abdi said. &#8220;The new law suggests that
the sanctions advocates have gained the upper hand.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tensions have been building between the U.S. and Israel
over a possible Israeli strike on suspected Iranian nuclear
weapons facilities. The visa denials likely reflect both
classified intelligence information and concerns that students
could pose a danger in the event of war with Iran, said Fred
Burton, a former State Department special agent focused on
Iranian terrorism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you think about the saber rattling and war footing
that everybody&#8217;s discussing, you want to minimize the
probability of attacks here domestically,&#8221; said Burton, now
vice president of intelligence for geopolitical consulting firm
Stratfor in Austin, Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Talented Pool &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American universities are eager to tap Iran&#8217;s students,
many of whom excel in science and math. Iran finished eighth
among 100 nations in the 2012 International Mathematical
Olympiad, a math championship for high school students.
Presidents of half a dozen universities including Carnegie
Mellon, Rice and the University of Florida visited Iran in late
2008 to foster academic ties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 23 new Iranian graduate students whom the University of
Florida expected to enroll this semester, only 16 have shown up,
University of Florida President Bernie Machen said. The other
seven may have been denied visas, or have had difficulty
transferring funds from Iran because of the sanctions, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iranian students are &#8220;a pool of very talented young people
who desire further education in this country,&#8221; especially in
science, engineering and math, Machen said. &#8220;We&#8217;re
disappointed. Politics trumps education in this case.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Iranian this year won a Northwestern University
fellowship for outstanding first-year graduate students in
mechanical engineering, only to be refused a visa. His admission
has been deferred, university spokeswoman Pat Tremmel said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Espionage Operations &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Iranian espionage increasingly worries
federal authorities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Iran&#8217;s intelligence operations against the United States,
including cyber capabilities, have dramatically increased in
recent years in depth and complexity,&#8221; James R. Clapper,
director of National Intelligence, testified before Congress in
January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration is also facing political pressure
from Congress and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney
to crack down on Iran. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;From Day One in 2009, Congress has been coming at the
administration like a steamroller on Iran-related issues in an
effort to box us in,&#8221; said Reza Marashi, a former officer on
the State Department&#8217;s Iran desk and now research director of
the National Iranian American Council. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Romney&#8217;s Call &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sept. 9, Romney called for &#8220;crippling sanctions&#8221; and
criticized what he called Obama&#8217;s &#8220;policy of engagement&#8221; with
Iran. &#8220;That policy has not worked, and we&#8217;re closer to a
nuclear weapon as a result,&#8221; Romney said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Iranian students have been criminally prosecuted in the
past five years for exporting restricted U.S. technology or
munitions to Iran, according to the Justice Department. It
declined to comment on whether any investigations are under way
for export or espionage violations involving Iranian students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once in the U.S., Iranian students generally may only work
on fundamental research that is publishable or in the public
domain. They typically aren&#8217;t eligible for licenses that
foreigners need to conduct weapons-related research under
federal rules on arms traffic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The State Department&#8217;s Bureau of Consular Affairs refused
visas to 262 non-immigrants worldwide under Section
212(a)(3)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act in fiscal
2011, up from 101 in 2010 and 13 in 2000, according to the State
Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Appeals Difficult &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The provision states that the consular officer &#8220;knows or
has reasonable ground to believe&#8221; that the alien seeks to enter
the U.S. to &#8220;engage solely, principally, or incidentally in any
activity&#8221; to violate U.S. law related to espionage, sabotage or
prohibited export of &#8220;goods, technology or sensitive
&#8220;information.&#8221;  Protected by a long-standing legal doctrine
known as consular non-reviewability, denials are hard to appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consular officers &#8220;are erring on the side of caution,
maybe if they have an inkling of a doubt,&#8221; said Marashi. &#8220;When
elephants fight, it&#8217;s the grass that gets trampled.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all of the people turned away are Iranian. A Chinese
graduate student admitted to Carnegie Mellon University in
Pittsburgh in 2010 was denied a visa for the same reason, said
Linda Gentile, director of the school&#8217;s office of international
education. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denials are based on &#8220;all the information we have
available to us&#8221; after extensive reviews by federal agencies,
said State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Finan, who declined
to discuss individual cases. &#8220;If we&#8217;re denying the visa for
that reason, it&#8217;s necessitated because of the evidence.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa applicants from Iran warrant special attention if
their academic pursuit appears on a U.S government list of
&#8220;critical fields&#8221; used in developing weapons of mass
destruction, according to a State Department manual. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interview Questions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consular officers &#8220;are not expected to be versed in all
the fields on the list,&#8221; the manual states. &#8220;Rather, you
should shoot for familiarization and listen for key words or
phrases from the list in applicants&#8217; answers to interview
questions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Ali Moslemi was a graduate student in mechanical
engineering at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, he went
home on vacation in December 2009. He had to wait 10 months
before his visa to return to the U.S. was granted. He earned his
doctorate in 2010 and works in the oil industry in Houston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authorities may have held up his visa because he was
researching propulsion, Moslemi said. While the U.S. stopped
releasing the alert list about a decade ago, the last publicly
available versions identified rocket propulsion technologies as
a critical field. Moslemi, though, was working on a type of
propulsion known as pulse jet, which occurs in heartbeats and in
the swimming of squid and jellyfish, not in rockets, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Dangerous Guy&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t military but it had the word propulsion,&#8221; said
Moslemi, president of the Iranian Students and Graduates
Association in the United States. Consular officials &#8220;are not
technical people. If there&#8217;s a match, they say, &#8216;He&#8217;s a
dangerous guy.&#8221;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iran was the leading foreign source of students at U.S.
universities in the 1970s before the Islamic revolution that
brought the current regime to power. The influx peaked at 51,310
in 1979-1980, triple the number from the second-biggest
supplier, Taiwan. Some returned to Iran and became professors,
who now guide their students to the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the 1979 revolution, the number of students from Iran
dwindled. Today, while Iranian undergraduates remain scarce in
the U.S., the graduate-student population has rebounded,
especially in the sciences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Brain Drain &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iran ranked seventh among countries sending graduate
students to the U.S. in 2010-2011, up from 26th in 2004-05. The
University of California enrolled 255 Iranian graduate students
in 2011, up from 29 in 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outdated lab equipment and disillusion with the repressive
regime drive the exodus of Iranian science graduate students.
They&#8217;re also drawn by U.S. universities&#8217; lofty reputation and
financial support for graduate study, students said. Once they
finish their degrees, they often seek jobs here rather than
return to Iran. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Iranian government doesn&#8217;t mind the brain drain of
potential dissidents, said Mohsen Milani, an Iranian-born
professor of politics at the University of South Florida in
Tampa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The thinking is, &#8216;We have a large reservoir of brilliant
students,&#8221;&#8217; Milani said. &#8220;If we lose a few of them, that&#8217;s
okay. That means less trouble internally.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostafa Rahmani, director of the Interests Section of the
Islamic Republic of Iran in Washington, didn&#8217;t respond to
written questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Multiple Entry &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration tried to help Iranian students
last year. Responding to complaints from Iranian-American groups
that students couldn&#8217;t risk going home for weddings or funerals
because they had to reapply to enter the U.S., it introduced a
two-year, multiple-entry visa in May 2011 for Iranian students
whose research isn&#8217;t sensitive or technical. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama personally approved the change, said Marashi, the
former Iran desk officer at the State Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Announcing the multiple-entry visa, Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton told students, &#8220;As long as the Iranian
government continues to stifle your potential, we will stand
with you. We will support your aspirations, and your rights.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple-entry visas are granted sparingly. Less than one-
fourth of Iranian students at U.S. universities receive them,
with the rest on single-entry status, according to an April 2012
survey by the student association headed by Moslemi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.S. Priority &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Eyre, the State Department&#8217;s Persian language
spokesman, sought to reassure Iranian students last month. U.S.
foreign policy &#8220;has nothing to do with granting or denying
visas,&#8221; he said on Voice of America&#8217;s Persian Service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;One of the priorities of the U.S. government is to make
it easier and faster for Iranian students to come to the U.S.
and continue their studies,&#8221; Eyre said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so for Arash Khajeh. When the University of South
Carolina offered him a full scholarship in its mechanical
engineering Ph.D. program, he sought a visa at the U.S. embassy
in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. Iranians travel to Dubai, Turkey,
Armenia and elsewhere for visa interviews because the U.S.
doesn&#8217;t have a consulate in Iran. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have been looking for a talented and motivated
researcher,&#8221; Addis Kidane, assistant professor of mechanical
engineering at South Carolina, wrote to the embassy. &#8220;His
research is open to non-U.S. citizens.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khajeh&#8217;s visa was denied under the espionage clause. Hoping
to get a visa from another embassy, Khajeh, 29, deferred his
enrollment at South Carolina until next semester, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Permanent Vacations &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Iranians already attending American universities have
taken vacations home that turned out to be permanent. After
obtaining his visa at the U.S. embassy in Ankara and entering
Michigan State University in 2009 as a graduate student in
mechanical engineering, Saleh Rezaei Ravesh maintained a 4.0
grade-point average, according to university administrators. His
research, partly funded by NASA, involved developing software to
simulate turbulent flows in problems such as weather
forecasting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ravesh practiced a traditional Iranian musical instrument,
the santour, which is a Persian dulcimer, and gave a concert on
campus. He also sympathized with the Arab Spring uprisings and
attended rallies celebrating rebel victories over the late
Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi, according to lab mate Husam
Abdulrahman, a Libyan-American. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He liked freedom,&#8221; Abdulrahman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Absolute Nightmare&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last December, Ravesh went home to see his ailing mother.
Farhad A. Jaberi, a Michigan State professor and native of Iran,
tried to dissuade Ravesh, who worked in his lab, because he
feared visa problems might delay the student&#8217;s return. While
Ravesh&#8217;s research couldn&#8217;t be used to design actual engineering
systems, some terminology could be misconstrued as sensitive,
Jaberi said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ravesh, 28, hasn&#8217;t been able to come back. After the U.S.
consulate in Dubai denied him a visa under the espionage clause,
he tried Tashkent, where the consular officer rejected him on
the spot without giving a reason, Ravesh said. He had an
interview in Ankara July 19, and is waiting for a decision. His
belongings, including his santour, remain in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It has been an absolute nightmare and overwhelming stress
for me, my wife and the rest of my family,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If he cannot leave Iran by the end of 2012, he is likely to
face compulsory military service, he said. He&#8217;s barred from
working in Iran until those duties are completed, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ravesh &#8220;is not an espionage type of guy,&#8221; said Peter
Briggs, director of Michigan State&#8217;s office for international
students and scholars. &#8220;It&#8217;s not like Mata Hari.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Research Sponsored &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Majid Abbasi, the Brigham Young scientist, is also back in
Iran, unemployed. After earning his master&#8217;s degree from Sharif
University of Technology, Iran&#8217;s premier engineering school, he
arrived at Brigham Young in 2006. Several companies and the
National Science Foundation sponsored Abbasi&#8217;s research on
welding and joining, which was a significant contribution to the
field, said Nelson at Brigham Young. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gregory Thompson, a professor of metallurgical and
materials engineering at the University of Alabama, offered
Abbasi a post-doctoral appointment starting in March 1, 2012.
While Thompson also conducts research for the Department of
Defense, Abbasi would have worked on fundamental science funded
by the university, Thompson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbasi, who enjoyed mountain biking and snowboarding, found
the contact lenses he wore for those activities irritated his
eyes. Using a microscope he modified to examine his own lenses,
he developed a method of cleaning lenses. He and two others are
seeking a patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Red Flags&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He&#8217;s primarily the science behind the device,&#8221; says co-
applicant Jacob Allred, who was in Abbasi&#8217;s research group at
Brigham Young. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Abbasi, who hadn&#8217;t seen his parents for more than five
years, decided to go home for two months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nelson and Allred warned him against it. &#8220;I said, &#8216;Majid,
I think that&#8217;s a bad idea,&#8221;&#8217; Nelson said. &#8220;My feeling was, if
you go home for a month or two, and come back, it looks bad. It
looks like you&#8217;re taking information in and out. Or the
government thinks you&#8217;re meeting with someone over there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the U.S. consulate in Beirut denied his visa on April
16, Alabama couldn&#8217;t wait for Abbasi any longer. Nelson then
invited him to return to Brigham Young as a post-doctoral
fellow. Abbasi&#8217;s visa application was again rejected on Aug. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. sanctions against Iran prohibit Abbasi from playing
any role in Soniclenz LLC, a company established by Allred and a
business partner, which licensed the contact lens invention and
is developing a prototype. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have asked Majid to participate&#8221; in the company as
soon as it&#8217;s allowed, said Allred, an engineer with Exxon Mobil
Corp. &#8220;I&#8217;ve done things with Majid personally, academically and
in business. None of them raise any red flags.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Quinsee, who oversees $120
billion as head of JPMorgan Asset Management&#8217;s large-
capitalization core equity division, comments on how trading is
generally cheaper than it used to be. He spoke in an interview
with Erik Schatzker and Stephanie Ruhle on Bloomberg
Television&#8217;s &#8220;Market Makers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On high-frequency trading: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;High frequency is one of these issues that we hear is
putting off the stock market, and I think that&#8217;s a great pity.
Because net, we think that our ability to trade stocks for
clients actually over the last five years is considerably
improved.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve had to really raise our game. We&#8217;ve made a lot of
investments in technology. It&#8217;s generally cheaper to trade
stocks now than it used to be, and that&#8217;s got to be a good thing
for our clients.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On markets and Europe: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What&#8217;s happening in Europe has been very helpful in
calming people down. One outcome of that is that people feel a
bit more comfortable about owning stocks and we&#8217;re seeing this
sort of very high frequency stocks fall off the edges. Low
volumes are not necessarily a bad thing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When you start to compare valuations with bonds, which is
where of course so much of the money has been going recently,
things look really quite interesting there. One-third of the SP
is still yielding more than the 10-year Treasury. We haven&#8217;t
seen that in modern times. That&#8217;s a very unusual balance still
very much in favor of stocks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trading loss at JPMorgan Chase
 Co. (JPM) helped cut revenue from cash and derivative positions at
U.S. commercial banks by 73 percent, compared with a year ago,
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While both normal seasonal weakness and reduced client
demand played a role, it was clearly the highly publicized
losses at JPMorgan Chase that caused the sharp drop in trading
revenues,&#8221; Martin Pfinsgraff, deputy comptroller for credit and
market risk, said today in a statement. Commercial banks had $2
billion in trading revenue for the second quarter, the
Washington-based regulator said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency said its main measure of credit risk in
derivatives markets, the so-called net current credit exposure,
rose 9 percent, or $32 billion, to $410 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, based in New York, lost $5.8 billion on credit-default swaps trades in the first six months of the year. About
$3.7 billion of that came in the second quarter, according to
Pfinsgraff, which caused the bank to post a $420 million trading
loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. bank by assets is facing regulatory
scrutiny and criminal probes over losses in the Chief Investment
Office, which Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon pushed in
recent years to make bigger and riskier bets with the bank&#8217;s
money. The loss, which Dimon said stemmed from positions that
were &#8220;poorly monitored,&#8221; prompted calls from Congress for
tighter bank regulation and triggered criminal investigations by
the U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of
Investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trades in question, made by a CIO group that included
Bruno Iksil, nicknamed the London Whale because his positions
grew so large, were on portions of credit-swap indexes, people
familiar with the transactions have said. Tranches allow
investors to wager on varying degrees of risk among a pool of
companies. Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower

&lt;p&gt;A U.S. Senate panel probing the multibillion-dollar trading loss by JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) plans to unveil its findings at a hearing this year to press regulators to tighten the Volcker rule, according to three people briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Staff members of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, headed by Senator Carl Levin, have interviewed JPMorgan officials as well as examiners and supervisors at the institution&#8217;s regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the inquiry isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One focus of the queries is whether JPMorgan&#8217;s wrong-way bets on derivatives would have been permitted under regulators&#8217; initial draft of the Volcker ban on proprietary trading, the people said. The lender lost $5.8 billion on the trades in the first six months of the year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Levin of Michigan and Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon, both Democrats, inserted the trading ban into the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, leaving the details largely up to regulators. The senators have said that the JPMorgan loss highlights a loophole in the regulators&#8217; draft that would allow banks to continue hedging their portfolio risks, and they said it should be closed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A patent dispute between Actavis
Group HF and Paris-based Sanofi (SAN) over a drug to treat diabetes
and hypertension was referred to a European Union court by a
London judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actavis, owned by Iceland-based private equity firm Novator
EHF, wants to sell a generic version of Sanofi&#8217;s Aprovel
treatment, according to a written ruling by Judge Richard Arnold
yesterday. Aprovel, also sold as Avapro, generated 1.3 billion
euros ($1.7 billion) in sales in 2011, according to Sanofi&#8217;s
annual report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanofi and the drug&#8217;s distributor Sanofi Pharma Bristol-
Myers Squibb SNC argue that, although Aprovel&#8217;s patent expired,
their right to exclusively sell the product is covered by a
supplementary protection certificate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue is unclear and should be referred to the European
Court of Justice, Arnold said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The referral to the European court to determine the meaning
of rules covering supplementary protection certificates will be
made shortly, Sanofi spokeswoman Marisol Peron said in an e-
mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actavis spokesman Frank Staud said in an e-mail the
certificate was invalid and the company sought to have it
revoked by the European court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Actavis is confident&#8221; the court will decide in its
favor, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Actavis Group PTC EHF  Anr v. Sanofi-Aventis,
High Court of Justice, Chancery Division, HC12C02525. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Moutai&#8217;s &#8216;National Liquor&#8217; Mark Opposed by Other Distillers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five Chinese distillers objected to Kweichow Moutai Co.&#8217;s
application to register &#8220;national liquor&#8221; as a trademark in
China, the Global Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They submitted a petition to the Trademark Office of the
State Administration for Industry  Commerce, stating that
permitting Moutai to register the mark would permit unfair
competition, Global Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granting the registration also would harm the government&#8217;s
reputation, the distillers said, according to Global Times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Fenjiu Group of Shanxi, China, said in an Aug.
6 filing with the trademark office that the Moutai products
weren&#8217;t good enough to &#8220;represent or symbolize the whole
nation,&#8221; Global Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vandy Halts Use of &#8216;12th Man&#8217; After Texas AM Complains &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One lesson learned by incoming freshman at Vanderbilt
University this year is that trademarks of other schools need to
be respected, the Inside Vandy student news service reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T-shirts worn by Vanderbilt students in the annual Freshman
Run that read &#8220;12th Man Tailgate: Class of 2016&#8221; were found to
have infringed a trademark registered to Texas AM University,
the news service reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;12th man&#8221; mark dates back to 1922 when a Texas AM
student was called from the stands to play for the school&#8217;s
short-handed football team, Inside Vandy reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Vanderbilt didn&#8217;t recall the t-shirts, once it was
informed of the infringement, the school removed about 30
references to &#8220;12th man&#8221; that were used in calendars, videos
and photos related to the event, according to the news service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Rape Nation&#8217; Stickers May Infringe University&#8217;s Trademarks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man seen on security-camera footage placing &#8220;rape
nation&#8221; stickers in the University of Montana&#8217;s school colors
around Missoula, Montana, is a potential defendant in a
trademark infringement action by the school, the Missoulian
newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sticker uses a stencil of a bear paw print that is the
same as the university&#8217;s logo, the director of the school&#8217;s
trademark and licensing office told the Missoulian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal departments of education and justice are
investigating reports of sexual assaults at the school, some of
which involve athletes, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to trademark infringement, the placer of the
stickers also faces a possible criminal-mischief charge, police
told the Missoulian. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Microsoft Said to Ask China to Stop Piracy at Four State Firms &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) asked China to stop the alleged use of
pirated versions of its Office software by China National
Petroleum Corp. and three other state-owned companies, three
people familiar with the situation said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s biggest software company filed its complaint
against CNPC, China Post Group, China Railway Construction Corp.
and Travelsky Technology Ltd. (696) last month to a government panel
led by Vice Premier Wang Qishan, said the three people, who
asked not to be identified because the filing isn&#8217;t public.
Microsoft alleged that more than 40 percent of Office and
Windows server client software used by CNPC, parent of China&#8217;s
largest company by value, is unlicensed, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft spokesman Charles Shen said he didn&#8217;t immediately
have any information on the filing. Liu Weijiang, a Beijing-
based spokesman at CNPC, said the company hadn&#8217;t heard about
Microsoft&#8217;s complaints. Liu declined to comment on whether CNPC
used pirated versions of the Office software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xu Zhaohui, who is in charge of hardware and software for
China Post, said Microsoft&#8217;s allegations were &#8220;inaccurate.&#8221;
The company, which delivers mail, received a complaint from
Microsoft within the past month and has sent a written response,
Xu said by telephone yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft alleges that 84 percent of China Railway
Construction&#8217;s Office software is unlicensed along with 97
percent of its Windows server client software, according to the
complaint, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those estimates &#8220;greatly exaggerated&#8221; the use of
unlicensed software by China Railway Construction, the company
said in an e-mailed response supplied by Kevin Mao, an outside
public relations representative for the listed unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls to the Travelsky headquarters number listed on its
website weren&#8217;t answered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer met Wang in
Beijing in May, and the vice premier pledged to crack down on
software piracy, the official Xinhua News Agency reported at the
time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s illegal software market was worth almost $9 billion
last year, compared with a legal market of less than $3 billion,
according to the annual report of the Business Software Alliance
released in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its complaint, Microsoft also alleges that almost all of
Travelsky&#8217;s Office software is unlicensed, with 93 percent of
China Post&#8217;s coming from pirated versions, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The allegations were based on Microsoft&#8217;s own estimates and
calculations, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China agreed during December 2010 meetings with U.S.
officials in Washington to take steps to counter losses from
piracy for software companies. Wang, who led that Chinese
delegation, was named head of a panel created in November with
responsibility for ensuring the protection of intellectual-
property rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Avatar&#8217; Copyright Infringement Case Dismissed in Los Angeles &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal judge in Los Angeles threw out a copyright
infringement case against filmmaker James Cameron and News
Corp&#8217;s 20th Century Fox unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit, filed in January by a Los Angeles writer, accused
Cameron and the studio&#8217;s blockbuster film &#8220;Avatar&#8221; of
infringing copyrights to a children&#8217;s story. &#8220;Avatar&#8221; is the
highest-earning film of all time, according to the
worldwideboxoffice.com website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elijah Schkeiban claimed in his court papers that a third
party passed along his self-published &#8220;Bats and Butterflies&#8221;
screenplay to the &#8220;Avatar&#8221; producers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said there were many similarities in plot, sequence of
events, themes, characters, moods, settings, time and place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Manuel Real disagreed, finding that
Schkeiban failed to demonstrate that Cameron and the studio
actually had access to &#8220;Bats and Butterflies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge granted the defendants&#8217; motion to dismiss the
suit on Sept. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Schkeiban v. Cameron, 12-cv-00636, U.S.
District Court, Central District of California (Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Penn State Fights to Keep Operations Secret After Sandusky &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pennsylvania State University is standing fast against
efforts to open its records to public scrutiny as it overhauls
its administration after the Jerry Sandusky child-sex case,
President Rodney Erickson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erickson, a former provost who took over as president when
President Graham Spanier resigned in November, said making the
university disclose documents and communications to the public
raises &#8220;issues related to our research,&#8221; because of trade
secrets and proprietary information it gets from working with
private industries. He also said many donors want their gifts
kept secret. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers and Republican Governor Tom Corbett, who sits on
the school&#8217;s Board of Trustees, say they want to make it subject
to all the provisions in the state&#8217;s Right-to-Know law, which
permits people to seek e-mails, contracts and other records from
government institutions. While almost all U.S. public
universities are subject to such statutes, Penn State was
excluded when Pennsylvania overhauled its law in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pennsylvania, Delaware and Alaska are the only three states
that exclude public universities from open records laws,
according to Terry Mutchler, executive director of
Pennsylvania&#8217;s Office of Open Records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penn State, which was established by the legislature in
1855 and got about $280 million in state support last year, has
been assailed for a culture of secrecy. Investigators found
university leaders sought to protect the football program by
covering up allegations more than a decade ago that Sandusky, a
former assistant football coach, sexually abused children on
campus. A grand-jury report last year revealed the scandal,
leading to perjury charges against two administrators, the
resignation of President Graham Spanier and firing of football
coaching legend Joe Paterno. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Erickson said in an interview this week that the
president&#8217;s office has been made more open and accountable to
the university&#8217;s Board of Trustees, the university opposes
legislation filed in Harrisburg that would extend all of the
provisions of the open records law. Instead, it supports a
proposal by Senate Majority Leader Dominic Pileggi that would
subject campus police to the law while also increasing
disclosure of how the university spends state funding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pileggi, a Republican elected in 2002, sponsored the
overhaul of Pennsylvania&#8217;s Right-to-Know law in 2008, which made
it easier for the public to get internal information from
government agencies. Penn State opposed its inclusion, with the
former president testifying that it would have a &#8220;profound
negative impact.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is forging a future
in tablets with students like Joe Shapiro, a computer science
major who had never crafted applications for the company&#8217;s
Windows software until he won an internship to try it out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shapiro, a senior at Brown University, spent the summer in
the Foundry paid internship program at Microsoft&#8217;s New England
Research  Development Center, known as NERD. He helped build a
commuter-transit app, Catch It, that should be available for
download later this month in the online store for Windows 8, the
new tablet-friendly version of Microsoft&#8217;s flagship operating
system. And, crucial to Microsoft&#8217;s ambitions, he plans to make
more apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker, designed
Windows 8 for touch-screen technology included in the company&#8217;s
first tablet, Surface, and other devices coming this year. To
gain share in tablets, a market expected by DisplaySearch to
reach $66.4 billion in 2012, Microsoft needs enough apps to
challenge the more than 200,000 available for Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The apps ecosystem is probably the single most important
factor in a customer&#8217;s experience,&#8221; said Al Hilwa, an analyst
at market researcher IDC. &#8220;It dictates what books you read,
what music you listen to, what movies you see, what social
activities you take part in. Problem is, you can&#8217;t have half a
million apps overnight.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interns, also deployed to write prototype apps for the
Windows 8 preview last year, produced six apps through Foundry,
generating enough interest among computer science students for
the company to make the pilot program permanent. Using student
recruits is one way Microsoft can woo app developers who are
used to building programs for mobile phones and tablets, where
the company has little and no share, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;College Struggle&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft has struggled to get college kids interested in
developing for Windows,&#8221; said Wes Miller, an analyst at
Directions on Microsoft, who is based in Kirkland, Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luring programmers before graduation is particularly
critical for recruitment in the U.S., which lags behind
countries such as India and China in its ability to crank out
qualified engineers. The U.S. ranks 23rd among developed nations
in the percentage of students with undergraduate degrees in
science or engineering who are employed in related fields, the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reported
last year. The report analyzed employment trends for people age
25 to 34. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like their counterparts already in the workforce, student
developers have focused programming efforts on apps for Apple&#8217;s
iOS software, which powers the iPad, and Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Android
operating system, used in an array of handheld devices,
including Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)&#8217;s Kindle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s version of the Surface tablet that is most
comparable to the iPad won&#8217;t be able to run older Windows apps,
forcing developers to start from scratch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Playing Catch-Up&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows 8 is the first Microsoft operating system that will
work on computers running chips based on ARM Holdings Plc (ARM)
technology. These chips are widely used in mobile devices,
including the iPad. The ARM-based products will run only apps
designed specifically for the new version of Windows -- and none
of the programs already available for Microsoft software on
machines made for Intel Corp. (INTC)&#8217;s chips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft is definitely playing catch-up with respect to
the global app marketplace,&#8221; said David Hilal, an analyst at
FBR Capital Markets, in an interview. &#8220;Their challenge is a
chicken-and-egg problem. They need to get more users for their
apps to entice developers, but they need better apps to attract
more users.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter NERD interns to help fill the void. This summer&#8217;s
group of 21 interns produced three apps already in the Windows
store, and two more that are expected to follow soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Intern-Built &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the intern-built apps is Trackage, which enables
users to locate packages shipped by FedEx Corp. (FDX), United Parcel
Service Inc. (UPS), the U.S. Postal Service and LaserShip Inc. using a
single app rather than having to go to each service&#8217;s website
separately. Another, Never Late, is an alarm clock app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inkarus is a physics game in which users collect gears and
feathers to help a chubby penguin build a flying machine that
must steer clear of things like antigravity fields and
rainstorms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NERD building, located in Cambridge&#8217;s Kendall Square,
lets Microsoft maintain a base near the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology and Harvard University as well as offices
belonging to Google, VMware Inc. (VMW) and other biotechnology and
venture capital firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parts of the facility, which also houses a research lab and
some of Microsoft&#8217;s Office employees, was designed by Ray Ozzie,
former chief technology officer at the company. Intern desks
have stunning views of the Charles River. Walls are adorned with
banners from an advertising campaign Microsoft ran in places
such as Boston&#8217;s subway, with lines like &#8220;Softwayah&#8221; -- or
software pronounced with a Boston accent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shapiro&#8217;s App &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app that Shapiro and two other students built for
Boston public transit may be available in Microsoft&#8217;s online
store by the end of the month. Shapiro, now well-versed in
Microsoft&#8217;s C# programming language, wants to make more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m a completely C# convert now,&#8221; Shapiro said. &#8220;I
never want to go back.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another intern-made app, FaceReel, also awaits approval. It
uses facial-recognition software to generate videos out of a set
of images -- think of it as a way to create a birthday or 50th-
anniversary video without all the complicated editing or
PowerPoint work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FaceReel was made by a team that included Jancarlo Perez
and Jasmine Huynh, students at MIT who, like Shapiro, hadn&#8217;t
worked on apps for Windows prior to the internship. They, too,
plan to develop Windows apps again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perez described the Windows 8 development environment as
&#8220;fast and fluid,&#8221; echoing the oft-repeated phrase Microsoft
executives have used to describe the program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;App Exposure &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NERD interns who later opt for a career making apps for
Microsoft may find it&#8217;s easier to get exposure for their work
because the field isn&#8217;t as crowded as it is for apps built for
Apple or Google operating systems, said Hilal, the FBR analyst. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As an app developer, you take a little bit of a leap of
faith today with Microsoft,&#8221; Hilal said. &#8220;You can get a lot of
downloads with Apple, but there&#8217;s a lot of competition.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond fostering a desire to work at Microsoft, NERD aims
to create a devoted group of Windows 8 converts who will spread
their enthusiasm among fellow computer science majors and design
students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Because Windows 8 is pre-release, it&#8217;s been so exciting
to get my hands on it before other people have been able to,&#8221;
said Emily Lin, a media arts and sciences major at Wellesley
College, who served as the designer on the Catch It team. &#8220;When
I tell my friends, they say, &#8216;That&#8217;s so cool that you are
getting to develop on Windows 8.&#8217; &#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. needs a policy to address
climate change and a plan to reduce emissions that may include a
carbon tax and bonds, Columbia University Professor Jeffrey Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have to make a technological transition that&#8217;s quite
deep to new energy systems, new transport systems, more
efficient buildings and that can be back loaded,&#8221; Sachs said to
reporters today at Climate Week NYC in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public needs a plan that isn&#8217;t just about electricity
prices rising, said Sachs. &#8220;You can&#8217;t tell the public that our
plan is cap-and-trade,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s not a plan, that&#8217;s
frightening, that just means: our electricity prices are going
up.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sachs suggested that bonds could be used to finance
investments to be paid back over their lifetimes. &#8220;You could
promise today significant feed-in tariffs totally paid for by a
backloaded carbon tax.&#8221; Not leveling with the public is &#8220;the
biggest missing thing,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m happy to have the future pay for a lot of this,&#8221;
Sachs said. &#8220;It can be bond financed --it doesn&#8217;t have to be
current financed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. lost a court ruling
against Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) in Germany regarding claims the
South Korean company&#8217;s Galaxy devices infringed patents on the
iPhone maker&#8217;s touch-screen technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mannheim Regional Court ruled that Samsung didn&#8217;t
violate Apple&#8217;s patents on features related to touch-screen
technology, Jason Kim, a Seoul-based spokesman for the Suwon,
South Korea-based company said in an e-mailed statement Sept.
21. Joachim Bock, a court spokesman, confirmed the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung and Apple, the world&#8217;s two biggest smartphone
makers, have traded victories in their patent disputes fought
over four continents since the Cupertino, California-based
company last year accused Asia&#8217;s biggest electronics maker of
&#8220;slavishly copying&#8221; its devices. The companies, competing for
dominance of the global smartphone market estimated by Bloomberg
Industries at $219 billion last year, are fighting patent
battles even as Apple remains Samsung&#8217;s biggest customer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We welcome today&#8217;s ruling, which affirms our position
that our products do not infringe Apple&#8217;s intellectual
property,&#8221; Samsung said in a Sept. 21 statement. &#8220;We will
continue to further develop and introduce products that enhance
the lives of German consumers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mannheim judges also rejected a bid by Apple regarding
the same patent against Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Motorola Mobility Holdings
unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Hely, a spokesman for Apple in London, declined to
comment on the court ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next to Munich and Dusseldorf, Mannheim is one of the three
prime court venues in Germany where lawyers for Apple, Samsung,
Motorola Mobility and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) meet regularly in the
current court fights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal jury in San Jose, California, on Aug. 24 found
the South Korean company copied the iPhone and iPad and awarded
Apple more than $1 billion in damages. A week later in Japan,
Apple lost a suit as a Tokyo judge ruled that Samsung
smartphones and a tablet didn&#8217;t infringe on an Apple invention
for synchronizing music and video data with servers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple accounts for about 9 percent of Samsung&#8217;s revenue,
making it the company&#8217;s largest customer, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday&#8217;s cases are LG Mannheim 7 O 337/11 (Apple v. Samsung)
and 7 O 528/11 (Apple v. Motorola Mobility). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apple Copied 68-Year-Old Swiss Clock Design, Railway Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s new iOS 6 operating system infringes a
trademarked design for clocks in Swiss rail stations, according
to state-owned railway operator SBB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The updated software, introduced this month by Apple,
includes a clock icon with black and red hands that uses an SBB
design created in 1944, Reto Kormann, a spokesman for the Swiss
rail operator, said by telephone Sept. 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SBB, which has allowed companies such as watchmaker
Mondaine Watch Ltd. to use the design under a license, said that
it&#8217;s in discussions with Cupertino, California-based Apple about
a license or a settlement that would allow the phonemaker to use
the image, and expects to resolve the issue in the next few
days, Kormann said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The money isn&#8217;t in the front of our interests because we
are proud that Apple took an SBB design,&#8221; Kormann said. &#8220;If we
have a cooperation agreement between two good brands, that&#8217;s a
win-win.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disputed design appears only on the iPad and isn&#8217;t on
the iPhone, said Adam Howorth, a spokesman for Apple in London.
He had no further comment immediately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Apple has been embroiled in patent battles with
smartphone maker Samsung Electronics Co. in courts across four
continents after Apple accused the South Korean company of
copying its devices last year. Apple lost a ruling against
Samsung in Germany regarding claims that Galaxy devices
infringed on Apple&#8217;s touch-screen technology, according to a
court spokesman Sept. 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal jury in San Jose, California, on Aug. 24 found
Samsung copied the iPhone and iPad and awarded Apple more than
$1 billion in damages. A week later in Japan, Apple lost a suit
as a Tokyo judge ruled that Samsung smartphones and a tablet
didn&#8217;t infringe on an Apple invention for synchronizing music
and video data with servers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iPhone 5, which also uses the iOS 6 operating system,
went on sale Friday and was expected to sell more than 10
million devices in its opening weekend, Piper Jaffray Cos.
analyst Gene Munster has predicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Peoples Federal Savings and People&#8217;s United Settle Dispute &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peoples Federal Savings Bank of Brighton, Massachusetts,
and People&#8217;s United Bank of Bridgeport, Connecticut, settled a
trademark dispute, according to a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Massachusetts-based bank sued People&#8217;s United in
federal court in Boston in June 2012. Established in 1888 as the
Elm Hill Cooperative Bank, Peoples Federal Savings said it&#8217;s
used the mark &#8220;Peoples&#8221; to identify its banking services since
1973. Other marks the bank uses include &#8220;Peoplescash,&#8221;
&#8220;Peoples Federal,&#8221; and &#8220;Peoples Federal Savings Bank,&#8221;
according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peoples Federal said after Connecticut-based People&#8217;s
United began to expand to Massachusetts in 2009, the public
became confused by the similarity of the two financial
institutions&#8217; names. It accused the Connecticut bank of
&#8220;willful, wanton, reckless&#8221; disregard of Peoples Federal&#8217;s
rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It asked the court to bar People&#8217;s United&#8217;s use of any mark
confusingly similar to Peoples in Massachusetts, and for awards
of money damages, litigation costs and attorney fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a Sept. 7 court filing, the parties resolved
their dispute and the case was dismissed. No details of the
settlement were disclosed in the filing. According to the
People&#8217;s United website, the Connecticut bank still operates 10
branches in Massachusetts. Neither bank&#8217;s website makes mention
of the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Peoples Federal Savings Bank v. People&#8217;s United
Bank, 1:10-cv-11002-NMG, U.S. District Court, District of
Massachusetts (Boston). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Italy, Switzerland Named to 2012 Congressional Piracy Watch List &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italy, Switzerland, Russia, Ukraine and China top a watch
list of nations with high levels of copyright piracy released by
the Congressional Anti-Piracy Caucus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The caucus says piracy has reached &#8220;alarming levels&#8221; in
these nations, which also lack adequate legal protections for
copyright. Industries most affected by piracy are film, home
video, television programming, music, books, video games and
software. These industries collectively are the second-largest
exporting segment of the U.S. economy, according to the caucus&#8217;
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year marks the first time Switzerland and Italy were
listed. Switzerland&#8217;s copyright law is inadequate, the report
claims, making it &#8220; a home for rogue sites whose clear purpose
is to facilitate and enable massive unauthorized making
available of pirated material.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italy&#8217;s inclusion is due to a lack of &#8220;sufficient
legislative framework for addressing the problem, or clear
leadership in developing one,&#8221; the caucus said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report cites ongoing problems in Ukraine, China and
Russia, including the presence of hubs for peer-to-peer networks
that facilitate the unauthorized sharing of content. China&#8217;s bar
on the sale of imported game consoles and the wide availability
of circumvention devices, prevents the development of a healthy,
legal market for video game products,&#8221; according to the caucus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada and Spain were hailed for enacting &#8220;stronger legal
frameworks&#8221; for copyright protection, the caucus said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Santa Paws&#8217; Infringement Case Against Disney Dismissed &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Walt Disney Co. (DIS) defeated a copyright-infringement case
brought by the authors of a children&#8217;s story about Santa Claus
and his dog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three writers, two from Missouri and one from
Tennessee, filed suit in federal court in St. Louis in December,
claiming two Disney Videos infringed the copyright to their 1991
book, &#8220;Santa Paws: The Story of Santa&#8217;s Dog.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their complaint they cited what they said were numerous
similarities between their book and Disney&#8217;s &#8220;Santa Buddies:
The Legend of Santa Paws&#8217;&#8221; and &#8220;The Search for Santa Paws.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They said a literary agent they employed had presented
their work to Disney, and that the agent told them in 1996 that
the studio was interested in producing a film based on the book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her Sept. 20 ruling, U.S. District Judge Catherine D.
Perry granted Disney&#8217;s request to dismiss the suit. She said the
videos weren&#8217;t &#8220;substantially similar&#8221; to elements in the
authors&#8217; book that came under copyright law&#8217;s protections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said of the perceived similarities between the works
that the idea of magic in a Christmas story isn&#8217;t original, and
neither is the use of ice for magical purposes in a story set at
the North Pole. The idea of Christmas spirit -- and the lack
thereof -- &#8220;being embodied by some sort of object is not an
original idea,&#8221; she said, nor is the idea of naming Santa&#8217;s dog
&#8220;Paws&#8221; or &#8220;Santa Paws.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Perry said that no reasonable viewer of the videos or
reader of the screenplays on which they were based &#8220;would
recognize them as a &#8216;dramatization or picturization&#8217; of
plaintiffs short story.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Ray K. Harter Jr. v. Disney Enterprises Inc.,
4:11-cv-02207-CDP, U.S. District Judge, Eastern District of
Missouri (St. Louis). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Leadscope to Receive $10 Million of $26.5 Million Jury Award &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leadscope Inc., a provider of software for scientific
research, will receive more than $10 million from the American
Chemical Society in the wake of an Ohio Supreme Court ruling
related to a trade secrets case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ACS, one of the largest professional scientific
societies in the world, sued Columbus, Ohio-based Leadscope for
trade secret misappropriation in 2002, claiming the company&#8217;s
key technology was developed at the society&#8217;s Chemical Abstract
Service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to court papers, Leadscope founders had been
employed by the service, where they worked to develop a software
tool aimed at improving the ability of researchers to access
information available in the society&#8217;s database. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After ACS suspended the software project in 1997, the
Leadscope founders quit and started their own business. There
they developed the software product that was at issue in the
litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially the society sued Leadscope in Ohio federal court
in May 2002. Leadscope responded to that suit, seeking dismissal
on the grounds that the court lacked jurisdiction. ACS then
refilled the complaint in Ohio state court in July 2002. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state court jury rejected the trade-secret claims and
awarded Leadscope $26.5 million on its counterclaims of unfair
competition and defamation. ACS then appealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ohio high court found that the jury properly determined
that Leadscope had been harmed by the ACS actions and was
entitled to compensation. Leadscope&#8217;s defamation claim did not
hold up, nor did the $15 million of the jury award that was
related to that claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is American Chemical Society V. Leadscope Inc.,
2010-1335, Supreme Court of Ohio. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. forecasts
an 18.2 percent return from commodities in the next 12 months,
with energy and industrial metals leading the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index gain
will include 26.5 percent for energy, 10 percent for industrial
metals and 6 percent for precious metals, Jeffrey Currie, an
analyst at Goldman Sachs, said in a Sept. 21 report. In three
months, the gauge will be up 8.6 percent, beating equities, 10-
year government and five-year corporate bonds, cash and the euro
and yen against the dollar, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Apart from being attractive in its own right, we also
continue to see an overweight in commodities as a hedge against
the risk of the impact of sharply higher commodity prices on
economic growth and other asset classes, if oil supplies were to
disappoint against a backdrop of very limited spare capacity,&#8221;
Currie said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP GSCI Enhanced gauge advanced 19 percent since June
21 on speculation that China will act to bolster its economy
after the U.S., Japan and the European Central Bank took steps
to boost growth. Copper prices will be higher in the first half
of 2013 on growth in China&#8217;s construction and the third round of
quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve, Currie said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Iran Sanction &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanctions against Iran have limited oil supplies and global
economic growth is strong enough that overall output may stay
short of demand in the second half this year, according to
Goldman. Oil in New York climbed 14 percent in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 18.2 percent return for the GSCI in 12 months would lag
behind a 32.8 percent jump forecast for the Tokyo Stock Exchange
Topix and 25.5 percent jump in Stoxx equity index, according to
the report. The SP 500 Index of shares will be down 10.4
percent in three months and 5.4 percent lower in a year, Goldman
Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In commodities, agriculture will be down 5 percent in 12
months and livestock up 4.5 percent, Goldman Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Amanda Gordon" date="Sep 25, 2012  5:13 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-25/scene-last-night-jp-morgan-s-staley-faces-squid-whale.html"><headline>Scene Last Night: Staley Faces Whale, Stoudemire Hits Met</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The irony of speaking to 600 guests
beneath a 94-foot replica of a blue whale at the American Museum
of Natural History was not lost on JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
investment-banking chairman Jes Staley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staley&#8217;s division is busy unwinding trades that lost $5.8
billion in the first half of this year and were executed by the
so-called London whale, a U.K.-based trader in JPMorgan&#8217;s Chief
Investment Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;ve had to sit here all night staring at a whale,&#8221;
Staley said last night, a few hours into a gala for the NYU
Langone Medical Center&#8217;s Hospital for Joint Diseases and Center
for Musculoskeletal Care. He was accepting an award for
corporate leadership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staley then suggested the whale could be replaced with the
squid in the room, which, he clarified afterward, meant Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS), represented by his friend Gary D. Cohn,
chairman of the dinner and the hospital&#8217;s advisory board.
Rolling Stone writer Matt Taibbi called Goldman a &#8220;vampire
squid.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this took place about 20 feet from a diorama depicting
a battle between a sperm whale and a giant squid. Which creature
will triumph is unclear, though squid have been found in whales&#8217;
stomachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That bit of actual marine science, as opposed to financial-
industry marine metaphors, came into play in the next speech
from Cohn, who cast off any hint of competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The only squid in the room is over there,&#8221; Cohn said.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve never been so comfortable in a roomful of JPMorgan people
in my life.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Safe Setting &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly the JPMorgan folks -- who included Mary Callahan Erdoes, CEO of asset management, as well as Phil Di Iorio and
John Duffy -- were in a safe setting. The president of the
museum, Ellen Futter, is on JPMorgan&#8217;s board, where one of her
roles has been overseeing risk management. She also sat on
American International Group Inc. (AIG)&#8217;s compliance and governance
committee, resigning in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohn and Staley both said their comments were &#8220;all in good
fun&#8221; -- and with good effect: The event raised $1.4 million for
the hospital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speeches came after dinner, which consisted of a salad
with goat cheese and roasted pine nuts, and Espelette-glazed
hanger steak with parsnip puree, Swiss chard, baby carrots and
purple cauliflower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staley and Cohn were seated together with their wives,
Debora, who wore a red lace dress, and Lisa, who wore a sequined
skirt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Home Depot &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also at their table was Home Depot Inc. (HD) co-founder Kenneth Langone, who is chairman of the NYU Langone Medical Center. He
was among a few dozen investors invited to attend a special
analyst meeting at JPMorgan&#8217;s headquarters when it disclosed its
losses during a second-quarter earnings announcement on July 13.
Afterward on that day he told Bloomberg Television that JPMorgan
is &#8220;one of the best-run companies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staley said he met Langone through Stanley Druckenmiller,
whom Staley knows through their alma mater, Bowdoin College. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another guest was Staley&#8217;s brother, Peter, the subject of
the documentary film, &#8220;How to Survive a Plague,&#8221; about his
living with AIDS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in the evening, Cohn had a post-op exam from Keith
Raskin, the doctor who performed surgery on his thumb. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He&#8217;s back and texting with greater ability than ever
before,&#8221; Raskin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohn took out his BlackBerry and demonstrated his double-
thumb typing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Met&#8217;s &#8216;Amore&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night the Metropolitan Opera raised $6.2 million at
its opening-night gala, which consisted of about six hours of
entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First came the premiere of a new production of Donizetti&#8217;s
&#8220;L&#8217;Elisir d&#8217;Amore&#8221; starring Anna Netrebko and Matthew
Polenzani. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterward, 1,200 guests showed off long gowns and shiny
black ties in a tent used earlier this month for New York
Fashion Week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My goodness, don&#8217;t trust elixirs,&#8221; Zac Posen said as he
entered the supper with two models wearing his creations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick Stewart had another take on the opera. &#8220;Alcohol is
good for you, generally,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Darling, that&#8217;s good,&#8221; Stewart&#8217;s girlfriend, Sunny
Ozell, added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Soothing Thing&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York Knicks basketball player Amar&#8217;e Stoudemire said he
listens to opera on his 40-minute drive to practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Music is always such a soothing thing, especially opera
and jazz,&#8221; Stoudemire said sitting with his wife at a table
brightened by sunflowers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scenery for dinner was intended to evoke the Italian-
market setting of the opera. Umbrellas and large shafts of wheat
on pillars were placed throughout the room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s all very fecund, as it should be. It has a sense of
fertility,&#8221; said Bartlett Sher, the opera&#8217;s director, seated at
a long banquet table in the center of the room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evening coincided with the birthday of fund manager
Willem Kooyker, chairman, CEO and founder of Blenheim Capital
Management LLC. Kooyker&#8217;s wife, Judith-Ann Corrente, underwrote
the entire cost of the production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s my 70th birthday,&#8221; Kooyker said. As to his youthful
look, he explained, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been coming to the opera for 46
years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Restaurant Association
said it will reject a proposed settlement of as much as $7.25
billion with Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) over the fees they
charge stores when customers pay with credit cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement won&#8217;t change a broken system on how the so-
called swipe fees are set, the association said in a statement
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Without meaningful reform, there is concern that
restaurateurs -- many of whom are small businesses -- will
continue to be negatively impacted by the unfair, non-
transparent system that exists today,&#8221; Dawn Sweeney, the
Washington-based industry group&#8217;s president, said in the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement announced July 13 still needs approval by a
federal judge. It would put to rest about seven years of
litigation over claims that San Francisco-based Visa and
Purchase, New York-based MasterCard conspired to fix fees. The
accord calls for a temporary reduction in rates for merchants
and would allow them to impose surcharges on customer purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The restaurant association joins the National Retail
Federation, which represents more than 9,000 retailers, in
opposing the settlement. The retailer association said on Sept.
11 that the proposed agreement does nothing to prevent Visa and
MasterCard from raising swipe fees in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A case-management conference is scheduled for Sept. 27 in
federal court in Brooklyn, New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), which paid $170,000
to settle California pollution allegations at a refinery, may
face more penalties including prison sentences for employees
stemming from a federal investigation of the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Environmental Protection Agency is investigating
actions at the company&#8217;s Richmond, California, refinery after
local officials in 2009 determined that pollution controls were
bypassed, according to company and local officials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bay Area Air Quality Management District, which
enforces air-pollution rules in nine counties near San
Francisco, discovered Chevron employees routed gas emissions
around monitoring equipment then burned off the excess,
violating local rules. The agency forced the company to end the
practice it said was used at least 27 times in four years, said
Wayne Kino, the district&#8217;s enforcement manager. Chevron paid a
$170,000 penalty to settle the agency&#8217;s civil case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It now appears that EPA has chosen to take that case&#8221; as
a criminal prosecution, Kino said yesterday in an interview.
&#8220;There are indications that they are investigating, but they
don&#8217;t talk about it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A flaring system is used in emergencies to eliminate gases
that could be increasing to dangerous levels, Kino said.
Refineries had been flaring gas for routine maintenance before
the local air quality board imposed standards in 2004, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A criminal prosecution might mean further fines or even
jail time for employees involved at the Richmond refinery. A
total of 249 individuals or companies were charged last year
after an EPA criminal investigation. Agency prosecutions last
year resulted in sending violators to prison for 89.5 years and
fines of $35 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Currently Cooperating&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EPA doesn&#8217;t comment on pending investigations, Alisha
Johnson, a spokeswoman for the agency, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are currently cooperating with the government&#8217;s
investigation,&#8221; Sean Comey, a Chevron spokesman, said in an e-
mail. The company estimates total emissions identified by the
state agency at about 200 pounds of sulfur dioxide, compared
with total sulfur-dioxide emissions in the Bay Area of 25
million pounds annually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This was certainly not done intentionally,&#8221; Comey said
yesterday during a news conference at the refinery called to
discuss an unrelated Aug. 6 fire there. &#8220;Safety and protecting
people and the environment is one of our core values as a
company and we take that responsibility very seriously.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery resolved the issue three years ago  by
rerouting a pipe through a metered system, Nigel Hearne, manager
of the Richmond plant, said during the news conference. He
described the pipe as an &#8220;equalization line&#8221; that helps
control pressure buildup at the refinery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The August fire injured five workers and forced the company
to shut a unit at the Richmond plant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron said yesterday that it suspects that a
phenomenon known as sulfidation corrosion caused a pipe to
rupture and led to the fire. The refinery is inspecting all
similar pipes and has found at least one that must be replaced,
Hearne said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) may have to wait until
March for word on whether their experimental blood thinner
Eliquis passes U.S. regulatory scrutiny. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pill was rejected by the Food and Drug Administration
in June after the agency said it needed more information from
the companies&#8217; existing trials. The two New York-based companies
said in a statement today they had given the FDA all the data
requested and were assigned a target decision date of March 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from Eliquis has the potential to peak at $4.7
billion if approved, Catherine Arnold, an analyst with Credit
Suisse Group AG in New York, estimated in a note this month. The
pill, which could replace the drug Warfarin as the standard of
care, would also help make up for sales that the companies have
lost from their own top-selling blockbusters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s Lipitor and Bristol-Myers&#8217;s Plavix lost patent
protection within the past 12 months and now face generic
competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson  Johnson (JNJ), based in New Brunswick, New Jersey, and
Leverkusen, Germany-based Bayer AG (BAYN) have a competing pill
Xarelto, as does Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, of Ingelheim,
Germany. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
computer programmer Sergey Aleynikov, charged twice with
stealing confidential trading code, sued the bank for payment of
more than $2.4 million in legal fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs should pay fees and expenses incurred during
Aleynikov&#8217;s federal prosecution, which resulted in a conviction
that was later overturned, his lawyers argued in court papers
filed yesterday in federal court in Newark, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov was freed from federal prison earlier this year
after the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York reversed the 2010
conviction in federal court in Manhattan. He was subsequently
charged by New York state prosecutors in Manhattan over the same
matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Aleynikov exhausted his financial resources prior to his
trial on the federal charges,&#8221; his lawyers said in the
complaint. &#8220;Unless the court orders Goldman Sachs to honor its
legal obligation to advance his legal fees and expenses to
defend the state charges, Aleynikov&#8217;s ability to defend those
charges will be irreparably harmed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov was arrested last month on state charges of
unlawful use of scientific material and duplication of computer-
related material, both felonies, according to Manhattan District
Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. He is free on $35,000 bail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment on the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conviction Overturned &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov is entitled to indemnification because of his
previous employment as an officer of Goldman Sachs, according to
the complaint. Aleynikov, a vice president in the bank&#8217;s Global
Equities Division until June 30, 2009, was part of a team
responsible for developing and improving source code related to
high-frequency trading, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors claimed that, on his last day of work
at Goldman Sachs, Aleynikov uploaded hundreds of thousands of
lines of source code from the firm&#8217;s trading system. He
allegedly sent the code to a server in Germany, compressed and
encrypted it, and took it with him to a meeting with new
employers in Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov pleaded not guilty to the charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York appeals court in February ordered Aleynikov
freed from prison in Fort Dix, New Jersey, ruling that the two
laws prosecutors used to charge him, the National Stolen
Property Act and the Economic Espionage Act, didn&#8217;t apply to his
case. Aleynikov was serving an eight-year prison term at the
time the conviction was overturned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lacking Funds &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state charges involve the same conduct underlying the
federal allegations, Kevin Marino, an attorney for Aleynikov,
said last month. The new charges each carry a maximum sentence
of four years in prison under the New York state penal code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov, who is unemployed, relies on the charity of
friends for shelter and doesn&#8217;t have the funds to fight the
state case or pay Marino&#8217;s law firm an initial retainer of
$500,000, Marino said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Aleynikov v. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., 12-
cv-05994, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey (Newark). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for retail groups seeking
to derail an estimated $7.25 billion settlement with Visa Inc. (V)
and MasterCard Inc. (MA) over credit-card fees charged to merchants
told a judge he needs access to all records in the case,
including some that Visa deemed &#8220;highly confidential.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Shinder, a lawyer for at least four trade
associations that oppose the deal, including the National
Community Pharmacists Association and the National Association
of Convenience Stores, made his argument today for release of
the records in federal court in Brooklyn, New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re simply asking for our clients to have what they had
throughout the litigation,&#8221; he told U.S. Magistrate Judge James Orenstein. Orenstein declined to make a ruling today and asked
Shinder to revise his request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement, made public in July, would put to rest a
seven-year-long case accusing Visa and MasterCard of conspiring
with major banks to fix the fees charged to merchants when
customers pay with credit cards. In addition to Shinder&#8217;s
clients, several other retail associations oppose the deal,
including the National Retail Federation and the National
Restaurant Association. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa, based in San Francisco, has alleged that Shinder may
present a risk for &#8220;inadvertent disclosure&#8221; of the company&#8217;s
business secrets because he and his firm also represent its
competitors. Shinder served as a lawyer for Discover Financial
Services (DFS) in the interchange fee suit, according to court
records. His firm, Constantine Cannon, is also advising a
mobile-payment venture, the Merchant Customer Exchange, he said
in a Sept. 25 letter he submitted to the court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wal-Mart, Target &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Merchant Customer Exchange, or MCX, was formed by
merchants including Target Corp. (TGT) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), which
also oppose the credit card fee settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal, which requires approval from a federal judge,
would be the largest-ever recovery in an antitrust case and
would include about 7 million merchants, according to Robbins
Geller Rudman  Dowd LLP, a law firm representing plaintiffs
that support the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plaintiffs have until Oct. 19 to submit a formal motion
seeking preliminary approval of the deal. K. Craig Wildfang, a
lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, told Orenstein in court today
that &#8220;we&#8217;re down to the fine-drafting issues.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics of the settlement have argued that it does little
to remedy merchants&#8217; complaints about the payment networks and
offers Visa and MasterCard too much freedom to raise fees in the
future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Worse Off&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Merchants and their customers are actually worse off than
if they had gone to trial and lost,&#8221; NRF general counsel
Mallory Duncan said in a Sept. 25 phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Senator Richard Durbin&#8217;s office has told retailers
that they may lose out on legislative opportunities to rein in
credit-card fees if they support the settlement. Durbin, a
Democrat from Illinois, secured the inclusion of limits on swipe
fees for debit cards in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, trimming
revenue for the largest U.S. banks by about $8 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amendment has been &#8220;beneficial for everyone except a
handful of very large banks&#8221; which were getting &#8220;truly just a
windfall, and an ill-gotten one,&#8221; Douglas Kantor, counsel to
the National Association of Convenience Stores, said in a Sept.
25 phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Joseph W. Saunders told investors in a July conference call that he
expects the settlement to receive preliminary approval this
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant
Discount Antitrust Litigation, 05-md-01720, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bridas Corp., the oil company owned
by China National Offshore Oil Corp. (883) and the billionaire
Bulgheroni family, completed the purchase of Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s
Campana refinery in Argentina and filling stations in South
America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bridas&#8217;s subsidiary, Axion Energy, will control the assets
acquired from Exxon, the company said in an e-mailed statement
today. The gasoline stations are in Argentina, Paraguay and
Uruguay. No dollar amount was given for the deal announced in
March 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bridas will invest $800 million in the next three years to
increase gasoline production at the Campana refinery by 50
percent to 650,000 cubic meters a year and diesel production by
60 percent to 1.2 million of cubic meters a year, Mario
Calafell, a Bulgheroni family spokesman, said in telephone
interview from Buenos Aires today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calafell declined to comment on an Ambito Financiero
newspaper report that said the deal was worth $600 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil didn&#8217;t respond to a telephone message to its
media line about the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bridas said it will continue using the Esso brand at its
filling stations and will be the exclusive distributor of Mobil
lubricants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bridas is owned in equal parts by Cnooc, China&#8217;s largest
offshore explorer, and the billionaire Bulgheroni family&#8217;s
Bridas Energy Holdings. Bridas also owns a 40 percent stake at
at BP Plc (BP/)&#8217;s controlled Pan American Energy LLC, Argentina&#8217;s
second-largest oil producer and the main supplier of crude to
Campana, located in Buenos Aires province. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve&#8217;s third round
of bond buying is putting emerging-market corporate and
sovereign debt is in a &#8220;sweet spot,&#8221; according to JPMorgan
Chase  Co.&#8217;s Joyce Chang. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quantitative easing, known as QE3, is reducing bond
supply and prompting investors to seek higher-yielding debt from
developing nations, Chang, the global head of emerging-market
research at JPMorgan, said yesterday at a conference at
Bloomberg&#8217;s headquarters in New York. Dollar-denominated
government debt in developing countries has returned 14 percent
this year as corporate securities advanced 12 percent, according
to JPMorgan indexes. Treasuries gained 2.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging markets &#8220;are still in a sweet spot,&#8221; said Chang,
whose emerging-market team was ranked the best by Institutional
Investor. &#8220;Modest&#8221; borrowing by emerging-market governments
and companies has avoided a supply glut, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pacific Investment Management Co., which oversees the
world&#8217;s largest bond fund, favors local-currency bonds in
Brazil, Mexico and South Africa as slower economic growth allows
the countries to keep interest rates low, according to Lupin Rahman, an executive vice president at the Newport Beach,
California-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My favorite investment in the emerging-market space is
really the local rate space, given the much weaker global
economic environment we are seeing,&#8221; Rahman said at the event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s real, which has lost 8 percent this year, is
Pimco&#8217;s &#8220;currency of choice,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Commodity Currencies &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s Chang said she favors commodity-related
currencies including the Russian ruble, Mexico&#8217;s peso and the
real. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alberto Ades, the head of emerging-market fixed-income
strategy and global economics at Bank of America Corp., also
likes the currencies as the Fed&#8217;s QE3 weakens the dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing countries&#8217; equities are in the middle of a
&#8220;bear market&#8221; as the credit expansion in nations such as
Brazil and China starts to reverse, according to Michael Shaoul,
the chairman of Marketfield Asset Management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Emerging-market equities should be avoided in general,&#8221;
Shaoul said at the event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Emerging Market Index (MXEF) has advanced 8.9 percent
this year, trimming its loss since its peak in May 2011 to 17
percent. The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index of U.S. stocks has
climbed 15 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
programmer Sergey Aleynikov, who successfully challenged a
federal conviction for stealing internal code from the bank,
pleaded not guilty to similar state charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov entered his plea today in New York state court in
Manhattan before Justice Ronald Zweibel. He was indicted on two
counts of unlawful use of scientific material and one of
unlawful duplication of computer-related material, according to
his lawyer, Kevin Marino. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marino in court assailed New York District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.&#8217;s office for attempting to prosecute Aleynikov a
second time, and said he will move to dismiss the case on
double-jeopardy grounds. Marino said his client declined an
offer to plead guilty to one felony count in exchange for time
served. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The message is, if you mess with Goldman Sachs, you
better get ready for the fight of your life,&#8221; Marino said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zweibel allowed Aleynikov to remain free on $35,000 bail
pending his next court appearance and gave him permission to
travel to Russia to visit his mother, who is being treated for
cancer, once his passport is returned by federal authorities. He
is scheduled to return to court on Nov. 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conviction Reversed &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov was freed from prison after serving about a year
following his federal conviction on charges he stole the bank&#8217;s
high-speed trading code. His 2010 conviction was reversed by the
U.S. Court of Appeals in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors claimed that, on his last day of work
at New York-based Goldman Sachs in June 2009, Aleynikov uploaded
hundreds of thousands of lines of source code from the firm&#8217;s
high-frequency trading system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov sued Goldman Sachs in federal court in Newark,
New Jersey, earlier this week, seeking payment of more than $2.4
million in legal fees. He claimed he&#8217;s entitled to
indemnification because of his previous employment as an officer
of Goldman Sachs, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov, a vice president in the bank&#8217;s Global Equities
Division until June 30, 2009, was part of a team responsible for
developing and improving source code related to high-frequency
trading, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Funds &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A New York appeals court in February ordered Aleynikov
freed from prison in Fort Dix, New Jersey, ruling that the two
laws prosecutors used to charge him, the National Stolen
Property Act and the Economic Espionage Act, didn&#8217;t apply to his
case. Aleynikov was serving an eight-year prison term at the
time the conviction was overturned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York prosecutors said that while the federal appellate
judges court said Aleynikov&#8217;s conduct didn&#8217;t constitute a
federal crime, they suggested it could be a violation of state
law. The prosecutors also said Marino asserted in court
documents that theft of trade secrets is a &#8220;quintessential
state-law crime.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;On our own initiative, we contacted federal prosecutors
and asked for their cooperation in filing a state criminal case
to make sure this defendant was held accountable for his
criminal conduct,&#8221; Assistant District Attorney David Szuchman
said in a statement. &#8220;Any suggestion that we filed these
charges for any other reason is false.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov, who is unemployed, relies on the charity of
friends for shelter and doesn&#8217;t have the funds to fight the
state case or pay Marino&#8217;s law firm an initial retainer of
$500,000, according to the New Jersey lawsuit. Marino said his
client lost his house, his wife left him and he lost his job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He left Russia for freedom, justice and the American
way,&#8221; Marino said in court. &#8220;And he got Franz Kafka and
Goldman Sachs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is New York v. Aleynikov, 04447-2012, New
York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). The New Jersey case is
Aleynikov v. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., 12-cv-05994, U.S.

&lt;p&gt;UBS AG (UBSN), Switzerland&#8217;s biggest bank,

&lt;p&gt;Port usage in northern Europe is
falling as the shipment of manufactured goods declines, amid an
oversupply of vessels that&#8217;s keeping container lines&#8217; earnings
below break-even levels on the Asia-to-Europe route, JPMorgan
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following are comments from Christopher Combe, head of
transport, equity research at the Capital Link 5th Annual
International Shipping and Marine Services Forum in London
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given the massive overcapacity in the shipping sector,
rates have now gone below cash break-even for the operators and
they are pushing in a very big way for rate increases. Time will
tell how successful they&#8217;ll be. We suspect it&#8217;s going to be very
tough.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On utilization rates for northern Europe ports: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re at the point where we are near bottom. How long
we&#8217;ll stay there is not very certain. The key is that average
utilization across the northern European ports is about 85
percent. It&#8217;s very difficult to get any pricing power. It&#8217;s
currently, at best, close to 80 perhaps or just below. There are
no real signs of confidence that we&#8217;re anywhere near the point
where pricing power emerges.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peru&#8217;s coca crop increased for a
sixth straight year in 2011 as producers diversify away from
areas targeted by U.S. government-backed efforts to eradicate
the plant used to make cocaine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area under cultivation increased 2.1 percent to 62,500
hectares (154,441 acres) from 61,200 hectares in 2010, according
to a report released yesterday by the United Nations Office on
Drugs and Crime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cultivation increased in 10 of Peru&#8217;s 11 growing areas
covered by the agency&#8217;s survey last year, led by a 40 percent
rise in plantations in the northeast near the Brazilian border
to 4,450 hectares. Production is rising to meet demand for crack
and cocaine in Europe and Brazil, which is the largest market in
the Americas after the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Drug traffickers are becoming more efficient&#8221; said
Flavio Mirella, the head of the agency&#8217;s Peruvian office, during
a presentation of the report in Lima. &#8220;Traffickers need less
coca leaf to produce more cocaine. Routes of supply are
diversifying and producing areas are getting closer to certain
routes of exit&#8221; toward Bolivia and Brazil, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New growing areas have compensated for slower growth in the
Valley of the Apurimac and Ene rivers, Peru&#8217;s top-growing area
since 2010, where there is little room to expand, and the Alto
Huallaga area, where eradication is focused, said Mirella. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Guerrillas, Government &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maoist guerrillas protecting growing areas and transit
routes for cocaine consignments have stepped up attacks on army
patrols this year, leading the government to allocate greater
resources for the drugs fight in next year&#8217;s budget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Ollanta Humala aims to increase manual
eradication of coca crops to 30,000 hectares by 2016 from its
target of 14,000 hectares this year while encouraging farmers to
switch to alternative crops such as cocoa and coffee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cultivation of the crop in Colombia rose for the first time
since 2007 last year, expanding 3 percent to 64,000 hectares,
while the crop contracted by about 12 percent in Bolivia,
according to the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peru and Bolivia have overtaken Colombia to become the
world&#8217;s biggest cocaine producers, according to a U.S.
government report published July 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe remains the biggest market for cocaine shipments
from Peru while Colombia is the top supplier of cocaine to the
U.S., according to the UN agency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google&#8217;s Inc.&#8217;s Motorola Mobility
can&#8217;t enforce a German court order preventing Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)
from selling its Xbox gaming software in Germany, a U.S. appeals
court ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A three-judge panel in San Francisco upheld a Seattle
judge&#8217;s order blocking Motorola Mobility&#8217;s enforcement of the
sales ban it won in May in its lawsuit against Microsoft pending
in Germany. The panel said the lower court&#8217;s order was narrowly
tailored. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility and Microsoft are locked in legal battles
over patents for Xbox and smartphone software in the U.S. and
Germany. Microsoft contends all devices that run on Google&#8217;s
Android operating system use its technology and seeks royalties
from Motorola Mobility. Motorola Mobility says it&#8217;s owed
royalties on the Xbox for use of the company&#8217;s Wi-Fi and video-
compression technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enforce the German sales ban, Motorola Mobility would
have to post a security bond covering potential damages to
Microsoft, the appeals court said. Microsoft could also avoid
the injunction by taking steps towards entering a licensing
agreement with Motorola with a specific rate or rate determined
by Motorola. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives of Mountain View, California-based Google,
didn&#8217;t respond to an e-mail message to the company&#8217;s media
office seeking comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seattle Judge &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft obtained the Seattle judge&#8217;s order blocking
Motorola Mobility form enforcing a German injunction before
Motorola Mobility won the lawsuit in Germany. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle said an
existing contract lawsuit between the two companies in his
courthouse will help determine a royalty rate, so putting the
German injunction on hold is appropriate, the appeals court
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is clear that there is a contract, that it is
enforceable by Microsoft, and that it encompasses not just U.S.
patents but also the patents at issue in the German suit,&#8221; the
appeals court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility, based in Libertyville, Illinois, has
submitted offers to license its patents, some of which relate to
standards established by industry groups for video compression
and Wi-Fi technology. It also has offered to take a license to
the coordination feature known as ActiveSync, that it has
previously licensed from Microsoft before 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Standard Demand &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility sent letters to Microsoft with what it
said was a standard demand for a 2.25 percent royalty on the end
price of products that use the inventions, including the Xbox
and Windows products. Microsoft contends that would add as much
as $4 billion in annual royalties, a figure Motorola Mobility
disputes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft contends the offer doesn&#8217;t meet Motorola
Mobility&#8217;s obligation to license such patents on fair and
reasonable terms, and the licensing offer should be based on
&#8220;market rates.&#8221; It filed a breach of contract suit that&#8217;s
scheduled for trial in November in federal court in Seattle,
near Microsoft&#8217;s headquarters in Redmond, Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re pleased that Judge Robart&#8217;s decision has been
affirmed by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, preventing
Motorola from enforcing an injunction in Germany until its use
of standard essential patents can be closely examined,&#8221; David
Howard, corporate vice president and deputy general counsel for
Microsoft, said in an e-mail. &#8220;It continues to be our hope that
Google and Motorola live up to their promises to standards
organizations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Microsoft Corp. v. Motorola Mobility Inc.,
12-35352, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, San
Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRF - Brasil Foods (BRFS3) SA, the world&#8217;s

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will pay
$14.4 million to resolve regulatory claims that a former banker
made improper campaign contributions to the treasurer of
Massachusetts while seeking underwriting business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neil Morrison, who was a vice president in Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
Boston office, worked for Treasurer Timothy P. Cahill&#8217;s
unsuccessful gubernatorial campaign from November 2008 to
October 2010, sometimes during his office hours, the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission said in a statement
yesterday. That constituted in-kind contributions and broke pay-
to-play rules, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement, which includes $4.6 million paid to
Massachusetts, is the SEC&#8217;s first involving noncash
contributions and is the latest since the agency began
bolstering oversight of the $3.7 trillion municipal-bond market
in 2010. At that time, SEC Enforcement Director Robert Khuzami
set up a task force to investigate bid-rigging for municipal-
investment contracts. The agency is looking into banks, local
governments that don&#8217;t disclose their true financial condition,
and public officials who hire advisers based on political
contributions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The campaign work by Morrison, 38, disqualified Goldman
Sachs from underwriting bonds for Massachusetts and its agencies
for two years after the contributions, the SEC said.
Nevertheless, the New York-based firm participated in 30
prohibited underwritings, earning more than $7.5 million in
improper fees, according to the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t admit or deny wrongdoing. A telephone
call to Thomas Kiley, Morrison&#8217;s lawyer, wasn&#8217;t immediately
returned. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;FSA to Oversee Libor in Streamlining of Tarnished Benchmark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oversight of Libor will be handed to the U.K.&#8217;s financial
regulator, and dozens of the currencies and maturities that make
up the benchmark axed, under proposals designed to revive
confidence in a rate tarnished by scandal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The British Bankers&#8217; Association should be stripped of the
responsibility for managing the rate and other organizations
invited to replace it, Financial Services Authority Managing
Director Martin Wheatley said in London today. More than 100
Libor rates tied to currencies and maturities where there isn&#8217;t
enough trading data to set them properly should be scrapped, and
a code of conduct introduced for how lenders contribute to the
benchmark backed by criminal penalties, he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wheatley began his review at the request of Chancellor of
the Exchequer George Osborne after Barclays Plc (BARC), Britain&#8217;s
second-biggest lender, paid a record 290 million-pound
($470 million) fine in June for manipulating the London
interbank offered rate, used to set rates for more than
$300 trillion of securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSA should receive greater powers to vet bankers who
contribute to the rate, according to Wheatley, who will become
the chief executive officer of the Financial Conduct Authority
when the FSA splits into two agencies next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stopped short of advocating scrapping Libor, saying that
would be too disruptive to borrowers whose existing contracts
reference the rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Financial Secretary to the Treasury Greg Clark
said the U.K. government will move at the &#8220;maximum possible
pace&#8221; to implement a proposed overhaul of the oversight of
Libor and will give a formal response in the week beginning Oct.
15. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;APRA Releases Final Basel III Capital Reform Package &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority commented in
a statement on its website about the key features to be included
in a new definition of regulatory capital, under which common
equity is the predominant form of Tier 1 capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the new definition, common equity Tier 1 capital must
be at least 4.5 percent of risk-weighted assets and the Tier 1
capital ratio at least 6 percent, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer will place
constraints on capital distributions, the authority said. In
addition, a countercyclical buffer of as much as 2.5 percent
will apply when excessive credit growth points to a system-wide
build-up of risk, the authority said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authority Chairman John Laker said reforms will lead to a
stronger Australian banking system, as well as make banks well
placed to meet Basel III timetable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Network Operators Submit Power-Trading Rules to EU Regulators &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European electricity-network operators submitted rules for
power trading that will help the bloc to achieve its goal of a
single market by 2014 to European Union regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The capacity-allocation and congestion-management code
contains rules for day-ahead and intraday markets and the
calculation of capacity as well as defining bidding zones,
Entsoe, a Brussels-based body that represents national
operators, said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators has
three months to assess the code and if approved, it will become
law, Entsoe said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SEC Issues Report to Help Brokers Safeguard Confidential Info &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued a staff
report for broker-dealers to help them determine the
effectiveness of their controls over sensitive information, the
SEC said in e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Report by the Office of Compliance Inspections and
Examinations addresses the prevention of insider trading and
details appropriate controls over matters such as e-mail,
information given to external parties, and disposal of
confidential documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report also describes various methods that broker-
dealers use to manage conflicts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.S. Criminal Libor Probe Said to Seek London Trader Interviews &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. investigators conducting a criminal probe of interest-
rate manipulation have asked their British counterparts for
permission to interview London traders, two people familiar with
the investigation said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department filed a request with the U.K.
Home Office for access to dozens of bankers in conjunction with
British prosecutors who are also investigating the rate rigging,
said one of the people, who declined to be identified because
the proceedings haven&#8217;t been made public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move may indicate the U.S. wants to pursue criminal
charges against individuals in the U.K. that may lead to
extradition, said Bradley Simon, a former federal prosecutor in
Brooklyn, New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators from Tokyo to London to New York are probing how
derivatives traders and bankers who submitted interest-rate data
colluded to rig benchmarks including the London Interbank
Offered Rate. Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, UBS AG (UBSN) and
Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) are among lenders awaiting information about
their fate. The Justice Department&#8217;s criminal probe is running
in parallel with civil investigations being conducted by its
fraud division, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
and the U.K. Financial Services Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. Serious Fraud Office opened its criminal case in
July at the request of British politicians after Barclays Plc
was fined a record 290 million pounds ($470 million) for rate
manipulation. The agency previously declined to get involved in
the case, according to the FSA. Barclays Chief Executive Officer
Robert Diamond and Chairman Marcus Agius resigned following the
fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Home Office spokesman declined to comment on any
cooperation request. A spokesperson for the U.S. Justice
Department didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a request seeking
comment on cooperation with U.K. authorities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blocking Identity Theft Is U.S. Goal Ahead of Tax Filing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department and the Internal Revenue
Service are working to head off identity theft aimed at stealing
people&#8217;s tax refunds when the filing season begins in January,
the government&#8217;s top tax prosecutor said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department will draw information from local
prosecutions to identify patterns in the cases and help the IRS
create computerized filters to block potentially fraudulent
refunds. They peak each year in the first few weeks of the
filing season as criminals try to get refunds under legitimate
taxpayers&#8217; names before those people file their own returns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a typical case, criminals steal or illegally purchase
taxpayers&#8217; identifying information from hospitals, medical
offices, prisons and other places that have the data. They then
file false tax returns, claim a refund and have the money
deposited on a prepaid debit card. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Sept. 15 speech in Boston, IRS Commissioner Douglas
Shulman said his agency this year stopped more than 3 million
tax returns and determined that 90 percent of them were &#8220;bad.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CFTC Orders ANZ to Pay $350,000 for Violating Position Limits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ordered Australia
 New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) to pay $350,000 for exceeding
speculative-position limits in wheat and cotton futures traded
on the Chicago Board of Trade and ICE Futures U.S. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank violated CBOT wheat limits in August 2010, and
held a net-short position that was greater than allowed for ICE
cotton contracts in February 2011, the CFTC said in a statement
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BofA Expects U.A.E. Central Bank to Extend New Lending Rules &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United Arab Emirates&#8217; central bank may extend a
deadline by six months for banks to comply with new rules that
limit lending to governments and their entities, Bank of America
Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.A.E. central bank said April 4 that banks in the
U.A.E. must not lend more than 100 percent of their capital to
local governments and the same to government-related entities
known as GREs to help reduce risk. Banks had until Sept. 30 to
comply. There was no limit under previous rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.A.E. central bank is holding separate discussions
with each bank about the rules, a spokesman for Emirates NBD
PJSC (EMIRATES), who declined to be identified because of company policy,
said. The Emirates Banks Association, a body representing U.A.E.
banks, led discussions with the central bank earlier, although
talks are being held separately with each bank about the rules
because of differences with each bank&#8217;s portfolio, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exposure of Emirates NBD PJSC, the U.A.E.&#8217;s biggest
bank by assets, to sovereign and quasi-sovereign clients is 192
percent of regulatory capital, while that of National Bank of
Abu Dhabi PJSC and Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC (ADCB), the second-
and third-biggest U.A.E. lenders, are 199 percent and 108
percent, according to Deutsche Bank AG estimates in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SEC Review Finds Gaps on Insider Trading at U.S. Broker-Dealers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traders at broker-dealers often interact with bankers who
know confidential information, raising concerns about undetected
insider trading, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior executives at some broker-dealers are allowed access
to non-public information from one group while overseeing
employees who could benefit from it, the SEC&#8217;s Office of
Compliance Inspections and Examinations said yesterday in a
report. Allowing some supervisors to be &#8220;above the wall&#8221;
dividing traders from those with the information may facilitate
insider trading, according to the report, which didn&#8217;t name any
firms where such practices exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC&#8217;s review of secrecy procedures at broker-dealers
follows a nationwide crackdown on insider trading by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation in New York and prosecutors in the
office of Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara that began five
years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ex-Credit Suisse CDO Boss Won&#8217;t Go to U.S. Before Plea Deal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kareem Serageldin, the ex-global head of Credit Suisse
Group AG (CSGN)&#8217;s CDO business charged in a bonus-boosting fraud tied
to a $5.35 billion trading book, will fight extradition to the
U.S. until he reaches a plea deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serageldin&#8217;s lawyer told a London court yesterday that his
client&#8217;s arrest Sept. 26 outside the U.S. Embassy was a result
of &#8220;miscommunication.&#8221; Ben Brandon said Serageldin was
negotiating a plea bargain with U.S. prosecutors before the
arrest. He was released on a 150,000-pound ($243,000) security
until a Nov. 28 court hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Serageldin has absolutely no intention of whatsoever of
fleeing,&#8221; Brandon said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serageldin, a U.S. citizen who lives in England, was
charged in February with masterminding a scheme to fake
collateralized debt obligations. In February, when he was first
charged in Manhattan federal court, Serageldin said through his
lawyers that he was surprised since he had been cooperating with
U.S. investigators for four years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serageldin was named in an indictment unsealed in February
accusing him of conspiracy, falsification of books and records
and wire fraud. The conspiracy charge carries a maximum five-
year prison term on conviction. The other counts are punishable
by as many as 20 years. The case is being investigated by agents
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Michael Snow, who said the allegations are &#8220;very
serious,&#8221; told Serageldin he must not leave his home between 11
p.m. and 6 a.m., and must wear an electronic tag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serageldin, who was born in Egypt, wants to renounce his
U.S citizenship and serve part of any sentence in the U.K.,
Brandon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. criminal cases are U.S. v. Higgs, 12-cr-00088, and
U.S. v. Siddiqui, 12-cr-00089, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). The SEC case is U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission v. Serageldin, 12-cv-00796,

&lt;h2&gt;SEC&#8217;s Gallagher Calls for Floating Price for Money Funds &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission member Daniel
Gallagher, who helped derail efforts to tighten rules for money-
market mutual funds, said he would probably support a measure
forcing the industry to abandon its marquee $1 share price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requiring money funds to have a fluctuating share price
&#8220;is an attractive option that I am likely to support,&#8221;
Gallagher, a Republican, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remarks may help revive the debate at the SEC and offer
a path toward compromise for SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro, whose
proposal ran aground last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gallagher said he couldn&#8217;t vote for Schapiro&#8217;s plan because
its centerpiece was to make the funds hold extra capital. The
cushion was too small to protect investors, Gallagher said,
leading him to believe the money would be used as collateral in
case the funds needed to borrow from the Federal Reserve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I could not be complicit in a rulemaking that purported
to eliminate bailouts but would actually do the opposite,&#8221;
Gallagher said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC spokeswoman Judith Burns declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s lung-cancer medicine
Xalkori extended the lives of patients without their disease
worsening for twice as long as the standard therapies, according
to a study sponsored by the New York-based drugmaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a trial of 347 previously treated patients whose non-
small lung cancer showed mutations in the gene known as ALK,
those given Pfizer&#8217;s Xalkori experienced progression-free
survival to 7.7 months, compared with 3 months for patients on
the other treatments, according to results presented today at
the European Society for Medical Oncology in Vienna. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study is the first to compare Pfizer&#8217;s drug against the
standard of care, the chemotherapy drug docetaxel, made by
Sanofi (SAN) and now available in a generic version, and Eli Lilly 
Co. (LLY)&#8217;s Alimta, which generated $2.46 billion in sales last year.
The results suggest Xalkori should be the new standard as a
second-line therapy in patients whose non-small cell lung cancer
has mutations in the ALK gene, researchers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xalkori&#8217;s results were &#8220;many months longer than what
chemotherapy might afford,&#8221; said Alice Shaw, a doctor at
Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center in Boston, and the
study&#8217;s lead author, in a telephone interview. The drug from
Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, also showed improved
quality of life compared with the current therapy, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shaw said the study hadn&#8217;t determined the survival benefit,
because patients on the other drugs had been allowed to switch
to the Pfizer medicine during the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This makes determination of overall survival benefit very
difficult,&#8221; she said in a statement. It may take as much as a
year before researchers on the study, which is continuing, can
report that data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Top Killer &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lung cancer is the top killer among malignancies in the
U.S. and is expected to cause about 160,000 deaths this year,
according to the National Cancer Institute. The Food and Drug
Administration approved Xalkori last August, along with a test
made by Abbott Laboratories (ABT) to determine whether patients carry
the mutation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the drug is approved as a first-line therapy for ALK-
positive patients in the U.S., European regulators want more
data on Xalkori as a first-line therapy and have ruled that it
should be used after patients fail other drugs first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Most of us who work in this area feel pretty strongly
that if a patient has a known, targetable target like ALK, that
they should get it as a first-line therapy,&#8221; Shaw said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the ALK mutation is present in just five percent of
non-small cell lung cancers, the most common form of the
malignancy, &#8220;it&#8217;s a large absolute number,&#8221; Shaw said in the
interview. Unlike other lung cancer patients, who are in their
mid-60s or 70s, ALK-positive patients are about 50 years old on
average and don&#8217;t have a history of smoking, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers still need to look at how to treat ALK-positive
patients who relapse after taking Pfizer&#8217;s drug. &lt;/p&gt;
