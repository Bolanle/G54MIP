<p>ABC has its work cut out to
reverse a decline in ratings, said Paul Lee, the executive named
last week to lead the Walt Disney Co. television network. </p>
<p>Lee headed Disney''s ABC Family cable channel until Steve McPherson unexpectedly resigned as president of ABC
Entertainment Group on July 27. The executive, who introduced
shows like Pretty Little Liars aimed at young female viewers
at ABC Family, said he will take some risks in his new role
to pull the broadcast network out of third place. He stopped
short of saying he''d target a millennial demographic at ABC. </p>
<p>The way to program a cable network is to do one thing and
do it well, Lee told writers at the semi-annual Television
Critics Association today in Beverly Hills, California. A
broadcast network is a much larger canvas. </p>
<p>Lee said he will seek to create a brand identity at ABC,
much as CBS has done with procedural dramas and Fox with shows
that appeal to younger men. He said ABC, the only major
broadcaster to decline in ratings last season, is known for
smart programs. He mentioned Dancing With the Stars, and
shows he called sexy like Grey''s Anatomy. </p>
<p>The London-born Lee, 50, founded the BBC America cable
channel before joining Disney in 2004. He said he was
vacationing with his wife on a California beach when he was
approached to take the ABC job. </p>
<p>You have more time in cable to stick with a show, Lee
said. But we are always a slave to ratings. </p>
<p>ABC was the only major U.S. broadcaster to lose viewers
last season and was also down in the 18-to-49-year-old group
that advertisers seek, according to Nielsen Co. The network is
adding six dramas to its schedule starting in September. </p>
<p>Body of Proof'' </p>
<p>The new shows include  including Body of Proof,
starring Dana Delany, and Detroit 1-8-7, which revolves
around a homicide unit in the city. It also picked up the comedy
Mr. Sunshine, featuring Matthew Perry as the manager of a
San Diego sports arena. </p>
<p>Paul has been very supportive of us so far, just as Steve
was, said Jason Richman, executive producer of Detroit 1-8-
7, which will air on Tuesdays. We''re just going to continue
to do what we''ve been doing, added David Zabel, the show''s
other executive producer. </p>
<p>McPherson established a block of comedy shows on Wednesday
nights last TV season that includes three returning programs:
Modern Family, Cougar Town and The Middle. Lee
predicted that Modern Family, nominated for the Emmy award
for best comedy, will win. </p>
<p>Upfront Sales'' </p>
<p>ABC sold about $2.4 billion in ads ahead of the new season
for its full-day schedule, with average prime-time rates rising
8 percent to 9 percent, a person with knowledge of the matter
said on June 9. ABC sold 75 percent to 80 percent of its
inventory, the person said. </p>
<p>By comparison NBC, last in prime-time viewers, sold about
$2.5 billion in advertising, with rates rising about 7 percent,
another person said on June 10. The network pre-sold about 70
percent of its prime-time inventory, that person said. </p>
<p>Disney, the world''s largest media company, fell 2 cents to
$33.69 on July 30 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
The shares have climbed 4.5 percent this year. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp., the world''s biggest
software maker, won a court ruling that its Xbox video-game
system doesn''t infringe a patent over multiplayer gaming, ending
a six-year legal battle. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Paul D. Borman in Detroit on July 20
dismissed the 2004 lawsuit against Microsoft brought by
inventors Peter Hochstein and Jeffrey Tennenbaum along with
Harold Milton Jr., who owns rights to the patent. The men had
been demanding royalties on Xbox sales, plus an order barring
further use of their invention. </p>
<p>The patent, issued in 1994, is for a device that lets two
or more people play video games together without being in the
same location, such as over a telephone line. The men claimed
that could be construed to cover all systems that can have
multiple players, like the Xbox. </p>
<p>Borman ruled that the patent only covered game systems that
are electrically connected. Such a connection doesn''t include
the type of link among players used by the Xbox, the judge said. </p>
<p>The Michigan men also sued Sony Corp., maker of the
PlayStation video-game system. That case was settled. Lawyers
for the men didn''t immediately return a message seeking comment.
Kevin Kutz, a spokesman for Microsoft, said the Redmond,
Washington-based company was pleased with the decision. </p>
<p>The case is Hochstein v. Microsoft, 04-73071, U.S. District
Court for the District of Michigan (Detroit). </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp., the world''s biggest computer-services company, plans to
sell $1.5 billion of three-year notes, leading a surge in U.S.
corporate bond issuance. </p>
<p>IBM plans to sell the debt as soon as today, according to a
person familiar with the offering who declined to be identified
because terms aren''t set. New York-based Citigroup Inc. and
ArcelorMittal, the world''s largest steelmaker, are among at
least five other issuers marketing debt today. </p>
<p>IBM''s offering comes after U.S. corporate bond issuance set
a record last month and yields on the debt fell to the lowest in
more than four years. Investors are snapping up the debt as 77
percent of companies in the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index that
have reported second-quarter earnings beat analysts'' estimates
and manufacturing growth in the U.S. and Britain slowed less
than expected in July, bolstering confidence in the economic
recovery. </p>
<p>Companies are taking advantage of a window of
opportunity, said Scott MacDonald, head of credit and economic
research at Aladdin Capital LLC in Stamford, Connecticut. The
money is inexpensive and people are willing to buy. </p>
<p>IBM''s notes may yield 30 basis points, or 0.3 percentage
point, more than similar-maturity Treasuries, said the person. </p>
<p>Credit Suisse Group AG, Expedia Inc., Omnicom Group Inc.
and Newell Rubbermaid also plan to tap the corporate bond market
as soon as today, according to people familiar with those
offerings. </p>
<p>Record Bond Issuance </p>
<p>Continental Airlines Inc. and Arch Coal Inc. may sell debt
later this week, people with knowledge of the transactions said. </p>
<p>Companies sold $85.7 billion of U.S. corporate bonds in
July, the most in that month since at least 1999, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Average yields on the securities
fell to 5.01 percent on July 31, the lowest since April 2004,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. </p>
<p>It''s a very good time for companies to be issuing debt
and they have excellent balance sheets that they''re leveraging
as well, John Herrmann, a senior fixed-income strategist at
Boston-based State Street Global Markets LLC, said today in a
Bloomberg Television interview. We have extremely low rates
and yet at the same time investors are searching for yield over
Treasuries. </p>
<p>Yields on two-year Treasury notes climbed 1 basis point to
0.56 percent after dropping to a record low 0.546 percent. Ten-
year Treasury yields climbed 4 basis points to 2.95 percent.
They touched 2.85 percent, a 15-month low, on July 21. </p>
<p>Use of Proceeds </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Barclays Plc and BNP Paribas are
managing IBM''s offering, the person said. Armonk, New York-based
IBM plans to use proceeds for general corporate purposes, the
person said. </p>
<p>IBM spokesman Mike Fay confirmed the maturity of the notes
and the timing of the offering and declined to provide further
details. </p>
<p>The company last sold debt in November, when it issued $750
million of two-year floating-rate notes and $1.25 billion of
3.5-year fixed-rate securities, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The 2.1 percent notes due in May 2013 fell 0.136 cent on
July 27 to 102.869 cents on the dollar to yield 1.045 percent,
or 4.9 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. </p>
<p>Moody''s Investors Service assigns IBM a grade of A1 and
Standard  Poor''s ranks it an equivalent A+. </p>

<p>Alexander Classen, head of Morgan
Stanley''s wealth-management operations in Europe, the Middle
East and Africa, has left the firm after four years. </p>
<p>The New York-based bank hasn''t named a replacement, said
spokesman Jim Wiggins, who confirmed Classen''s departure.
Classen joined Morgan Stanley in 2006 from Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., the same year that James Gorman, now chief executive
officer, came in to turn around the brokerage. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley paid $2.75 billion last year to win control
of a joint venture with Citigroup Inc.''s Smith Barney that
includes about 18,000 financial advisers, making it the world''s
biggest brokerage. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley Smith Barney will look to expand outside the
U.S. because those markets are set to grow faster, Charles Johnston, the unit''s president, said in April. The global
wealth-management division had net new international assets of
$2.4 billion in the second quarter, compared with outflows of
$7.9 billion in the U.S. </p>
<p>We don''t have a large enough footprint in those
markets, Johnston said in April. We''d like it to be bigger,
and there''s only two ways to do that -- you can buy something or
you can grow organically. There hasn''t been much that''s been
available to buy. We''ve talked about some deals, but we''re going
on the path of organic growth. </p>
<p>Dow Jones Newswire reported Classen''s departure earlier
today. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. gave the
panel investigating the causes of the credit crisis examples of
how it set prices for illiquid mortgage derivatives before the
U.S. rescue of American International Group Inc. </p>
<p>The data provided to the Financial Crisis Inquiry
Commission include mortgage-related trades from May 2007 through
November 2008, which the New York-based firm reported in a nine-
page document on its website. Those trades and other market
information showed that prices were falling, which in turn led
to demands for collateral from AIG, Goldman Sachs said. </p>
<p>During two days of hearings earlier this year, FCIC members
questioned whether the investment bank deliberately discounted
prices to push markets lower because it had bet on a decline in
the value of subprime mortgage-backed debt. Gary Cohn, Goldman
Sachs''s president and chief operating officer, and Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar said at the hearings that the
firm''s prices reflected what it saw in the market. </p>
<p>In the document on its website, Goldman Sachs said a
certain degree of judgment was necessary in valuing the
transactions. We were able to access the best available market
information to price these CDO securities and to ensure that our
pricing represented actual fair market values at the time, the
firm said in the document. </p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reported the details of Goldman
Sachs''s response to the FCIC late yesterday on its website. </p>
<p>Risk Management </p>
<p>The dispute is at the heart of whether Goldman Sachs had a
role in the near-bankruptcy of AIG or was a careful risk manager
whose focus on marking assets to fair value helped the
securities firm prepare for the credit contraction earlier than
rivals. Goldman Sachs, whose 2007 profit benefited from bets
against securities backed by subprime mortgages, was one of the
biggest buyers of AIG''s insurance covering such debt and
increased demands for collateral from AIG as prices fell. </p>
<p>You guys are net short and you''re driving down prices,
are you creating a self-fulfilling prophecy? Philip N. Angelides, chairman of the FCIC, asked Viniar during the
hearings. Were you in fact pushing the market down? </p>
<p>The FCIC is investigating what caused the credit crisis,
and will report findings to Congress and President Barack Obama
by December. </p>
<p>Derivatives are contracts whose value is derived from
stocks, bonds, loans, currencies and commodities, or linked to
specific events. </p>

<p>Pagan, who has 25 years of experience in public debt

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp., the world''s
second-largest producer of oil from deep-water wells, is seeking
to sell its stake in discoveries off the coast of the Republic
of Congo. </p>
<p>Exxon owns a 30 percent stake in the fields, which hold the
equivalent of 500 million barrels of recoverable crude, the
Irving, Texas-based company said in a posting today on
Schlumberger Ltd.''s asset-sale website. </p>
<p>Exxon''s stake in the resource has a value of about $12
billion at current average New York crude prices for the year.
The Mer Tres Profonde Sud block covers 3,818 square kilometers
(1,474 square miles). </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil has a long-standing practice of continually
reviewing all assets for the contribution to the company''s
operating needs and financial objectives, as well as their
potential value to others, Patrick McGinn, a company
spokesman, said in an e-mailed message. </p>
<p>Exxon rose 78 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $62.72 as of 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock fell 11
percent in the past 12 months, the second-worst performance in
the NYSE Arca Oil Index. BP Plc''s American depositary receipts
had the largest decline among index members, tumbling 23
percent. </p>
<p>An online data room for the Congolese fields will open on
Aug. 9, followed by a physical data room on Aug. 16, according
to the posting. A data room is where potential suitors can get
more information about the geological features and other
characteristics of oil fields. Exxon will accept proposals
through Oct. 22. </p>
<p>Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Brazil''s state-controlled oil
company, is the biggest producer of crude from deep-water
fields, according to PFC Energy. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc.''s second-quarter profit
beat analyst estimates after sales were boosted by a weaker
dollar and products from its acquisition of Wyeth. The shares
rose the most in almost 17 months. </p>
<p>Profit excluding one-time items was 62 cents a share,
beating the 52 cents average estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, the New York-based company said today in a statement.
Revenue increased 58 percent to $17.3 billion, $696 million more
than analysts had estimated. </p>
<p>Sales benefited from a $584 million gain in foreign
currency exchange and from the addition of the Enbrel arthritis
treatment and Prevnar pneumonia vaccine from Pfizer''s $68
billion acquisition of Wyeth last year. The company reaffirmed
its forecast for 2010, saying earnings may be at the higher end
of the target. </p>
<p>This is a major statement by a company that has had a
rough year, said Marc Goodman, an analyst with UBS Securities
LLC, in a note to clients. This is the kind of quarter that

<p>Pfizer rose 86 cents, or 5.6 percent, to $16.34 at 4 p.m.

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is offering
to give investors in the highest-rated portions of a bond sale
backed by commercial mortgages control in the event the loans go
bad as bankers attempt to revive the market. </p>
<p>The $788.5 million offering gives holders of the safest
portion of the transaction, or about 81 percent of the deal, the
power to direct and replace firms hired to handle loans that
become troubled, according to marketing documents distributed
last week to investors. Typically, that right is held by
investors who buy the smaller, riskiest slice. </p>
<p>It''s plowing new ground, said Patrick Sargent, a
partner at Dallas law firm Andrews  Kurth LLP. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is attempting to address concern that holders
of the riskiest pieces of commercial mortgage bonds in the $700
billion market may make decisions that favor their interest over
other investors in the transactions when loans sour. Late
payments on office buildings, shopping centers and other
properties jumped to a record 7.71 percent as of June 30, from
2.67 percent a year earlier, according to Moody''s Investors
Service. </p>
<p>This is a big nod to the AAA buyers, Lisa Pendergast, a
strategist at Jefferies  Co. in Stamford, Connecticut, said in
an interview. </p>
<p>A unit of New York-based hedge-fund firm Elliott Management
Corp. bought the slice most likely to take losses in the latest
mortgage-bond offering by Goldman Sachs, according to the
marketing documents. Scott Tagliarino, a spokesman for Elliott,
and Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment. </p>
<p>B-Piece'' Buyers </p>
<p>Investors who hold the most-junior slices, or B-pieces, are
first to be wiped out as losses mount and may have an incentive
to keep the debt outstanding rather than foreclose, punishing
other holders. </p>
<p>Some investors don''t like the link between the B-piece
buyer and the special servicer, Sargent, a member of the
executive committee of the Commercial Real Estate Finance
Council, a New York-based trade group, said in a telephone
interview. It was one of the points raised by investors in
discussions about how to restart issuance, he said. </p>
<p>Units of special servicers, which are firms that handle
troubled loans, often were buyers of the riskiest portions of
commercial-mortgage bonds, Sargent said. </p>
<p>Top-rated commercial mortgage-backed securities yield 2.73
percentage points more than Treasuries, compared with 3.95
percentage points more than the benchmark at the beginning of
the year, according to a Barclays Plc index. A year ago, the
debt was yielding a spread of 5 percentage points. </p>
<p>Innovative Structure'' </p>
<p>The offering being marketed by Goldman Sachs and Citigroup
Inc., the fourth sale backed by newly originated commercial
mortgages this year, uses an innovative structure, according
to Andy Solomon, a managing director at Angelo Gordon  Co. with
$23 billion in assets under management. It still doesn''t
eliminate potential conflicts of interest, he said in an
interview. </p>
<p>I don''t see any reason to believe that AAA holders would
influence special servicers to make better decisions for all
bondholders as a group, said Solomon, who is based in New York
and oversees $4 billion in commercial-mortgage-backed bonds.
These are the same folks that wanted to liquidate loans at
fire sale prices into a no-bid market two years ago. </p>
<p>Holders of the top-ranked debt get paid first if the loan
is liquidated, meaning it may be to their advantage to foreclose
sooner rather than later, even if property prices are at a
bottom. U.S. commercial property prices, down 39 percent from
2007 peaks, rose for the second straight month in May, according
to Moody''s. </p>
<p>Higher Yielding </p>
<p>Some investors may shy away from buying the lowest-ranked
portion of a commercial-mortgage backed bond deal if they can''t
exert control over soured loans, though the chase for higher-
yielding assets may make it an easier sell, Sargent said. </p>
<p>This is an environment where there are more investors for
that riskier slice, he said. </p>
<p>An affiliate of BlackRock Inc., the world''s biggest asset
manager, bought the non-investment grade portion of a $716.3
million commercial-mortgage bond offering sold by JPMorgan Chase
 Co. on June 11, according to deal documents disseminated to
investors at the time of the sale. </p>
<p>The BlackRock affiliate retained certain control
rights, including directing the special servicer, the
documents show. Lauren Trengrove, a spokeswoman for BlackRock,
declined to comment, as did Brian Marchiony, a JPMorgan
spokesman. </p>
<p>The Goldman Sachs offering comes as banks are trying to
revive the market after sales tumbled 95 percent to $11.2
billion in 2008 from a record $234 billion in 2007, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Banks arranged $3.4 billion of the securities last year,
and about $1.7 billion has been issued in 2010. The lack of
sales chokes off funding to borrowers with maturing debt. </p>

<p>General Growth Properties Inc., the
second-largest U.S. mall operator, said it intends to reinstate
$1.35 billion of bonds instead of seeking a term loan under a
revised reorganization plan to exit bankruptcy. </p>
<p>General Growth, based in Chicago, filed the revised plan
yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York. The company said
it still expects to leave bankruptcy in October, as proposed in
the earlier plan. </p>
<p>Under the amended plan, $1.35 billion of company bonds due
in 2012 and 2013 will be reinstated with accrued interest paid
to holders instead of giving them the option of taking cash,
according to court documents. </p>
<p>General Growth has secured $8.55 billion in capital
commitments for its restructuring from Brookfield Asset
Management Inc., Fairholme Funds Inc. and Pershing Square
Capital Management LP. </p>
<p>Other plan changes include General Growth''s consent to a
sale by the investor group of as much as $500 million of their
equity stake to Blackstone Group LP, the company said in a
statement yesterday. </p>
<p>In addition, the investors have agreed to buy $250 million
of new equity in a new company General Growth is spinning off
instead of backstopping a $250 million rights offering for the
company. </p>
<p>Last Stage </p>
<p>General Growth is in the last stage of its bankruptcy case,
which began after the mall owner failed to refinance its debt
during the credit crunch. At the time, commercial real estate
prices in the U.S. had dropped 15 percent and retail sales had
fallen as job losses forced consumers to pull back on spending. </p>
<p>At a court hearing set for Aug. 19, General Growth will ask
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Allan Gropper in Manhattan to approve a
disclosure statement explaining the plan so that creditors can
begin voting on it. </p>
<p>General Growth has interests in more than 200 regional
shopping malls in 43 states. </p>
<p>The case is In re General Growth Properties Inc., 09-11977,

<p>Pfizer Inc., the world''s biggest
drugmaker, persuaded a Missouri judge to deny class-action
status for a lawsuit alleging the company illegally marketed its
Neurontin epilepsy medicine. </p>
<p>Judge Donald L. McCullin in St. Louis refused on July 27 to
allow Missouri Neurontin buyers to combine claims that Pfizer
sold the drug for unapproved uses and misled users about its
effectiveness, according to state-court filings. Two consumers
sought to have their case certified as a class action to recover
money spent on Neurontin prescriptions. </p>
<p>The evidence in the record shows Neurontin is effective
for treatment of many conditions, McCullin wrote in his 13-
page decision. The court cannot certify this putative class
because it appears from the record that it would include more
than a small number of uninjured individuals. </p>
<p>Pfizer, based in New York, faces at least 400 lawsuits
accusing it of illegally promoting Neurontin. In March, a Boston
jury ordered Pfizer to pay more than $140 million in damages to
an insurer over its marketing practices in connection with the
drug. </p>
<p>The company also has settled at least two suits alleging
the drug played a role in users'' suicides, paying almost
$400,000 in one of the accords, people familiar with the deals
said earlier this year. </p>

<p>Pfizer is pleased with McCullin''s decision, spokesman Chris Loder said today in an e-mailed statement. The judge found the
case wasn''t suitable for class-action treatment because
potential class members had different types of claims depending
on how the drug worked for them. </p>
<p>We think this ruling is subject to challenge, Gerald
Meunier, a New Orleans-based lawyer representing Missouri
plaintiffs Elizabeth Judy and Stephen Brown, said in a phone
interview. This case is far from over. </p>
<p>Some Neurontin users contend that Pfizer''s Warner-Lambert
unit intentionally violated federal law by marketing the
epilepsy drug for more than a dozen medical conditions that
weren''t approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration
regulators. </p>
<p>Warner-Lambert officials pleaded guilty in 2004 to criminal
charges filed by the U.S. Justice Department and paid a $430
million fine over allegations the company illegally marketed
Neurontin. Pfizer bought Warner-Lambert for $120 billion in
2000. </p>
<p>Consumer Law </p>
<p>In the Missouri case, lawyers for Judy and Brown argued
that Neurontin purchasers overpaid for the drug based on the
company''s illegal marketing tactics and deserved to able to join
together in a group suit to recoup that money. </p>
<p>They also argued Neurontin wasn''t effective for the non-
approved uses that Warner-Lambert targeted in its marketing
effort. The plaintiffs brought the case under a Missouri
consumer statute, Meunier said. </p>
<p>The Missouri case is Judy v. Pfizer Inc., 042-01946-02,
Missouri Circuit Court, Twenty-Second Judicial Circuit (St.
Louis). </p>

<p>General Motors Co., the biggest
overseas automaker in China, boosted sales in the nation 22
percent in July, aided by the popularity of Chevrolet cars,
while deliveries by Ford Motor Co.''s local sales unit fell. </p>
<p>GM sold 176,645 vehicles last month in the world''s largest
auto market, after boosting deliveries of Chevrolet vehicles 70
percent to 35,385, the company said in an e-mailed statement
today. Sales of GM-brand vehicles rose 45 percent to 1.3 million
in the first seven months of the year, it added. </p>
<p>The carmaker is counting on expansion in China and other
overseas markets to bolster profit as it prepares for an initial
public offering as early as the fourth quarter. GM''s first-half
sales in China surpassed those in the U.S. for the first time
this year as the world''s fastest-growing major economy propelled
global auto demand. </p>
<p>GM has been doing the right things by tapping demand
growth in smaller cities with smaller cars, said Han Weiqi, an
analyst at CSC International Holdings Ltd. in Shanghai. When
overall demand growth slows in the second half, companies
deploying the wrong approaches will be hit much harder. </p>
<p>Ford''s Sales Decline </p>
<p>Changan Ford Sales Co., the Chinese sales unit of Ford,
delivered 18,255 vehicles in July, it said in statement today.
Sales in July 2009 by Changan Ford totaled 19,486, the automaker
said on its website last year. </p>
<p>Chongqing Changan Automobile Co., which makes cars with
Ford in China, fell 3.1 percent, the most in more than two weeks,
to close at 10.20 yuan in Shenzhen trading today. </p>
<p>China''s total passenger car sales to consumers rose 15.4
percent last month to 822,300, the China Automotive Technology 
Research Center said yesterday. Vehicle demand may weaken in
August, the center said. </p>
<p>GM, which makes vehicles including Buick Excelle cars and
Chevrolet Cruze compacts with its Chinese joint-venture partner
SAIC Motor Co. in China, has added new models at a much faster
pace than Ford, CSC''s Han said. </p>
<p>GM, based in Detroit, is refreshing its lineup in China
with new models such as the Chevrolet Sail compact and Buick
Excelle GT small sedan, the automaker said last month. </p>
<p>The company also makes Sunshine minivans at SAIC-GM-Wuling
Automotive Co., a separate joint venture in which the U.S.
automaker has a 34 percent stake. </p>

<p>General Motors Co.''s Escalade is the
most-stolen car of the past decade as thieves seek chrome,
horsepower, Hemis and leather, according to the Highway Loss
Data Institute. </p>
<p>The Escalade, a luxury sport utility vehicle priced between
$60,000 and $190,000, again topped the list, as it has every
year since 2000, the insurance industry study group said in a
report released today. </p>
<p>For every 1,000 insured Cadillac Escalades, during the 2007
through 2009 model years, an average of 10.8 were reported
stolen, said the study group, which is an affiliate of the
Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The next most stolen is
the Ford F-250, a large pickup, followed by the Infiniti G37
two-door, a midsize luxury car, and the Dodge Charger with a
hemi engine, a large family car. </p>
<p>Sedate family cars and fuel sippers aren''t on the hot
list, said Kim Hazelbaker, the group''s senior vice president.
Thieves are after chrome, horsepower and Hemis. </p>
<p>The average claim for an Escalade is seven times the
average for all passenger vehicles -- $11,934, which is a
fraction of its sticker price. That''s because thieves often
steal only parts of the SUV, such as the stereo system or the
hubcaps. </p>
<p>The Chevrolet Corvette Z06 sports car has the highest
average claim cost among the most stolen, at $41,229. </p>
<p>Most-stolen models aside, since 1998, the frequency of auto
theft claims has declined while the cost per vehicle has risen. </p>
<p>Pickups'' Theft Appeal </p>
<p>Pickup trucks are growing in theft popularity, according to
the institute. The trucks are already the top stolen vehicles in
Houston, said Jim Woods, who has been an auto theft officer at
the Houston Police Department for 17 years. </p>
<p>Pickups prove useful tools for other crimes, Woods said.
Storage space in the truck is helpful for transporting drugs and
other illegal items. Its four-wheel drive also means the
criminal can escape off-road, he said. </p>
<p>The least frequently stolen vehicles are Japanese makes
such as the Toyota Prius and the Nissan Murano, and family cars
like the Toyota Sienna 4WD and the Volvo S80, according to the
institute''s data. </p>
<p>Thieves are attracted by the Escalade''s leather interior,
which can be easily bolted into less luxurious SUVs such as the
Chevrolet Suburban or Tahoe, said Houston''s Officer Woods. You
wonder how many Chevrolet Tahoes are running around with
Cadillac interiors, he said. </p>
<p>GM has added a steering lock to the vehicle and OnStar
tracking, which allows the Escalade to be slowed down remotely
by authorities, said Nick Twork, a spokesman for Cadillac.
Customers aren''t deterred from buying the car because it''s the
most-stolen, he said. </p>
<p>If someone wants to steal any car, they can do it,
Twork said. It speaks to the desirability of certain aspects
of the Escalade. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Citigroup Inc. sold $788.5 million of bonds backed by commercial
mortgages in the fourth offering of the debt this year as Wall
Street seeks to jumpstart sales. </p>
<p>The largest top-rated portions of the transactions, a
$410.6 million slice maturing in 9.86 years, yields 135 basis
points more than the benchmark swap rate, according to a person
familiar with the offering who declined to be identified because
terms aren''t public. Similar debt sold in 2006 and 2007 when
sales peaked and underwriting bottomed yields about 320 basis
points over the benchmark, according to Deutsche Bank AG data. </p>
<p>The deal is the third to pool loans from multiple property
owners this year, and included new features designed to appease
investors as banks attempt to revive the $700 billion market.
Sales tumbled 95 percent to $11.2 billion in 2008 from a record
$234 billion in 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The changes are a sharp departure from past transactions,
according to a Deutsche Bank report today. </p>
<p>The changes were no doubt made to better the structure
and make the deal more attractive to investors, the New York-
based analyst Harris Trifon said in the report. The sheer
number of changes makes it difficult to assess how smoothly the
deal will function in practice. </p>
<p>One of the key changes is giving buyers of the highest-
rated portions control of who manages troubled loans, a right
that has historically been held by investors who buy the
riskiest slice, the so-called B piece. Some investors are
concerned that those holders may make decisions that favor their
own interests when loans go bad. </p>
<p>Material Impact'' Unlikely </p>
<p>Stripping control from the buyers most susceptible to
losses could make it harder to sell the debt, Trifon wrote. </p>
<p>With a relatively limited supply and strong demand, this
issue in isolation is not likely to have a material impact, he
said. Assuming the new deal pipeline continues to grow, the
market might have a hard time finding enough B-piece buyers
willing to participate without some control rights. </p>
<p>Banks arranged $3.4 billion of securities backed by newly
originated commercial mortgages last year, and about $2.49
billion has been issued in 2010, Bloomberg data show. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. asked a New
York judge to dismiss a $1 billion lawsuit by Australian hedge
fund Basis Capital, arguing that a June U.S. Supreme Court
decision bars the claim. </p>
<p>The lawsuit by Basis Capital''s Basis Yield Alpha Fund
focuses on Goldman Sachs''s sale of the Timberwolf
collateralized debt obligation. The complaint, filed June 9 in
Manhattan federal court, says the fund was forced into
insolvency after buying mortgage-linked securities created by
Goldman Sachs, in what one of its own executives described
internally as a shi**y deal. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs argued that the suit is barred by the Supreme
Court''s June 24 ruling in Morrison v. National Australia Bank.
In that case, the high court held that U.S. securities laws
don''t apply to the claims of foreign buyers of non-U.S.
securities on foreign exchanges. </p>
<p>This litigation presents a contract dispute between two
foreign entities, executed abroad and governed by English law,
and Morrison makes clear that it does not belong in this
court, New York-based Goldman said in a filing dated Aug. 2. </p>
<p>Eric Lewis, a lawyer for Basis, said there are significant
arguments to be made that Morrison doesn''t bar the Basis
claim. </p>
<p>The credit-default swaps in the transaction were
derivatives of U.S. securities, Lewis said. The location of the
transaction was really New York, and Goldman Sachs International
was acting as an agent of New York-based Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. in the transaction, he said. </p>
<p>In the complaint, Basis alleged that Goldman falsely
claimed in June 2007 that the market for investments such as
Timberwolf had stabilized. Basis claims it closed on its deal
with Goldman to buy credit default swaps tied to Timberwolf at
the same time Thomas Montag, Goldman''s former head of sales and
trading for the Americas, sent the e-mail calling the Timberwolf
CDO one shi**y deal. </p>
<p>Basis, which invested $78 million in Timberwolf, is seeking
compensatory and punitive damages from Goldman. </p>
<p>The case is Basis Yield v. Goldman Sachs, 1:10-cv-04537,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

according to three people with direct knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>ICICI Securities Ltd. and SBI Capital Markets Ltd. may also
be hired, the people said, declining to be named before an
official announcement. Seventeen banks had bid to manage the
offering, with presentations ending yesterday in New Delhi,
according to a notice on the Gurgaon-based company''s website. </p>
<p>The government and Power Grid, India''s largest energy
transmission company, will sell a combined 841.8 million shares,
it said in July. Shares of Power Grid rose 0.3 percent to 100.15
rupees at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai yesterday, valuing a 20
percent stake at 84.3 billion rupees ($1.83 billion). </p>
<p>Power Grid Chairman S.K. Chaturvedi wasn''t immediately
available to comment on his mobile-phone yesterday. Spokespeople
at the banks didn''t immediately respond to e-mails. </p>
<p>The lowest fees bid was 0.00000001 percent, one of the
people said. Banks shortlisted for the sale have to match the
lowest bidder to win the mandate, according to the government''s
guidelines. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are among U.S. banks seeking to
make more of their revenue in developing markets such as India
as tougher regulations and slower economic growth reduce
opportunities in the U.S. and Europe. </p>
<p>JPMorgan in June named Heidi Miller, a longtime associate

finance its exit from bankruptcy. </p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Allan Gropper in New York today
approved a plan for the Teacher Retirement System of Texas to
buy $500 million of shares in the reorganized General Growth at
$10.25 a share. </p>
<p>I will approve the agreement as a reasonable exercise of
the debtors'' powers under the bankruptcy code, Gropper said.
There was no opposition to the investment. </p>
<p>The pension plan is joining Brookfield Asset Management
Inc., Fairholme Funds Inc. and Pershing Square Capital
Management LP to finance the Chicago company''s exit from
bankruptcy protection, which is set for October. </p>
<p>Under the plan, Brookfield, Fairholme and Pershing have
agreed to buy $6.3 billion of stock in the reorganized company
at $10 a share in addition to other commitments. The pension
plan will hold a 4.9 percent stake in General Growth when it
emerges from bankruptcy, and the other three investors will

to court documents. </p>
<p>The Texas pension investment will reduce the other

<p>Assicurazioni Generali SpA, Europe''s

lower investment income and asset writedowns. </p>
<p>Net income probably declined to 353 million euros ($466

average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. The

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., suing to
overturn a $20.5 million arbitration award to creditors of the
failed hedge-fund firm Bayou Group LLC, got support from the
Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. </p>
<p>The association, which says it represents the interests of
hundreds of securities firms, banks and asset managers,
filed a brief in federal court in New York today in support of
Goldman Sachs, claiming the case has potentially industrywide
implications, especially for clearing brokers. </p>
<p>The creditors claim Goldman Sachs facilitated the
$400 million fraud committed by Bayou co-founder Samuel Israel,
who is now serving 22 years in prison. Stamford, Connecticut-
based Bayou filed for bankruptcy protection in May 2006. </p>
<p>The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the
independent regulatory group for the securities industry, on
June 24 issued a decision in favor of Bayou''s creditors in an
arbitration targeting Goldman Sachs Execution  Clearing LP for
its role as the prime broker and clearing broker for Bayou''s
hedge funds. Goldman sued last month to overturn the decision. </p>
<p>In imposing liability on Goldman, the arbitrators
disregarded the long-recognized principle that a clearing firm
cannot be liable for merely processing transactions received
from an authorized source, the trade association argued. </p>
<p>John Rich of New York''s Rich  Intelisano LLP, a lawyer for
Bayou''s unsecured creditors, defended FINRA''s finding. </p>
<p>This was an experienced and well-seasoned arbitration
panel''s decision after an 18-day trial and lengthy closing
arguments on the law and facts,he said in an e-mail today. </p>
<p>Speed and Efficiency'' </p>
<p>If clearing firms were required to analyze trading in
introduced accounts, or to make determinations concerning
whether the records and documents in their possession regarding
the activities of an introducing firm''s customers indicated
possible wrongdoing, the speed and efficiency demanded in the
contemporary securities markets would not be possible, the
Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association said in
its filing. </p>

<p>A federal judge denied a motion by
two former JPMorgan Chase  Co. bankers to dismiss a Securities

Jefferson County, Alabama, that allowed the bank to win almost
$5 billion in bond and interest-rate swap business. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Abdul Kallon in Birmingham rejected
arguments by Douglas MacFaddin, the former head of JPMorgan''s
municipal derivatives desk, and investment banker Charles LeCroy
that the SEC doesn''t have jurisdiction over interest-rate swaps.
The unregulated derivatives were used by the county to lower
borrowing costs on debt issued to rebuild its sewer system. </p>
<p>Kallon said it was too early in the case to resolve the
question of whether the swaps were security-based and
therefore subject to SEC oversight. </p>
<p>MacFaddin''s and LeCroy''s challenge to the SEC''s
jurisdiction failed because they relied on a disputed fact, that
the swaps were based on an interest-rate index, rather than an
index of securities, Kallon wrote in a 22-page opinion. </p>
<p>The SEC filed suit against the pair last year, alleging the
New York-based bank made more than $8 million in undisclosed
payments to friends of county commissioners. The associates
owned or worked at local broker-dealer firms that didn''t do any
work on the deals, which have nearly bankrupted the county, the
state''s most populous. </p>
<p>Larry Langford, the former president of the Jefferson
County Commission and former mayor of Birmingham, is serving 15
years in prison after being convicted of accepting $235,000 in
designer clothes, Rolex watches and cash from an Alabama banker
who was paid almost $3 million by JPMorgan. </p>
<p>The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Charles E. LeCroy and Douglas W. MacFaddin., 09-CV-02238, U.S. District

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s principal-
strategies business, a unit that makes bets with the firm''s own
capital, plans to transform into a fund and raise outside money,
a person with direct knowledge of the decision said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs may announce as soon as tomorrow plans to
discontinue the business, which is part of the New York-based
bank''s equities unit, the person said, declining to be named
because the decision hasn''t been made public. The team, which
aims to complete the process by the end of the year, hasn''t set
a target for the amount it wants to raise, the person said. </p>
<p>The Dodd-Frank Act signed by President Barack Obama last
month prohibits banks such as Goldman Sachs from engaging in
proprietary trading. Goldman Sachs Principal Strategies, led by
Hong Kong-based Morgan Sze, 44, may be keen to raise money
before competition emerges from proprietary-trading teams
leaving other banks, analyst Brad Hintz said. </p>
<p>What you don''t want to be is the 50th prop desk being
spun out, Hintz, at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in New York,
said in an interview. I think what they''re saying is, Get out
while the getting''s good.'' </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which doesn''t break out the size of teams
like GSPS or the revenue or profit they generate, has said it
derives about 10 percent of annual revenue on average from
proprietary-trading activities. </p>
<p>Reviewing Operations </p>
<p>Lucas van Praag, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York,
declined to comment. Last week, asked to comment on the firm''s
plans for its proprietary-trading teams, he said: Given the
changes coming to financial regulation, we are as you would
expect reviewing those operations likely to be affected. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley is in talks to spin off its FrontPoint
Partners LLC hedge-fund unit, according to people familiar with
the plans. The New York-based bank may retain a stake in the
business, which is run by Daniel Waters and Michael Kelly, said
one of the people, who declined to be named because the talks
aren''t public. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley purchased FrontPoint in 2006. The firm paid
$400 million for its stake, people familiar with the terms said
at the time. Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said in
February that the firm was evaluating its investments in
hedge funds, including FrontPoint. </p>
<p>Erica Platt, a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley, said she
couldn''t comment on market rumors. </p>
<p>Good Opportunity'' </p>
<p>Some of these guys feel that now is a good opportunity to
strike out on their own, said Steven Nadel, a New York-based
partner who specializes in advising hedge funds at law firm
Seward  Kissel LLP, who wasn''t speaking on Goldman Sachs or
FrontPoint specifically. Still, he added that it''s not easy to
raise money and new requirements for funds to register with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission can add to the
complexity of starting funds. </p>
<p>Under the so-called Volcker rule provision in the Dodd-
Frank Act, banks would be allowed to contribute up to 3 percent
of the equity in hedge funds or private-equity funds. Goldman
Sachs has a history of investing with former traders who start
hedge funds. Alumni who left to start hedge funds include Eric Mindich at Eton Park Capital Management LP, Dinakar Singh at
TPG-Axon Capital Management, and Daniel Och of Och-Ziff Capital
Management Group LLC. </p>
<p>In 2007, about half the members of the Goldman Sachs
Principal Strategies team created a fund called Goldman Sachs
Investment Partners that remains housed in the firm''s money-
management division. Some traders who stayed in the principal-
strategies unit, including Pierre-Henri Flamand and Ali Hedayat,
left Goldman Sachs earlier this year. </p>
<p>The Dodd-Frank law allows banks at least four years to
bring proprietary trading into compliance, with a potential
extension of as many as three years, according to a timeline
prepared by Davis Polk  Wardwell LLP. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., winning its
first job managing a share sale by an Indian state-owned company,
may earn next to nothing for the privilege. </p>
<p>The most profitable securities firm in Wall Street history
tied for the lowest bid among 17 banks vying to manage the
$1.8 billion offer by Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd.,
three people with knowledge of the matter said. Goldman Sachs
and SBI Capital Markets Ltd. said they''d do the work for a fee
equal to 0.00000001 percent of the sale proceeds. That means the
firms stand to reap about 2 rupees (4 cents) each on the deal. </p>
<p>The Indian government''s plan to sell a record 400 billion
rupees of assets this year is producing near-zero fees for Wall
Street firms that charge an average of about 4 percent of money
raised for U.S. offerings, data compiled by Bloomberg show. As
many as 20 banks still compete for each state sale, betting the
league-table credits will help them win more investment-banking
work in Asia''s third-largest economy. </p>
<p>They bet they can absorb any losses through other state
or private sector deals, said Ashvin Parekh, head of financial
services for India at Ernst  Young LLP. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is among U.S. banks seeking to make more of
their revenue in developing markets such as India as tougher
regulations and slower economic growth reduce opportunities in
the U.S. and Europe. David Viniar, Goldman Sachs''s chief
financial officer, told analysts on July 20 that the firm is
investing more in faster-growing emerging markets after it
reported second-quarter net income plunged 82 percent. </p>
<p>Lowest Fees </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. and ICICI Securities Ltd. may earn
similar fees to manage Gurgaon-based Power Grid''s sale, the
people said. Banks must match the lowest fees to be hired under
government guidelines. </p>
<p>S.K. Chaturvedi, chairman of Power Grid, India''s largest
electricity transmission company, declined to comment, as did
Christopher Jun, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in Seoul.
Spokespeople at the remaining banks also declined to comment. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs bid without success to manage offers from
state-owned Coal India Ltd. and Manganese Ore (India) Ltd. this
year. Both those sales may generate fees of 0.000001 percent for
underwriters including Citigroup Inc. and Edelweiss Capital Ltd.,
according to bankers with knowledge of the deals. </p>
<p>New York-based Goldman Sachs, ranked second globally for
equity sales, is No. 23 in India, where the average fee is 0.7
percent, including offerings by private companies, according to
Bloomberg data. SBI Capital, the Mumbai-based investment banking
unit of India''s largest lender, is No. 13 on share sales in the
nation, while New York-based Citigroup is the top-ranked
arranger, the data show. </p>
<p>Two Offers </p>
<p>Citigroup, whose local investment-banking operations are
run by Ravi Kapoor, has managed two offers by state-owned
companies this year and 10 sales by private firms, Bloomberg
data show. Sunil Sanghai, who was co-head of investment banking
at Goldman Sachs along with Brooks Entwistle, quit in June. The
company hasn''t named a replacement yet. </p>
<p>For state asset sales in India, rules governing the
selection of underwriters have helped squeeze fees. </p>
<p>Bankers must have the lowest fees as well as the best
technical bids if they want to win the mandates, according to
government guidelines. The bids must include reimbursements for
arranging roadshows, conducting market research, placing
advertisements and other expenses incurred by the banks, the
government has said. </p>
<p>Record Offers </p>
<p>India''s government plans to raise the 400 billion rupees in
the year that ends March 31 by selling stakes in companies
including Coal India, the world''s largest producer of the fuel,
and Steel Authority of India Ltd., the nation''s second-biggest
producer of the metal. </p>
<p>The government and Power Grid will sell a combined 841.8
million shares, according to a statement last month. Shares of
Power Grid have declined about 10 percent this year, valuing the
20 percent stake at about 83.2 billion rupees. </p>
<p>Presentations by the banks competing for the offering ended
Aug. 4 in New Delhi, according to a notice on the company''s
website. </p>
<p>The bidders included Bank of America Corp., Citigroup,
Deutsche Bank, HSBC Holdings Plc, Nomura Holdings Inc., Morgan
Stanley, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and UBS AG, the notice
showed. The domestic banks were Enam Securities Pvt., Edelweiss,
IDBI Capital Market Services Ltd., IDFC Capital Ltd. and Kotak
Mahindra Capital Co., it said. </p>

<p>Assicurazioni Generali SpA, Europe''s
third-biggest insurer, said second-quarter profit fell 14
percent on lower investment income and asset writedowns. </p>
<p>Net income declined to 346 million euros ($457 million)
from 400 million euros a year earlier. That compared with the
353 million-euro average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News. Bloomberg calculated the company''s income by
subtracting published first-quarter figures from the first-half
results released today. </p>
<p>In 2010, the Group expects to report higher operating
margins and a rise in net profit compared with 2009, the
Trieste, Italy-based company said in the statement. </p>
<p>Profitability at insurers is under pressure as low interest
rates and turbulence in the stock market weigh on investment
returns, while flood claims and lower margins hurt their
property and casualty business. Cesare Geronzi, who was
appointed Generali''s new chairman in April, aims to boost growth
in emerging markets, including China and the Middle East, and in
eastern Europe to recover from the global financial crisis. </p>
<p>It''s a good set of numbers, with net profit in line with
our estimate, Gruppo Banca Leonardo analysts wrote in a note
sent to clients. </p>
<p>Generali posted 461 million euros of writedowns related to
equity holdings in the first half, according to a slide
presentation. Total writedowns in the period fell to 655 million
euros from 1.1 billion euros a year earlier. </p>
<p>The non-life business, which was affected by claims related
to natural catastrophes in France and central-eastern Europe,
recorded gross premiums in the period of 5.1 billion euros, up
from 5 billion euros a year earlier. The company''s combined
ratio, a measure of profitability, worsened to 98.8 percent in
the first half from 97.9 percent a year earlier. </p>
<p>Generali''s gross premiums from life insurance rose 8
percent to 12.1 billion euros. </p>
<p>Generali gained 0.6 percent to 15.93 euros at 3:50 p.m. in
Milan, giving the company a market value of 24.68 billion euros.
The Bloomberg Europe 500 Insurance Index has risen 10 percent in
the past six months, compared with Generali''s 1 percent
increase. </p>
<p>The insurer is due to hold a conference call on its results
at 4 p.m. local time. </p>

<p>Drugmakers led by Pfizer Inc. will 
soon gain access to a new testing system that can shrink by 
months to years the time needed to determine an experimental
drug''s safety, potentially adding millions of dollars in
research savings and revenue. </p>
<p>Since 1938, U.S. regulators have required pharmaceutical
companies to test for toxicity using animal studies before
costly human testing begins. That can take months for most 
compounds, and years for cancer medicines. The new system, 
developed by three federal agencies, uses computers to test
products against human and animal cells, rather than living
creatures, to find chemical reactions linked to toxicity. </p>
<p>Speeding approvals by just six months can lift net income
over the average 12.8-year, patent-protected sales life of a
typical product by 5.5 percent, based on the declining value of
the dollar over time, data compiled by Bloomberg shows. The new
test, which may be available for use as early as next year, may 
also be more precise, helping eliminate more dangerous compounds. </p>
<p>The earlier you can kill a drug that''s unsafe the
more economic sense it makes, said David Jacobson-Kram, Food
and Drug Administration executive director for pharmacology
and toxicology, in a telephone interview. His agency last month
teamed up with the Environmental Protection Agency and the
National Institutes of Health in developing the system. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which makes
more money from trading than any other bank, estimates that 25
percent to 35 percent of its revenue comes from derivatives, a
spokesman said. </p>
<p>The New York-based firm, whose executives have said that
they didn''t know how much of their money came from derivatives,
provided the information in response to a request from the
Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, spokesman Lucas van Praag
said. The Wall Street Journal reported Goldman Sachs''s response
late yesterday on its website. </p>
<p>Based on the firm''s 2009 revenue of $45.2 billion, the
estimate means derivatives may have provided $11.3 billion to
$15.8 billion of revenue last year. </p>
<p>Chief Financial Officer David Viniar told members of the
FCIC in a July 1 hearing that Goldman Sachs doesn''t keep
separate records on derivatives because they are integrated
into the firm''s cash trading business. Derivatives are contracts
whose value is derived from assets such as stocks, bonds,
currencies or commodities, or events such as changes in interest
rates or the weather. </p>
<p>Tucker Warren, a spokesman for the FCIC, said today that he
wasn''t able to confirm that the commission had received the
information from Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>$49.1 Trillion </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs held a gross amount of $49.1 trillion of
derivatives contracts as of March 31, according to a June report
from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The OCC
lists Goldman Sachs among the five banks that together account
for 97 percent of the derivatives held by U.S. banks. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which is the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by
assets, reported $11.8 billion in revenue from trading fixed-
income, currencies and commodities in the first half of the year
and $3.57 billion from trading equities in the
same period. Combined, the two categories accounted for 71
percent of the firm''s $21.6 billion in net revenue. </p>
<p>Lawmakers appointed the 10-member FCIC in July 2009 to
investigate the causes of the worst U.S. financial crisis since
the Great Depression. The panel, led by Chairman Phil Angelides
and Vice Chairman Bill Thomas, has until December to
report its findings to Congress. </p>

<p>Visa Inc., the world''s biggest

<p>Visa may be terribly discounted after the shares fell
20 percent as Congress passed and President Barack Obama
recently signed financial-overhaul legislation that included a
cap on fees for debit-card use, the weekly newspaper said in its

<p>Quinteros expects year-over-year earnings grow of more than
20 percent over the next several quarters as consumer spending,
debit-care use and margins rise, Barron''s said. The newspaper

<p>Microsoft Corp., Yahoo! Inc. and Hulu
LLC plan to make online advertisements less annoying and more
profitable -- by letting users choose which ones to watch. </p>
<p>Starting next month, websites including MSNBC.com,
Yahoo.com and Hulu.com will begin letting consumers decide which
ads show up in the video clips they watch online. A research
study of the new Hulu-designed format led by Vivaki, the digital
arm of French advertising company Publicis Group SA, showed that
users were twice as likely to click an ad when given a choice
than when one was selected for them. </p>
<p>When you give people a choice they tend to love you
because you''re showing them respect, said Beth Uyenco Shatto,
global research director at Microsoft''s ads unit. If it wasn''t
for advertising they wouldn''t be getting the content for free. </p>
<p>The new ad-selecting tool, called ASq, may step up
development of the $3.1 billion global video ads market, already
the fastest-growing part of online advertising, Bloomberg
Businessweek.com reported. While it may not end unwelcome
commercials for car insurance or weight-loss pills, it may help
websites command higher rates while letting marketers attract
more eyeballs and better target consumers. </p>
<p>CBS.com, AOL.com and Discovery.com plan to start using ASq
in September and Google Inc.''s YouTube is studying it. The new
offering would let the viewer of an online video choose from
three or more ads instead of a pre-roll clip. Yahoo and Hulu
plan to use it as does Microsoft''s MSNBC.com, which features
segments from the Today show, NBC Nightly News and
Meet the Press. </p>
<p>We''re getting smarter about what makes more impactful
advertising, said Uyenco Shatto. The big aha! here is
understanding what makes a viewer choose a particular ad. </p>
<p>Online Ad Surge </p>
<p>Online advertising is expected to rise 12 percent this year
to $61.8 billion worldwide from $55.2 billion in 2009, according
to New York-based researcher eMarketer. Although text ads on
search pages such as Google or Microsoft''s Bing remain the
dominant form of online advertising, video ads are growing fast,
eMarketer says. According to IDC, global online video ad
spending, which was $2.2 billion in 2009, will expand to $11.3
billion in 2014. </p>
<p>YouTube, which has more than 1 billion views a day, says
the company is doubling its efforts to get more viewers for
its video ads. </p>
<p>We are always looking to develop new formats and features
that make them more interactive, the company said. </p>
<p>While online ads may be seen as disruptive, they foot the
bill for much of the Internet''s content. They are expected to
get better at targeting individual consumers. </p>
<p>Fun and Engaging </p>
<p>Online is much more individualist than television so
targeting is extremely important and effective, said Dean
Donaldson, director of media experience at MediaMind
Technologies Inc., a maker of software for digital ad campaigns. </p>
<p>People do like advertising if it''s fun and engaging and
that''s done by speaking to each user, he said. </p>
<p>Not everyone is convinced allowing users to choose ads will
benefit the industry. </p>
<p>If you only watch what you like then how will it broaden
your appeal? said Richard Wheaton, managing director at Ogilvy
 Mather''s Neo digital media agency, which works with clients
including Cisco Systems Inc., Eastman Kodak Co., International
Business Machines Corp. and American Express Co. Everybody
isn''t happy to be advertised at, but the more iPads I see the
more I want an iPad. </p>
<p>Wheaton said there''s a real shortage of quality of
video ads online because they are very expensive to shoot. </p>
<p>Experimental </p>
<p>For now, most online video ads are nothing more than TV
commercials posted on the Internet, said David Hallerman, an
advertising analyst at eMarketer. </p>
<p>The whole online video space is still experimental for
most advertisers and websites, he said. It definitely will
be growing, though search still remains No.1 in terms of dollars
spent and will remain dominant. </p>
<p>An estimated 9 percent of ads online are touched by a
user''s mouse for an average 43 seconds, Donaldson said. The
touch-time grows by 2 percent to 3 percent if the ad is a video. </p>
<p>Blinkx Plc, an online video-search operator spun off by
Autonomy Corp., is among companies that stand to benefit from
the expected surge in video ads, said Chief Executive Officer
Suranga Chandratillake. </p>
<p>The site, which gets 99 percent of its revenue from
advertising and was rated by ComScore as the fastest-growing
video site after Facebook, targets consumers with ads using
software that analyzes words and visual signs. Users can even
choose their own endings to some video ads. </p>
<p>Samsung 3-D </p>
<p>Samsung Electronics Co. is using interactive ads in one of
its campaigns for 3-D television. The company took a projection
of the late-19th-century Beurs van Berlage building in Amsterdam
and pasted it into a YouTube page. The building then cracks,
butterflies emerge from it, and users are instructed to click on
as many butterflies as possible to win a free TV. </p>
<p>Video is emotive, said Chandratillake. Search is a
terrible place to do branded advertising. When you think of your
favorite ads, they are never Google search ads. </p>
<p>There are 150 million online video watchers in the U.S. and
double that in China, said Sean Finnegan, chief digital officer
at Starcom MediaVest Group, a media buying and communications
agency owned by Publicis. </p>
<p>The majority of brands we represent plan to increase
their allocation to online video this year and next, he said. </p>
<p>Starcom MediaVest was part of a research group put together
by Publicis''s Vivaki, along with Hulu, Microsoft and the others
to study the ASq model. The group included marketers such as
Allstate Corp., Applebee''s International Inc. and Capital One
Financial Corp. </p>
<p>Eventually, video ads will become richer and accompany TV
audiences migrating online. They will have social and commercial
elements and target the right person at the right time, said
Jonathan Nelson, Omnicom Group Inc.''s digital chief. </p>
<p>Video ads and interactive ads have lineage in TV;
extending that online is natural, he said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was sued by
five computer-network technicians who claim the bank denied them
overtime pay for their work as contractors. </p>
<p>The lawsuit seeks class-action status and unspecified
damages, Goldman Sachs said today in a filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. The plaintiffs contend they
deserve overtime pay for working more than 40 hours a week. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s conduct was willful and in bad faith,
according to the technicians, who say the bank never paid them
overtime for work weeks that topped 70 hours. More than 100
employees in New York and New Jersey were underpaid as a result,
according to the lawsuit filed in May. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, based in New York, disputed the allegations
in a July 16 filing, saying the technicians weren''t
employees as defined by the states'' labor laws. About 25
percent of Goldman Sachs''s staff works on technology, Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar said earlier this year. </p>
<p>Technology is fundamental to everything we do, from
revenue-producing activities to enabling much of the control
infrastructure of the firm, Viniar said in a presentation to
investors on Feb. 10. </p>
<p>In July 2009, Goldman Sachs started including consultants
and temporary staff in quarterly employee numbers. The change
prompted the firm to revise its employee total to 29,800 at the
end of March 2009, up from 27,898 when the figure included only
full-time staff. </p>
<p>The case is Bardouille v. Goldman Sachs  Co., 10cv4285,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the bank
that makes the most revenue trading stocks and bonds, lost money
in that business on 10 days in the second quarter, ending a
three-month streak of loss-free days at the start of the year. </p>
<p>Losses on Goldman Sachs''s trading desks exceeded $100
million on three days during the period that ended June 30,
according to a filing today by the New York-based company with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. The firm also disclosed
that trading losses surpassed its value-at-risk estimate, a
measure of potential losses, on two days. </p>
<p>Trading results across Wall Street firms declined after
Goldman Sachs and its biggest competitors posted perfect
results, with no losing days, in the first quarter. Goldman
Sachs''s $5.61 billion in second-quarter trading revenue exceeded
all its Wall Street competitors. The bank, overseen by Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, relied on trading
for 71 percent of its revenue in the first half of the year,
down from 80 percent a year earlier. </p>
<p>Today''s filing also shows that the firm''s traders generated
more than $100 million on 17 days during the quarter. Of the 65
days in the quarter, Goldman Sachs traders made money on 55
days, or 85 percent of the time. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan
Stanley have invested almost $20 billion of their own money in
private-equity, private-debt, real-estate and hedge funds,
meaning they may each have to cut those stakes by more than 60
percent to comply with the so-called Volcker rule. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs had $15.4 billion in such investments as of
June 30, while Morgan Stanley had $4.22 billion, the New York-
based companies said today in regulatory filings. </p>
<p>The Volcker rule limits a bank''s total investments in such
funds to 3 percent of its Tier 1 capital. That means Goldman
Sachs and Morgan Stanley would have to reduce their stakes to
about $2.1 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, if the rule
were enforced today. U.S. banks may have as long as a dozen
years to cut their stakes under the financial-overhaul bill
President Barack Obama signed into law last month. </p>
<p>The regulators are likely to give them several years in
order to comply, so I think it will be a steady, slow process,
said Richard Staite, a London-based analyst at Atlantic Equities
LLP. I think they''ll find it fairly easy to sell those size
investments over a multiyear period. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs said in the filing that substantially all
of the underlying assets of the funds will be liquidated within
10 years. Morgan Stanley said 46 percent of the fair value of
its private-equity funds and 49 percent of its real-estate funds
are likely to be liquidated in the next 10 years. </p>
<p>Tier 1 </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs had $7.32 billion invested in private-equity
funds, $4.18 billion in private-debt funds, $3.02 billion in
hedge funds and $910 million in real-estate funds, according to
its filing. The bank''s Tier 1 capital was $68.5 billion. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley had a $1.59 billion investment in private-
equity funds, $1.75 billion in hedge funds and $887 million in
real-estate funds as of June 30, the bank said. Its Tier 1
capital rose to $53.5 billion. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s total stakes were down from $15.9 billion
as of Dec. 31, 2009, according to the filing. Morgan Stanley''s
total stakes decreased from $4.62 billion as of March 31 and
$4.94 billion at Dec. 31, 2009, according to previous filings. </p>
<p>Rules curbing banks'' investments in their own funds would
take effect 15 months to two years after a law is passed,
according to the legislation. Banks would have two years to
comply, with the potential for three one-year extensions after
that. They could seek another five years for illiquid funds
such as private equity or real estate, according to a
presentation from law firm Davis Polk  Wardwell LLP. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley raised its forecast
for Argentina''s 2010 economic growth to 9.7 percent from
4.6 percent because of increased agriculture production, exports
to Brazil and domestic consumption. </p>
<p>Gross domestic product will expand 5.9 percent next year
compared with a previous forecast of 2.4 percent, the bank said
today in an e-mailed statement. This year''s growth rate will be
one of the fastest in Latin America, the bank said. </p>
<p>Argentina''s economy is in the midst of a scorching
recovery, Morgan Stanley economist Daniel Volberg wrote in the
report. The stronger growth outlook implies stronger fiscal
results and more manageable financing over the next 15 months. </p>
<p>Argentina''s economy, South America''s largest after Brazil,
is recovering from a slump that cut economic growth to
0.9 percent in 2009, the slowest since the country pulled out of
a recession in 2003. GDP rose 6.8 percent in the first quarter
from a year earlier, the fastest pace in two years. Economy
Minister Amado Boudou last week said the economy will expand
7 percent this year. </p>
<p>Argentina''s fiscal deficit will be 0.1 percent of GDP this
year, compared with an earlier estimate of a 1 percent deficit,
Morgan Stanley said. </p>
<p>Boudou said on Aug. 4 that Argentina has no financial
urgency to tap international credit markets after the country
last month restructured $12.9 billion in defaulted debt tied to
its 2001 default on $95 billion of bonds. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lowered its
year-end forecast for the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index to 1,200
from 1,250 and reduced its 2011 earnings projection, citing
weakening economic forecasts. </p>
<p>SP 500 companies will post combined profit of $89 a share
next year, compared with Goldman Sachs'' prior estimate of $93,
according to David Kostin, the New York-based equity strategist.
Jan Hatzius, the firm''s chief U.S. economist, lowered his
prediction for 2011 growth in gross domestic product to 1.9
percent from 2.4 percent on Aug. 6. </p>
<p>The weak GDP growth forecast and specter of deflation
means top-line sales increases will be hard to achieve, Kostin
wrote today in a note to clients. He raised his 2010 earnings
forecast for the SP 500 to $81 a share from $78. </p>
<p>The SP 500 has rallied 9.7 percent since July 2 as profit
growth that exceeded analyst estimates helped overcome concern
the economy will slip into the second recession in three years.
Growth in the U.S. slowed to a 2.4 percent annual rate in the
second quarter, less than forecast, reflecting an easing in
consumer spending, according to Commerce Department data. </p>
<p>Before today, the average estimate of 12 strategists
tracked by Bloomberg called for the SP 500 to rise 20 percent
in the last six months of 2010 to 1,242. U.S. earnings will
increase 35 percent in 2010, the biggest annual gain since 1988,
more than 8,000 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>The Federal Reserve may return to unconventional monetary
stimulus as early as this week''s policy meeting as the U.S.
economy continues to lose momentum, economists led by Hatzius
wrote Aug. 6. The firm raised its estimate for the jobless rate
as growth slows and the reacceleration in U.S. output expected
for 2011 is made more doubtful by congressional resistance to
fiscal stimulus, the note said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its
growth forecasts for the world''s two largest economies on signs
that stimulus boosts will wane. </p>
<p>Japan will grow 1.4 percent in 2011, compared with an
earlier forecast of a 1.7 percent expansion, Tokyo-based senior
economist Chiwoong Lee said in a report dated Aug. 7. Goldman
last week lowered its projection of U.S. growth for the same
year to 1.9 percent from 2.5 percent. </p>
<p>A report today showed Japan''s current-account surplus
narrowed for a second month as export gains cooled, adding to
concerns that the recovery is losing steam. Government
incentives that have bolstered spending at home are wearing off,
with economists forecasting second quarter gross domestic
product grew at half the pace of the previous period. </p>
<p>We expect signs that growth is slowing to gradually
emerge in line with the disappearance of the government stimulus
boost both in Japan and abroad, Lee wrote in a separate report
dated today. The U.S. economic recovery has lost a
considerable amount of its momentum. </p>
<p>Japan will experience a significant falloff in consumer
spending, which has so far been propped up by government
measures, according to Lee. He noted that there is little
chance Prime Minister Naoto Kan will extend a program
scheduled to expire in December that encourages household to buy
energy-efficient electronics. </p>
<p>Seven-Month High </p>
<p>Japan''s jobless rate is at a seven-month high and factory
output fell in June. The GDP report due Aug. 16 may show that
the expansion moderated to an annualized 2.1 percent from 5
percent in the previous quarter, according to the median
estimate of 11 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>Lee said Japan''s export gains are already losing steam and
will be sluggish in 2011 given a worsened outlook for the
expansion in the U.S. </p>
<p>U.S. growth will be slower in 2011 because of lawmakers''
resistance to extend several stimulus measures, Lee said. The
unemployment rate, which was at 9.5 percent in July, may climb
to 10 percent by early 2011, he said. That may prompt the
Federal Reserve to return to unconventional monetary easing,
such as increasing its purchases of Treasuries, he added. </p>

<p>Chicago drivers will pay a Morgan
Stanley-led partnership at least $11.6 billion to park at city
meters over the next 75 years, 10 times what Mayor Richard Daley
got when he leased the system to investors in 2008. </p>
<p> Morgan Stanley, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Allianz
Capital Partners may earn a profit of $9.58 billion before
interest, taxes and depreciation, according to documents for a
$500 million private note sale by their Chicago Parking Meters
LLC venture. That is equivalent to 80 cents per dollar of
projected revenue. Standard Parking Corp., which runs 30,000
spaces at the city''s O''Hare and Midway airports, earned 4.84
cents on that basis last year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>The deal illustrates how Wall Street banks, recipients of
more than $300 billion in taxpayer bailouts in the worst credit
collapse since the Great Depression, are profiting from helping
states and cities close record recession-induced deficits by
selling bonds and leasing public properties. Chicago gave up
billions of dollars in revenue when it announced in 2008 that it
leased Morgan Stanley its 36,000 parking meters, the third-
largest U.S. system, for $1.15 billion to balance its budget,
said Alderman Scott Waguespack. </p>
<p>While Chicago has the right to repossess and assume
operational control of the meters if the Morgan Stanley
partners default on their obligations, the bond document says,
the contract doesn''t expire until 2084. The next couple of
generations will pay the price, said Waguespack, 40, a
Democrat from the 32nd Ward. </p>
<p>It''s despicable, the way it went down, said Waguespack,
one of only five aldermen among 50 who voted against the lease. </p>
<p>Midway Airport </p>
<p>Indianapolis, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh and other
cities may follow Chicago in selling future parking revenue for
cash to help fill budget holes, according to the Reason
Foundation, a Los Angeles-based researcher that advocates
public-private partnerships. Chicago may also lease Midway
International Airport, a regional hub 10 miles from downtown. </p>
<p>When Daley, a 68-year-old Democrat who took office in 1989,
announced the parking deal on Dec. 2, 2008, two days before the
council''s vote, Waguespack''s staff estimated the city would give
up $4 billion to $5 billion of revenue in exchange for the
upfront sum. Last month, the private partners'' debt-sale
memorandum projected revenue over the 75-year lease would be
$11.6 billion. </p>

<p>Liverpool, the soccer club that last
season had its worst Premier League performance in 11 years, is
attracting gamblers for the new campaign. </p>
<p>Even after finishing seventh, the team is being backed by
the highest number of bettors at U.K. and Irish bookmakers. The
season starts Aug. 14, with Liverpool hosting Arsenal a day
later. </p>
<p>An 18-time winner of England''s top league, Liverpool has
attracted about a fifth of the total number of bets made with
Ladbrokes Plc and Paddy Power Plc, the bookmakers say. At 12-1
the Reds are the fifth favorite to win the league, so a
successful 1-pound ($1.58) bet would bring in 12 pounds plus the
original stake. </p>
<p>All fans are optimistic, and then there are Liverpool
fans, Paddy Power spokesman Darren Haines said in a telephone
interview. The eternal optimists who always think it''s going
to be their year. It''s been a long time since Liverpool has been
12-1. They may also be tempted by the takeover rumors. </p>
<p>The five-time European champion, which last won the
domestic league in 1990, failed to qualify for this season''s
Champions League and is the subject of media speculation about a
possible takeover. </p>
<p>A change of ownership before the end of August could hand
new manager Roy Hodgson tens of millions of pounds to bolster
his squad. He''s already added Joe Cole and retained Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres amid speculation they might leave. </p>
<p>Punters are tipping Liverpool to turn the corner with Roy
Hodgson, Ladbrokes spokesman Nick Weinberg said. </p>
<p>Worst-Case Scenarios </p>
<p>Ahead of Liverpool in Ladbrokes'' odds are defending
champion Chelsea, the favorite at 13-8, Manchester United (9-4),
Manchester City (5-1) and Arsenal (6-1). </p>
<p>Of the realistic contenders, Arsenal alarms Paddy Power
the most. </p>
<p>In terms of money, it''s significantly more than anyone
else. They are probably the realistic team that we currently
fear the most, Haines said. To date, the club has attracted
the company''s largest bet, with 4,500 pounds ventured at 6-1. </p>
<p>A Liverpool triumph would be Ladbrokes'' worst result.
We''re quite happy laying them at 12-1 but that''s not to say we
wouldn''t get a bit nervy if they start quite well, Weinberg
said. The club carries the bookmaker''s largest bet at 10,000
pounds, which could cost it 120,000 pounds. </p>
<p>A title-winning season for Liverpool''s city rival Everton
is currently the worst-case scenario for Paddy Power, although
at 150-1 the company is quite comfortable with that, Haines
said. </p>
<p>Spurs, City </p>
<p>Betting for this season has been well up on last year
for Paddy Power with the emergence of Tottenham Hotspur (33-1)
and Manchester City, fourth and fifth last season, making the
market more competitive. The two sides meet at White Hart Lane
in London in three days. </p>
<p>Both Ladbrokes and Paddy Power expect a large increase in
bets, particularly on Manchester United and Chelsea, as the week
progresses. A growth in football bets is partially offsetting a
decline gambling on horseracing, which attracts the largest
proportion of bettors, said Greg Johnson, an analyst for
Liverpool-based Shore Capital Group. </p>
<p>It''s a bit of a struggle out there, it''s certainly
sluggish, Johnson said in a phone interview. I would have
thought that they would be looking to the football season with
some excitement. </p>
<p>The Premier League is becoming more surprising with those
at the top becoming weaker, Johnson said. You''re more likely
to get more draws and less predictable results, which is how the
bookies make the money. </p>
<p>Houses Painted Orange </p>
<p>Premiership newcomer Blackpool has the longest odds in the
league at 5,000-1. Earlier this week, just 51 bets had been
placed with Paddy Power on the Lancashire team, known as the
Seasiders or Tangerines because of their orange jerseys. </p>
<p>It would be our second-worst result after Everton if
Blackpool were to win the league, Haines said. I''m not sure
who these 51 people are but I suspect their houses are painted
orange. The largest bet on Blackpool is 10 pounds, resulting
in a payout of 50,000 pounds if it finishes first. </p>
<p>Home loyalties often sway bettors living in the area of
newly promoted teams, such as Blackpool, Newcastle United and
West Bromwich Albion. </p>
<p>You''ll see punters in that particular area come in and
have a pound on their side to win the title, Weinberg said.
Just to say that they''ve done it and then go show their mates
down the pub. </p>
<p>The same can''t be said for 1,000-1 shot Bolton Wanderers,
who have elicited the lowest level of interest from Paddy Power
customers. The almost invisible man of the Premier League,
also based in Lancashire, has attracted five bets, Haines said. </p>

Marvel and Pixar studios enjoyed box-office successes with two

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. hired
Michael Wise from Morgan Stanley as a partner to run the team
that helps manage equity offerings for financial institutions in
the Americas. </p>
<p>Wise, 52, will start in New York in November, according to
an internal memo sent to employees by John S. Weinberg and David M. Solomon, Goldman Sachs''s co-heads of investment banking. Wise
succeeds Stuart Bernstein, who now oversees investment banking
for clean technology and renewable energy companies. Andrea Rachman, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, confirmed the contents
of the memo and declined to comment further. Wise declined to
comment when contacted by Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the most profitable securities firm in Wall
Street history, ranks fourth this year among managers of U.S.
equity and equity-linked offerings compared with second-place
Morgan Stanley, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Wise,
who was most recently chairman of equity capital markets at
Morgan Stanley, will report to Stephen Pierce, who runs the
equity capital markets division in the Americas. </p>
<p>Wise, who joined Morgan Stanley in 1997, covered media and

<p>Goldman Sachs generated $593 million in revenue from equity
underwriting in the first six months of 2010, compared with $533
million at Morgan Stanley, according to company filings. Both
firms lag behind industry leader JPMorgan Chase  Co., which
reaped $767 million in the first six months of the year from the
business, and Bank of America Corp., which made $662 million,
filings show. </p>

<p>Merrill Lynch  Co., the brokerage
unit of Bank of America Corp., won a U.S. judge''s ruling denying
a bid by 17 black financial advisers for group status in their
five-year-old discrimination lawsuit. </p>
<p>Broker George McReynolds of Nashville, Tennessee, sued in
2005, alleging Merrill Lynch''s practices and procedures favored
white financial advisers over their black counterparts,
impairing their ability to make comparable incomes. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Robert W. Gettleman in Chicago on Aug.
5 rejected the bid by McReynolds and 16 other advisers for
certification of the case as a class action, or group, lawsuit. </p>
<p>Plaintiffs'' statistical evidence alone is insufficient to
establish companywide discrimination affecting each member of
the proposed class the same way, the judge said. Each individual
group member''s claim must be tried before a jury, Gettleman
said. </p>
<p>McReynolds, along with the plaintiffs who joined the case
after he filed it, sought to represent about 700 advisers and
trainees who had worked in the firm''s Global Private Client unit
from January 2001 until now, according Gettleman''s decision. </p>
<p>Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America, the
largest U.S. bank by assets, acquired New York-based Merrill
Lynch last year for about $33 billion in stock. </p>
<p>Linda Friedman, a lawyer for the advisers, said she would
ask a federal appeals court for permission to seek review of the
ruling. </p>
<p>I continue to believe that a class action is the only way
to rid Wall Street of this horrific discrimination, said
Friedman, a partner at Stowell  Friedman Ltd. in Chicago.
However, the individuals who brought this lawsuit have no
intention of dropping it. </p>
<p>If Gettleman''s ruling stands, there could be as many as 200
trials, Friedman said. </p>
<p>We''re pleased with the court''s ruling, Bank of America
spokesman William Halldin said in a phone interview. He declined
to comment further. </p>
<p>The case is McReynolds v. Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner 
Smith Inc., 05-cv-06583, U.S. District Court, Northern District
of Illinois (Chicago). </p>
<p>Lehman, HSBC May Be Sued Over Worthless Minibonds'' </p>
<p>Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and HSBC Holdings Plc may be
sued over $1.6 billion in worthless securities sold to retail
investors, primarily in Hong Kong, a judge in New York ruled. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III yesterday
reversed part of a decision by Lehman''s bankruptcy judge, who
threw out a suit by seven holders of structured financial notes
called minibonds. The plaintiffs seek to represent a class of
investors in the notes from June 16, 2003, to Sept. 15, 2008,
Pauley said in his decision. </p>
<p>Pacific International Finance Ltd. issued the minibonds and
marketed them as linked to the credit of financially sound
companies and backed by AAA-rated collateral, Pauley said. The
minibonds became worthless as a result of the collapse of Lehman
Brothers, which filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history in
September 2008. </p>
<p>A Hong Kong regulatory authority investigation disclosed
that Lehman designed the minibonds program and used Pacific
Finance to issue them, Pauley said. Lehman selected HSBC Bank
USA as trustee of the collateral securing the notes, Pauley
said, citing testimony in the Hong Kong proceeding. </p>
<p>In two orders, issued in November and December, U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge James Peck ruled that the plaintiffs lacked
standing to sue and that any attempt to revise their complaint
would be futile. </p>
<p>In yesterday''s ruling, Pauley reversed the dismissal of one
count against HSBC and Lehman and permitted the plaintiffs to
amend two dismissed counts. </p>
<p>Neil Brazil, an HSBC spokesman, said the firm had no
immediate comment on the ruling. Kimberly Macleod, a Lehman
spokeswoman, didn''t return a voice-mail message seeking comment. </p>

District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<p>Madoff Judge Erred in Fake Profit Ruling, Court Told </p>
<p>Customers defrauded by Bernard Madoff''s Ponzi scheme
deserve repayment of as much as $500,000 each, even if they took
out more than they put into his investment business, a lawyer
argued yesterday to an appeals court. </p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland erred when he ruled in
March that the Securities Investor Protection Corp. doesn''t
offer insurance to investors, and that Madoff customers can only
collect from SIPC if they put in more cash than they took out
from his business, attorney Helen Chaitman argued in a brief. </p>
<p>Chaitman, who represents 700 investors, asked the U.S.
Court of Appeals in New York to reverse Lifland and rule that
SIPC trustee Irving Picard should review claims based on final
account statements in December 2008 that included fake profit
from the fraud. Those investors say they had no knowledge of the
fraud at New York-based Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities
LLC. </p>
<p>Appellants are, typically, people in their 70s, 80s or
90s, whose assets, other than their homes, were invested in
BLMIS and face serious medical issues, Chaitman wrote in
yesterday''s filing. They live in constant fear that the
trustee will sue them for the amount they withdrew from BLMIS in
excess of their investments. </p>
<p>Those investors are among more than 2,500 Madoff customers
who couldn''t collect any SIPC money under Lifland''s ruling,
which Picard sought. Picard, who is overseeing the liquidation
of Madoff''s business, has allowed more than 2,100 claims to
proceed.     Madoff, 72, who pleaded guilty last year, is
serving a 150-year sentence for running the largest Ponzi scheme
in U.S. history. Prosecutors said that Madoff falsely told
investors that they profited from stock trades that never took
place. </p>
<p>Picard, hired by SIPC to repay victims of the fraud, has
said that using account statements to set claims would let
Madoff decide who gets what, and include profit from trades that
didn''t really happen. </p>
<p>Victims wanted their final account statements from Madoff''s
firm to determine the size of their claims. They had argued to
Lifland that SIPC was required to base claims on customers''
legitimate expectations. Lifland disagreed, ruling the account
statements were entirely fictitious. </p>

L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, 08-01789, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>SEC, Goldman''s Tourre Had Preliminary Talks, Agency Lawyer Says </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive director Fabrice Tourre
had very preliminary talks with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission to settle the agency''s civil fraud claims
against him, an SEC lawyer said. </p>
<p>I would characterize us as having very preliminary
discussions along those lines a while back, and that''s all,
SEC lawyer Lorin Reisner said in a hearing yesterday in U.S.
District Court in Manhattan. </p>
<p>The SEC sued Goldman Sachs and Tourre in April, over claims
the firm misled investors in collateralized debt obligations
linked to subprime mortgages. Tourre, the only Goldman Sachs
executive sued individually, remains in the case after the firm
agreed to a $550 million settlement last month. </p>
<p>The settlement includes a $300 million fine and $250
million in restitution for investors. The penalty is the largest
ever levied by the Securities and Exchange Commission against a
Wall Street firm, the SEC said. Goldman Sachs acknowledged it
made a mistake and that marketing materials for the
instruments had incomplete information, the agency said. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones in Manhattan granted
final approval to the settlement on July 20. </p>
<p>Jones''s approval of the accord came a day after Tourre
filed court papers asking her to dismiss the lawsuit against
him. Tourre denied making any materially misleading statements
or omissions related to the sale of Abacus 2007-AC1 CDOs linked
to subprime mortgages. </p>
<p>In the hearing yesterday, before U.S. Magistrate Judge
Michael Dolinger, the parties discussed possible outlines for
pretrial discovery in the case. Reisner said the SEC is turning
over 9 million pages of investigative documents to Tourre''s
lawyers. He said the agency may seek to take pretrial testimony
from 25 witnesses. </p>
<p>Pamela Chepiga, one of Tourre''s lawyers, said Tourre may
seek to take testimony from as many as 50 witnesses. Chepiga
said the parties may also need to pursue evidence in the U.K.
and Germany in addition to the U.S. </p>
<p>Dolinger set an Oct. 4 hearing to discuss the progress of
discovery in the case. </p>
<p>The case is SEC v. Goldman Sachs, 10-CV-3229, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<p>BP and U.S. Agree on Oil Spill Compensation Fund </p>
<p>The U.S. completed negotiations with BP Plc over the
company''s agreement to establish a $20 billion fund to
compensate victims of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico,
according to the Justice Department. </p>
<p>The negotiations followed an agreement made between the
London-based company and President Barack Obama on June 16. </p>
<p>We are pleased that BP made an initial contribution and
has taken an important step toward honoring its commitment to
the president and the residents and business owners in the gulf
region, said Associate Attorney General Tom Perrelli in a
statement yesterday. </p>
<p>The fund, administered by lawyer Kenneth Feinberg, doesn''t
cap BP''s liability for cleanup costs and economic damage, Obama
said in June, and it doesn''t supersede the rights of individuals
or states to sue the company. </p>

<p>New Suits </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Is Sued by Technicians for Overtime </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was sued by five computer-network
technicians who claim the bank denied them overtime pay for
their work as contractors. </p>
<p>The lawsuit seeks class-action status and unspecified
damages, Goldman Sachs said yesterday in a filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. The plaintiffs contend they
deserve overtime pay for working more than 40 hours a week. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s conduct was willful and in bad faith,
according to the technicians, who say the bank never paid them
overtime for work weeks that topped 70 hours. More than 100
employees in New York and New Jersey were underpaid as a result,
according to the lawsuit filed in May. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, based in New York, disputed the allegations
in a July 16 filing, saying the technicians weren''t
employees as defined by the states'' labor laws. About 25
percent of Goldman Sachs''s staff works on technology, Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar said earlier this year. </p>
<p>The case is Bardouille v. Goldman, Sachs  Co., 10cv4285,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<p>BP Accused of Air Pollution at Texas City Refinery </p>
<p>A BP Plc unit allowed the emission of about 500,000 pounds
of air pollutants in violation of Texas environmental laws,
state Attorney General Greg Abbott alleged in a lawsuit. </p>
<p>BP admitted to the release of air contaminants to the
atmosphere at its Texas City refinery after an April 6 fire on
part of a ultracracking unit, according to the complaint filed
yesterday in Austin, Texas. BP restarted the ultracracker and
another unit before repairing a compressor, sending benzene and
other pollutants into the air for about a month, the state said. </p>
<p>BP decided to continue those units so as not to reduce
productivity, the state said in the complaint. BP made very
little attempt to minimize the emission of air contaminants
caused by its actions, once again prioritizing profits over
environmental compliance. </p>
<p>The state also has a pending action over a release of
contaminants related to a 2005 explosion at the Texas City
refinery, Abbott said in a statement yesterday. That blast
killed 15 workers and led to a $50 million fine by the U.S. for
a violation of the federal Clean Water Act. </p>
<p>BP will continue to cooperate with the attorney general''s
office and the Texas environmental quality agency to resolve
their concerns, Scott Dean, a BP spokesman, said in an e-
mailed statement. The company declined further comment on the
litigation, he said. </p>
<p>The Texas lawsuit is State of Texas v. BP Products North
America Inc., District Court, Travis County, Texas. The class
action is Fontenot v. BP Products North America Inc., 3:10-cv-
295, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Texas
(Galveston). </p>
<p>BP Sued Over Gulf Oil Cleanup Chemicals, Sunday Telegraph Says </p>
<p>BP Plc has been sued for the first time over alleged
environmental and health problems caused by chemicals used in
the Gulf of Mexico cleanup, the Sunday Telegraph reported. </p>
<p>BP, based in London, sprayed 1.8 million gallons of Corexit
dispersant into the sea to break up the oil from the spill, the
newspaper reported Aug. 8. Two Gulf Coast residents, Glynis
Wright and Janille Turner, have filed a class action in Alabama,
alleging that the chemical is four times more toxic than sweet
crude oil, the newspaper said. </p>
<p>The suit is also against Nalco Holding Co., Corexit''s
manufacturer, the Telegraph said. </p>
<p>Robert Wine, a BP spokesman, declined to comment on the
lawsuit when reached by e-mail. He said the type of dispersants
used and the method employed were approved by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency. </p>

<p>Legal Reviews </p>
<p>Cuomo Subpoenas Citigroup, JPMorgan in Health Probe </p>
<p>New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo expanded his health-
care credit card probe, which has included subpoenas to JPMorgan
Chase  Co.''s Chase Health Advance, Citigroup Inc.''s Citi Health
and CareCredit, a division of General Electric Co''s GE consumer
finance unit. </p>
<p>Last week, Cuomo announced an investigation into what he
called predatory health care lending where consumers were
allegedly misled about financing terms for health-care credit
cards. </p>
<p>Our ongoing investigation has uncovered conflicts of
interest and predatory practices in the health care industry
that are hurting New Yorkers and patients across the country,
Cuomo said yesterday in a statement. Patients are being misled
into paying for services they never received by the people they
should be able to trust the most -- their doctors. </p>
<p>Cuomo said he has issued subpoenas to 14 dental and health
care clinics. The subpoenas seek marketing materials,
applications, terms of credit, and contracts. He claimed some
providers pressure consumers into using the card and are
rewarded with kickbacks in the form of rebates. </p>
<p>Citigroup spokesman Samuel Wang said in an e-mailed
statement that the bank will cooperate with Cuomo''s
investigation. Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for New York-based
JPMorgan, declined to comment. </p>

looking forward to working with Cuomo''s office. </p>
<p>Trials/Appeals </p>
<p>Farrow Says Campbell Got Huge Diamond'' From Taylor </p>
<p>Actress Mia Farrow said Naomi Campbell told her she
received a huge diamond from men sent by former Liberian
President Charles Taylor, contradicting the supermodel''s
testimony at a war-crimes tribunal last week. </p>
<p>Campbell said that in the night she had been awakened,
some men were knocking at the door and they had been sent by
Charles Taylor and had given her a huge diamond, Farrow, 65,
said yesterday during the war-crimes trial of Taylor at the
Special Court for Sierra Leone in Leidschendam, the Netherlands. </p>
<p>Campbell told the court last week that two strangers handed
her some dirty looking stones after a dinner at Nelson
Mandela''s home in South Africa in 1997. Campbell said she at
first didn''t know the stones were diamonds or who had given them
to her. Farrow said she hadn''t been shown any stones. </p>
<p>Taylor, who is on trial for crimes against humanity during
the Sierra Leone civil war, has been accused by Chief Prosecutor
Brenda Hollis of giving the British model a diamond after the
Mandela dinner. Conflict diamonds, also known as blood diamonds,
have been used to fund wars throughout Africa. </p>
<p>Taylor last year denied providing weapons to fighters in
the Revolutionary United Front, a Sierra Leone rebel movement,
in exchange for diamonds. The testimonies of Farrow and Carole
White, Campbell''s former agent, on the gift to the supermodel
may refute Taylor''s claim he never possessed rough diamonds. </p>
<p>Ken Macdonald, a lawyer for Campbell, didn''t immediately
respond to e-mails seeking comment on yesterday''s testimonies. </p>
<p>Taylor has pleaded innocent to 11 counts including
enlisting child soldiers, murder and sexual slavery during the
1991-2002 civil war in Sierra Leone. As many as 250,000 people
were killed in the conflict. </p>

<p>Dutch Prosecution Says Trafigura Fine Is Too Low </p>
<p>The Dutch public prosecutor''s service appealed a ruling by
an Amsterdam district court against Trafigura Beheer BV for
shipping harmful waste to Ivory Coast, saying the fine of 1
million euros ($1.3 million) was too low. </p>
<p>The prosecution can also prove that the closely held
commodities trader committed fraud, Esther Schreur, spokeswoman
for the Dutch National Fraud Prosecutor said, confirming an
earlier report by the newspaper De Volkskrant. </p>
<p>We vigorously deny all charges, including fraud, said
Margaret van Kempen, an outside spokeswoman for Trafigura.
Trafigura has also appealed the ruling, she said. Ron van
Leeuwen, spokesman for the Amsterdam Appeals Court, said he
couldn''t yet confirm or deny the appeals. </p>
<p>Waste from a ship hired by Trafigura four years ago was
given to a local company, Compagnie Tommy, and was dumped near
Ivory Coast''s commercial capital, Abidjan. Residents claimed the
pollution caused deaths and widespread illness. </p>

<p>Verdicts/Settlements </p>
<p>AstraZeneca Settles Two-Thirds of Seroquel Lawsuits </p>
<p>AstraZeneca Plc will pay about $198 million to settle
17,500 lawsuits, or about two-thirds of the total cases alleging
its antipsychotic drug Seroquel causes diabetes in some users. </p>
<p>The settlements resulted from court-ordered mediation, the
London-based drugmaker said in a statement yesterday.
AstraZeneca previously agreed to pay at least $55 million to
resolve more than 5,500 cases alleging the company knew Seroquel
could cause diabetes and failed to adequately warn patients,
people familiar with those settlements said. These earlier
agreements are part of the 17,500 settlements, the company said. </p>
<p>AstraZeneca, the U.K.''s second-biggest drugmaker, is closer
to wiping out the 26,000 total Seroquel cases and at a lower
cost than expected, analysts said. Average payments are $10,000
to $11,000 for former Seroquel users, according to previous
announcements and people familiar with earlier accords. The
settlements are probably lower than the worse-case estimate,
according to Jeremy Batstone-Carr, an analyst at Charles Stanley
 Co Ltd. </p>
<p>While the terms remain confidential and are subject to
non-monetary agreements, we believe it was in the best interest
of the company to explore resolving these cases through the
mediation process, Tony Jewell, AstraZeneca''s spokesman, said
in an e-mailed statement. We remain committed to a strong
defense effort, but will also continue to participate in good
faith in court-ordered mediation. </p>
<p>Lawyers for the company and former Seroquel users met last
week with Stephen Saltzburg, a George Washington University Law
School professor who is the mediator in the case, the people
familiar said. Saltzburg said in a February court filing that
AstraZeneca faces as many as 26,000 suits over Seroquel and a
global settlement wasn''t likely. </p>
<p>Company officials said earlier this month that lawyers for
other former Seroquel users are scheduled to meet Saltzburg to
see if their claims can be resolved. </p>
<p>Ken Bailey, a Houston-based lawyer representing former
Seroquel users who hasn''t settled his cases, said he was
encouraged that AstraZeneca was willing to talk about resolving
patients'' claims. </p>
<p>Former Seroquel users contend research has shown patients
have developed diabetes while on the drug and AstraZeneca''s own
researchers acknowledged the link in internal documents. </p>
<p>The consolidated Seroquel case is In re Seroquel Products
Litigation, 06-MD-01769, U.S. District Court, Middle District of
Florida (Orlando). </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley was accused of taking
a profit for itself and failing to sell notes when it should
have in a lawsuit filed by nuns, a veterinary fund and 85 other
Irish investors. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley and Saturns Investments Europe Plc, a
special-purpose vehicle set up by the New York-based bank,
deliberately or carelessly failed to redeem the notes when
they were downgraded to junk in January 2009, according to a
statement by Stewarts Law LLP, the lawyers for the investors. </p>
<p>The bank and Saturns waited until June 2009, after the
price of underlying bonds had risen significantly, to redeem the
notes, thereby securing Morgan Stanley a profit of at least
$11.2 million on the sale of the notes by way of a termination
payment, the lawyers said. The notes were sold to a related
Morgan Stanley entity at a profit, they said. </p>
<p>The Sisters of Charity of Jesus and Mary, the Holy Faith
Sisters, the Irish Veterinary Benevolent Fund and other
individual investors bought 5.88 million euros ($7.6 million) of
the notes through the stockbroker Bloxham in 2005 and 2006. The
investors filed the suit on Aug. 10 in London, according to
Stewarts Law. They are seeking damages of more than 15 million

<p>Pfizer Inc., the world''s largest

<p>New York-based Pfizer contends Actavis has applied to the

<p>General Motors Co., the automaker 61
percent owned by the U.S., is seeking to raise $12 billion to
$16 billion in an initial public offering, said a person
familiar with the plan. </p>
<p>The more than 500-page document, called an S-1, is likely
to be filed tomorrow, though it may not happen until Monday,
said the person, who asked not to be named because the
discussions are private. The exact value of the offering may not
be fully detailed in the registration statement filed with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said the person. </p>
<p>The IPO would be the second-largest in U.S. history, behind
Visa Inc.''s $19.7 billion initial offering in March 2008. The
share sale is also the first step in freeing the Detroit-based
automaker from government ownership, which Chief Executive
Officer Ed Whitacre has pushed for after GM''s $50 billion
taxpayer bailout in the wake of its bankruptcy in June 2009. </p>
<p>After the restructuring, I expect GM to once again be a
leading company on the U.S. stock market, said Kim Yong Tae,
who helps manage $2.9 billion equivalent of assets at Yurie
Asset Management Co. in Seoul. The U.S. government has shown a
strong will to revive GM. It''s a stock I want to add to my
portfolio. </p>
<p>Whitacre will be succeeded as CEO by director Dan Akerson
on Sept. 1 and as chairman at the end of the year, GM said
today. </p>
<p>Credit Line </p>
<p>GM has obtained a $5 billion revolving line of credit from
a group of at least 15 banks as of last night New York time,
said the person. More than half are named in the draft of the
document as underwriters, including Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan
Chase  Co., Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Credit
Suisse Group AG. </p>
<p>Selim Bingol, a GM spokesman, declined to comment on
details of the IPO. </p>
<p>We will do an IPO when conditions are right for the
company and in the markets, he said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>GM today reported second-quarter net income of
$1.54 billion on higher sales in the U.S. and China. Earnings
before interest and taxes climbed to $2.03 billion from $1.82 in
the first three months of the year, the company said in a
statement. Revenue rose 44 percent from a year ago to $33.2
billion. </p>
<p>The company reported $1.07 billion in first-quarter profit
in May, compared with a $5.98 billion loss a year earlier. </p>
<p>Most of the shares offered would come from the U.S.
Treasury, the person said. The aim is to sell a fifth of the
government''s 304 million shares, two people familiar with the
plan said in June. That would reduce the Treasury''s holdings to
less than 50 percent. </p>
<p>New Shares </p>
<p>The automaker may sell a small number of new shares, the
person familiar with the plans said yesterday. The Canadian
government, the United Auto Workers union''s retiree medical
trust and the estate of the bankrupt predecessor General Motors
Corp. haven''t decided whether to participate in the IPO, the
person said. </p>
<p>The document will describe the old GM, its restructuring in
bankruptcy and liabilities facing the new company, the person
said. </p>
<p>GM reported its second quarter profit today, and industry
analysts are looking for strong results to set the stage for the
IPO even as consumer confidence wanes. </p>
<p>GM needs to be very careful about when to conduct the
IPO, said Yuuki Sakurai, chief executive officer of Fukoku
Capital Management in Tokyo. Can they convince investors to
buy shares when spending is dropping in the U.S. and they don''t
have leading-edge environmental technology? </p>
<p>Chevrolet Volt </p>
<p>The largest U.S. automaker will introduce its Chevrolet
Volt electric-drive car later this year. The vehicle will
compete with models including Nissan Motor Co.''s Leaf electric
car and a planned plug-in version of Toyota Motor Corp.''s Prius
hybrid. </p>
<p>General Motors Corp. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection on June 1, 2009, after posting $88 billion of losses
since 2004, the last year the company reported an annual profit.
General Motors Co. emerged 39 days later. </p>
<p>Executives responded today to investor concerns about when
the company will break even in its European business, which lost
$666 million before interest and taxes in the first half, and
who will succeed Whitacre. </p>
<p>Confidence in Europe </p>
<p>The automaker expects to break even in Europe next year,
Chris Liddell, chief financial officer, said during an interview
on Bloomberg Television''s In the Loop. </p>
<p>We still have confidence that we can achieve, let''s say,
break-even in Europe by next year and then profitability
thereafterwards, he said. We''re closing a plant. We''re
looking at changes in employee relationships, which will lower
our costs, and looking to really invest in the product range, as
well. That''s been very successful, that formula, here in North
America. </p>
<p>The other question is the company''s succession plan. The
company had not said who would lead GM after Whitacre, 68,
retires. Now that has been resolved. </p>
<p>Dan Akerson is one of the most exceptional executives in
the country and will serve both GM''s interests and our national
interest well, said William E. Conway Jr., a founder of the
Carlyle Group, where Akerson had been a managing director. He
has played an incredibly valuable role at Carlyle. We will miss
him. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. appointed
James P. Esposito, who worked in the debt capital markets unit,
to succeed Howard Schiller as chief operating officer of the
firm''s investment-banking division, according to an internal
memo. </p>
<p>Esposito will report to David Solomon and John S. Weinberg,
co-heads of investment banking, who reported the change in the
memo to employees. The contents of the memo were confirmed by
Michael DuVally, a spokesman at the firm. Schiller is retiring. </p>
<p>Jim will focus on increasing global connectivity and
driving best business practices across products and regions,
Solomon and Weinberg said in the memo. In addition, Jim will
oversee the activities related to the division''s key day-to-day
operations. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s investment-banking division, which includes
merger advisory and debt and equity underwriting, contributed 6
percent of the firm''s pretax earnings in the first half of 2010,
compared with 5 percent in the same period last year.
Esposito had been global head of the teams that help raise debt
financing for investment-grade borrowers, the public sector and
infrastructure projects. </p>
<p>Jonathan Fine, managing director on the U.S. investment-
grade syndicate desk, will become head of the desk, DuVally
said. Fine was promoted to managing director in 2007. </p>
<p>Esposito, who joined Goldman Sachs in 1995 in emerging-
markets sales, will continue to serve the financing needs of
some large global clients, the memo said. He became a managing
director in 2002 and a partner in 2006. </p>
<p>Dow Jones Newswires reported Esposito''s new role and Fine''s
promotion earlier today. </p>

<p>General Motors Co., 61 percent owned
by the U.S. government, reported second-quarter net income of
$1.54 billion on increased vehicle sales and production as the
Detroit automaker prepares for an initial public offering. </p>
<p>Profit rose 44 percent from $1.07 billion in the first
three months of the year. Revenue increased 44 percent from a
year ago to $33.2 billion on growing sales of the Buick Excelle
in China and Chevrolet Equinox in the U.S., the company said
today in a statement. Operations in Europe will continue to
improve, the company said. </p>
<p>Showing profit growth is part of Chief Executive Officer Ed Whitacre''s march toward selling shares in the nation''s largest
automaker after emerging from bankruptcy reorganization in July
2009. GM is seeking to raise $12 billion to $16 billion in the
offering, which would make it the second-largest in U.S.
history, said a person familiar with the plan. </p>
<p>They continue to head in the right direction, even if the
pace is plodding, said Rebecca Lindland, an analyst at IHS
Automotive in Lexington, Massachusetts. At least they are
tracking as expected. </p>
<p>The automaker''s European operations continued to weigh on
GM''s overall results with a $160 million loss. The unit lost
$506 million in the first quarter. GM reported a $123 million
gain on the sale of Saab to Spyker Cars NV. </p>
<p>There''s no doubt it''s tougher in Europe, said Joe Phillippi, principal of AutoTrends Inc., a consulting firm in
Short Hills, New Jersey. GM is just going to have to be even
tougher. </p>
<p>Europe Next Year </p>
<p>The automaker is confident it can break even in Europe
next year, Chris Liddell, GM''s chief financial officer, said
during an interview on Bloomberg Television''s In the Loop. </p>
<p>We still have confidence that we can achieve, let''s say,
break-even in Europe by next year and then profitability
thereafterwards, he said. We''re closing a plant. We''re
looking at changes in employee relationships which will lower
our costs and looking to really invest in the product range, as
well. That''s been very successful, that formula, here in North
America. </p>
<p>GM''s North America operations had profits before interest
and taxes of $1.59 billion, a 31 percent increase from the first
quarter''s $1.2 billion. The company''s international operations
declined 44 percent to $672 million. </p>
<p>GM''s sales in the U.S. rose 12 percent to 601,700 cars and
trucks during the second quarter from 535,400 a year earlier,
according to researcher Autodata Corp. The company increased its
U.S. customer discounts in the second quarter by an average of
7 percent per vehicle to $3,624, according to Autodata. </p>
<p>Increasing Output </p>
<p>GM said it built 731,000 vehicles in North America, an
85 percent increase from the same months last year. </p>
<p>GM''s revenue and profit gains in the second quarter were
driven by an increase in output and higher productivity in its
plants. </p>
<p>Last year GM was shutting down plants when they filed
Chapter 11, said Wall, who is based in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
This summer, most of its U.S. plants were running full out. </p>
<p>Models such as the Chevrolet Equinox, GMC Terrain and
Cadillac SRX are selling well and with higher profit margins
because GM lowered its costs in bankruptcy, Wall said. </p>
<p>GM said it generated $3.85 billion in cash from operations,
up from $1.7 billion in the first quarter. GM ended June with
$32.5 billion in cash and marketable securities, including funds
in a Canadian medical trust escrow. </p>
<p>Growth in China </p>
<p>Through the first half of the year, GM''s China sales,
including those of its joint ventures, rose 49 percent to
1.2 million vehicles compared with last year, according to the
automaker. That exceeded the 1.1 million cars and trucks GM sold
in the U.S. in the year''s first half. </p>
<p>Chevrolet brand sales more than doubled in the first half in
China, driven by strong sales of the Cruze small car. Buick
sales rose 29 percent, according to J.D. Power  Associates. GM
is the No. 2 seller in China, behind Germany''s Volkswagen,
according to J.D. Power. </p>
<p>GM went through a rough time last year, but they never
backed away from China, said Tim Dunne, an analyst with J.D.
Power. China provides the bulk of their revenue and profits
from Asia. </p>
<p>During the second quarter, GM finished repaying
$8.4 billion in U.S. and Canadian loans assumed as it emerged
from bankruptcy. </p>
<p>Eager for IPO </p>
<p>Whitacre has said he is eager for the U.S. government to
sell its 61 percent share of the automaker. </p>
<p>We don''t like this label of Government Motors, he said
last week. </p>
<p>A more than 500-page document, called an S-1, is likely to
be filed tomorrow, though it may not happen until Monday, said
the person familiar with the plans. The exact value of the
offering may not be fully detailed in the filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, said the person, who asked
not to be named because the discussions are private. </p>
<p>GM has obtained as much as $5 billion in a revolving line
of credit from a group of at least 15 banks as of last night New
York time, said the person. More than half are named in the
draft of the document as underwriters, including Morgan Stanley,
JPMorgan Chase  Co., Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and
Credit Suisse Group AG. </p>
<p>Selim Bingol, a GM spokesman, declined to comment on
details of the IPO. </p>
<p>The IPO would include a fifth of the U.S.''s shares, people
familiar with the plan have said, which would bring the
Treasury''s stake below 50 percent. </p>
<p>Time is Now </p>
<p>You''ve got to get the money when the market is giving
it, Shelly Lombard, debt analyst with New York-based Gimme
Credit, said in a telephone interview before the release. Now
is the time for GM to do an IPO. </p>
<p>The UAW retiree medical fund now holds 17.5 percent of GM,
the Canadian government has 11.7 percent and debtors are left
with 10 percent. </p>
<p>GM''s announcement this week that its board had changed the
rules of minimum ownership to call a special meeting to
25 percent from 15 percent was likely taken in preparation for
an IPO, said Logan Robinson, a distinguished visiting law
professor at the University of Detroit Mercy. </p>
<p>You want to get your takeover defense in place before you
go public, said Robinson, a former general counsel at Delphi
Corp., where he worked on the auto supplier''s IPO and spinoff
from GM. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp., the world''s largest
software company, is seeking a patent on a system that would
allow gestures to be used to input data to a computer. </p>
<p>According to application 20100199228, which was published
in the database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Aug. 5,
the system includes a camera that captures gesture, and a
gesture recognizer engine to identify the significance of
the gesture. </p>
<p>The system can read American Sign Language gestures, which
is a manual language used by the deaf in the U.S., according to
the application. It can be used with a prop such as a
conductor''s baton or a tennis racket. </p>
<p>In addition to being used to generate words, gestures can
be used to indicate emotions or to control game activities,
according to the patent. </p>
<p>Microsoft applied for the patent in February 2009 with the

<p>Interpump Group Unit Sued Over Patent by Colorado Competitor </p>
<p>A unit of Italy''s Interpump Group SpA was sued for patent
infringement by a Colorado competitor. </p>
<p>The complaint, filed Aug. 4 in federal court in Beaumont,
Texas, accuses Interpump''s NLB Corp. of infringing two patents
for high-pressure nozzles for waterjet tools held by StoneAge
Inc. of Durango, Colorado. The tools are used to clean sewer
pipes and to bore through stone. </p>
<p>According to court papers, NLB is a former StoneAge
customer now making its own products that infringe the patents.
StoneAge claims NLB''s Typhoon 10 nozzles use the patented
technology and design. </p>
<p>In dispute are patents 7,635,096 and D617,870, which were
issued in December 2009 and June 2010, respectively. They cover
StoneAge''s Banshee line of products, the company said in its
court filings. </p>
<p>StoneAge complained that NLB''s infringing products were
shown at a trade show in Louisville, Kentucky, in February, and
that NLB''s sales representatives are contacting StoneAge''s
European customers, offering the allegedly infringing Typhoon
devices. </p>
<p>The company claims it has lost sales it would have made
but for NLB''s infringement and that it will continue to
suffer irreparable harm if NLB continues to make and sell
infringing products. </p>
<p>StoneAge asked the court for money damages, no less than
a reasonable royalty, and for an award of profits NLB gained
from its allegedly infringing products. The company also asked
for awards of attorney fees and litigation costs and a court
order barring NLB from future infringement of the patents. </p>
<p>BLP didn''t respond immediately to an e-mailed request for
comment. </p>
<p>The company is represented by Brian A. Carpenter, Eric W.
Buether and Christopher M. Joe of Buether Joe  Carpenter LLC of

<p>Pfizer Sues Iceland''s Actavis Over Lipitor Patent </p>
<p>Pfizer Inc., the world''s largest drug company, sued
Iceland''s Actavis Group hf asking a judge to block sales of a
generic version of the cholesterol drug Lipitor until its patent
5,969,156 expires in 2017. </p>
<p>New York-based Pfizer contends Actavis has applied to the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration to make copies of the drug in
violation of the 1999 patent, according to a complaint filed
yesterday in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware. </p>

<p>UBS Sued for Copying Oil Reports in Investor Research </p>
<p>UBS AG''s U.K. unit was sued for allegedly copying articles
from oil and gas publications and reprinting them in the
investment research it distributed to clients. </p>
<p>Energy Intelligence Group Inc., based in New York, said its
publications, which include International Oil Daily, World Gas
Intelligence and Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, were copied by
UBS Ltd. at least 10 times during 2006 and 2007, according to
the lawsuit. </p>
<p>Articles from Energy Intelligence or portions of them were
reprinted in UBS''s own investment research publication, Daily
Oil News, according to the suit filed in a London court last
month and made public this week. </p>
<p>Last month in a similar scenario, Deutsche Bank AG research
analyst Pankaj Jha left after the bank told clients one of his
reports contained significant similarities to an article
from Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. </p>
<p>In the UBS case, analyst Jon Rigby had a single-user
subscription for the Energy Intelligence publications beginning
as long as 10 years ago, according to the suit. Rigby, based in
London, is the global coordinator of the bank''s Daily Oil News
publication, which is distributed in at least 17 countries
including the U.S., U.K., Germany, Russia and China, Energy
Intelligence said. </p>
<p>UBS, based in Zurich, has been copying the publications
in a systematic manner over a long period of time for the
purposes of enhancing its profile and reputation amongst its
customers and potential customers, according to the complaint.
The defendant threatens and intends to repeat the acts of
infringement. </p>
<p>UBS spokesman Dominik von Arx declined to comment. </p>
<p>The publisher''s suit seeks unspecified damages from UBS for
copyright infringement and an injunction to stop UBS and its
employees from copying the articles. </p>
<p>The acts of the defendant were carried out flagrantly and
in the belief that the benefit to be so gained far exceeded the
damages at risk, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>Energy Intelligence charges subscribers an additional fee
to reproduce an article from one of its publications, according
to the lawsuit. The publisher said it was unable to determine
how many times UBS copied stories or the full extent to
which they were distributed. </p>
<p>The bank showed cynical disregard by printing its own
copyright prohibiting the redistribution of the material on each
publication of Daily Oil News, according to Energy Intelligence. </p>
<p>In the U.S., the Copyright Clearance Center in Danvers,
Massachusetts, licenses a wide range of written content for
business and other purposes. These licenses can include works
from academic and other specialty publishers. </p>

<p>Viacom Appeals YouTube Copyright-Infringement Ruling </p>
<p>Viacom Inc., the owner of MTV Networks and Paramount

sharing website didn''t infringe Viacom copyrights. </p>
<p>Viacom appealed the June decision to the U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in New York, according to a filing yesterday in
federal court in Manhattan. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Louis Stanton ruled that YouTube hadn''t
infringed Viacom''s copyrights because it''s protected by the
safe-harbor provision of the federal Digital Millennium
Copyright Act. The law states a service provider isn''t liable if
it removes infringing material when notified by the copyright
owner. </p>

<p>RadioShack Sues Former Iowa Licensee for Trademark Infringement </p>
<p>RadioShack Corp., a chain of consumer electronic stores
based in Fort Worth, Texas, sued a former licensee for trademark
infringement. </p>
<p>Somebody Cares Inc. of Fairfield, Iowa, is accused of
infringing RadioShack marks by continuing to operate a store
under the RadioShack designation one year after the license
agreement was terminated. </p>
<p>According to the complaint filed Aug. 10 in federal court
in Iowa, Somebody Cares had a license from RadioShack from
August 2000 to August 2009. RadioShack said it warned Somebody
Cares to quit using the marks in October 2009. </p>
<p>The letter to Somebody Cares, which is included in the
court filing, mentions that Somebody Cares was also offering its
franchise for sale on the Craigslist website, which is not
possible, as you do not have a franchise. </p>
<p>RadioShack said the public is likely to be confused by
Somebody Care''s actions, and that its business, reputation and
goodwill are damaged. The Texas company asked the court to order
Somebody Cares to stop the alleged infringement, and the
destruction, at Somebody Cares'' expense, of all offending signs
and other promotional material. </p>
<p>Additionally, the company asked for money damages, and
requested that they be tripled. RadioShack also requested awards
of litigation costs and attorney fees. </p>

Zarley Law Firm Plc of Des Moines, Iowa. </p>

<p>Mile High Festival Promoters Seek Permission to Seize Fake Goods </p>
<p>Promoters for Colorado''s Mile High Music Festival filed a
preemptive trademark infringement suit against vendors who would
sell unauthorized merchandise in the festival''s vicinity. </p>
<p>The suit, filed Aug. 9 in federal court in Denver, accused
100 unidentified female defendants, 100 unidentified male
defendants and one unidentified company of selling counterfeit
T-shirts and other merchandise. These sales will damage the
authorized seller and confuse the public, according to the
complaint. </p>
<p>The plaintiff is AEG Life - Rocky Mountains LLC of Denver,
which promotes the festival and sells festival merchandise. The
festival, which opens Aug. 13 at a park north of Denver, drew
more than 90,000 attendees in 2009, its second year of
existence, and AEG Life says it derived substantial income
from the sale of authorized festival merchandise. </p>
<p>It asked the court for an order barring infringement of its
marks and for authorization for law enforcement officials and
agents of AEG to seize and deliver for destruction all
unauthorized merchandise sold in the vicinity of the arena. </p>
<p>AEG also asked for money damages, attorney fees and
litigation costs. </p>
<p>The festival promoter is represented by Cara R. Burns of
Hicks, Mims, Kaplan  Burns of Santa Monica, California. </p>
<p>The firm represents many entertainment figures and events
with reference to licensed merchandise, including Aerosmith,
Toni Braxton, Coca-Cola Co, Walt Disney Co., Hard Rock Cafe,
Glenn Danzig, Don Henley, H.R. Giger, INXS, Judy Garland, Korn,
Lollapolloza, Mattel, Metallica, Morrissey, Nirvana, Paul Simon,
The Eagles, Thomas the Tank, Warner Bros., and Dwight Yocum
according to the Hicks, Mims website. </p>
<p>The case is AEG Live - Rocky Mountains LLC, v. John Does,
1:10-cv-01896-WYD, U.S. District Court, District of Colorado
(Denver). </p>
<p>Trafficker in Fake Trojan Condoms Gets 37 Months in Prison </p>
<p>A U.S. immigrant from China was sentenced to 37 months in
prison for trafficking in more than a million counterfeit Church
 Dwight Co. Trojan condoms. </p>
<p>Jian Jimmy Wang was sentenced yesterday by U.S.
District Judge Brian Cogan in Brooklyn, New York. </p>
<p>Condoms tested from the same batch as Wang''s were found to
burst, leak and lack spermicide, prosecutors said. The brands
seized were Trojan Magnum, Trojan-ENZ, Trojan Ultra Ribbed and
Trojan Mint Tingle, according to court papers. </p>
<p>Wang is also accused of trademark infringement in an
ongoing civil case brought by Church  Dwight in the same court.
Wang is one of more than 40 defendants accused of distributing
fake Trojan condoms in the area comprising the federal judicial
district known as the Eastern District of New York and in
Manhattan. </p>
<p>According to court papers in the civil case, the
counterfeit condoms were sometimes packaged two to a box rather
than three, were the wrong size and the lubricated condoms were
packed with a silicon lubricant Church  Dwight doesn''t use. </p>
<p>The U.K.''s Times reported in November that the making of
fake condoms was rampant in China and that just one workshop
in central Hunan province turned out 2.19 million condoms
produced in unsanitary settings. </p>
<p>The civil case is Church  Dwight Inc. v. Kaloti
Enterprises of Michigan LLC, 1:07-cv-00612-BMC-VVP, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). </p>

<p>Chevron Corp., ConocoPhillips,
Mubadala Development Co. and TX Oil Limited, chaired by Neil Bush, brother of former U.S. President George W. Bush, may gain
rights to explore in Turkmenistan''s Caspian Sea blocks. </p>
<p>Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov told the
government to make a choice on bids from those companies for
blocks 9 and 20 in the Caspian, according to the government''s
website. </p>
<p>Turkmenistan allows international investors the ability to
gain equity in offshore exploration while limiting onshore
access to its state oil and gas companies. The bulk of
Turkmenistan''s known resources, including the world''s fourth-
largest reserves of natural gas according to BP Plc data, are in
onshore fields in the country''s east. </p>
<p>Majors are more interested in bigger gas plays onshore,
but may believe that a presence offshore would help them achieve
this ultimate objective, Ed Chow, a senior fellow at the
Center for Strategic International Studies, said by e-mail
today. </p>
<p>ConocoPhillips and Abu Dhabi-backed Mubadala have a venture
to explore a block in the Kazakh sector of the Caspian together.
In April, the two companies had a plan to team up in accessing
Turkmen offshore areas, a person familiar with the strategy said
at the time. </p>
<p>TX Oil was formed this year to develop opportunities in
Turkmenistan. Neil Bush visited the country in February with a
letter to his father, President George H.W. Bush, to the Turkmen
president, according to the website Turkmenistan.ru. Bush again
visited the Turkmen president in June, according to the website. </p>
<p>E-mails to Chevron asking for confirmation of the bid
weren''t immediately returned. TX Oil didn''t immediately return
calls. ConocoPhillips didn''t respond to a request for comment. </p>

<p>Google Inc., Coca-Cola Co. and Walt
Disney Co. are among the favorite holdings of Morris Mark,
president of Mark Asset Management Corp., Barron''s reported. </p>
<p>Google, the owner of the world''s most popular search
engine, and Coca-Cola, the world''s largest soft-drink maker, are
underpriced because the market is overlooking that you can buy
quality today at no premium, the New York-based asset manager,
who oversees about $500 million, told Barron''s in its Aug. 16
edition. </p>
<p>Google''s management is constantly improving its product
and is constantly out there being willing to develop something
internally or buy something externally to really make Google a
better product, Mark told Barron''s. Buying YouTube Inc. in
2006 will pay off a big way because almost every television
sold will allow access to web video starting next year, he said. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola earnings growth will accelerate because it has a
global brand and a presence in emerging markets such as China,
he said. Disney, the world''s biggest media company, should have
a higher valuation than it already does compared with rivals
Time Warner Inc. and Viacom Inc., he said. Disney''s Marvel and
Pixar studios are strengthening and its ESPN sports channel has
strong audience demographics that allow it to charge more
for advertising, he said. </p>
<p>Google, based in Mountain View, California, is down 22
percent this year, compared with a 2.2 percent drop for Atlanta-
based Coca-Cola and 4.4 percent advance for Disney in Burbank,
California. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp., the second-largest
U.S. oil company, announced another natural-gas discovery in the
Carnarvon Basin off Australia''s western coast. </p>
<p>The Acme-1 well encountered about 896 feet (273 meters) of
net gas pay, San Ramon, California-based Chevron said today in a
statement. The well was drilled to a depth of 15,469 feet in
2,880 feet of water. </p>
<p>The discovery is the company''s ninth and biggest off the
coast of western Australia in the past 12 months, Vice Chairman
George Kirkland said in the statement. Chevron announced Aug. 12
that its Brederode-1 exploration well in the Carnarvon Basin
found 49 feet of net gas pay. </p>
<p>The company is operator of the WA-205-P permit area, which
includes the Acme-1 well, and has a 67 percent stake in the
prospect. A unit of Europe''s Royal Dutch Shell Plc owns the
rest. </p>
<p>Chevron Chief Executive Officer John Watson is looking to
increase oil and gas production with projects in places such as
the Gulf of Mexico and Australia. The company has said its
proposed Wheatstone and Gorgon liquefied-natural-gas ventures
are centerpieces of its global growth plans. </p>
<p>The latest find is expected to help underpin possible

<p>Scherzer was part of the Citigroup team that advised AIG

<p>Global crude oil demand may have
exceeded supply in the past two months as inventories stored on
tankers fell to an 18-month low, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. </p>
<p>Now that floating storage has dropped to its lowest
levels in over 18 months, we expect to experience declining
onshore inventories in coming months, Goldman Sachs analysts
including David Greely and Stefan Wieler said in a report today.
Given that world demand tends to increase seasonally in the
second half, we would expect the draw on world inventories to
accelerate. </p>
<p>Oil held on ships may have dropped by as much as 40 million
to 45 million barrels in June and July, in part due to the
clearing of a large portion of Iranian floating storage,
Goldman said. </p>
<p>The June-July discharge of floating storage suggests that
the draw at sea has more than offset the build on shore, which
the International Energy Agency estimates at 21 million
barrels, Goldman analysts said. </p>
<p>World oil demand exceeded supply by 600,000 barrels a day,
or 36.9 million barrels more than normal in June and July, based
on the IEA estimate of a 13.3 million barrels draw on combined
onshore OECD inventories and global floating storage, Goldman
said in the report. </p>
<p>West Texas Intermediate crude time spreads, the difference
between monthly futures contracts, have strengthened, suggesting
a tighter physical oil market, Goldman said. </p>
<p>Goldman said that the time spread from the first to the
60th month gained as much as $10 a barrel to trade at about
minus $8 to minus $10. </p>
<p>We continue to expect the WTI forward curve to flatten in
the second half, lifting prompt WTI prices into the $85-$95 a
barrel range, Goldman said. </p>
<p>The company reiterated its recommendation to buy December
WTI crude futures, which traded up 44 cents to $77.38 a barrel
at 11:49 a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. </p>

<p>Commodities demand from emerging
markets and limited growth in supplies will help to support
prices toward the end of the year, according to Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., which backed oil, gold, copper, zinc and platinum. </p>
<p>The bank reiterated an overweight recommendation on
commodities, analysts led by Allison Nathan and Jeffrey Currie
wrote in a report. Goldman pared its 12-month forecast for the
SP GSCI Enhanced Total Returns Index to a 19 percent gain from
21.6 after recent gains in agricultural commodities and metals. </p>
<p>Commodities last week had the worst weekly performance in
six after the Federal Reserve said the recovery is weakening and
European industrial output fell, stoking concern that there may
be a double-dip recession. Reports also showed China''s retail
sales and new lending grew in July at a slower pace than June. </p>
<p>We are not overly optimistic about commodities prices in
the second half, Ni Xiaolei, a trader at Donghai Futures Co.,
said from Jiangsu today. We saw a very sharp ascent in
commodity prices last month,  which will be hard to sustain as
global macroeconomic data emerges weaker than expected.'''' </p>
<p>Goldman''s commodity overweight'''' call was maintained even
as the bank has been paring forecasts for U.S. and Japanese
economic growth for next year. Ed McKelvey, Goldman''s senior U.S.
economist in New York, has also said that the chance the U.S.
may tumble back into recession is as high as 30 percent. </p>
<p>Gold, Crude </p>
<p>Gold, which surged to a record $1,265.30 an ounce in June
amid concern sovereign-debt levels in Europe may be excessive,
traded at $1,29.60 at 2:11 p.m. in Singapore, 11 percent higher
this year. Goldman forecast a rise to $1,260 in three months and
to $1,300 in six. New York crude futures were at $75.86 a barrel,
4.4 percent lower over 2010. Goldman''s report put them at $92 a
barrel in three months. </p>
<p>The current softness in economic data, combined with
increasingly mixed signals from the underlying commodity markets,
is likely to continue to generate choppy commodity-price action
in the near term, the Goldman analysts wrote in the Aug. 13
report. Still, high and rising emerging-market demand levels
against limited supply growth in key commodities are likely to
increasingly tighten balances, they wrote. </p>
<p>Japan''s economy expanded at an annualized 0.4 percent in
the three months to June 30, the Cabinet Office said today.
That''s the slowest pace in three quarters. U.S. industrial
production figures are due for release tomorrow, the same day as
data on investor confidence in Germany. </p>
<p>Chinese Demand </p>
<p>Commodity prices may advance into the end of the year on
evidence of increased oil demand in China, a decline in crude
stockpiles in Europe and the U.S., and further falls in metals
inventories, the report said. </p>
<p>We expect upside to be greatest for crude oil, copper,
zinc, platinum and gold, it said. Improved data will likely
be required to sustain rising prices. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs last week backed gold to resume a rally and
climb to a record $1,300 an ounce within six months on renewed
investor interest. The precious metal, which has risen for nine
years to last year, may also climb in 2011, the report said. </p>
<p>A ban on wheat exports by Russia helped to drive futures to
$8.68 a bushel earlier this month, the highest price in almost
two years. The country is battling reduced grains production
amid the worst drought in at least 50 years. </p>
<p>Sharp Gains'' </p>
<p>Commodity returns rose over the past month led by sharp
gains in the agricultural complex owing to weather-related
supply shocks in wheat, according to the Goldman report. </p>
<p>Zinc, trading today at $2,080 a metric ton, has fallen 19
percent this year, making it the worst performer on the London
Metal Exchange. Goldman''s analysts forecast that the metal may
climb to $2,121 a ton in six months, according to the report. </p>
<p>Copper rose 1.3 percent to $7,246.50 a metric ton, paring
this year''s loss to 1.7 percent, while platinum gained 0.8
percent to $1,535.75 an ounce, 5 percent stronger this year.
Goldman forecast copper at $7,925 a ton in six months. </p>
<p>Japan will grow 1.4 percent in 2011, compared with an
earlier forecast of 1.7 percent, Goldman''s Tokyo-based senior
economist Chiwoong Lee said in a report dated Aug. 7. The week
before that Goldman lowered its projection for U.S. growth for
the same year to 1.9 percent from 2.5 percent. </p>

<p>Wall Street banks led by JPMorgan
Chase  Co. and Morgan Stanley stand to make a combined $120
million on General Motors Co.''s initial public offering. If it
weren''t for Goldman Sachs Group Inc., they could have made four
times as much. </p>
<p>In a pitch to the U.S. Treasury in May, Goldman Sachs
offered to accept a fee of 0.75 percent, according to people
with direct knowledge of the matter. That''s a fraction of the 3
percent banks typically charge on the largest IPOs and well
below the 2 percent offered by Bank of America Corp. and other
banks that presented to Treasury, said the people, speaking
anonymously because the matter is private. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which had just been sued for fraud by
federal regulators and has ties to GM competitor Ford Motor Co.,
didn''t get a top role in the IPO. The government imposed the fee
pitched by Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn and his five-person
team on all underwriters, angering the banks, the people said. </p>
<p>The fact the other banks are furious at Goldman is not
surprising, said Samuel Hayes, a professor emeritus of
investment banking at Harvard Business School in Boston. They
feel it gave the government a real lever to force down fees on
the underwriters. But the deal still has a lot of marquee
value. </p>
<p>Subsidized Car Purchases </p>
<p>Banks involved in the deal include lead managers JPMorgan
and Morgan Stanley, as well as Bank of America and Citigroup
Inc., among others. Some banks made different concessions in
their pitches to the Treasury. Charlotte, North Carolina-based
Bank of America and Zurich-based Credit Suisse Group AG offered
to use some of their fees to buy GM vehicles or to subsidize
employee purchases of GM cars and trucks, according to the
people with knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs spokeswoman Andrea Rachman and spokespeople
for the other banks declined to comment. Treasury spokesman Mark Paustenbach also declined to comment. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs will have a role in the offering, as will
Credit Suisse, said the people. Five U.S. banks pitched GM and
the Treasury on May 19 in Washington, and non-U.S. lenders made
presentations in early June. All sent top executives, such as
JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon and John Mack,
chairman of Morgan Stanley. </p>
<p>Treasury officials including Ronald Bloom, chief of the
auto task force, and GM executives were concerned that if it
became public the government hadn''t picked Goldman Sachs''s low
bid, they would face criticism for wasting taxpayer money
because of a bias against the firm, the people said. The
officials and executives decided, in conjunction with Lazard
Ltd., which is advising Treasury, to use the Goldman Sachs bid
and impose it on other banks. </p>
<p>Probably Serious'' </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs signaled that it was willing to make a bid
for pretty much any amount, according to two people who saw the
bank''s presentation. Rivals grumbled that Goldman Sachs knew it
couldn''t win the lead on the GM offering, so it submitted a low
bid knowing that would force Treasury to squeeze whichever banks
did win the job, these people said. </p>
<p>The investment banks have always been cutthroat in their
competition, Hayes said. I don''t think they did it just to
squeeze their competitors. They were probably serious. </p>
<p>All the U.S. banks, apart from Bank of America and Bermuda-
based Lazard, have their headquarters in New York. </p>
<p>4-Cent Fee </p>
<p>In India, Goldman Sachs this year tied for the lowest bid
among 17 banks vying to manage a $1.8 billion offer by state-
owned Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd., three people with
knowledge of the matter said. Goldman Sachs and SBI Capital
Markets Ltd. said they''d do the work for a fee equal to
0.00000001 percent of the sale proceeds -- equivalent to about 2
rupees (4 cents) each on the deal. </p>
<p>At the time of the pitch, Goldman Sachs and the Securities
and Exchange Commission were at odds over allegations Goldman
Sachs had sold mortgage-related securities designed to fail. The
firm settled the suit last month for $550 million and
acknowledged it made a mistake. A June poll showed that the
firm suffered the worst reputational decline among its largest
competitors, according to a global quarterly poll of 1,001
investors and analysts who are Bloomberg subscribers. </p>
<p>GM, 61 percent owned by the government after a $50 billion
taxpayer bailout, aims to raise $12 billion to $16 billion in
the IPO and plans to file the registration statement as early as
today, according to people familiar with the situation. At that
size, the IPO would be the second-largest in the U.S. after San
Francisco-based Visa Inc.''s $19.7 billion offering in March
2008. </p>
<p>Goldman Trails </p>
<p>While the IPO is paying a quarter of the usual rate for the
largest initial offerings in the U.S., fees would equal about 16
percent of the total $728.4 million of revenue generated from
all U.S. IPOs this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which won the biggest share of fees from
underwriting U.S. IPOs in 2009, has slipped to third this year
behind Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan, the data show. The firm''s
first-half revenue from underwriting equity sales also trailed
JPMorgan and Bank of America, according to company reports. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the most profitable firm in Wall Street
history, has been credited with 12.6 percent of the $11.3
billion in initial sales this year. Last year, it had 21.3
percent, according to Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>Still, American companies that used Goldman Sachs as the
lead underwriter got the highest prices for their shares in the
first half, selling at an average 1.4 percent discount to their
offering range, the data show. Companies that didn''t hire the
141-year-old firm to lead their IPOs took an average discount of
14 percent for their shares. </p>
<p>Ford Backs Goldman </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs bankers have advised Ford since 1953 and the
firm managed Ford''s IPO in January 1956, the biggest ever at the
time. Sidney Weinberg, the Goldman Sachs chairman who managed
the sale and was later named to Ford''s board, used Ford to
leapfrog his firm''s standing on Wall Street into the top tier of
underwriters, according to Charles Ellis''s book The
Partnership: The Making of Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>Ford publicly backed Goldman Sachs after the firm was sued
for fraud by the SEC. We have a long relationship with Goldman
Sachs and expect it to continue, Ford spokesman Mark Truby
said on April 20, four days after the SEC sued Goldman Sachs. </p>

<p>A Pfizer Inc. unit is seeking to
duck responsibility for two women''s breast cancers linked to its
Prempro menopause drug, a lawyer argued at the end of a trial. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s Wyeth subsidiary rejected Sharon Buxton''s and Joy
Henry''s claims that its hormone-replacement medicine helped
cause their cancers in the face of a wealth of evidence to the
contrary, Zoe Littlepage, a lawyer for the women, told a state
court jury today in Philadelphia. </p>
<p>Wyeth accepts responsibility for not a single breast
cancer, Littlepage said in closing arguments in the trial of
the two women''s lawsuit against the drugmaker. The pair seek at
least $100,000 total in damages in the first phase of the case. </p>
<p>More than 6 million women took the menopause drugs to treat
symptoms such as hot flashes and mood swings before a 2002 study
highlighted their links to cancer. Wyeth''s sales of the
medicines, which are still on the market, topped $2 billion
before the Women''s Health Initiative, a National Institutes of
Health-sponsored study, concluded they posed an increased cancer
risk. </p>
<p>Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Premarin,
Wyeth''s estrogen-based drug, with Upjohn''s progestin-laden
Provera, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth later combined the two
hormones in its Prempro pill. </p>
<p>Wyeth''s witnesses testified during the five-week trial that
researchers haven''t conclusively found Prempro causes breast
cancer, and Buxton''s and Henry''s lawyers didn''t produce enough
evidence linking their cancers to the drug to win, Beth Wilkinson, one of the company''s attorneys, told jurors. </p>
<p>Lot of Proof'' </p>
<p>We brought you a whole lot of proof that Prempro wasn''t
the culprit in the cancers, Wilkinson argued. </p>
<p>Wyeth has lost seven of the 11 Prempro cases decided by
juries since trials began in 2006. The drugmaker got some of
those verdicts thrown out at the post-trial stage and or had
awards reduced. </p>
<p>Pfizer also has won dismissals of more than 3,000 cases at
either the pretrial stage or after the cases were set for
trials, according to court filings. </p>
<p>A judge in Philadelphia refused in May to throw out a
$9.4 million jury award to a woman who blamed Prempro for her
breast cancer. The case is on appeal. </p>
<p>Buxton, 66, took Prempro over six years before the retired
scheduler for a surgical practice developed breast cancer, court
filings show. Henry, a 76-year-old owner of a moving company,
took the drug for eight years before being diagnosed with the
disease. </p>
<p>Clash Over Cause </p>
<p>Littlepage contends Wyeth knew the hormone-based Prempro
could promote the growth of cancer and should be held liable.
Wyeth officials counter that researchers can''t pinpoint a single
cause of breast cancer and the medicine can''t be held
responsible for the disease. </p>
<p>If jurors find for the women, they can award money for
medical expenses, lost wages and pain and suffering. The panel
then will be asked to decide whether Wyeth failed to adequately
warn patients and doctors about Prempro''s risks. </p>
<p>Pfizer, the world''s largest drugmaker, completed its
$68 billion purchase of Wyeth last year. It acquired Upjohn in
2003 as part of a $54 billion buyout of Pharmacia Corp. </p>
<p>The case is Buxton v. Wyeth, 00202, Philadelphia Court of
Common Pleas (Philadelphia). </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc.''s menopause drug Prempro
didn''t cause two women''s cancers, and the drugmaker doesn''t have
to pay damages over those illnesses, a jury decided. </p>
<p>Jurors in state court in Philadelphia deliberated about
four hours before concluding today that Prempro wasn''t a
factual cause of Sharon Buxton''s and Joy Henry''s breast
cancers. The women sought at least $100,000 in damages. </p>
<p>While we have great sympathy for Mrs. Buxton, Mrs. Henry
and their families, we believe the verdicts in this case confirm
our position, Pfizer said in a statement. The vast majority
of women who take hormone therapy do not get breast cancer. </p>
<p>Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Premarin,
Wyeth''s estrogen-based drug, with Upjohn Co.''s progestin-laden
Provera, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth later combined the two
hormones in Prempro. </p>
<p>Pfizer, the world''s largest drugmaker, completed the $68

<p>More than 6 million women took hormone drugs to treat
menopause symptoms such as hot flashes and mood swings before
the Women''s Health Initiative, a National Institutes of Health-
sponsored study, concluded they posed an increased cancer risk. </p>
<p>Victoria Davis, a spokeswoman for New York-based Pfizer,
said in an interview that the study also showed that 99.6
percent of users didn''t get breast cancer. </p>
<p>Jury Trials </p>
<p>Wyeth has lost seven of the 12 Prempro cases decided by
juries since trials began in 2006. The drugmaker got some of
those verdicts thrown out at the post-trial stage or had awards
reduced. </p>
<p>A judge in Philadelphia refused in May to throw out a $9.4

scheduler for a surgical practice developed breast cancer, court
filings show. Henry, a 76-year-old owner of a moving company,
took the drug for eight years before being diagnosed with the
disease. </p>
<p>Beth Wilkinson, an attorney for Pfizer, said in a phone
interview that the trial with two plaintiffs was incredibly
challenging. Her team was helped by being allowed to focus
on the science first and show jurors that there''s no
evidence that Prempro causes breast cancer based on testimony
from practicing cancer doctors, she said. </p>
<p>Zoe Littlepage, a lawyer for Buxton and Henry, didn''t
immediately return a phone call or an e-mail seeking comment on
the verdict. </p>
<p>Pfizer, which reported $50 billion in sales last year, fell
17 cents to $16.10 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading
at 4 p.m. The shares have dropped 11 percent this year. </p>

<p>Much ink is being spilled over the
meaning of China''s economy surpassing Japan''s. </p>
<p>Even more important is what it doesn''t mean: greater
Chinese purchasing power, longer life spans, better health care
and education, freedom of speech, assembly, religion and
expression, safer roads, building standards, free elections,
clean air and water or social harmony. </p>
<p>It''s great that China is growing 10 percent. Just don''t get
carried away about what this moment means. China faces the
daunting task of getting per-capita income into the orbit of
Japan''s, which is 10 times higher. That''s what matters and we
are a decade away from knowing how China will do. </p>
<p>China is altering the global economy, and not always for
the better. Two phenomena growing before our eyes are the spread
of an authoritarian model and the dominance of the Wal-Mart
economy, both of which represent a race to the bottom. </p>
<p>No, I''m not betting against China. Only the most cynical
and short-sighted among us would want China to fail. A fifth of
humanity enmeshed in crisis is in no one''s best interest. </p>
<p>China, though, must beat history. No economic giant has
avoided a major crisis. If China is to eclipse the U.S. by 2027,
as London-based economist Jim O''Neill of Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. predicts, it must grow at today''s rates indefinitely.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the world''s largest professional-
services organization, says it will happen in 2020. </p>
<p>At the moment, China''s trajectory is anathema to what Adam Smith taught us about the nature of economic development. </p>
<p>Authoritarian Example </p>
<p>China legitimizes a market-authoritarian example, says
Stefan Halper, a senior fellow at Magdalene College in
Cambridge, England, and the author of The Beijing Consensus. </p>
<p>With American-style capitalism in tatters and Europe
unraveling, developing nations are clamoring for new role
models. Countries from Angola to Myanmar to Venezuela see
China''s state-directed capitalism combined with authoritarian
rule as a better path than liberalization and democracy. </p>
<p>How you create thriving markets over time without
transparency and a free press is beyond me. Wall Street took
things too far and acted shamefully thanks to too little
oversight. China has the opposite problem. </p>
<p>There''s a reason investors question China''s data. The
country somehow comes up with a single figure in a structurally
imbalanced system of 1 billion-plus people at very different
levels of development, a healthy gray economy and local
governments whose budgets rely on reporting rapid growth. </p>
<p>One Number </p>
<p>With modest resources, officials settle on one number
purporting to capture the daily activities of the nation --
almost always within the range of expectations of economists
from Shanghai to New York. Try explaining that. </p>
<p>The spread of the Wal-Mart economy, an ever-growing
effort to mass-produce at the cheapest cost, also bears
watching. China''s reluctance to let the yuan strengthen
underlines the primacy of its exports. As China grows, so does
the scope and efficiency of this trade machine. That would be
fine if output were translating into rapid increases in domestic
consumption. It''s not. </p>
<p>There have been rays of hope on that front, such as demands
for higher wages among factory workers. There are limits,
though, to how much the government will allow income to
skyrocket, lest it fuels inflation or reduces competitiveness.
Chinese, like Germans, will continue to produce more than they
consume. Companies are reinvesting much of what they earn in
increasing capacity, upgrading the machine. </p>
<p>Deceiving Trends </p>
<p>News reports that China is now the biggest market for cars
and cell phones and that LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA is
making a beeline there are deceiving. They suggest vast pockets
of consumers can afford such goods. They can''t. China''s
purchasing power is growing slower than its ability to undercut
all competitors in the production of goods and services. </p>
<p>As China becomes better at churning things out cheaply,
other developing nations will be at a loss. Until recently,
Asian countries such as Indonesia and the Philippines were
ecstatic about China''s growth. Now they see it''s more of a zero-
sum game than they anticipated. Expect this dynamic to grow with
China''s size. This is a budding, but major, geopolitical issue. </p>
<p>China may have regrets about passing Japan. More will now
be asked of its leaders on climate change, North Korea, energy
deals that support dodgy regimes, and even human rights. </p>
<p>Size matters less than the quality of growth. China, for
example, surpassed Japan in trademark patent filings in 2009.
Further progress here means China may well be home to the next
Silicon Valley. That is, if the nation''s state-economy model
doesn''t smother innovation. </p>
<p>The entrepreneurial potential is a key reason investors are
bullish on China. Japanese are doing lots of soul-searching this
week, wondering why they became No. 3. Here''s why: In China, you
have 1.3 billion people working hard to circumvent government
regulations so they can make a quick yuan. Japan has 126 million
complaining about how the government isn''t fixing their lives. </p>
<p>Whatever happens, China has some work to do before it can
topple the U.S. from the top slot. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. plans to sell
$1 billion of commercial mortgage-backed bonds, giving control
of soured loans to a holder of the riskiest portion after
another offering ceded power to investors in the safest pieces. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s sale, the largest this year of the debt, would
grant hedge fund H/2 Capital Partners LLC, the buyer of the
bottom $50 million slice, primary authority over troubled loans,
according to people familiar with the transaction who declined
to be identified because negotiations are private. Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. gave those rights to investors of
the highest-rated portions in a $788.5 million offering on Aug.
4. </p>
<p>Concern that holders of the riskiest pieces may make
decisions favoring their own interests prompted Goldman Sachs to
switch from the traditional structure of securities backed by
hotels, shopping malls and skyscrapers. Spreading control among
numerous senior bondholders may create confusion in the event of
defaults, according to NewOak Capital LLC''s Ron D''Vari. </p>
<p>It''s very difficult to come to terms with delinquent
borrowers as it is, said D''Vari, chief executive officer of
the advisory and asset-management firm in New York, and
previously the head of structured finance at BlackRock Inc. If
you multilayer that with additional bureaucracy, it becomes more
difficult. </p>
<p>Sales Decline </p>
<p>H/2, the Stamford, Connecticut-based commercial-real estate
fixed-income manger, will receive a yield of more than 14
percent on its 10-year investment, assuming the loans take no
losses, one of the people said. </p>
<p>That compares with an 8.55 percent average yield for
speculative-grade companies, according to the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield Master II Index. High-yield, high-
risk, or junk, debt is ranked below Baa3 by Moody''s Investors
Service and lower than BBB- by Standard  Poor''s. </p>
<p>The higher-ranked portions of the deal are set to be
offered next month, the people said. </p>
<p>Justin Perras, a spokesman for JPMorgan, Michael DuVally of
Goldman Sachs and Alex Samuelson at Citigroup, all in New York,
declined to comment. </p>
<p>Spencer Haber, chief executive officer of H/2 Capital,
didn''t respond to a phone call seeking comment. </p>
<p>Sales of commercial mortgage-backed securities plunged 95
percent to $11.2 billion in 2008 from a record $234 billion in
2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Banks arranged
$3.4 billion of the securities last year, and about $2.4 billion
has been issued in 2010. </p>
<p>B-Pieces </p>
<p>Top-ranked securities yield 2.76 percentage points more
than Treasuries, compared with 3.95 percentage points at the
start of the year, and 4.84 percentage points a year ago,
according to a Barclays Plc index. </p>
<p>Late payments on commercial mortgages bundled and sold as
bonds are at a record 8.25 percent as of July, compared with
3.04 percent a year earlier, according to Fitch Ratings. </p>
<p>Investors who hold the most-junior slices, or B-pieces, are
first to be wiped out as losses mount and may have an incentive
to keep the debt outstanding rather than foreclose, potentially
punishing other holders. </p>

<p>Blackstone Group LP, the world''s
largest buyout firm, agreed to invest $500 million in General
Growth Properties Inc. as part of its restructuring plan as the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission opened a formal insider-
trading probe of some of the mall owner''s officials. </p>
<p>Blackstone reached the deal with the investor group
financing the plan, General Growth said in a revised
reorganization proposal filed yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court
in New York. General Growth received notice in July that the SEC
is investigating possible insider-trading violations by current
and former officers and directors. </p>
<p>General Growth, the second-largest mall owner in the U.S.,
is scheduled to seek court permission this week to send the
reorganization plan to creditors for a vote. Blackstone, based
in New York, would get new common stock and shares in a new
company that General Growth will spin off when it exits
bankruptcy, according to court papers. </p>
<p>General Growth, based in Chicago, described Blackstone''s
participation as a potential investment in an earlier
version of the plan. In the new version, General Growth also
agreed to issue new notes to replace certain so-called Rouse
notes. The company previously planned to reinstate $1.35 billion
worth of the debt. </p>
<p>David Keating, a General Growth spokesman, couldn''t
immediately comment on the terms of the new notes. </p>

<p>New Filings </p>
<p>Apex Digital Files for Reorganization in Los Angeles </p>
<p>Apex Digital Inc., one of America''s leading providers of
Apex Digital-branded televisions, sought bankruptcy protection
from creditors to modify its business model. </p>
<p>The closely held Walnut, California-based company listed as
much as $50 million in both assets and debt in Chapter 11
documents filed yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Los
Angeles. </p>
<p>This restructuring plan allows Apex to grow its business
in a new direction capitalizing on the increasing demand for
green energy. This is an area where we have a proven track
record and a number of new products under development, David
Ji, Apex Digital''s Chief Executive Officer, said in statement
yesterday. </p>
<p>The company said in the statement it will seek approval of
a restructuring plan that will allow it to modify its business
strategy to expand its consulting business and grow its green
energy lighting products line. The company said it has adequate
working capital to continue business operations normally. </p>
<p>Apex Digital, founded in 1997, provides and markets
consumer electronics, including high-definition LCD televisions,
home entertainment media devices, solar powered lights and
digital set top boxes. The trademark Apex Digital is owned
and licensed by independent third parties not affected by the
Chapter 11 petition, according to the statement. </p>
<p>The case is In re Apex Digital Inc., 10-44406, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Central District of California (Los Angeles). </p>
<p>LH Trucking Company Files for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection </p>
<p>LH Trucking Company Inc., a Central Pennsylvania trucking
company, sought bankruptcy protection from creditors without
giving a reason. </p>
<p>The company, based in Hanover, Pennsylvania, listed debt
from $10 million to $50 million and assets from $1 million to
$10 million in Chapter 11 documents filed Aug. 16 in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Harrisburg. </p>
<p>LH Trucking, founded in 1960 by Larry and Helen

<p>Updates </p>
<p>Visteon Ordered to Reinstate Health Care to Retirees </p>
<p>A judge ordered Visteon Corp. to reinstate health benefits
to thousands of retirees who lost insurance coverage after the
auto-parts maker filed for bankruptcy. </p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher S. Sontchi said yesterday
he will give the company a chance to help him decide how quickly
the benefits will be restored to more than 6,000 retirees. The
former workers, many of whom held jobs at now-closed Midwest
factories, must also be reimbursed for any health-care expenses
they incurred since the cuts took place in May, Sontchi said. </p>
<p>Sontchi''s decision follows a July 15 appeals court order
that the benefits for 2,100 former workers in Indiana be
restored. Sontchi had ruled in December that the company had the
right to cancel the coverage without first negotiating with the
union. The Indiana workers are covered by yesterday''s ruling. </p>
<p>Visteon, based in Van Buren Township, Michigan, filed for
bankruptcy last year, citing the faltering economy and a

<p>Tribune Creditors Get More Time to Vote on Plan </p>
<p>A judge gave Tribune Co. creditors more time to vote on the
publishing company''s plan to exit bankruptcy while it negotiates
with opponents. </p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin J. Carey yesterday in
Wilmington, Delaware, scheduled a hearing for Aug. 20 to set
court dates that may affect the company''s plan to exit
bankruptcy this year. </p>
<p>James Conlan, a Tribune attorney, said company officials
are talking with creditors who oppose its plan to give more than
90 percent of Tribune to the lenders who financed a 2007 buyout.
Lower-ranking creditors who hold $1.2 billion in pre-buyout debt
would get nothing under the plan. </p>
<p>Creditors have been reviewing a report by a court-appointed
examiner who found evidence of a fraudulent transfer involving
part of the deal that real-estate billionaire Sam Zell used to
take over Tribune. Creditors are somewhat likely to win a
lawsuit based on the smaller piece of the $8.3 billion
transaction, the examiner said. </p>
<p>Some creditors have said the report will help them decide
how to vote on Tribune''s reorganization plan. Carey will take
those votes into consideration when he decides whether to
approve the plan at a hearing scheduled to start in October. </p>
<p>Depending on how negotiations go this week, that date,
along with other related deadlines, may change, Conlan said. </p>
<p>Tribune owns the Los Angeles Times, the Chicago Tribune and
television and radio stations. It filed for bankruptcy in
December 2008, about a year after the buyout was completed. </p>

<p>Harrisburg Hires Scott Balice to Help With Debt-Recovery Plan </p>
<p>Harrisburg, the Pennsylvania state capital, hired Scott
Balice Strategies to help plan a financial recovery after
missing payments on $282 million of debt for an incinerator and
considering bankruptcy. </p>
<p>Mayor Linda Thompson, who took office in January, announced
the appointment yesterday at a City Hall press conference. </p>
<p>Harrisburg faces $68 million in payments this year on debt
tied to the incinerator, which is managed by the Harrisburg
Authority. The cost is about four times what the city of 47,000
raises through property taxes annually, according to its budget.
Harrisburg and the authority have so far skipped $6 million in
loan and bond payments, and have missed two $637,500 loan
payments to Covanta Holding Corp., the incinerator operator. </p>
<p>The Scott Balice Strategies team has the experience and
expertise to advise the city at this critical juncture,
Thompson said in a press release. With their assistance the
city will identify and implement the most efficient strategies
to maximize value for all of the city''s stakeholders. </p>
<p>Thompson is struggling to win City Council support for a
plan to lease parking garages and meters to a private operator
to raise money for debt-service payments. </p>
<p>Scott Balice, based in Chicago, is working on a parking
facility lease plan for Pittsburgh. Lois Scott, president of
Scott Balice, didn''t immediately respond to e-mail messages and

<p>The Newark Group Emerges from Chapter 11, Closes on Exit Loans </p>
<p>Newark Group Inc., a manufacturer of recycled paperboard
and paperboard products, announced yesterday that it had emerged
from bankruptcy protection and closed on its exit loans. </p>
<p>The Cranford, New Jersey-based company won court approval
of its reorganization plan July 30, 51 days after seeking
bankruptcy protection. The paperboard maker listed from $100
million to $500 million in both debts and assets in Chapter 11
documents when it filed June 9. </p>
<p>We are pleased to have the continued support of our
lenders and stakeholders as we have completed the steps
necessary to strengthen our balance sheet so we are poised for
sustainable growth, Robert Mullen, Chief Executive Officer of
The Newark Group, said in an Aug. 16 statement. We emerge from
Chapter 11 a well capitalized private company with a much
improved operating profile. </p>
<p>Under the company''s restructuring plan, about $175 million
in unsecured subordinated notes were converted into 96.5 percent
of the reorganized company''s equity. Trade suppliers and
unsecured creditors owed about $57 million were paid in full.
Shareholders, with 84 percent of the company''s equity, got 1.5
percent of new common stock plus warrants to buy up to 15
percent. The plan also gave owners of employee stock options up
to 2 percent of new stock. </p>
<p>The Newark Group closed on a $70 million revolving loan
from Wells Fargo Capital Finance and a $110 million term loan
from Orix Finance, as the last step of its restructuring. The
exit loans will provide the company with about $25 million in
undrawn liquidity, according to the statement. </p>
<p>The case is In Re The Newark Group Inc., 10-27694, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of New Jersey (Newark). </p>

<p>Madoff Feeder Fund, Fairfield Sentry, Sues Investors </p>
<p>Fairfield Sentry Ltd., a feeder fund that transferred $3.2
billion to convicted swindler Bernard Madoff, sued 17 of its
shareholders to try to recover money they received. </p>
<p>Fairfield Sentry, an affiliate of Fairfield Greenwich
Group, said it had no way to repay the $3.2 billion without
getting back the money its shareholders received since about
2004, according to the complaints it filed in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Manhattan. Fairfield Sentry said it raised money for
Madoff without knowing he was running a Ponzi scheme. </p>
<p>Fairfield Sentry is trying to recover more than $160
million in payments it made to shareholders, including Banco
Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner 
Smith Inc. and RBC Dominion Securities Sub A/C. </p>
<p>The biggest claims are being made against Banque Privee
Edmond de Rothschild SA for $33.7 million, Meritz Fire  Marine
Insurance Co. for $21.9 million and Bank Hapoalim (Suisse) Ltd.
for $20 million. </p>
<p>Fairfield Sentry is being liquidated under the supervision
of the Commercial Division of the High Court of Justice in the
British Virgin Islands. </p>
<p>The first case filed is Fairfield Sentry Ltd. v. Theodoor
GGC Amsterdam, 10-03496, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern

<p>Nikolaus Bets on Default Surge in Expansion to Distressed Debt </p>
<p>Nikolaus  Co. LLP, a restructuring specialist established
in Germany in 2001, is raising as much as $50 million to invest
in distressed debt, betting a slowing recovery will lead to
unprecedented defaults. </p>
<p>The recent financial environment has created the perfect
hunting ground, said Chief Investment Officer Stefan Benedetti. There will be a default and restructuring cycle on
an unprecedented scale, he said. </p>
<p>Nikolaus''s Alloro Global Special Situations Fund will be
based in London and marks the firm''s first expansion into hedge-
fund management. The fund will focus on Europe, the former
Soviet Union and Latin America and will target debt sold by
telecoms, manufacturing and financial companies. </p>
<p>I look at the world in terms of whether a company can pay
its debt, Benedetti said. And if it goes bankrupt I want to
know what I can recover from the situation. </p>
<p>Regency Lenders Said to Consult Lazard on $700 Million of Loans </p>
<p>Regency Entertainment SA''s lenders are consulting financial
advisory firm Lazard Ltd. as the Greek casino operator seeks to
restructure about 600 million euros ($714 million) of loans. </p>
<p>Regency, which is owned by London-based BC Partners Ltd.,
is starting discussions with lenders to reorganize its debt,
according to three people familiar with the matter. The Athens-
based company is being advised by Houlihan Lokey Howard  Zukin,
said the people, who declined to be identified because the talks
are private. </p>
<p>Andrew Honnor, a London-based spokesman for BC Partners,
declined to comment. Andrea Hewitt, a spokeswoman for Houlihan
Lokey in London, also wouldn''t comment. Spokesmen for Regency
and Lazard couldn''t be reached for comment. </p>
<p>BC Partners acquired Regency in 2006 using a 680 million-
euro ($876 million) leveraged-buyout loan arranged by Deutsche
Bank AG, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Mexicana Pilots Agree to Investors Terms, Horcasitas Says </p>
<p>Grupo Mexicana de Aviacion''s pilots'' union has reached an
agreement with new investors to rescue the company, said
Communications and Transportation Minister Juan Molinar Horcasitas. </p>
<p>The investors would acquire all of the company''s
operations, including the low-cost Click and Link airlines,
Horcasitas said in an interview with Radio Formula. The union is
working to present a restructuring plan to Mexicana''s creditors,
he said. </p>
<p>Blockbuster''s $300 Million Notes Drop to Record Low 4.75 Cents </p>
<p>Bonds of Blockbuster Inc. fell to a record low as the
Dallas-based video-rental chain seeks to restructure its debt. </p>
<p>The 9 percent notes due in 2012 fell 3.25 cents to 4.75
cents on the dollar yesterday as of 11:11 a.m. in New York,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The company''s notes
have declined from 73.5 cents on the dollar in September, Trace
data show. </p>
<p>Defaults </p>
<p>U.S. Bank TruPS CDO Defaults Pass 14% on July Spike, Fitch Says </p>
<p>Eleven new bank defaults on U.S. bank trust preferred
security collateralized debt obligations pushed the Fitch
Ratings default and deferral index past the 14 percent mark as
of July, according to the latest results. </p>
<p>New defaults totaled $129.5 million last month, affecting
16 CDOs, Fitch said in a statement yesterday. Twenty two banks
also began deferring interest payments on about $302.5 million
of collateral in 23 trust preferred security CDOs. </p>
<p>The 11 new bank defaults bring the total to 134, affecting
82 CDOs. The 357 banks now deferring are affecting interest
payments on $6.5 billion of collateral held by 83 trust
preferred security CDOs. </p>
<p>Fitch''s Bank Default and Deferral Index tracks defaults and
deferrals by banks and bank holding companies of 85 bank trust
preferred security CDOs encompassing approximately $37.7 billion
of bank collateral originated. The index includes all types of
securities issued by banks and bank holding companies such as
trust preferred security and senior and subordinated debt. </p>
<p>European Insurers Pass Sovereign-Debt Default Test, Fitch Says </p>
<p>European insurers such as Allianz SE and Axa SA could
withstand a Greek sovereign-debt default without suffering
downgrades, Fitch Ratings said. </p>
<p>Stress-testing of European insurers based on their euro-
zone sovereign exposures has resulted in no rating actions,
the firm said in a statement today. Fitch carried out the test
based on the hypothetical scenario of a default on Greek
government debt. </p>
<p>A Europe-wide stress test conducted among banks last month
showed that seven of 91 European lenders examined needed to
raise capital. Fitch''s scenario for insurers included knock-on
effects on the sovereign debt of Portugal, Ireland, Spain and
Italy, the ratings firm said. </p>
<p>Fitch tested the insurers in its rated portfolio, which
includes the majority of the European insurance market and most
major European insurance groups. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. is marketing
$484.6 million of bonds backed by a loan to Centro Properties
Group, the Australian shopping center owner seeking to refinance
$2.7 billion of debt from its U.S. business. </p>
<p>The loan is secured by 72 retail properties owned by the
Glen Waverley, Australia-based company, according to people
familiar with offering who declined to be identified because
terms are private. Shopping centers in Texas account for 39
percent of the pool, while properties in New York and New Jersey
represent 21 percent. </p>
<p>The transaction is the sixth sale of commercial mortgage-
backed securities this year as Wall Street seeks to revive sales
after issuance plummeted 95 percent to $11.2 billion in 2008
from a record $234 billion in 2007, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The most recent offering, also tied to a single
loan, was a $660 million deal for Vornado Realty Trust earlier
this month. </p>
<p>Of commercial-mortgage bond sales in 2010, three have been
linked to the properties of a single borrower. Offerings grew to
be as large as $7.6 billion and bundled as many as 300 loans
from borrowers across the U.S. as sales peaked in 2007,
Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Wall Street banks have been writing new loans to pool for
so-called multi-borrower offerings, though many property owners
are unable to pay off the existing mortgage amid tighter
underwriting standards and prices down 41 percent from 2007
peaks, according to Moody''s Investors Service. </p>
<p>The Moody''s/REAL Commercial Property Price Index dropped 4
percent in June, the company said today in a report. The decline
was the biggest since July 2009. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is preparing a $1 billion deal for September,
people familiar with that sale said. The offering, the largest
this year, will be made up of about 38 loans to different
property owners. </p>

<p>General Growth Properties Inc., the
second-largest mall owner in the U.S., won court approval to
move forward with its plan to exit bankruptcy as creditors
protest the proposal. </p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Allan Gropper in New York today
approved a summary of the plan, known as a disclosure statement.
Under the plan, General Growth would pay creditors in full and
provide a recovery to shareholders, which is unusual in a
bankruptcy case. </p>
<p>This is a case in which we are decidedly not rearranging
the deck chairs on the Titanic, Gropper said. We are trying
to determine the rights of creditors who are being paid in full
and equity holders who are getting a very substantial return by
all accounts. </p>
<p>General Growth resolved most objections to the disclosure
statement before today''s hearing. Unsecured creditors still have
significant problems with the plan, said Michael Stamer, an
attorney for the group. Investors including Fairholme Funds Inc.
will be able to receive cash for General Growth bonds to offset
their investments, an option not available to other bondholders. </p>
<p>The investors are getting something that the other
creditors are not, Stamer said. </p>
<p>Heirs of Howard Hughes also have objected, saying they
won''t get the same recovery as creditors or shareholders.
Creditors can raise their objections when General Growth asks
Gropper to confirm the plan at an Oct. 21 hearing, he said. </p>
<p>Real Issue'' </p>
<p>We''ll hear the issue, if it''s a real issue, at
confirmation, Gropper said of the bondholders'' complaint. We
can consider why this is really discrimination. </p>
<p>General Growth, based in Chicago, filed for bankruptcy last
year after failing to refinance its debt load. The company plans
to emerge from bankruptcy this year with $8.4 billion in
financing. </p>
<p>The company expects to raise $4.4 billion through the sale
of new stock to Brookfield Asset Management Inc., Fairholme and
Pershing Square Capital Management LP, and $2.15 billion from
selling notes exchangeable for stock, according to court
documents. It also plans to reinstate $1.35 billion in bonds or
issue new ones, and to spin off a group of assets into a new
company. </p>
<p>The case is In re General Growth Properties Inc., 09-11977,

<p>Mobile telephones sold in the U.S.
would need to receive FM radio signals under a proposal pushed
by broadcasters as part of a tentative agreement to end a
dispute over music royalties. </p>
<p>Requiring phones to become radio receivers would be part of
a deal to pay artists for airplay between the National
Association of Broadcasters, representing radio companies led by
CBS Corp. and Entercom Communications Corp., and the MusicFirst
Coalition of artists and record labels. A trade group for makers
of mobile phones opposes the plan. </p>
<p>The possible requirement is a back room scheme and
the height of absurdity, Gary Shapiro, chief executive
officer of the Consumer Electronics Association, said in an e-
mail. The group in Arlington, Virginia, lists among members
Amazon.com, Apple Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Motorola Inc. </p>
<p>Forced inclusion of an additional antenna, processor and
radio receiver will compromise features that consumers truly
desire, such as long battery life and light weight, Shapiro
said. Broadcasters and the music industry are like buggy-whip
industries that refuse to innovate and seek to impose penalties
on those that do, he said. </p>

<p>Ian Henderson, manager of $7 billion
in resource assets at JPMorgan Chase  Co., said China may bid
for Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., after a $40 billion BHP
Billiton Ltd. offer, while a Brazilian proposal is less likely. </p>
<p>China is dependent upon potash exports so they are a big
customer of Potash Corp., Henderson, who manages mining stocks
including BHP and Brazil''s Vale SA, said today on Bloomberg
Television''s The Pulse with Andrea Catherwood.'' Brazil does
have its own potash reserves and these can be developed and I
think Vale is increasing their own production plans already. </p>
<p>Potash Corp., the world''s largest fertilizer maker, this
week rejected a $130-a-share offer from BHP, describing the bid
as grossly inadequate. Rival bidders may include Vale, Rio
Tinto Group and groups in Russia and China, the world''s biggest
user of fertilizer with about 30 percent of global consumption,
according to Macquarie Group Ltd. analysts. </p>
<p>In the absence of a higher BHP bid, Potash Corp. sees the
best alternative offers coming from businesses backed by China
or India, or companies such as Vale, said two people familiar
with the matter. The likeliest from China are Sinochem Group,
the nation''s largest chemical trader, China Investment Corp.,
the sovereign wealth fund, or Sinofert Holdings Ltd., they said. </p>
<p>China has been acquiring production across a number of
commodity classes, Macquarie analysts led by Duncan McKeen
wrote on Aug. 17. Given that it is still a large net importer
of potash, it may be a logical buyer of potash production. </p>
<p>A concern for Potash Corp. would be that Chinese companies
move too slowly for the Canadian takeover code, which may force
a potential acquirer to act within a few months, they wrote in a
research report. UBS AG said in an Aug. 17 note that it doesn''t
expect Vale to lodge a competing offer. </p>
<p>Hostile Bet </p>
<p>BHP, the world''s biggest mining company, has arranged $45
billion of loans for its hostile bid, the most debt to finance a
takeover since February 2008. Melbourne-based BHP is seeking to
take control of Potash Corp. to become the leading producer of
fertilizer, betting on rising demand as global food needs grow. </p>
<p>What we''ve got on the table is a full offer and that''s
the only thing that I can talk about, BHP Chief Executive
Officer Marius Kloppers said on a conference call with analysts
yesterday. I can''t speculate about anything else. </p>
<p>Demand for potash, mined from deposits left by evaporated
seas, will rebound to 50 million metric tons this year from less
than 30 million tons in 2009, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-based
Potash Corp.''s CEO Bill Doyle said on a conference call Aug. 17.
Potash is a form of potassium mined in countries including
Canada, Brazil, Germany and the U.S. and used by farmers to help
boost crop yields. </p>
<p>The potash market is bottoming after prices slumped more
than 50 percent amid the global economic crisis. Saskatchewan
prices rallied to $374 a ton in the second quarter, according to
Salman Partners, from $359 a ton in the prior three months.
Potash Corp. has about 20 percent of global output capacity. </p>
<p>It''s like the Ritz, there is only one Ritz hotel around
and there is no doubt about it that this is a fantastic asset,
Henderson said. Clearly 2010 has been a huge recovery year for
the potash market. </p>

<p>General Motors Co. filed for an
initial share offering that will mark the return of what was
once the world''s largest automaker to public markets a year
after it was bailed out by the government. </p>
<p>GM, 61 percent-owned by the U.S., didn''t disclose the
number of shares that will be sold in the initial public
offering or the price range in a statement filed yesterday with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The automaker won''t
sell any common shares itself while offering preferred shares
alongside the IPO, the filing showed. </p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury will sell some of the common shares it
owns in GM, according to the filing. The aim is to sell a fifth
of the Treasury''s 304 million shares, people familiar with the
IPO said in June, cutting the government''s stake to less than 50
percent. GM may hold the IPO in November, people familiar with
the matter have said. </p>
<p>General Motors Corp. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection on June 1, 2009, after posting $88 billion of losses
since 2004, the last year the company reported an annual profit.
General Motors Co. emerged 39 days later. </p>
<p>GM may seek to raise as much as $16 billion in the IPO, a
person familiar with the plans said last week, making it the
second-largest in U.S. history behind Visa Inc.''s $19.7 billion
deal in March 2008. Outgoing Chief Executive Officer Ed Whitacre
has pushed to end government ownership of the Detroit-based
company, which received a $50 billion taxpayer bailout following
its bankruptcy in June 2009. </p>

<p>Innkeepers Creditors Want Apollo''s 2007 Deal Probed </p>
<p>Innkeepers USA Trust''s unsecured creditors asked for an
investigation of the bankrupt company''s 2007 transaction with
Apollo Investment Corp., including fairness opinions issued by
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and UBS Securities LLC. </p>
<p>A committee of the unsecured creditors on Aug. 17 asked the
bankruptcy court in Manhattan to authorize the probe and compel
other creditors, including Lehman and Apollo, to produce
documents and witnesses to determine whether the deal harmed the
hotel owner. The committee also wants to examine the validity of
secured creditors'' claims and find out whether company
executives breached their fiduciary duties. </p>
<p>Shareholders in Innkeepers are also seeking an
investigation of plans by Apollo Investment Corp. and Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. to reorganize the bankrupt chain of
hotels. They said in their Aug. 12 request for a probe that the
proposal is unfair to creditors as well as shareholders. </p>
<p>The deal would give Lehman all the hotel company''s stock,
which it would split with Apollo, squeezing out other creditors
and investors, a committee of preferred holders said in an Aug.
17 court filing. </p>
<p>Lehman, which helped Apollo finance the 2007 buyout of
Innkeepers with a $1.2 billion loan, won court approval
yesterday to lend Innkeepers $17.5 million to help it
restructure. Lehman said last month that the refinancing would
help it recoup a secured claim. </p>
<p>Innkeepers, whose parent is managed by an affiliate of Leon
Black''s private-equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC, filed
for bankruptcy on July 19 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court with a pre-
arranged reorganization plan that has continued to draw
objections. </p>

<p>QMG Winddown Wins Dismissal of Bankruptcy Case </p>
<p>QMG Winddown Inc., formerly known as Questex Media Group
Inc., received a judge''s approval to end its bankruptcy case
after all potential recoveries for creditors were exhausted. </p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Mary Walrath granted the company''s
June 15 request and ordered the dismissal of the Chapter 11
case, according to court documents filed Aug. 17 in Wilmington,
Delaware. </p>
<p>The Newton, Massachusetts-based company sold virtually all
its assets to lenders in exchange for about $120 million in debt
owed to them and the assumption of about $15 million used to
finance the bankruptcy case. The lenders left QMG with $500,000
to wind down the estate. </p>
<p>The creditors committee has investigated and determined
not to pursue any potential lawsuits, lawyers for the company
said in court papers. </p>
<p>Questex was a business-to-business media and information
provider with 23 trade publications, 150 digital media

<p>U.S. Credit-Default Swaps Benchmark Declines for Second Day </p>
<p>A benchmark gauge of corporate credit risk in the U.S. fell
yesterday for the second day to the lowest since Aug. 10. </p>
<p>The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index Series
14, which investors use to hedge against losses on corporate
debt or to speculate on creditworthiness, fell 1.1 basis point
to a mid-price of 105.8 basis points as of 8:19 a.m. yesterday
in New York, according to Markit Group Ltd. The index, which
typically declines as investor confidence improves and rises as
it deteriorates, fell 4.8 basis points over the two days. </p>
<p>Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank, will revamp its $1.6 trillion asset
management unit to compete against investment firms such as
BlackRock Inc. and Pacific Investment Management Co., a person
with direct knowledge of the changes said. </p>
<p>George Gatch, 46, who has worked at JPMorgan since 1986,
will replace Eve Guernsey as chief executive officer of
Investment Management Americas, the person said, speaking
anonymously because the changes haven''t been announced publicly.
Gatch will assume Guernsey''s duties and keep running mutual fund
and retirement units, the person said. Gatch will work with a
new global manager overseeing the institutional business to be
named in September, according to an e-mail from Gatch to
employees dated Aug. 18. </p>
<p>Now is the time to ensure that we have a structure that
supports our future success as we confront challenges from
passive managers, ETFs and a generational shift in the way our
country saves for retirement, Gatch said in the e-mail. So-
called passive managers typically follow indexes instead of
picking individual stocks. </p>
<p>The changes underscore efforts by asset management head
Mary Callahan Erdoes, 42, to double revenue in five years,
expanding after competitors such as Bank of America Corp. and
Barclays Plc shed such units following the worst economic crisis
since the Great Depression. Erdoes previously ran JPMorgan''s
private bank and succeeded Jes Staley in September. Staley took
over the investment bank after JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon ousted
investment bank co-CEO Bill Winters. </p>
<p>Rounding Adjustment'' </p>
<p>Spokeswoman Mary Sedarat declined to comment on the
changes, which were reported earlier today by the New York
Times'' Dealbook. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s asset management division, which generated $391
million in net income during the second quarter, provides the
bank with a buffer to the variability of investment banking
revenues, said Geoffrey Bobroff, a mutual fund consultant in
East Greenwich, Rhode Island. For many large investment banks,
it''s a rounding adjustment in good days, he said. In bad
days, it may be the only source of revenue. </p>
<p>Garibaldi Named </p>
<p>John Garibaldi will run institutional advisory and sales in
investment management, reporting to both Gatch and the new
global head for institutional clients, Gatch wrote in the e-
mail. Garibaldi replaces John Hunt, who is leaving in October,
the person with knowledge of the changes said. Guernsey is
retiring after 32 years at the bank. </p>
<p>Gatch, who most recently ran the retail business for
investment management in North America, is one of three regional
division heads. Jamie Broderick will continue to run the retail
and institutional businesses for investment management in the
U.K., Europe and Latin America while David Hsu will do the same
in Asia, according to the person. All three report to Clive Brown, the chief operating officer for asset management, the
person said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan ranked 12th among U.S.-based stock and bond mutual
fund managers as of June 30, according to Morningstar Inc. data.
The bank had $103 billion of assets under management, excluding
money market funds. The asset management unit oversees $1.6
trillion in investments, which includes $1.2 trillion it
directly manages. </p>
<p>The bank, ranked second behind Bank of America in deposits
and assets among U.S. lenders, was the only large Wall Street
bank to remain profitable through the financial crisis. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley, the most bearish
among the 18 primary dealers that trade government securities
with the Federal Reserve, acknowledged that its forecast that
Treasury yields would rise this year was misguided. </p>
<p>We got our rates call wrong and missed a great
opportunity to be long bonds this year, James Caron, head of
U.S. interest-rate strategy at Morgan Stanley in New York, wrote
in a note to clients yesterday. The market is currently rife
with tactical relative value opportunities and that''s what we
will focus on going forward. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley had forecast that a strengthening U.S.
economy would lead to private credit demand, higher stock prices
and diminish the refuge appeal of Treasuries, pushing yields
higher. David Greenlaw, chief fixed-income economist at Morgan
Stanley, said in December that yields on benchmark 10-year notes
would climb about 40 percent to 5.5 percent, the biggest annual
increase since 1999. The New York-based firm reduced its
forecast to 4.5 percent in May and to 3.5 percent last week. </p>
<p>Other primary dealers weren''t much better at predicting
yields, according to a March survey by Bloomberg News. Jefferies
Group Inc. said the 10-year would yield 4.75 percent by year-
end. Deutsche Bank AG, JPMorgan Chase  Co., and Royal Bank of
Canada estimated a rise to 4.5 percent. The most accurate
dealers so far have been Goldman Sachs Group Inc., with an
estimate of 3.25 percent, and HSBC Holdings Plc at 3.3 percent. </p>
<p>Risk Weighted Return'' </p>
<p>The 10-year note yield fell as much as 4 basis points to
2.53 percent today, the lowest level since March 2009. Yields
have declined 10 basis points in the last five days and about 46
basis points in four weeks. </p>
<p>Caron is advising clients to buy shorter-term Treasuries
maturing in 5 years or less and 1- and 2-year forward contracts. </p>
<p>If the Fed is going to be on hold for an extended period
of time, then that''s the sector that is going to perform the
best and it also has the best risk-weighted return, Caron said
today in an interview with Thomas R. Keene on Bloomberg Radio. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley also recommends profiting from the narrowing
of the gap between the yields on 10- and 30-year Treasuries. The
difference narrowed to 106 basis points today, after touching
125 basis points on Aug. 10. </p>
<p>It''s mainly about the 30-year bond yield coming lower,
Caron said today, adding that 10-year yields may remain low as
the Fed buys more Treasuries. </p>
<p>Treasury Purchases </p>
<p>Policy makers began a purchase program on Aug. 17 to keep
borrowing costs low to foster economic growth by reinvesting
principal payments on mortgage-backed bonds and agency debt into
Treasuries. The Fed bought $6.16 billion in debt this week. It
acquired $300 billion of government debt last year. </p>
<p>Caron is recommending that investors position for the Fed''s
purchase of Treasuries on Aug. 24, 25 and Sept.1. </p>
<p>We believe that U.S. Treasury 10-year yields will be
range-bound from 2.85 percent, where the Fed announced it would
buy U.S. Treasuries, to 2.40 percent near-term, Caron wrote. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley also cited that it thought yields would
move higher because the Fed would be more likely to raise
interest rates in the first half of this year and the
unprecedented supply of Treasuries to weigh on prices, Caron
wrote. The market suggests the central bank will keep its target
rate for overnight loans between banks at a record-low range of
zero to 0.25 percent well into next year, he said. </p>
<p>Shrinking credit markets may help explain why some Treasury
yields are at record lows even after the amount of marketable
government debt outstanding increased by 21 percent from a year
earlier to $8.18 trillion. </p>
<p>We''ve Been Wrong'' </p>
<p>While net issuance of Treasuries will rise by $1.2 trillion
this year, the net supply of corporate bonds, mortgage-backed
securities and debt tied to consumer loans may recede by $1.3
trillion, according to Jeffrey Rosenberg, a fixed-income
strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley may revise its forecast for 3.1 percent
gross domestic product growth this year if economic data
continues to be weak, Caron said today. The firm is
unimpressed with recent data, including unemployment claims,
payroll and retail sales, he said. </p>
<p>We''ve become a lot more short-term and tactical, Caron
said. Once in a while you have to say we''ve been wrong, and
here''s why and it''s time to move on. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley, owner of the world''s
largest brokerage, hired Jack O''Connor as head of North American
institutional sales for its investment-management unit. </p>
<p>O''Connor ran U.S. institutional sales at Pioneer
Investments, according to Morgan Stanley spokeswoman Alyson Barnes. He starts Aug. 23 in New York and will report to Lisa Jones, global head of sales. </p>
<p>Gregory Fleming, head of the investment-management
division, also hired Paul Julius as chief financial officer of
the unit, Barnes said in an e-mail. Julius joins the New York-

he was chief administration officer since January 2007. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer James Gorman hired
Fleming, a veteran of Merrill Lynch  Co., in December to run
the investment-management unit. The division had $220 billion in
assets under management as of March 31, an increase of about 4
percent from a year earlier, according to its website. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp., the second-largest
U.S. oil company, said it''s investigating an oil spill in
Angola, which vies with Nigeria as Africa''s top oil producer. </p>
<p>The size and source of the leak are unknown, Chevron said
today in a statement. Oil washed up on a beach in the region of
Cabinda where Chevron''s local unit, the Cabinda Gulf Oil Co., is
the operator of two concessions with partners including Total SA
of France, Italy''s Eni SpA and Angola''s state oil company
Sonangol. </p>
<p>The origin of the material is not identified, but the
Cabinda Gulf Oil Co. immediately enacted its response plan for
spills in order to minimize the environmental impact, Chevron
said. The company reaffirms that the origin of the substance
is unknown. </p>
<p>The Chevron unit pumped about 500,000 barrels a day off the
coast of Cabinda last year, compared with Angola''s daily
production of 1.8 million barrels. Cabinda is an exclave of
Angola, separated from the rest of the country by a sliver of
the Democratic Republic of Congo. </p>

<p>General Growth Properties Inc., the
second-largest mall owner in the U.S., won court approval to
move forward with its plan to exit bankruptcy as creditors
protest the proposal. </p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Allan Gropper in New York yesterday
approved a summary of the plan, known as a disclosure statement.
Under the plan, General Growth would pay creditors in full and
provide a recovery to shareholders, which is unusual in a
bankruptcy case. </p>
<p>General Growth resolved most objections to the disclosure
statement before yesterday''s hearing. Unsecured creditors still
have significant problems with the plan, said Michael
Stamer, an attorney for the group. Investors including Fairholme
Funds Inc. will be able to receive cash for General Growth bonds
to offset their investments, an option not available to other
bondholders. </p>
<p>Heirs of Howard Hughes also have objected, saying they
won''t get the same recovery as creditors or shareholders.
Creditors can raise their objections when General Growth asks
Gropper to confirm the plan at an Oct. 21 hearing, he said. </p>
<p>General Growth, based in Chicago, filed for bankruptcy last
year after failing to refinance its debt load. The company plans
to emerge from bankruptcy this year with $8.4 billion in
financing. </p>
<p>The case is In re General Growth Properties Inc., 09-11977,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>

<p>American Mortgage Bankruptcy Plan Terms Win Approval </p>
<p>American Mortgage Acceptance Co., a real estate trust
formed in 1991, won approval of the terms of its plan to
reorganize by giving creditors stock in a new company. </p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn in New York yesterday
approved a revised disclosure statement, or description of the
plan to exit bankruptcy. The new disclosure statement limits the
scope of third-party transfers, Glenn said. He had raised the
issue at an earlier hearing. </p>
<p>The company will transfer some assets to Taberna Preferred
Funding I Ltd. to satisfy its claims. New common stock will be
issued to C3 Initial Assets LLC. Other unsecured claims will be
paid in full. Equity holders will get nothing. </p>
<p>In June, the judge refused to approve an earlier draft of
the statement, which gave a blanket release to directors and
officers, prohibiting suits by shareholders and creditors. </p>
<p>As soon as the company''s exit from bankruptcy becomes
effective, it will issue new preferred shares to fund
operations, according to court documents. It will maintain its
status as a real estate investment trust. </p>
<p>Creditors have until Sept. 23 to vote on the plan. </p>
<p>American Mortgage Acceptance filed for bankruptcy in April.
The company, which invests in mortgage loans and other debt
secured by property, had assets of $666.4 million as of Dec.31,
2007, according to court documents. The company''s holdings lost
value after the collapse of the market for mortgage-backed
securities, according to court papers. </p>
<p>The case is In re American Mortgage Acceptance Co., 10-
12196, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York. </p>
<p>HSBC Should Reveal Reports on Madoff Risk, Judge Says </p>
<p>HSBC Holdings Plc, Europe''s biggest bank, should turn over
internal reviews of potential fraud and other operational risks
at Bernard Madoff''s business from 2006 and 2008, a New York
judge ruled. </p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland, in an Aug. 17 ruling,
agreed to ask the High Court in London to order HSBC to hand
over reports, contracts, audio recordings and documents related
to examinations conducted by an affiliate of KPMG International.
HSBC acted as custodian bank for several funds that invested
with the con man. </p>
<p>The last review was commissioned by HSBC in September 2008,
about three months before Madoff''s arrest, according to the
ruling. London-based HSBC and trustee Irving Picard in New York
reached an agreement on which documents should be turned over if
the order is issued, Manhattan court filings show. </p>
<p>Picard is suing hedge funds and other parties that profited
from the $65 billion fraud to repay victims. Madoff, 72, pleaded
guilty last year and is serving a 150-year sentence. </p>
<p>HSBC spokesman Adrian Russell said the company can''t
comment on ongoing litigation. </p>

<p>Goldman Mortgage Denied Protective Order in RQB Bankruptcy </p>
<p>In the Chapter 11 case of RQB Resort LP and RQB Development
LP, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Paul M. Glenn yesterday denied a
renewed motion made by Goldman Sachs Mortgage Co., a unit of
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., seeking a protective order, according
to court files. He did not provide a reason in the order. </p>
<p>Glenn denied the request, writing that the denial was
without prejudice to privileges and confidentiality of Goldman
Sachs Mortgage, which should be preserved and may be claimed. </p>
<p>The term without prejudice means the party is not
barred from asserting rights or claims in the future. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Mortgage asked the court to issue an order
prohibiting the debtors from continuing the deposition of
Goldman Sachs Mortgage witnesses beyond the areas of inquiry
described in the debtors'' notice of deposition. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Mortgage said the topic described in the
notice of deposition related to the company''s valuation of
property underlying a $193 million loan. Goldman Sachs Mortgage
argued that discovery beyond valuation that probed loan analysis
methods should be recognized for its irrelevance and highly
proprietary nature, and therefore prohibited, it said in court
papers. </p>
<p>The case is RQB Resort, 10-01596, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Middle District of Florida (Jacksonville). </p>
<p>N.Y. State''s DiNapoli Reserves Right to Sue Lehman Executives </p>
<p>New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who urged the
appointment of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. examiner Anton
Valukas, said the $132.5 billion state retirement fund reserved
its potential right to undertake appropriate actions to
recover the losses it sustained from its investments in the
bankrupt investment bank. </p>
<p>The New York State Common Retirement Fund lost $216.3
million over three years after it sold Lehman shares, which
traded as high as $82 each in 2007, at 14 cents to 30 cents a
share after the September 2008 bankruptcy, according to a court
filing yesterday. </p>
<p>DiNapoli made the filing to object to Lehman''s disallowal
of the fund''s claim. </p>
<p>The bankruptcy case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
08-13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>

<p>PFF Bancorp Inc., the holding company for PFF Bank  Trust,
yesterday filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, a
monthly operating report for the month of July, 2010 and the
period to date ending July 31. The report showed cumulative cash
in the amount of $6.637 million during the period, and no cash
receipts for the month, according to the report. Cumulative

<p>Fiddler''s Creek LLC, a developer of luxury residential
communities, yesterday filed a financial report for the period
July 1 to July 31, and cumulative figures for the period ending
July 31, the filing showed. Funds at the beginning of July

<p>Neff''s Creditors Ask to File Papers Under Seal </p>
<p>Neff Corp.''s committee of unsecured creditors asked U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Shelley C. Chapman on Aug. 18 to let it file
under seal an unredacted version of a motion asking for
permission to prosecute lender claims. </p>
<p>The final order on debtor-in-possession, or DIP, financing
in the bankruptcy case would release Neff from obligations to
certain lien holders and bar claims or challenges against the
company. Aug. 18 was the deadline for challenging the order,
according to court papers. </p>
<p>Previously, the committee filed a redacted version of the
motion for permission to bring claims challenging the DIP order.
The committee now seeks to file the motion under seal with
confidential information revealed. </p>
<p>Responses to the motion must be filed by Sept. 3 and a
hearing on the request is set for Sept. 9. </p>

<p>Foreclosure </p>
<p>Ackman Group''s Stuyvesant Town Foreclosure Postponed </p>
<p>A New York judge halted a foreclosure auction planned for
next week on Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village, Manhattan''s
biggest apartment complex, as creditors wrangle for control of
the property. </p>
<p>A hearing will take place Sept. 2 on how to proceed,
according to a statement yesterday from CWCapital Asset
Management LLC, the special servicer for the senior mortgage on
the property. Bill Ackman''s Pershing Square Capital Management
LP and Winthrop Realty Trust had scheduled an Aug. 25
foreclosure auction after buying $300 million in defaulted
mezzanine debt. </p>
<p>Senior lenders, who had been given permission to foreclose
in June, also agreed not to initiate an auction before the
hearing, according to an e-mailed statement from Pershing and
Winthrop. The two companies want to take control of the complex
under a plan that senior mortgage holders claim will put the 80-
acre property in bankruptcy. </p>
<p>Bank of America Corp. and U.S. Bancorp, trustees for
holders of the $3 billion senior mortgage, sued to stop the
venture''s foreclosure yesterday. The complaint, filed in the New
York state Supreme Court in Manhattan, claims the Pershing and
Winthrop plan violates terms of an existing agreement among
creditors. New York State Supreme Court Justice Richard Lowe is
overseeing the case. </p>
<p>As junior creditors, Pershing and Winthrop must pay senior
lenders $3.66 billion, which covers the first mortgage plus
interest and penalties, before they do anything that might put
them in control of the property, according to the lawsuit. </p>
<p>The Pershing and Winthrop venture agreed to a short
adjournment of the auction until legal objections raised by
the senior lenders, represented by CWCapital, are resolved in
court, the companies said in the statement. </p>
<p>Tishman Speyer Properties LP and BlackRock Inc. bought
Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village for $5.4 billion in 2006, a
record New York commercial real estate deal at the time. They
stopped payments on the $3 billion senior mortgage in January
after the development''s value sank and the owners failed to
raise rents as fast as anticipated. </p>
<p>The case is Bank of America Corp. v. PSW NYC LLC, 10-
651293, New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan (New York
County). </p>
<p>Statistics </p>
<p>Municipal Bond Ratings Cuts Outnumber Upgrades, Fitch Reports </p>
<p>Ratings cuts on U.S. state and municipal bonds outnumbered
increases for the sixth consecutive quarter amid lingering
budget pressures, the longest streak since at least 2002, Fitch
Ratings said. </p>
<p>Fifty-seven public-finance issues representing $71.2
billion were downgraded and 36 valued at $28 billion were
upgraded in the three months ended June 30, Fitch said yesterday
in a report. The ratio of ratings cuts to increases was 1.6-to-
1. That''s down from the first quarter, when it was almost 2-to-
1. Fitch assigned negative outlooks to 246 credits in the second
quarter, down from 305 in the previous three-month period,
according to the report. That''s the first decrease in the number
of negative outlooks since the fourth quarter of 2007. More than
90 percent of ratings had a stable outlook on June 30, the
report said. </p>
<p>In the tax-supported bond sector, downgrades outnumbered
upgrades by 44 to 18, Fitch said. </p>
<p>Downgrades/Other Ratings Actions </p>
<p>Transocean''s Senior Unsecured, Short-Term Ratings Downgraded </p>
<p>Transocean Inc.''s senior unsecured and short-term ratings
were downgraded by Moody''s Investors Service, the ratings
company said in a statement. </p>
<p>The senior unsecured rating was downgraded Aug. 18 to Baa3
from Baa2. The downgrade was made with a negative outlook,
Moody''s said in the statement. The short-term rating was
downgraded to Prime-3 from Prime-2, Moody''s said. </p>
<p>In addition, Moody''s also downgraded ratings for debt at
unit Transocean Worldwide Inc., which was formerly known as
Global Santa Fe, and at unit Global Marine Inc., to Baa3 from
Baa2. The ratings company left those two ratings under review
for further downgrade, it said in the statement. </p>
<p>The downgrade to Baa3 is a result of Moody''s view that
Transocean potentially faces significant liability exposure
due to its involvement in the blowout and subsequent oil spill
from the Macondo well and a concern as to whether it will be
fully protected under its indemnification from BP, said Ken
Austin, Moody''s Vice President. </p>
<p>DigitalGlobe''s Liquidity Rating Downgraded by Moody''s </p>
<p>DigitalGlobe Inc.''s speculative grade liquidity rating has
been downgraded to SGL-3 from SGL-1 by Moody''s Investors
Service, the rating company said in a statement. </p>
<p>The action reflects Moody''s concern that the accelerated
timeline of constructing the next generation imaging satellite,
WorldView-3, will weaken the company''s liquidity over the next
12 to 18 months, according to the statement. </p>
<p>Moody''s affirmed all of the company''s other ratings,
including the Ba3 corporate family rating, the Ba3 probability
of default rating, and the Ba3 rating on the senior secured
notes, the ratings company said in the statement. </p>
<p>The outlook remains stable, Moody''s said. </p>
<p>Radio One on Review for Possible Downgrade by Moody''s </p>
<p>Radio One Inc.''s ratings were placed on review for possible
downgrade by Moody''s Investors Service, according to a statement
released by the ratings company. </p>
<p>Approximately $650 million of rated debt is affected,
Moody''s said in the statement. The ratings placed on review
include Radio One''s Caa1 corporate family rating, and its Caa2
probability of default rating. </p>
<p>The review stemmed from the company''s announcement that
Radio One''s bank group blocked its August 15 interest payment
on the 6.375% senior subordinated notes due 2013, Moody''s said
in the statement. The bank group has the ability to block the
interest payment as Radio One has been in violation of the total
leverage covenant under its credit agreement as announced in
July, Moody''s said in the statement. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc.''s cancer treatment
Sutent failed in a large-scale study to improve overall survival
in patients with a form of lung cancer. </p>
<p>The drug, when combined with Roche AG''s Tarceva, improved
the length of time patients lived without their tumor
progressing, though that didn''t translate into an overall
benefit in survival when compared with Tarceva alone, the New
York-based company said today in a statement. </p>
<p>Sutent was approved in 2006 to treat cancer of the kidneys
and digestive tract by chocking off a tumor''s blood supply.
Researchers from Pfizer, the world''s biggest drugmaker,
theorized the drug would show similar effects in other tumor
types and began studying it in a wide range of cancers. Since
its approval, Sutent has failed to show a benefit in cancer of
the liver, breast, and colon. </p>
<p>We believe that the statistically significant improvement
in progression free survival is an important finding, said
Mace Rothenberg, vice president of clinical development and
medical affairs for cancer at Pfizer, in the statement. Over
the next few months, we will conduct an in-depth analysis to
gain further insight into these results and determine whether we
can identify one or more subgroups of non-small cell lung cancer
patients for a future trial in either previously untreated or
recurrent disease. </p>
<p>Further Analysis </p>
<p>Pfizer said it will analyze the results to see if there
were any subgroups of patients who may have benefited. The
drugmaker is continuing to study Sutent for certain types of
prostate cancer and kidney cancer, the statement said. </p>
<p>Today''s study was from the final stages of testing required
to get U.S. approval for treating advanced non-small cell lung
cancer. In the study, Pfizer looked at the effects of Sutent in
combination with Tarceva in about 900 previously treated
patients. The company started the study in September 2007. </p>
<p>Lung cancer killed 159,000 people in the U.S. last year and
219,000 new cases were diagnosed, according to the National
Cancer Institute. About 85 percent of people with lung cancer
will die within five years of being diagnosed because the
disease usually isn''t caught until its late stages and there are
few effective treatments, according to the American Cancer
Society. </p>
<p>Pfizer said it plans to release the full results of the
study, called SUN-1087, in October at the European Society for
Medical Oncology Congress in Italy. </p>

<p>A California man accused of leaking
Walt Disney Co.''s earnings information pleaded guilty to
conspiracy and wire fraud in Manhattan federal court. </p>
<p>Yonni Sebbag, 30, and his girlfriend, Bonnie Hoxie, the
former assistant to Disney corporate communications chief Zenia Mucha, were arrested in California on May 26 for leaking
confidential stock tips about the entertainment company''s
earnings. Sebbag has been jailed since his arrest. </p>
<p>From March 2010 to May 26, 2010, I agreed with others to
commit securities fraud and wire fraud, Sebbag told U.S.
Magistrate Judge James Cott in Manhattan today. I disclosed
material, non-public information about the Walt Disney Company
to outside investors, he said, adding later, I transmitted
via electronic mail that material, non-public information. </p>
<p>Sebbag, who is a Moroccan citizen, faces deportation and a
prison term of as long as 33 months in prison when he is
sentenced by U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones, Cott said. </p>
<p>Prosecutors say Sebbag sent letters in March to at least 33
investment companies, including hedge funds, offering to sell
confidential information about Burbank, California-based Disney. </p>
<p>On March 11, an undercover agent with the Federal Bureau of
Investigation began reaching out to the pair, according to a
criminal information filed in New York. On May 8, the two gave
undercover FBI agents internal Disney documents, according to
the filing. </p>
<p>None of the funds acted on the tips, a person familiar with
the matter said. Disney said it cooperated with prosecutors. </p>
<p>Wire Fraud </p>
<p>The charge of wire fraud carries a statutory term of as
long as 20 years in prison, Cott said today. As part of his
guilty plea, Sebbag also agreed to forfeit the $15,000 he
received from the undercover FBI agent as part of a scheme. The
government said the evidence against Sebbag included audiotape
and videotaped evidence of Sebbag soliciting the FBI agent who
was posing as a hedge fund manager. </p>
<p>His lawyer, Steven Kartagener, said his client isn''t
cooperating with prosecutors. </p>
<p>Mr. Sebbag has come forward and accepted full
responsibility for his misconduct, Kartagener said in an
interview after court. The foundation of this guilty plea was
a fair basis to go forward and ultimately resolve this matter. </p>
<p>Cott set a Nov. 16 court date in the case. No sentencing
date has been set by Judge Jones, Cott said. </p>
<p>Criminal charges are pending are pending against Hoxie, who
remains free on bail. Her lawyer, Robert Baum, couldn''t be
immediately be reached for comment. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Hoxie, 10-mag-01113, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Icecek AS, a bottler of

<p>Net income at Coca-Cola Icecek was 73.8 million liras
($48.6 million) compared with 151.8 million liras in the second
quarter of last year, the company said in a filing with the
Istanbul Stock Exchange today. Profit was expected to be 80.6

<p>The Federal Reserve will probably
ease monetary policy further as the U.S. economy weakens, said
Jan Hatzius, chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in
New York. </p>
<p>The Fed will eventually move to additional monetary
stimulus via asset purchases or other unconventional measures,
Hatzius said in a radio interview today with Tom Keene on
Bloomberg Surveillance. Should the Fed opt for more
securities purchases, he said, there is no point in doing
anything less than $1 trillion. </p>
<p>Fed policy makers on Aug. 10 made their first attempt to
bolster the economy in more than a year, saying they will
maintain their holdings of securities at $2.05 trillion to
prevent money from draining out of the financial system. The
Federal Open Market Committee, in its statement, said the pace
of recovery in output and employment has slowed in recent
months. </p>
<p>Sales of previously owned U.S. homes slumped 27 percent in
July, the National Association of Realtors said today in a
report that pointed to further weakening of the economy.
Hatzius, speaking before the home-sales data, predicted gross
domestic product will expand at a 1.5 percent annual pace in the
second half of the year, and unemployment will rise to 10
percent next year from 9.5 percent currently. </p>

<p>Investors face defaults on
government bonds given the burden of aging populations and the
difficulty of increasing tax revenue, according to a Morgan
Stanley executive director. </p>
<p>Governments will impose a loss on some of their
stakeholders, Arnaud Mares in the firm''s London office wrote
in a research report today. The question is not whether they
will renege on their promises, but rather upon which of their
promises they will renege, and what form this default will
take. The sovereign-debt crisis is global and it is not
over, he wrote. </p>
<p>Rather than miss principal and interest payments,
governments may choose a soft default in which they pay back
debts with devalued currencies resulting from faster inflation
or force creditors to take lower returns, Mares said in an
interview. </p>
<p>Borrowing costs for so-called peripheral euro-region
nations from Greece to Ireland surged today, resuming their
ascent on concern that governments won''t be able to cut their
budget deficits. Standard  Poor''s lowered Ireland''s credit
rating yesterday on the rising cost of supporting nationalized
banks. </p>
<p>Population trends may be a better predictor of the ability
to meet obligations rather than debt as a percentage of gross
domestic product, which doesn''t reflect governments'' available
revenue and is backward-looking, Mares wrote. </p>
<p>While the U.S. government''s debt is 53 percent of GDP, one
of the lowest ratios among developed nations, its debt as a
percentage of revenue is 358 percent, one of the highest, the
report said. Italy has one of the highest debt-to-GDP ratios, at
116 percent, yet has a debt-to-revenue ratio of 188, Mares said. </p>
<p>Double Dip </p>
<p>Outright sovereign default in large advanced economies
remains an extremely unlikely outcome, in our view, the report
said. But current yields and break-even inflation rates
provide very little protection against the credible threat of
financial oppression in any form it might take. </p>
<p>Mares, who didn''t identify which nations may default, once
worked at the U.K.''s Debt Management Office and is a former
senior vice-president at credit-rating company Moody''s Investors
Service. </p>
<p>Note that a double-dip recession would not invalidate
this conclusion, Mares'' report said. It would cause yet
further damage to the governments'' power to tax, pushing them
further in negative equity and therefore increasing the risks
that debt holders suffer a larger loss eventually. </p>
<p>Investor concern that the U.S. may fall back into recession
has grown in recent weeks as data missed economists'' estimates.
A Citigroup Inc. index of U.S. economic data surprises fell to
minus 59 last week, the least since January 2009. </p>
<p>Credit-Default Swaps </p>
<p>A report from the Commerce Department today showed U.S.
durable goods orders increased 0.3 percent, compared with the 3
percent median estimate of 75 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News, figures showed today in Washington. The number of
unemployment claims unexpectedly shot up by 12,000 to 500,000 in
the week ended Aug 14, Labor Department figures showed Aug. 19. </p>
<p>Yields on German and U.S. benchmark securities sank today
as investors sought the safest assets. U.S. two-year Treasury
yields, at a four-month high 1.18 percent on April 5, fell to a
record low 0.4542 percent yesterday. </p>
<p>Greek Debt Yields </p>
<p>The yield on Greek debt rose to more than 900 basis points
above that of Germany today, the most since the European Union
and International Monetary Fund created a 750 billion-euro ($948
billion) bailout package in May. Greece''s so-called yield spread
over German debt was at 932 basis points as of 2:18 p.m. in
London, short of the 973 basis-point record set on May 7. The
Irish-German yield spread rose to a record 347 basis points,
from 318 points yesterday. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps that insure Irish government bonds
against non-payment for five years rose 21 basis points to 331
today, the most since March 2009, according to data provider
CMA. Greek swaps jumped to 921.5, the most since June, from 896. </p>
<p>The conflict that opposes bondholders to other government
stakeholders is more intense than ever, and their interests are
no longer sufficiently well-aligned with those of influential
political constituencies, such as elderly voters and their
claims on pensions and health insurance, Mares wrote. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley today ended a bet
against the euro as U.S. economic weakness may take a while
to influence Europe while the Federal Reserve moves closer to
easing policy further.  </p>
<p>While we have been very vocal in recent weeks calling for
dollar strength against the euro, the risk-reward has
deteriorated and the risks of further easing measures by the
Federal Reserve on September 21 are perhaps building, analysts
led by London-based Stephen Hull wrote in a note today.
While it is likely that European data will eventually slow if
the current bout of weakness in U.S. data continues, it might
take a while to feed through. </p>
<p>The short euro-dollar bet had a 20 percent weighting in the
strategy team''s portfolio of trade recommendations and was ended
with a profit of 326 basis points, or 3.26 percentage points,
the analysts wrote. The euro rose 0.1 percent to $1.2638 as of
8:56 a.m. in New York after falling to a six-week low of 
$1.2588 yesterday. </p>

<p>Recent reports on jobless claims and manufacturing point to

O''Neill said, referring to quantitative easing. He spoke in an

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the bank
with the biggest trading profits on Wall Street, is losing
market share underwriting corporate bonds as it seeks to boost
its image as a company adviser rather than a $900 billion hedge
fund. </p>
<p>The most profitable firm in Wall Street history has slipped
to 10th in helping the world''s companies raise debt, down from
ninth last year and as high as third place in 2003, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Its share of this year''s $1.9
trillion in global offerings dipped to 3.7 percent, from an
average 4.8 percent in the previous 10 years. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein is working to
restore the New York-based firm''s reputation as an advocate for
its customers after agreeing last month to pay a record fine to
settle U.S. allegations it misled clients over sales of a
mortgage-linked security. Goldman Sachs''s 35,000 employees help
governments finance schools and roads and provide advice and
capital to companies to invest in their growth, Blankfein,
55, said before Congress in April. </p>
<p>Goldman is struggling a little bit here, said Richard Bove, an analyst at Rochdale Securities in Lutz, Florida. It
has to overcome some pretty sizable public relations issues,
which are related to the way it does business and the products
it creates. The company is good enough to overcome all of this
stuff, but it would be hard for me to imagine that there''s no
impact as a result of what we''ve seen over the last 12 to 18
months. </p>
<p>Taking a Hit'' </p>
<p>Blankfein has said the firm''s clients have stuck with it
after agreeing to pay a $550 million fine to the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission in connection with allegations that it
misled investors in securities that bet on subprime mortgages.
While not acknowledging or refuting improper conduct, Goldman
Sachs said it made a mistake by failing to disclose a hedge
fund that helped construct the investment was also planning to
bet against it. </p>
<p>Definitely Goldman Sachs''s reputation took a hit,
Blankfein said in a Bloomberg Television interview in May. And
that''s certainly reflected in people''s attitudes to the firm
now. And that''s something that we have to work on. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs has retained its top spot in advising
companies on mergers and acquisitions, with 165 deals this year
and is second in equity offerings, with a 9.5 percent market
share of the $258 billion raised. Equity offerings amount to 13
percent of the total raised through corporate bonds this year. </p>
<p>Bond Bonanza </p>
<p>When you think of Goldman Sachs and you think of our investment-banking and our market-making across the board and
our money-management, we have one of the biggest client
franchises out there, maybe the biggest, Blankfein said.
This is a tough, competitive market with clients that can
sometimes border on the cynical in terms of their
expectations. </p>
<p> Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York,
declined to comment on the firm''s bond underwriting business. </p>
<p>Deposit-rich lenders JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Deutsche Bank
AG have climbed in the league tables at the expense of Goldman
Sachs as companies tap the bond market for some of the lowest
yields on record. The banks began to dominate the market more
than a decade ago after the repeal of Depression-era laws that
separated investment and commercial banking. They won business
in part by using their bigger balance sheets to lend directly to
companies. </p>
<p>Banks Rise </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank, is leading global
underwriting for the third straight year while Deutsche Bank, Germany''s biggest lender, is ranked second, up from an average
rank of 4.6, Bloomberg data show. New York-based JPMorgan has a
6.8 percent share of the market, down from an average 7.3
percent, while Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank has 5.9 percent, up
from an average 5.5 percent. </p>
<p> Barclays Capital in London, which bought Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.''s North American division in 2008, has climbed to
fourth from an average of eighth. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs also has dropped in U.S. corporate bond
underwriting, where it holds a bigger share. The bank is sixth
this year, down from as high as third in 2005, Bloomberg data
show. Its U.S. share has dwindled to 7.3 percent from as high as
9 percent in 2005 and an average of 7.9 percent the previous 10
years. </p>
<p>Core Deposits </p>
<p>Borrowers want an underwriter that has the balance-sheet
strength of a real commercial bank with investment banking
capabilities as opposed to an investment bank with these nominal
commercial banking facilities like Goldman Sachs, said Charles Geisst, a finance professor at Manhattan College in Riverdale, New York, who has written about Wall Street''s history. </p>
<p>JPMorgan had quarterly average assets of $1.99 trillion
last year, including $112.8 billion in commercial and industrial
loans, Federal Reserve filings show. It held $548.2 billion of
core deposits. Goldman Sachs''s quarterly average assets of
$880.3 billion included $1.5 billion of commercial and
industrial loans. It had core deposits of $19.4 billion. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is generally bullish on opportunities across
markets, Therese Esperdy, the global head of debt capital
markets at the bank in New York, said in a statement.
Spokespeople for Deutsche Bank and Barclays didn''t comment. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is holding steady in businesses where profit
margins are highest. It''s second in global equity underwritings,
in line with an average rank of 1.7 the previous 10 years,
Bloomberg data show. The average fee in that market this year
has been 3.3 percent, compared with 0.5 percent in corporate
bond underwriting. </p>
<p>MA Dominance </p>
<p>It also has advised on more mergers and acquisitions than
any other firm, with $289.7 billion in deals this year. MA
advisory generates about 40 percent of the investment-banking
industry''s revenue, according to a Sanford C. Bernstein  Co.
report reviewing the industry''s performance from 2000 to 2007. </p>
<p>Trading of fixed-income securities and derivatives,
currencies and commodities generated an unprecedented $7.39
billion of revenue in the first quarter for Goldman Sachs,
following overall record net earnings of $13.4 billion in 2009. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs averaged $348.5 million a quarter in revenue
from debt underwriting the last 20 quarters. That''s less than 10
percent of the average $3.68 billion a quarter during the same
period from trading in fixed income, currency and commodity
markets, data compiled by Bloomberg from earnings presentations
show. </p>
<p>Expanding Competition </p>
<p>It''s a little early to tell that there''s been major
reputational damage, said Ricardo Kleinbaum, a credit analyst
at BNP Paribas in New York. In periods of lower economic
growth, there tends to be less financing needs and less MA and
advisory business, and therefore it is a negative for investment
banking in general. </p>
<p>Part of the erosion may be at the expense of all
underwriters as competition intensifies. The average amount of
deals for the top 10 underwriters has shrunk to $93.4 billion
this year from $118.7 billion in the corresponding period of
2007. </p>
<p>New bond issues earned bankers $18.8 billion in fees in
2009 from debt underwriting, a 31 percent increase over 2008 and
equal to the record set in 2007, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Securities firms haven''t dominated debt underwriting league
tables since 1999 when Congress repealed the Glass-Steagall Act.
For more than 60 years, the law separated investment and
commercial banking by prohibiting federally insured banks from
underwriting securities and other investment banking activities. </p>
<p>Merrill Lynch  Co., which was bought in 2009 by Bank of
America Corp., Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs were ranked
first, third and fourth in global bond underwriting in 1999,
with a combined market share of 19.4 percent. </p>
<p>Historically, they were 1, 2 or 3, Geisst, 63, the
author of Wall Street: A History, said of Goldman Sachs
before the repeal of Glass-Steagall. </p>
<p>From 2000 to 2009, Goldman Sachs''s average rank in global
corporate bond underwriting was 6.7. Morgan Stanley, which
slipped to seventh the past two years, averaged 5.4 percent. Its
share this year is 4 percent, down from an average 5.3 percent. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley hired Sean Chao, a
UBS AG veteran of almost 18 years, as chief executive officer of
its Taiwan unit. </p>
<p>Chao, 55, will join the New York-based bank in early
December and be based in Taipei, Morgan Stanley said in an e-
mailed statement today. He was head of UBS''s Taiwan operations. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley ranks first in advising on mergers and
acquisitions involving Taiwanese companies this year, while UBS

is seeking to expand its fixed-income and private-banking
businesses in Taiwan, according to the statement. </p>
<p>Chao will replace Gary Kuo, who quit in July. Kuo joined
Barclays Plc as co-head of investment banking for China, Hong
Kong and Taiwan, two people with knowledge of the matter said
last month. </p>
<p>Chao joined UBS in Taipei in 1993 after working at Westpac
Banking Corp. in Sydney and Taipei. He was UBS''s head of Taiwan
investment banking from 1993 to 2004, and chairman of asset
management on the island from 2004 to 2005, Morgan Stanley said. </p>
<p>Chris Cockerill, a spokesman at UBS in Hong Kong, confirmed

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., UBS AG and
15 other banks are competing to manage the share sale of state-
run Steel Authority of India Ltd., part of a record asset-sale
program by the government. </p>
<p>The banks will be asked to make presentations on Aug. 31
and Sept. 1, Steel Secretary Atul Chaturvedi said today in a
phone interview from New Delhi. Morgan Stanley, Bank of America
Corp., Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc, Nomura Holdings Inc.
and SBI Capital Markets Ltd. also submitted bids for managing
the public offer, likely to be made in January, he said. </p>
<p>Steel Authority plans to sell a 5 percent stake and the
government will sell an equal share in a follow-on public sale.
The offer is part of the Indian government''s plan to sell a
record 400 billion rupees ($8.5 billion) of assets this year as
it aims to contain fiscal deficit. </p>
<p>We plan to have at least five banks for managing the
share sale, Chaturvedi said. </p>
<p>Shares of Steel Authority rose as much as 1.9 percent to
188.75 rupees and traded at 188.15 rupees as of 12:17 p.m. in
Mumbai. The key Sensitive Index, or Sensex, was little changed. </p>
<p>Share sales by government-controlled companies are
producing near-zero fees for Wall Street banks that charge an
average of about 4 percent of money raised for U.S. offerings,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. As many as 20 banks still
compete for each state sale, betting the league-table credits
will help them win more investment-banking work in Asia''s third-
largest economy. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. told traders
who bet on commodities for the firm''s account that their unit
will be closed as the company, the second-biggest U.S. bank by
assets, starts to shut down all proprietary trading, according
to a person briefed on the matter. </p>
<p>The bank eventually will close all in-house trading to
comply with new U.S. curbs on investment banks, said the person,
who asked not to be identified because New York-based JPMorgan''s
decision hasn''t been made public. </p>
<p>Closing the proprietary trading desk for commodities
affects fewer than 20 traders, one in the U.S. and the rest in
the U.K., the person said. The unit is based in London, and
traders there were given notice on Aug. 27 that their jobs were
at risk as required by U.K. law, according to the person.
Proprietary traders in fixed-income and equities, who account
for 50 to 75 employees, will need to find jobs when those desks
are shut down, this person said. </p>
<p>Congress passed restrictions on financial firms this year
designed to prevent a recurrence of the 2008 credit crisis,
which almost caused the banking system to collapse. Proprietary
trading involves transactions made on behalf of the bank rather
than its customers. The curbs are known as the Volcker rule,
named after former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, who
campaigned for limits on risk-taking by lenders. </p>
<p>The Volcker rule may cost JPMorgan as much as $1.4 billion
in annual profit, analysts at Barclays Capital led by Jason Goldberg estimated in a June 28 research report. </p>
<p>Revenue Goes Away </p>
<p>This revenue and the risk it carries with it now goes
away, said Christopher Whalen, a Federal Reserve Bank of New
York analyst in the 1980s and co-founder of Institutional Risk Analytics in Torrance, California. This will put more pressure
on JPM to look for growth outside the U.S. market. </p>
<p>JPMorgan traders will be given a chance to apply for jobs
elsewhere in the company, according to the person. JPMorgan
spokeswoman Kimberly Weinrick declined to comment. </p>
<p>Coal derivatives trader Chan Bhima, who made a bad bet on
coal prices that the New York Post said cost JPMorgan as much as
$250 million in the second quarter, isn''t affected by the cuts,
the person said. The proprietary trading desk reports to
commodities head Blythe Masters, who discussed Bhima''s trade and
other matters in a July conference call with her team. </p>
<p>U.S. banks are exploring ways to comply with the new
trading rules. Citigroup Inc. was looking at three options to
meet the new rule, including moving a team of proprietary
traders into its hedge-fund unit, people briefed on the matter
said in July. The bank would set up the traders as hedge-fund
managers and seed their funds, then raise money from outside
investors to redeem its stakes, the people said. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. and Bayer AG revealed
study results today that may give their medicines a foothold in
a $10-billion-a-year market to prevent clots that cause strokes
and deadly lung damage. </p>
<p>The research provided evidence that Pfizer''s apixaban and
Bayer''s Xarelto are as safe as existing therapy, which may ease
concerns among doctors who are seeking a replacement for
warfarin, a powerful and unwieldy blood thinner used for more
than a half-century. Apixaban beat aspirin at preventing strokes
in patients with irregular heartbeat, while Xarelto matched
standard treatments for clots in the legs and lungs. </p>
<p>At stake is a share in a warfarin-replacement market that
could reach $10 billion to $20 billion a year, according to an
estimate from Seamus Fernandez, an analyst with Leerink Swann 
Co. Doctors and patients will insist on using a replacement
as soon as one is available for warfarin, which requires regular
blood tests and can leave patients vulnerable to deadly clots or
uncontrollable bleeding at too low or high a dose, said Ralph
Brindis, president of the American College of Cardiology and a
cardiologist at Oakland Medical Center in California. </p>
<p>We''re getting pretty close to the holy grail in finding a
replacement for warfarin, Brindis said in an interview. I
don''t know which one is going to win or lose in that family, but
the body of evidence is growing. </p>
<p>Pfizer rose 5 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $15.91 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading, while partner
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. rose 23 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
$26.08. Bayer rose 1.15 euros, or 2.4 percent, to 48.18 euros in
Frankfurt trading, and partner Johnson  Johnson fell 28 cents,
or 0.5 percent, to $57.02 in New York. </p>
<p>Boehringer''s Pradaxa </p>
<p>Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH may be the first drugmaker to win
U.S. approval of a revolutionary alternative to warfarin, which
is derived from rat poison. U.S. regulatory advisers will review
Pradaxa, already approved in Europe to prevent clots following
hip and knee surgery, on Sept. 20. </p>
<p>Pradaxa, apixaban and Xarelto interfere with the body''s own
clotting mechanisms to minimize strokes, lung clots and extended
leg clots, commonly at a risk of increased bleeding, Brindis
said. Apixaban, which is still being tested, and Xarelto, which
is approved in Europe for hip and knee surgery patients, appear
to be effective and safe, perhaps safer than the current
standard, he said. </p>
<p>Apixaban Results </p>
<p>Patients who took apixaban were 54 percent less likely to
have a stroke or damaging clot than those who took aspirin in a
study of 5,600 patients who couldn''t use warfarin, researchers
said today at the European Society of Cardiology conference in
Stockholm. Apixaban and aspirin showed a similar risk of major
bleeding, a feared side effect of blood thinners, according to
the study, dubbed Averroes after a 12th century Islamic
philosopher. </p>
<p>The use of aspirin will probably be reduced after this
study, said Harald Arnesen, a professor at Ullevaal University
Hospital in Oslo. </p>
<p>Warfarin typically reduces the rate of stroke 40 percent
more than aspirin, Larry Biegelsen, a New York-based analyst for
Wells Fargo Securities, wrote in a note to investors on Aug. 30.
That''s a less potent effect than apixaban showed in today''s
trial. </p>
<p>Results from the larger 18,000-patient Aristotle study
comparing apixaban with warfarin in patients with an irregular
heartbeat called atrial fibrillation are expected in the first
half of next year, Tim Anderson, a New York-based analyst with
Bernstein Research, said today in a note to clients. </p>
<p>Xarelto Results </p>
<p>Aspirin isn''t the recommended treatment simply because
there''s significant amounts of clinical data that shows that in
fact protection is greater on warfarin, said Nick Turner, a
London-based analyst at Mirabaud Securities, in a telephone
interview today. So exactly how well a drug compares to
aspirin is probably not that significant. </p>
<p>Xarelto matched the standard therapy of Sanofi-Aventis SA''s
Lovenox plus warfarin at blocking blood clots in the lungs and
legs, researchers said today in a study of more than 3,400
patients. Some 2.1 percent of those in the Xarelto group
developed clots compared with 3 percent of people taking the
older standard treatments. </p>
<p>Patients who took Xarelto were 33 percent less likely to
develop either clots or major internal bleeding, Bayer said. The
Leverkusen, Germany-based drugmaker is developing Xarelto with
Johnson  Johnson. About 8.1 percent of patients in both
treatment groups developed serious bleeding, the study found. </p>
<p>The company designed the study, dubbed Einstein-DVT, to see
whether the once-a-day pill could match the existing therapies,
which are very, very effective, said lead researcher Harry Bueller, of Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam. </p>
<p>Bayer''s Plans </p>
<p>Medicines to prevent clots after knee surgery or in the
lungs and legs are a small part of the blood thinner market,
said Flemming Oernskov, head of the women''s health and general
medicine unit at Bayer. The much bigger market is in atrial
fibrillation, Oernskov said in an interview. </p>
<p>Bayer has said it plans to present its trial on Xarelto
versus warfarin in atrial fibrillation patients at the American
Heart Association conference in November. </p>
<p>We think that when all indications are there, we have all
the trials and it has worked out well, it could be for us as a
company over 2 billion euros in annual revenue, the Bayer
executive said. You can imagine this market will be several
factors higher than the 2 billion euros. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. asked a federal
judge to throw out a lawsuit by bankrupt Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc., accusing the bank of helping cause its collapse. </p>
<p>The New York-based lender, in papers filed with U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge James M. Peck in Manhattan on Aug. 25, said
that when the securities firm teetered on the brink of collapse
in 2008, it was the only major bank that continued to extend
credit to it. </p>
<p>JPMorgan typically extended more than $100 billion in
credit each day to LBI for the settlement and clearance of its
securities transactions, the bank''s attorneys said in the
filing. </p>
<p>The case is scheduled to be tried in 2012 in U.S.
bankruptcy court in Manhattan. </p>
<p>Lehman Brothers, with $639 billion in assets, filed the
biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history in September 2008. In May,
the New York-based firm sued the bank, alleging that JPMorgan
took advantage of the stricken firm. </p>
<p>On the brink of LBHI''s bankruptcy, JPMorgan leveraged its
life and death power as the brokerage firm''s primary clearing
bank to force LBHI into a series of one-sided agreements and to
siphon billions of dollars in critically needed assets, Lehman
said in the complaint. </p>
<p>Securities, Real Estate </p>
<p>Peck in March approved the bank''s return of $9 billion in
illiquid securities and difficult-to-value real estate to
Lehman, and its taking back cash and collateral from the firm.
The combatants reserved the right to later challenge and defend
the legitimacy of their claims. </p>
<p>Lehman, in its May complaint, alleged JPMorgan -- which was
its main short-term lender before the bankruptcy -- helped cause
its collapse by demanding $8.6 billion in collateral as credit
markets contracted in 2008. </p>
<p>JPMorgan could have avoided the vast bulk of its exposure
by declining to extend credit to LBI on any morning, the
lender''s lawyers said in their request. </p>
<p>The bankruptcy case is In Re: Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc., 08-13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). </p>
<p>The adversarial proceeding is Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.

<p>Pfizer Inc.''s experimental blood
thinner apixaban beat aspirin in a study that may open the door
to a $10 billion-a-year market to prevent clots that cause
strokes and deadly lung damage. </p>
<p>Patients who took the Pfizer drug were 54 percent less
likely to have a stroke or damaging clot than those who took
aspirin in a study of 5,600 patients who couldn''t use the
standard therapy warfarin, researchers said today at the
European Society of Cardiology conference in Stockholm. Apixaban
and aspirin showed a similar risk of major bleeding, a feared
side effect of blood thinners. </p>
<p>About half of the 2.2 million Americans with atrial
fibrillation, an irregular heartbeat that increases the
likelihood of clots, don''t take warfarin because of side effects
or the need for constant monitoring, studies show. Today''s
results leave no competition for apixaban in the foreseeable
future for that group of patients and signal the drug could
challenge warfarin, said lead investigator Stuart Connolly, of
the Population Health Research Institute at McMaster University
in Ontario, Canada. </p>
<p>You can definitely conclude that apixaban is going to
have a markedly improved safety profile compared to warfarin,
Connolly said in an interview in Stockholm. You can also
anticipate that apixaban is going to be at least as good as
warfarin and probably better than warfarin in efficacy. </p>
<p>Warfarin typically reduces the rate of stroke 40 percent
more than aspirin, Larry Biegelsen, a New York-based analyst for
Wells Fargo Securities, wrote in a note to investors on Aug. 30.
That''s a lower rate than apixaban showed in today''s trial.
Results from a larger 18,000-patient study comparing apixaban
with warfarin in atrial fibrillation patients are expected early
next year, Barbara Ryan, an analyst with Deutsche Bank in New
York, said in a note to clients. </p>
<p>Replacing Warfarin </p>
<p>Pfizer, partnering with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., is racing
to challenge German drugmaker Boehringer-Ingelheim GmbH in the
market for pills to replace warfarin. Crafted from rat poison 65
years ago, warfarin can cause fatal bleeding at high doses and
leave patients vulnerable to clots if too little is given. </p>
<p>Aspirin is the only alternative now for irregular heartbeat
patients for whom warfarin is too risky, Connolly said. </p>
<p>This is a major advance for these patients, the
researcher said. The effects are really important to
individuals, and they''re going to be important to society. </p>
<p>Atrial fibrillation means the heart doesn''t properly pump
blood out of its upper chamber, allowing it to pool and clot,
according to the American Heart Association. A stroke can result
if part of that clot breaks off and gets lodged in the artery to
the brain. </p>
<p>Trial Stopped </p>
<p>Pfizer and Bristol-Myers, both based in New York, stopped
their Averroes study comparing apixaban to aspirin ahead of
schedule in June, after an early analysis showed it cut the rate
of strokes and certain clots. Both companies are looking for new
drugs to plug a hole in revenue after their top-selling pills
face generic competition. </p>
<p>Pfizer will start losing the majority of revenue next year
for its cholesterol pill Lipitor, the top-selling drug in the
world with $11.4 billion in sales last year. Meanwhile, Bristol-
Myers is likely to face competition in the U.S. in 2012 for
Plavix, the anti-clotting drug it markets with Sanofi-Aventis
SA. </p>
<p>The companies may ask regulators to approve apixaban for
irregular heartbeat patients on the basis of the Averroes trial
alone, Seamus Fernandez, an analyst with Leerink Swann  Co.,
wrote in a note to investors on Aug. 30. The market for warfarin
replacements may be worth $10 billion to $20 billion a year,
Fernandez wrote in an earlier note. </p>
<p>Bayer Data </p>
<p>Apixaban may face competition from Xarelto, an anti-clot
pill from Bayer AG and Johnson  Johnson, as well as from
Boehringer Ingelheim''s Pradaxa. In a separate study released at
the meeting in Stockholm today, Bayer said Xarelto was as safe
and effective as the standard therapy of Sanofi-Aventis SA''s
Lovenox plus warfarin at preventing blood clots in the lungs and
legs. </p>
<p>Bayer has said it will issue data on how its blood thinner
Xarelto matched up against warfarin at the American Heart
Association''s meeting in November. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is
scheduled to review Pradaxa on Sept. 20. The blood thinner beat
warfarin at preventing strokes in atrial fibrillation patients
last year in a trial. </p>
<p>"These medications are going to change the practice in the
United States," Ralph Brindis, president of the American College
of Cardiology and a cardiologist at Oakland Medical Center, told
journalists before today''s results were released. Being first to
market in the U.S. "is huge," he said. </p>

received a loan extension on $2.3 billion in debt. </p>
<p>The largest top-rated portion of the bond, containing $272
million in debt maturing in 10 years, yields 165 basis points
more than the benchmark swap rate, according to a person
familiar with the sale who declined to be identified because
terms aren''t public. Similar securities sold in 2006 and 2007,
when property values peaked in the U.S., yesterday yielded about
2.68 percentage points more than Treasuries maturing in about
the same time, according to Barclays Plc data. </p>
<p>Wall Street is seeking to revive the market for bonds
backed by commercial property loans after issuance plummeted 95
percent to $11.2 billion in 2008 from a record $234 billion in
2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. JPMorgan''s Centro
deal is the sixth sale this year. The most recent offering, also
tied to a single loan, was a $660 million deal for Vornado
Realty Trust last month. </p>
<p>Half of this year''s sales have been linked to properties of
a single borrower. In 2007, offerings of as much as $7.6 billion
contained as many as 300 loans from multiple U.S. borrowers,
Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Commercial property values have tumbled 41 percent since
2007, according to the Moody''s/REAL Commercial Property Price
Index. Landlords are having trouble paying off existing loans
amid tighter underwriting standards and lower occupancy rates
for hotels, skyscrapers, apartments and warehouses. </p>
<p>Centro''s net loss for the year ended June 30 was A$652.7
million ($582.9 million) compared with a net loss of A$3.5
billion a year earlier, the Melbourne-based company said in a
statement to the Australian stock exchange yesterday. The
company wrote down A$487.9 million of properties, compared with
A$2.7 billion last year. </p>
<p>The shares slipped 5.7 percent yesterday after it announced
results. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. agreed to buy closely
held FoldRx Pharmaceuticals Inc. as it looks to expand into
medicines for rare disorders. </p>
<p>FoldRx, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is focused on
developing treatments for conditions caused by the improper
folding of proteins, Pfizer said today in a statement. Financial
terms of the deal weren''t disclosed. </p>
<p>The deal fits with Pfizer''s strategy of focusing on
medicines for niche diseases, Geno Germano, head of Pfizer''s
specialty care unit, said in a telephone interview. Pfizer set
up a research division in June focused on developing medicines
for orphan diseases, classified as conditions affecting less
than 200,000 people. More than 30 million Americans have one of
6,000 orphan diseases, according to the National Organization
for Rare Disorders. </p>
<p>Within our research organization we established a
specific research unit focused on rare disorders and this fits
nicely into that area of focus, Germano said today. Rare
diseases are an aspect of our portfolio that we think is very
attractive, and we are eager to see and continue development. </p>
<p>Pfizer, the world''s biggest drugmaker, contacted FoldRx
eight weeks ago after one of its researchers saw a scientific
poster presented by the company, Richard Labaudiniere, FoldRx''s
chief executive officer, said in a telephone interview. He said
the company was founded in 2004 from a technology project
developed at the Scripps Research Institute. </p>
<p>Lipitor Copies </p>
<p>Pfizer is looking to make acquisitions to help offset some
of the revenue it will start losing next year when generic
copies enter the market of its Lipitor cholesterol pill, the
world''s top-selling medicine with $11.4 billion in 2009 sales.
Pfizer Chief Financial Officer Frank D''Amelio said in August
that the drugmaker is looking for bolt-on transactions worth
as much as several billion dollars. </p>
<p>Pfizer, based in New York, rose 37 cents, or 2.3 percent,
to $16.28 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. </p>
<p>FoldRx''s most advanced drug, tafamidis meglumine, is in the
final stages of testing required to get regulatory approval in
the U.S. to treat transthyretin amyloid polyneuropathy, a fatal
disorder of the nervous system that affects about 8,000 people
worldwide, Labaudiniere said. The condition starts in most
patients around age 40 and kills them within 10 years, he said.
The company had filed for approval of the treatment in Europe. </p>
<p>In Development </p>
<p>FoldRx is also working on drugs in earlier stages of
testing for Parkinson''s disease, Huntington''s disease, cystic
fibrosis, and a rare heart condition called transthyretin
amyloid cardiomyopathy. All of its research is focused on
developing chemical compounds, rather than injectable biologics. </p>
<p>Treatments designated by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration as orphan medicines get an additional seven years
of market exclusivity in addition to the standard 20 years of
patent protection, according to the FDA website. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s financial adviser on the acquisition was Jefferies
 Co. and its legal adviser was Ropes  Gray LLP. Goldman, Sachs
 Co. served as FoldRx''s financial adviser, while Mintz, Levin,
Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo P.C., provided legal advice. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, has appointed Ray Eyles as chief
executive officer of its commodities business in Asia, according
to an e-mail sent to Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>Eyles, 40, was the global head of commodity proprietary
trading based in London, and he will replace Oral Dawe in
Singapore, who will be retiring, the e-mail said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan has told traders who bet on commodities for the
firm''s account that their unit will be closed as the company,
starts to shut all proprietary trading, according to a person
briefed on the matter. The bank eventually will close all in-
house trading to comply with new U.S. curbs, said the person. </p>
<p>Oral and Ray will work closely on a transition plan,
Blythe Masters, head of the bank''s global commodities group,
said in the e-mail. Ray has a long-term connection in the
region, having worked in Singapore twice previously. </p>
<p>Eyles, who joined JPMorgan in 1988, was formerly chief
executive officer for Europe, Middle East and Africa commodities;
co-head of global commodities; and head of global metals and
agriculture, the e-mail said. He was based in Singapore from
1997 to 2000, and again from 2005 to 2007 to start and then
develop JPMorgan''s Asian commodity business, the e-mail said. </p>
<p>Dawe, who is Asia-Pacific chief executive officer of the
bank''s global commodities group, joined JPMorgan in 2008 from
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., where he was co-head of Asia
commodities. Under him, the bank built a first-class franchise
through our sales and trading capabilities across the region and
in establishing and strengthening our operations in both
physical and financial products, Masters said. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. kept its ESPN, ABC
and other networks on Time Warner Cable Inc. systems while
negotiations to resolve a fee dispute extended through a
midnight deadline. </p>
<p>The sides are still talking and programming is still on the
air, Maureen Huff, a spokeswoman for New York-based Time Warner
Cable, said in an e-mail at 6 a.m. local time. </p>
<p>About 13 million Time Warner Cable subscribers would have
lost ESPN and Disney Channel in a blackout. Customers in New
York, Los Angeles, and Raleigh, North Carolina, would lose ABC
as well. A standoff would threaten Disney''s advertising revenue,
and potentially trigger defections at Time Warner Cable. </p>
<p>Sticking points in the negotiations have included whether
Time Warner Cable should pay Disney for its ESPN3.com website
and if it should carry Disney Jr., the preschool service Disney
is converting from SoapNet next year, a person familiar with the
negotiations said last week. </p>
<p>Burbank, California-based Disney is probably seeking at
least 50 cents per subscriber per month for ABC, and as much as
a 10 percent increase on its cable fees, said Andrew Kim, an
analyst at Macquarie Capital in New York. </p>
<p>ESPN Programming </p>
<p>In addition, Disney requested 10 cents a month per Web
customer for ESPN3.com, said the person with knowledge of the
negotiations, who declined to be identified because the talks
are private. ESPN, the most expensive channel on the dial,
received $4.08 per customer monthly on average from pay-TV
operators last year, while the Disney Channel brought in 88
cents a month per subscriber, according to researcher SNL Kagan. </p>
<p>Time Warner Cable fell 49 cents to $54.47 at 9:41 a.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares gained 30
percent this year before today. Disney advanced 29 cents to
$33.80 today and had risen 3.9 percent in 2010. </p>
<p>In January, Time Warner Cable almost lost Fox-owned TV
station programming after a fee battle with parent News Corp.
The dispute was later resolved in overnight talks. In March,
Disney struck a deal with Cablevision Systems Corp. for its ABC
stations after a dispute blacked out the opening minutes of the
Academy Awards for Cablevision''s 3.1 million New York-area
customers. </p>
<p>For about two decades, the owners of networks gave away
broadcast rights for their stations, relying on higher
programming fees for their cable networks or better channel
positioning to help drive sales. Disney, like other broadcast
network owners, has been seeking fees for its ABC network, in
addition to asking for higher prices for its cable networks and
introducing new Web fees. </p>
<p>Time Warner Cable has tried to stem costs by resisting
increased fee demands. In national campaigns, Chief Executive
Officer Glenn Britt has asked subscribers to pressure
programmers to keep costs low. Britt said that higher fees
ultimately are billed to the customer and that network
programming is free on the Internet and over the air. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. and HSBC
Holdings Plc are among six banks that may manage a 10 percent
share sale in Steel Authority of India Ltd., according to three
people with knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>Deutsche Bank AG, Enam Securities Pvt., Kotak Mahindra
Capital Co. and SBI Capital Markets Ltd. may also be hired to
manage the sale by the government and the New Delhi-based
company, the people said, declining to be named before a public
announcement. Steel Authority fell 22 percent this year, valuing
a 10 percent stake at almost 78 billion rupees ($1.6 billion). </p>
<p>The lowest bid for fees was 0.00000000001 percent,
according to two of the people, or less than 1 paisa. The
selected banks must match that to win the mandate, according to
government guidelines. As many as 20 banks compete for each
stake sale, betting that league-table credit will help them win
more investment-banking work in Asia''s third-largest economy. </p>
<p>Selling the stake in Steel Authority would help Prime
Minister Manmohan Singh''s administration meet its target of
raising 400 billion rupees in the year to March 31. The
government has raised about 20 billion rupees since April 1,
even as Indian companies sold 259 billion rupees in equity,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Underwriter Rankings </p>
<p>Citigroup Inc. is ranked first in managing share sales in
India this fiscal year, followed by IDFC Capital Ltd. and Kotak
Mahindra Capital, the data showed. </p>
<p>R.K. Singhal, spokesman for Steel Authority, declined to
comment today. Chairman C.S. Verma wasn''t immediately available.
Spokespeople at the banks didn''t immediately reply to an e-mail
seeking comment. </p>
<p>Steel Authority, the nation''s second-largest producer of
the alloy, will issue new shares amounting to 5 percent of its
total equity, according to a notice posted in the Economic Times
on Aug. 2. The government, which holds an 85.8 percent stake in
the New Delhi-based company, will sell 5 percent, according to a
statement on the disinvestment department''s website. </p>
<p>Bank of America Corp., Credit Suisse Group AG, Edelweiss
Capital Ltd., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., IDBI Capital Ltd. and
IDFC are among 17 banks that bid to manage this offering,
according to the statement. JM Financial Ltd., Morgan Stanley,
Nomura Holdings Inc., Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and UBS
AG also submitted bids, it said. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. is pulling out of an
agreement with Celldex Therapeutics Inc. to fund the development
of an experimental brain tumor vaccine. Celldex shares fell the
most in almost two years. </p>
<p>The vaccine called rindopepimut, or CDX-110, is no longer
a strategic priority of Pfizer, which will return the rights
to the therapy to Celldex Nov. 1, Needham, Massachusetts-based
Celldex said today in a statement. </p>
<p>The treatment is in the second of three stages of testing
generally required to win U.S. regulatory approval. New York-
based Pfizer, the world''s biggest drugmaker, licensed rights to
the product in 2008 from Celldex for as much as $440 million,
plus royalties. If approved, the brain cancer vaccine could have
$450 million in peak annual sales and come on the market in
2013, Joseph Pantginis, an analyst at Roth Capital, said in May. </p>
<p>We see this as a tremendous opportunity for Celldex, our
shareholders and patients, said Chief Executive Officer
Anthony Marucci, on a conference call with investors today. We
believe rindopepimut is very well-positioned to advance into
pivotal clinical studies. </p>
<p>Celldex fell $1.25, or 26 percent, to $3.53 at 4 p.m. in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Celldex has no approved products,
and the vaccine is its most advanced treatment in testing. </p>
<p>Funds Needed </p>
<p>Celldex will need to raise additional money to fund late-
stage testing, Marucci said. The company, with 100 employees,
had $65.8 million in cash and short-term assets as of June 30.
Celldex doesn''t need another partner to move the drug forward in
development, Marucci said. </p>
<p>The treatment is designed to ramp up the body''s immune
response to fight off the tumor. The vaccine targets the
molecule called epidermal growth factor receptor variant III,
which plays a role in cell growth. The strategy could be applied
to breast, ovarian and prostate cancer as well. </p>
<p>Pfizer spokesman Curtis Allen declined to comment on the
specifics of why the drugmaker was terminating the agreement
with Celldex. </p>
<p>As part of Pfizer Oncology''s ongoing prioritization of
assets across its broad research and development portfolio, the
Company will be terminating its license and development
agreement with Celldex Therapeutics for the investigational
compound rindopepimut, said Allen in an e-mailed statement.
Pfizer is working to transition the compound back to Celldex
Therapeutics. Pfizer remains committed to research and
development of new therapies for patients with cancer. </p>
<p>Results from a study presented in May showed 70 percent of
patients receiving the vaccine were alive without their cancer
worsening about eight months after diagnosis. Typically, about
half of patients with that type of tumor survive without the
disease progressing during that time period. The finding,
involving 40 patients, were from an interim analysis of a study. </p>

<p>They''re trying to make a bold move to get ahead of the
market, said Jim Kinney, vice president of luxury sales for
Baird  Warner, a residential brokerage in Chicago. This time
next year, that house is not going to be on the market. They''re
going to find whatever it takes to get it sold. </p>
<p>Dimon and his wife Judith bought the house in 2000 for $4.7
million, according to records on the website of the Cook County
Recorder of Deeds. The mansion, built in the late 1800s, has
eight bedrooms and nine full bathrooms. Dimon first listed it
for sale in April 2007 for $13.5 million. </p>
<p>The property, near Lake Michigan and Oak Street Beach, has
a rooftop terrace, wine vault and gym, according to the listing.
Located on the corner of tree-lined Astor and Banks streets, it
lies in one of the city''s most expensive neighborhoods and is
among the largest homes in the Gold Coast. </p>
<p>Thomas Kelly, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment. Janet Owen, the listing agent for the
property, didn''t immediately return a telephone call seeking
comment. </p>
<p>Dimon bought the house, at 25 E. Banks St., when he headed
Chicago-based Bank One Corp. Dimon, 54, helped engineer the sale
of Bank One to JPMorgan Chase in 2004. </p>
<p>The latest price cut was reported earlier today by Business
Insider. </p>
<p>Sales of single-family homes and condominiums in Chicago
fell 20 percent to 1,589 in July from 1,975 a year earlier, the
Illinois Association of Realtors said Aug. 24. The median price
dropped 20 percent to $196,500 from $245,000. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley will be replaced by
Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. as the presenting sponsor of the
Memorial Tournament, an annual U.S. PGA Tour event hosted by
Jack Nicklaus, beginning in 2011. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s seven-year sponsorship of the tournament,
which is held at Nicklaus''s Muirfield Village Golf Club in
Dublin, Ohio, ended after this year''s event. </p>
<p>Financial terms weren''t disclosed. </p>
<p>Nationwide''s agreement with the Memorial extends through
the 2016 tournament, the PGA Tour said in a press release. The
Columbus, Ohio-based insurance company''s title sponsorship of
the Nationwide Tour, a professional circuit one level below the
PGA Tour, will end after the 2012 season. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, owner of the world''s biggest brokerage,
kept a low profile at the tournament the past two years after
members of Congress criticized the spending by financial-
services firms who had received funds as part of the U.S.
government''s Troubled Asset Relief Program. </p>
<p>In 2009, the New York-based company replaced the event''s
annual pro-am competition, in which 54 Morgan Stanley executives
played alongside professionals, with a Skins competition
involving Tiger Woods, Nicklaus and other pros. </p>
<p>The departure of Morgan Stanley comes a day after Deutsche
Bank AG extended its sponsorship of this week''s FedEx Cup
tournament near Boston. </p>
