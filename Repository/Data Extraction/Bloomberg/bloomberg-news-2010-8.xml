&lt;p&gt;ABC has its &#8220;work cut out&#8221; to
reverse a decline in ratings, said Paul Lee, the executive named
last week to lead the Walt Disney Co. television network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee headed Disney&#8217;s ABC Family cable channel until Steve McPherson unexpectedly resigned as president of ABC
Entertainment Group on July 27. The executive, who introduced
shows like &#8220;Pretty Little Liars&#8221; aimed at young female viewers
at ABC Family, said he will &#8220;take some risks&#8221; in his new role
to pull the broadcast network out of third place. He stopped
short of saying he&#8217;d target a millennial demographic at ABC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The way to program a cable network is to do one thing and
do it well,&#8221; Lee told writers at the semi-annual Television
Critics Association today in Beverly Hills, California. &#8220;A
broadcast network is a much larger canvas.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee said he will seek to create a brand identity at ABC,
much as CBS has done with procedural dramas and Fox with shows
that appeal to younger men. He said ABC, the only major
broadcaster to decline in ratings last season, is known for
&#8220;smart&#8221; programs. He mentioned &#8220;Dancing With the Stars,&#8221; and
shows he called &#8220;sexy&#8221; like &#8220;Grey&#8217;s Anatomy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The London-born Lee, 50, founded the BBC America cable
channel before joining Disney in 2004. He said he was
vacationing with his wife on a California beach when he was
approached to take the ABC job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You have more time in cable to stick with a show,&#8221; Lee
said. &#8220;But we are always a slave to ratings.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABC was the only major U.S. broadcaster to lose viewers
last season and was also down in the 18-to-49-year-old group
that advertisers seek, according to Nielsen Co. The network is
adding six dramas to its schedule starting in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Body of Proof&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new shows include  including &#8220;Body of Proof,&#8221;
starring Dana Delany, and &#8220;Detroit 1-8-7,&#8221; which revolves
around a homicide unit in the city. It also picked up the comedy
&#8220;Mr. Sunshine,&#8221; featuring Matthew Perry as the manager of a
San Diego sports arena. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Paul has been very supportive of us so far, just as Steve
was,&#8221; said Jason Richman, executive producer of &#8220;Detroit 1-8-
7,&#8221; which will air on Tuesdays. &#8220;We&#8217;re just going to continue
to do what we&#8217;ve been doing,&#8221; added David Zabel, the show&#8217;s
other executive producer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McPherson established a block of comedy shows on Wednesday
nights last TV season that includes three returning programs:
&#8220;Modern Family,&#8221; &#8220;Cougar Town&#8221; and &#8220;The Middle.&#8221; Lee
predicted that &#8220;Modern Family,&#8221; nominated for the Emmy award
for best comedy, will win. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Upfront Sales&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABC sold about $2.4 billion in ads ahead of the new season
for its full-day schedule, with average prime-time rates rising
8 percent to 9 percent, a person with knowledge of the matter
said on June 9. ABC sold 75 percent to 80 percent of its
inventory, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By comparison NBC, last in prime-time viewers, sold about
$2.5 billion in advertising, with rates rising about 7 percent,
another person said on June 10. The network pre-sold about 70
percent of its prime-time inventory, that person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s largest media company, fell 2 cents to
$33.69 on July 30 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
The shares have climbed 4.5 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company may sell a quarter of the unit, NZZ reported. A

&lt;p&gt;A federal judge ruled against a

information about the 2005 acquisition of Jamdat Mobile Inc. by
Electronic Arts Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Susan Decker" date="Aug 02, 2010  5:43 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-02/microsoft-wins-six-year-patent-battle-that-targeted-its-xbox-game-system.html"><headline>Microsoft Wins Patent Lawsuit That Targeted Xbox Game Systems</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest
software maker, won a court ruling that its Xbox video-game
system doesn&#8217;t infringe a patent over multiplayer gaming, ending
a six-year legal battle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Paul D. Borman in Detroit on July 20
dismissed the 2004 lawsuit against Microsoft brought by
inventors Peter Hochstein and Jeffrey Tennenbaum along with
Harold Milton Jr., who owns rights to the patent. The men had
been demanding royalties on Xbox sales, plus an order barring
further use of their invention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent, issued in 1994, is for a device that lets two
or more people play video games together without being in the
same location, such as over a telephone line. The men claimed
that could be construed to cover all systems that can have
multiple players, like the Xbox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borman ruled that the patent only covered game systems that
are electrically connected. Such a connection doesn&#8217;t include
the type of link among players used by the Xbox, the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Michigan men also sued Sony Corp., maker of the
PlayStation video-game system. That case was settled. Lawyers
for the men didn&#8217;t immediately return a message seeking comment.
Kevin Kutz, a spokesman for Microsoft, said the Redmond,
Washington-based company was pleased with the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Hochstein v. Microsoft, 04-73071, U.S. District
Court for the District of Michigan (Detroit). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Peter Eichenbaum and Margaret Collins" date="Aug 02, 2010  4:56 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-02/at-t-verizon-said-to-target-visa-mastercard-with-smartphones.html"><headline>AT&amp;amp;T, Verizon to Target Visa, MasterCard With Smartphones</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;ATT Inc. and Verizon Wireless, the
biggest U.S. mobile carriers, are planning a venture to displace
credit and debit cards with smartphones, posing a new threat to
Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc., three people with direct
knowledge of the plan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partnership, which also includes Deutsche Telekom AG
unit T-Mobile USA, may work with Discover Financial Services and
Barclays Plc to test a system at stores in Atlanta and three
other U.S. cities that would let a consumer pay with the
contactless wave of a smartphone, the people said. The carriers
have been searching for a chief executive officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial would be the carriers&#8217; biggest effort to spur
mobile payments in the U.S. and supplant more than 1 billion
plastic cards in American wallets. Smartphones have encroached
on tasks ranging from Web browsing to street navigation and now
may help the phone companies compete with San Francisco-based
Visa and MasterCard, the world&#8217;s biggest payments networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is definitely a game-changer,&#8221; said industry
consultant Richard Crone of San Carlos, California-based Crone
Consulting LLC. The firm advises card networks, issuers and
phone companies. The mobile carriers &#8220;are the biggest recurring
billers in every market. They are experts at processing
payments,&#8221; Crone said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market Dominance &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa and Purchase, New York-based MasterCard handled $2.45
trillion, or 82 percent, of U.S. consumer spending on general-
purpose cards last year, according to the Nilson Report, an
industry newsletter. That dominance has helped fuel profit
growth for both companies. Visa&#8217;s annual operating income has
grown sixfold since fiscal 2005 to $3.54 billion last year.
MasterCard&#8217;s has surged more than fivefold to $2.27 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa fell 1.5 percent to $72.23 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading and MasterCard declined 3.6
percent to $202.52, the worst performance in the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The service, similar to those already available in Japan,
Turkey and the U.K., would use contactless technology to
complete purchases in stores. They&#8217;d be processed through
Discover&#8217;s payments network, currently the fourth-biggest behind
Visa, MasterCard and American Express Co. Barclays would be the
bank helping to manage the accounts, said the people, who
requested anonymity because of confidentiality agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Logical Next Step&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT and Verizon Wireless are equal partners in the venture
and T-Mobile has a smaller stake, one person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives for the carriers, London-based Barclays and
Riverwoods, Illinois-based Discover declined to comment on the
venture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mobile payments are the logical next step for
consumers,&#8221; said Mark Siegel, a spokesman for Dallas-based
ATT. Siegel, Marquett Smith of Basking Ridge, New Jersey-based
Verizon Wireless, and Peter Dobrow of the Bellevue, Washington-
based T-Mobile unit, all said their companies &#8220;have nothing to
announce.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Discover, spokeswoman Leslie Sutton said the company
&#8220;is always evaluating technology solutions that make things
faster, safer and more convenient.&#8221; Barclays spokesman Kevin
Sullivan said, &#8220;facilitating mobile payments is a big part of
Barclaycard&#8217;s strategy globally.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phone companies probably wouldn&#8217;t replace the biggest
U.S. credit- and debit-card issuers, including JPMorgan Chase 
Co. and Wells Fargo  Co., said Gary Townsend, CEO of Hill-
Townsend Capital LLC, a Chevy Chase, Maryland-based hedge fund
that specializes in financial firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swipe Fees &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What is a cell phone, except a mechanism for consumers to
address their lives in whatever way they choose?&#8221; Townsend said
today in a telephone interview. &#8220;There&#8217;s certainly no reason if
an ATT account can effectively be carried on a phone that a
JPMorgan or a Wells Fargo card can&#8217;t be there, too. In fact, the
antitrust issues would demand that that be allowed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retailers may be eager to help another network after years
of fighting over transaction fees set by Visa and MasterCard.
The merchants persuaded Congress last month to approve caps on
interchange, or &#8220;swipe&#8221; fees, for debit transactions and filed
a 2005 federal antitrust lawsuit that is still pending. The U.S.
Department of Justice is weighing whether to bring a civil
lawsuit against Visa for barring merchants from surcharging
customers who use credit cards, according to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Material, Adverse Effect&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If we change our rules in these areas, this could cause a
material, adverse effect on our business,&#8221; Visa said today in a
regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interchange fees on credit and debit cards exceed $40
billion a year and average about 1 percent to 2 percent of every
transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people with knowledge of the carriers&#8217; venture didn&#8217;t
say how much merchants may be charged per transaction or when
the trial will start. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have long argued that real competition is missing from
today&#8217;s payments market,&#8221; said Brian Dodge, a spokesman for the
Retail Industry Leaders Association, which represents merchants
such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Home Depot Inc. and Target Corp.
&#8220;The emergence of a secure and reliable competing network that
serves the demand from consumers for mobility payment options
and reduces retailers&#8217; costs would be welcomed news.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Tipping Point&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa and MasterCard are benefiting as people abandon cash
and paper checks for cards and electronic payments, which
account for more than half of U.S. consumer purchases, compared
with 36 percent in 2003, according to the Nilson Report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile technology for banking and payments is reaching &#8220;a
tipping point,&#8221; with younger consumers leading the way,
Mercatus LLC, a Boston-based consulting firm, said in a June 7
study. More than half of U.S. consumers, and almost 80 percent
of those between the ages of 18 and 34, will use mobile
financial services within five years, according to Mercatus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Rapid and broad-based consumer adoption of mobile
financial services is imminent,&#8221; as people rely on their phones
to manage every aspect of their lives, said Mercatus Managing
Partner Bob Hedges, former head of retail banking and payments
at Fleet Bank. &#8220;Consumers want it to happen.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MasterCard and Visa have been investing in their own mobile
projects. Visa and Richardson, Texas-based DeviceFidelity, have
developed technology that can transform phones consumers carry
today, including Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPhone, into a payment device that
can store multiple card accounts, said Bill Gajda, head of
mobile for Visa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zong, Bling, Boku &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Visa is in discussions with a number of mobile operators
around the world,&#8221; Gajda said in a July 28 interview. &#8220;We
continue to believe that the best opportunity to create a
secure, scalable, mobile-payment service is by working together,
converging mobile and financial networks, and extending the
value of electronic payments to the mobile channel.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, New York-based Citigroup Inc. introduced
MasterCard PayPass stickers that can be affixed to the back of
mobile phones to make contactless payments at about 230,000 U.S.
merchants, MasterCard spokeswoman Joanne Trout said in an e-
mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Startups based near Silicon Valley, California, such as
Zong, Bling Nation and Boku Inc., offer alternative payment
solutions. Zong users enter their mobile phone numbers to make
purchases on the Internet. Bling Nation works with community
banks and local businesses, allowing customers to &#8220;tap-and-
pay&#8221; with their devices. Boku lets online gamers buy &#8220;digital
goods and social experiences,&#8221; the company says on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Card Is Dumb&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any new payment system may face barriers that prevent the
technology from taking hold in the U.S., the Federal Reserve
Bank of Boston said in a May policy paper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers won&#8217;t demand mobile payments &#8220;until they know
that enough merchants accept them, and merchants will not
implement the technology until a critical mass of consumers
justifies the cost of doing so,&#8221; the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merchants would have to spend an estimated $200 per reader,
and updating mobile phones with embedded microchips would
increase manufacturing costs by $10 to $15 per handset,
according to the Boston Fed. That may be worthwhile if accepting
mobile payments allows retailers to send rewards and information
about promotions to their customers&#8217; phones at checkout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contactless, or near-field communication, technology &#8220;is
no less secure&#8221; than today&#8217;s plastic cards, according to the
Fed. Consumers may also be able to sync their phones to a
computer, allowing them to make purchases even if there&#8217;s no
mobile signal or the battery dies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These are important issues if people are to be convinced
to rely on this technology as an alternative to carrying a
wallet,&#8221; the policy paper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wireless carriers have an advantage over Visa and
MasterCard in the race to control the U.S. payments market
because the phone companies have access to their customers&#8217;
mobile numbers and bank account information, said Crone, the
industry consultant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A mobile device is online, real-time interactivity that
changes the customer relationship,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A card is
dumb.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should sell First Solar
Inc. shares and buy bullish options to profit from a rally by
the world&#8217;s biggest maker of solar power modules while limiting
their risk on alternative energy, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity derivatives strategists Amyn Bharwani and Marko Kolanovic recommended selling First Solar shares and buying
December $125 calls to profit from further gains in the stock.
First Solar has risen 22 percent since June 9 to $126.14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategists cited JPMorgan alternative energy analyst
Christopher Blansett, who said on July 14 that First Solar has
limited potential because the risk of a double-dip recession
will keep energy prices low and because of &#8220;legislative
uncertainty&#8221; in Europe and the U.S. The analyst wrote on July
30 after First Solar&#8217;s second-quarter earnings report that the
&#8220;company continues to execute well, however we remain cautious
due to the declining subsidy outlook in Europe.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blansett has an &#8220;underweight&#8221; rating on the stock with a
December 2010 price estimate of $99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors who agree with the J.P. Morgan analyst and are
long the stock may want to consider replacing their stock with
First Solar call options,&#8221; Bharwani and Kolanovic wrote in a
report today. It is an &#8220;opportune time to realize the gains&#8221;
in the stock &#8220;but continue to have upside exposure through call
options.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Solar, based in Tempe, Arizona, reported July 29 that
second-quarter net income fell 13 percent as panels were held
for use on its own projects, reducing sales to customers, and as
the euro declined against the dollar. The stock has fallen 6.9
percent since then. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samuel Wyly and Charles Wyly, the
Texan brothers and entrepreneurs who funded ads helping George
W. Bush&#8217;s presidential campaigns, were sued by U.S. regulators
who accused them of misleading investors while selling hundreds
of millions of dollars in stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wylys used &#8220;an elaborate sham system of trusts and
subsidiary companies&#8221; in the Isle of Man and Cayman Islands
over a 13-year period to hide control of securities linked to
companies where they were board members, the Securities and
Exchange Commission said July 29 in a lawsuit filed in New York
federal court. They illegally kept investors in the dark as they
sold off holdings, and in one case made illegal insider trades,
the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The cloak of secrecy has been lifted from the complex web
of foreign structures used by the Wylys to evade the securities
laws,&#8221; the SEC&#8217;s deputy enforcement director, Lorin Reisner,
said in a statement. &#8220;They used these structures to conceal
hundreds of millions of dollars of gains in violation of the
disclosure requirements for corporate insiders.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brothers &#8220;intend to vigorously defend themselves --and
expect to be fully vindicated,&#8221; said their attorney, William A. Brewer III in Dallas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Barnes  Noble Files Lawsuits Against Alcatel, Xerox &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnes  Noble Inc., which makes the Nook electronic reader
and sells books from its website, sued Xerox Corp. and Alcatel-
Lucent SA over demands the bookseller pay royalties for patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. subsidiary of Alcatel says the Nook violates seven
of its patents, New York-based Barnes  Noble said in a lawsuit
filed July 29. Xerox says that barnesandnoble.com violates four
its patents, the book seller said in a separate court filing
July 29. Neither claim is valid, Barnes  Noble said in its
lawsuit. It asked the court to rule in its favor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We filed the declaratory judgment actions to make clear,
as outlined in the complaints, that we are not infringing any
valid Xerox and Alcatel-Lucent patents,&#8221; Barnes  Noble
spokeswoman Mary Ellen Keating said in an e-mail. &#8220;We cannot
further comment on pending litigation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary Ward, a spokeswoman for Alcatel-Lucent, declined to
comment in an e-mail. A Xerox spokeswoman didn&#8217;t respond to an
e-mail asking for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are barnesandnoble.com LLC v. Xerox Corp., 1:10-
cv-05758, and Barnes  Noble Inc. v. Alcatel-Lucent USA Inc.,
1:10-cv-05759, both in U.S. District Court, Southern District of

&lt;h2&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.S. Justice Staff Said to Urge Subpoenas for BP Managers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Justice Department attorneys conducting a criminal
probe of the BP Plc well explosion in the Gulf of Mexico have
recommended that a grand jury be convened and BP managers
subpoenaed to determine if any laws were broken, a person
familiar with the investigation said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subpoenas also would target employees of rig operator
Transocean Ltd., said the person, who was briefed by the
attorneys and asked not to be identified. London-based BP is the
majority owner of the well that exploded on April 20, killing 11
workers and triggering the worst oil spill in U.S. history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offshore drilling regulators from the Interior Department
agency formerly known as the Minerals Management Service would
be summoned to testify about the process under which BP received
permits to drill the well about 40 miles (64 kilometers) off the
Louisiana coast, and whether any improper relationships existed
between agency employees and the company, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contractors that worked for BP and Transocean aboard the
rig also might be compelled to testify, according to the person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior Justice Department officials still have to approve a
grand jury, which would be a special panel or one that sits
regularly. The recommendations were made by department attorneys
in Washington and New Orleans, the person said. The panel would
probably meet in New Orleans, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hannah August, a Justice Department spokeswoman, and Kathy
English, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Jim Letten of the
Eastern District of Louisiana, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Fugitive Polly Peck Founder Granted Bail in London &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asil Nadir, the founder of Polly Peck International Plc who
fled to northern Cyprus in 1993, can return to the U.K. on bail
before standing trial in London for embezzling 30 million pounds
($47 million). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nadir&#8217;s bid for bail was granted and he must attend court
in London on Sept. 3, Judge David Bean said at a hearing July 30
at the Old Bailey criminal court. Within eight hours of
returning to the U.K. he must be fitted with an electronic
security tag, Bean said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nadir&#8217;s lawyer, William Clegg, told Bean his client had
agreed with the U.K. Serious Fraud Office, which is prosecuting

police every week and attend his criminal trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Nadir is today anxious to return to this country and
face his trial,&#8221; Clegg said before the ruling. Nadir has
already taken an option to rent an apartment in London, his
lawyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nadir fled the U.K. after he was charged with theft and
false accounting. Polly Peck was a food-packaging firm that
collapsed in 1990 after it failed to pay creditors.
Administrators found more than 700 million pounds were
unrecoverable from the subsidiaries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victor Temple, a lawyer for the SFO, said during the
hearing that the agency would not oppose bail if Nadir appeared
in court to request it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Singapore Death Penalty Book Author Won&#8217;t Apologize &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Shadrake, the British author charged for contempt of
court for challenging the integrity and independence of
Singapore&#8217;s judiciary, said he wouldn&#8217;t apologize for his book
on the city&#8217;s death penalty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I want to have my day in court,&#8221; he said after his trial
was adjourned July 30 to allow his lawyer more time to prepare a
defense of fair criticism and fair comment. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t spend
three years writing the book only to run away,&#8221; Shadrake said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 75-year-old writer is also being investigated for
criminal defamation by Singapore authorities. His book &#8220;Once a
Jolly Hangman: Singapore&#8217;s Justice in the Dock,&#8221; suggests that
the government &#8220;succumbs to political and economic pressures&#8221;
in meting out the death penalty, the Attorney-General&#8217;s Chambers
said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shadrake can &#8220;tender an unreserved apology in unqualified
terms,&#8221; David Chong, chief counsel of the Attorney-General&#8217;s
civil division, said in court July 30. &#8220;Justification is no
defense&#8221; for contempt of court, Chong said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refusing to apologize would count as an&#8220;aggravating
factor,&#8221; the Attorney-General&#8217;s office said in a statement July
30. &#8220;An apology tendered to the court, if unqualified and
sincere, may mitigate the punishment,&#8221; according to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book &#8220;insinuates that the Singapore judiciary is a
tool of the People&#8217;s Action Party to muzzle political dissent&#8221;
through the award of &#8220;heavy damages in defamation actions
brought without legal basis,&#8221; the Attorney General&#8217;s office
said in the court papers. The book contains comments that imply
the Singapore judiciary was &#8220;guilty of impropriety&#8221; by being
&#8220;biased particularly against the weak, poor or less educated,&#8221;
according to the papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shadrake&#8217;s lawyer M. Ravi asked Justice Quentin Loh to
order Chong &#8220;not to put unnecessary fear in the media&#8221; after
the prosecutor told journalists not to cite contentious
statements from the book or risk being in contempt as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Attorney-General v. Alan Shadrake OS720/2010 in
the Singapore High Court. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Roche Holding to Face Hollywood Stars in Accutane Trial &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roche Holding AG faces a lineup of Hollywood stars in the
New Jersey trial of an actor&#8217;s lawsuit alleging he suffered the
loss of his colon after taking the company&#8217;s Accutane acne drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Marshall, who played U.S. Marine Louden Downey in the
1992 hit movie &#8220;A Few Good Men,&#8221; claims his acting career was
derailed by his use of Accutane, which Roche no longer sells.
Marshall will ask a jury to award at least $11 million in
damages at a trial starting next week that will feature
testimony from stars such as Martin Sheen and Brian Dennehy,
according to court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheen, Dennehy and Director Rob Reiner will testify that
Marshall, 43, was headed for stardom before bowel ailments
allegedly caused by Accutane forced doctors to remove his colon,
Michael Hook, the actor&#8217;s lawyer, said in an interview. Basel,
Switzerland-based Roche faces thousands of lawsuits claiming it
failed to warn patients that the drug could cause inflammatory
bowel disease in some users, Hook said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The jury will hear that James Marshall had the potential
to be the next James Dean-like star,&#8221; Hook said. &#8220;That dream
is gone because he took something to treat acne.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roche officials said July 30 that Accutane&#8217;s safety label
contained a warning about the risks of inflammatory bowel
disease for more than 20 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marshall&#8217;s case has been combined with claims by two other
former Accutane users for trial before Judge Carol Higbee in
state court in Atlantic City, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Greenblatt v. Hoffman-La Roche Inc., ATL-l-
1246-06, New Jersey Superior Court, Atlantic County (Atlantic
City). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Facebook Lawsuit Most Popular Docket on Bloomberg &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawsuit by a New York man who claims he owns 84 percent
of Facebook Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest social networking service,
was the most-read litigation docket on the Bloomberg Law system
last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Ceglia, of Wellsville, New York, sued Facebook and its
founder and Chief Executive Officer Mark Elliot Zuckerberg in
state court in New York&#8217;s Allegany County on June 30. In the
suit, Ceglia claims that a contract he and Zuckerberg signed in
April 2003 entitles Ceglia to ownership of most of the privately
held company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said on July 21
that he is &#8220;quite sure&#8221; he never signed such a contract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Zuckerberg, speaking in a TV interview with ABC World &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services company, plans to
sell $1.5 billion of three-year notes, leading a surge in U.S.
corporate bond issuance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM plans to sell the debt as soon as today, according to a
person familiar with the offering who declined to be identified
because terms aren&#8217;t set. New York-based Citigroup Inc. and
ArcelorMittal, the world&#8217;s largest steelmaker, are among at
least five other issuers marketing debt today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s offering comes after U.S. corporate bond issuance set
a record last month and yields on the debt fell to the lowest in
more than four years. Investors are snapping up the debt as 77
percent of companies in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index that
have reported second-quarter earnings beat analysts&#8217; estimates
and manufacturing growth in the U.S. and Britain slowed less
than expected in July, bolstering confidence in the economic
recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Companies are taking advantage of a window of
opportunity,&#8221; said Scott MacDonald, head of credit and economic
research at Aladdin Capital LLC in Stamford, Connecticut. &#8220;The
money is inexpensive and people are willing to buy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s notes may yield 30 basis points, or 0.3 percentage
point, more than similar-maturity Treasuries, said the person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Group AG, Expedia Inc., Omnicom Group Inc.
and Newell Rubbermaid also plan to tap the corporate bond market
as soon as today, according to people familiar with those
offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record Bond Issuance &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continental Airlines Inc. and Arch Coal Inc. may sell debt
later this week, people with knowledge of the transactions said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies sold $85.7 billion of U.S. corporate bonds in
July, the most in that month since at least 1999, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Average yields on the securities
fell to 5.01 percent on July 31, the lowest since April 2004,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a very good time for companies to be issuing debt
and they have excellent balance sheets that they&#8217;re leveraging
as well,&#8221; John Herrmann, a senior fixed-income strategist at
Boston-based State Street Global Markets LLC, said today in a
Bloomberg Television interview. &#8220;We have extremely low rates
and yet at the same time investors are searching for yield over
Treasuries.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on two-year Treasury notes climbed 1 basis point to
0.56 percent after dropping to a record low 0.546 percent. Ten-
year Treasury yields climbed 4 basis points to 2.95 percent.
They touched 2.85 percent, a 15-month low, on July 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use of Proceeds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Barclays Plc and BNP Paribas are
managing IBM&#8217;s offering, the person said. Armonk, New York-based
IBM plans to use proceeds for general corporate purposes, the
person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM spokesman Mike Fay confirmed the maturity of the notes
and the timing of the offering and declined to provide further
details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company last sold debt in November, when it issued $750
million of two-year floating-rate notes and $1.25 billion of
3.5-year fixed-rate securities, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2.1 percent notes due in May 2013 fell 0.136 cent on
July 27 to 102.869 cents on the dollar to yield 1.045 percent,
or 4.9 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s Investors Service assigns IBM a grade of A1 and
Standard  Poor&#8217;s ranks it an equivalent A+. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. gave the
panel investigating the causes of the credit crisis examples of
how it set prices for illiquid mortgage derivatives before the
U.S. rescue of American International Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data provided to the Financial Crisis Inquiry
Commission include mortgage-related trades from May 2007 through
November 2008, which the New York-based firm reported in a nine-
page document on its website. Those trades and other market
information showed that prices were falling, which in turn led
to demands for collateral from AIG, Goldman Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During two days of hearings earlier this year, FCIC members
questioned whether the investment bank deliberately discounted
prices to push markets lower because it had bet on a decline in
the value of subprime mortgage-backed debt. Gary Cohn, Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s president and chief operating officer, and Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar said at the hearings that the
firm&#8217;s prices reflected what it saw in the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the document on its website, Goldman Sachs said &#8220;a
certain degree of judgment was necessary&#8221; in valuing the
transactions. &#8220;We were able to access the best available market
information to price these CDO securities and to ensure that our
pricing represented actual fair market values at the time,&#8221; the
firm said in the document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported the details of Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s response to the FCIC late yesterday on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk Management &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute is at the heart of whether Goldman Sachs had a
role in the near-bankruptcy of AIG or was a careful risk manager
whose focus on marking assets to fair value helped the
securities firm prepare for the credit contraction earlier than
rivals. Goldman Sachs, whose 2007 profit benefited from bets
against securities backed by subprime mortgages, was one of the
biggest buyers of AIG&#8217;s insurance covering such debt and
increased demands for collateral from AIG as prices fell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You guys are net short and you&#8217;re driving down prices,
are you creating a self-fulfilling prophecy?&#8221; Philip N. Angelides, chairman of the FCIC, asked Viniar during the
hearings. &#8220;Were you in fact pushing the market down?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FCIC is investigating what caused the credit crisis,
and will report findings to Congress and President Barack Obama
by December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derivatives are contracts whose value is derived from
stocks, bonds, loans, currencies and commodities, or linked to
specific events. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barnes  Noble Inc., which makes the
Nook electronic reader and sells books from its website, sued
Xerox Corp. and Alcatel-Lucent SA over demands the bookseller
pay royalties for patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. subsidiary of Alcatel says the Nook violates seven
of its patents, New York-based Barnes  Noble said in a lawsuit
filed July 29. Xerox says that barnesandnoble.com violates four
of its patents, the bookseller said in a separate court filing
the same day. Neither claim is valid, Barnes  Noble said in its
lawsuit. It asked the court to rule in its favor by issuing a
so-called declaratory judgment, or statement that the company
isn&#8217;t infringing any valid patents of Xerox and Alcatel-Lucent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnes  Noble spokeswoman Mary Ellen Keating declined to
comment further on pending litigation other than to confirm the
filing of the suit. Mary Ward, a spokeswoman for Alcatel-Lucent,
declined to comment in an e-mail. A Xerox spokeswoman didn&#8217;t
respond to an e-mail asking for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are barnesandnoble.com LLC v. Xerox Corp., 1:10-
cv-05758, and Barnes  Noble Inc. v. Alcatel-Lucent USA Inc.,
1:10-cv-05759, both in U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see the Xerox patents: 5,513,126; 5,689,642; 6,236,994;
and 6,999,962. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panel Doesn&#8217;t Vote on Pfizer&#8217;s Revatio Study in Kids &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. didn&#8217;t get a U.S. panel&#8217;s decision for changes
to a pediatric lung study that, if accepted by regulators, would
give the erection pill Viagra an extra six months on the market
without generic competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside advisers to the Food and Drug Administration were
scheduled to vote July 29 on whether a test measuring blood flow
inside the arteries is sufficient to determine if a form of the
drug, sold as Revatio for adults with pulmonary hypertension,
works for children with the rare lung disorder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel declined to vote because &#8220;the data aren&#8217;t as
perfect as people would like,&#8221; said Robert Temple, director of
the FDA&#8217;s Office of Drug Evaluation, in an interview. The agency
now must decide, without a vote by advisers, whether the blood-
flow test can be used to determine if Revatio works in children,
Temple said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA asked Pfizer in 2001 to study sildenafil in
children with pulmonary hypertension. If the New York-based
company meets FDA requirements for testing the treatment in
children, it will get a six-month patent extension for the drug,
which had 2009 sales of $1.89 billion as Viagra and $450 million
as Revatio. The patents are expected to expire in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KV Pharmaceutical Sues Perrigo Over Gynazole Patent &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KV Pharmaceutical Co. sued generic-drug maker Perrigo Co.,
alleging patent infringement with plans to make low-cost copies
of the drug Gynazole used to treat female yeast infections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KV asked a federal judge in Delaware July 29 to rule that
Perrigo&#8217;s sale of its version of the medicinal cream would
violate U.S. patent laws, and to issue an injunction to stop
Perrigo from marketing the drug until the patent expires in
2017. The suit also seeks attorney fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KV reported a $313.6 million net loss on $312.3 million in
sales for the fiscal year ended in March 2009. The company said
in March it cut more than 200 jobs after manufacturing problems.
Company stock has fallen about 70 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perrigo, which also makes store-brand drugs, reported $2
billion in sales for the fiscal year ended in June 2009. Its
shares have risen about 40 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel Willard, a Perrigo spokesman, didn&#8217;t immediately
return voice and e-mail messages seeking comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is KV Pharmaceutical Co. v. Perrigo Israel
Pharmaceuticals Ltd., 10CV641, U.S. District Court, District of
Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see the patent: 5,993,856. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony, McAfee Sued by Uniloc Over Anti-Piracy Software Patent &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony Corp., McAfee Inc. and other technology companies were
sued by Uniloc USA Inc. over claims they infringe a patent it
holds for anti-piracy software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uniloc claims Sony&#8217;s SecuROM system uses its technology, as
does McAfee&#8217;s Total Protection product. The lawsuit, filed in
federal court in Tyler, Texas, seeks an order barring the
infringement and unspecified damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uniloc persuaded a federal court jury last year to award
$388 million in damages in a patent-infringement claim against
Microsoft Corp. The award against Microsoft was later thrown out
by the trial judge and is on appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activision Blizzard Inc., Quark Inc. and Micro Focus US
Inc.&#8217;s Borland Software were also sued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Santa Monica, California-based Activision
didn&#8217;t immediately return a voice-mail and e-mail asking for
comment, and neither did a spokeswoman at Quark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tracy Ross, a spokeswoman for Santa Clara, California-based
McAfee, declined to comment. A voice-mail left in the legal
department of Sony&#8217;s office in New York wasn&#8217;t immediately
returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Uniloc USA Inc. and Uniloc Singapore Private

&lt;p&gt;Disney to Sell Miramax to Filmyard for $660 Million &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. agreed to sell Miramax to investors
including Ronald Tutor and private-equity firm Colony Capital
LLC for more than $660 million, ending a six-month search to
find a buyer for the art-house moviemaker. Rights to titles are
part of the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale to Filmyard Holding LLC, backed by partners
including construction executive Tutor and Colony, is expected
to be completed by the end of the year, Burbank, California-
based Disney said July 30 in a statement. Disney, the world&#8217;s
largest media company, began winding down Miramax, founded by
brothers Harvey and Bob Weinstein, in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miramax, with rights to more than 700 titles including
Academy Award winners such as &#8220;Chicago&#8221; and &#8220;Shakespeare in
Love,&#8221; was one of several film assets on the block. Liberty
Media Corp. agreed to sell its Overture unit to Relativity Media
LLC last month. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. is seeking buyers after
falling behind on $3.7 billion of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Studios is focusing on film development &#8220;under
the Disney, Pixar and Marvel brands,&#8221; President and Chief
Executive Officer Robert Iger said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Weinsteins sold Miramax to Disney in 1993. The two, who
left in 2005, control rights to some films. Disney had been
seeking $600 million to $700 million for Miramax. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diageo Wins Vodka Protection, ICB Can Still Sell Vodkat Drink &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diageo Plc, maker of Smirnoff, the best-selling vodka brand
in the U.K., won a ruling in London that Intercontinental Brands
Ltd.&#8217;s Vodkat drink misrepresented its contents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICB can only continue to use the name for Vodkat, a mixture
of vodka and neutral fermented alcohol with a citrus base, if it
is &#8220;clearly distinguished&#8221; from vodka, the court of appeal
ruled July 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vodkat is less than half vodka and costs about a third of
the price, according to the judgment. Vodka must contain at
least 37.5 percent alcohol under regulations governing the
drink. The court ruled that ICB should be able to market a
&#8220;vodka-type product&#8221; in such a way that consumers are clear
about what they&#8217;re getting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon Litherland, managing director of Diageo GB, said in a
statement that continued use of the Vodkat name will cause
&#8220;substantial numbers of consumers&#8221; to be misled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICB Director Paul Burton said the company is &#8220;extremely
pleased&#8221; it can continue to sell Vodkat and was always
&#8220;convinced about the merits&#8221; of its case. The judgment
&#8220;encourages&#8221; ICB that it &#8220;may ultimately win the case,&#8221; if
it gets permission to appeal, Burton said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Diageo North America Inc. v. Intercontinental
Brands Ltd., case nos. A3/2010/0411 and A3/2010/0408, Court of
Appeal (Civil Division)). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sparks, who holds a Ph.D. in biochemistry and biophysics
from Texas AM University, counsels clients on general
intellectual property matters, including patent prosecution,
domestic and foreign patent strategy, and due diligence and
patent lifecycle management, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acacia Seeks $250 Million for IP Investment Fund &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acacia Research Corp., a publicly traded firm that invests
in and licenses patents, is raising as much as $250 million for
a private fund to expand its business with big technology
companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which shares licensing revenue with inventors
and patent owners, is asking institutions such as endowments and
pension managers to invest in the Acacia Intellectual Property
Fund LP, according to a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acacia Intellectual Property is asking each investor to
commit a minimum of $10 million, according to a private-
placement notice filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission on July 19. Ryan said the partnership will require a
10-year commitment from investors, equivalent to a private-
equity fund&#8217;s lock-up period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund will allow the company to invest in more patent
agreements without selling additional stock and diluting its
value for existing shareholders. The company will earn an
estimated $44.4 million in management fees for overseeing Acacia

&lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc hired J.P. Xenakis of
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Jonathan Simblist of Macro Risk
Advisors LLC to oversee and expand electronic options trading
and sales in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xenakis, 39, will be a director and head of electronic
options trading distribution and previously was a vice president
of electronic derivatives sales at Goldman Sachs, according to
Bill Bell, head of Americas equities electronic trading
distribution at Barclays in New York. Xenakis will report to
Bell. Simblist, 31, will be a director on the electronic options
trading distribution team and report to Xenakis, Bell said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays is expanding its electronic options trading to
capture a larger share of business from clients executing orders
directly themselves instead of giving their buy and sell
requests to brokers over the phone. Bell said he plans to make
more hires this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;More and more clients are looking at ways to trade more
quickly and more efficiently,&#8221; Bell said. &#8220;The electronic
options market really is a tremendous growth opportunity. Firms
that are not trading options electronically today will be
tomorrow.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to Barclays, Xenakis spent 10 years at Goldman Sachs
and before that was a derivatives marketing manager at the
American Stock Exchange for three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading, Technology &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simblist joined Barclays after two years at Macro Risk, a
New York-based trading and advisory firm that specializes in
equity derivatives where he focused on options execution and
trading technology. Before that he traded options at Bank of
America Corp. for three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronic trading has been fueled by regulatory changes,
competition among eight exchanges and the use of quotes that can
change by a penny for some options contracts. The one-cent
increment decreases the spread, or difference between the bid
and ask prices, enabling traders to employ more electronic
options trading strategies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Options trading remains an intricate process and this
complexity is a prime factor behind the buy-side traders&#8217;
dependence on brokers, especially among those accounts that need
capital, counsel and advice,&#8221; Andy Nybo, a principal at New
York-based research firm Tabb Group LLC, said in a July report.
&#8220;But there is also growing demand for tools and systems that
can make the business of trading options more efficient,
especially among technology-driven strategies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brokers providing electronic options tools mentioned most
often by asset managers, hedge funds and firms trading their own
money are Credit Suisse AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Knight
Capital Group Inc and UBS AG, according to the Tabb report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elpida Memory Inc., the world&#8217;s
third-biggest maker of memory chips, fell the most in a month
in Tokyo trading after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lowered its
rating on concern semiconductor prices will fall next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elpida declined 7.8 percent to close at 1,199 yen on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, the biggest drop since June 25. Japan&#8217;s
benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market for dynamic random access memory chips will
peak in the fourth quarter, Ikuo Matsuhashi, a Tokyo-based
analyst at Goldman, wrote in a July 30 report. Matsuhashi
lowered his rating on Elpida to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;buy,&#8221; a
rating he had maintained since January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It will take at least six to nine months before we can
tell whether Elpida and its peers can avoid losses,&#8221; wrote
Matsuhashi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matsuhashi lowered his 12-month share price estimate on
Elpida, which trails Samsung Electronics Co. and Hynix
Semiconductor Inc. in DRAM production, to 1,600 yen from
2,400 yen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. hired Jose Pagan
to run its public finance operations in South Florida as part of
a planned expansion in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pagan, who has 25 years of experience in public debt
underwriting, will become the fourth member of the bank&#8217;s
municipal finance team in Florida, JPMorgan said. The move was
reported earlier in the Bond Buyer newspaper. Henry Reyes, who
is based in Orlando, remains the group&#8217;s head of public finance
for the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re expanding our already strong presence in Florida
and Jose&#8217;s experience will enhance our efforts in the southern
part of the state,&#8221; said Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for
JPMorgan, in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pagan, who will be based in Miami, worked most recently at
Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan said. Before that he was
employed by UBS AG and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp., the world&#8217;s
second-largest producer of oil from deep-water wells, is seeking
to sell its stake in discoveries off the coast of the Republic
of Congo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon owns a 30 percent stake in the fields, which hold the
equivalent of 500 million barrels of recoverable crude, the
Irving, Texas-based company said in a posting today on
Schlumberger Ltd.&#8217;s asset-sale website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s stake in the resource has a value of about $12
billion at current average New York crude prices for the year.
The Mer Tres Profonde Sud block covers 3,818 square kilometers
(1,474 square miles). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Exxon Mobil has a long-standing practice of continually
reviewing all assets for the contribution to the company&#8217;s
operating needs and financial objectives, as well as their
potential value to others,&#8221; Patrick McGinn, a company
spokesman, said in an e-mailed message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon rose 78 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $62.72 as of 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock fell 11
percent in the past 12 months, the second-worst performance in
the NYSE Arca Oil Index. BP Plc&#8217;s American depositary receipts
had the largest decline among index members, tumbling 23
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An online data room for the Congolese fields will open on
Aug. 9, followed by a physical data room on Aug. 16, according
to the posting. A data room is where potential suitors can get
more information about the geological features and other
characteristics of oil fields. Exxon will accept proposals
through Oct. 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Brazil&#8217;s state-controlled oil
company, is the biggest producer of crude from deep-water
fields, according to PFC Energy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s second-quarter profit
beat analyst estimates after sales were boosted by a weaker
dollar and products from its acquisition of Wyeth. The shares
rose the most in almost 17 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit excluding one-time items was 62 cents a share,
beating the 52 cents average estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, the New York-based company said today in a statement.
Revenue increased 58 percent to $17.3 billion, $696 million more
than analysts had estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales benefited from a $584 million gain in foreign
currency exchange and from the addition of the Enbrel arthritis
treatment and Prevnar pneumonia vaccine from Pfizer&#8217;s $68
billion acquisition of Wyeth last year. The company reaffirmed
its forecast for 2010, saying earnings may be at the higher end
of the target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a major statement by a company that has had a
rough year,&#8221; said Marc Goodman, an analyst with UBS Securities
LLC, in a note to clients. &#8220;This is the kind of quarter that
was needed to rejuvenate investor interest.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer rose 86 cents, or 5.6 percent, to $16.34 at 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the biggest jump
since March 2009. The stock had fallen 2.8 percent in the 12
months before today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twenty-two companies including
Corning Inc. and Northrop Grumman Corp. urged the U.S. Senate to
jump-start a plan to renew dozens of business tax breaks,
pushing back against private-equity firms and companies like
International Business Machines Corp. that oppose the bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corning, Northrop Grumman and companies including American
Express Co., Hewlett-Packard Co. and General Electric Co. that
would benefit from renewed benefits for research activities
urged enactment of the bill in a letter yesterday to Senate
Majority Harry Reid of Nevada and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan would renew dozens of tax breaks for research,
overseas lending and store improvements that expired at the end
of 2009. To help pay for it, the measure would raise taxes on
private-equity fund managers and on global operations of U.S.-
based multinational companies. Democrats tried to pass the plan
earlier this year as part of an extension of unemployment
benefits, though the tax provisions were dropped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The expired provisions are critically important to a wide
range of American businesses (small and large), charities and
individuals,&#8221; said the letter. &#8220;Failure to renew these
provisions will result in reduced economic activity, loss of
American jobs and continued financial uncertainty.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is offering
to give investors in the highest-rated portions of a bond sale
backed by commercial mortgages control in the event the loans go
bad as bankers attempt to revive the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $788.5 million offering gives holders of the safest
portion of the transaction, or about 81 percent of the deal, the
power to direct and replace firms hired to handle loans that
become troubled, according to marketing documents distributed
last week to investors. Typically, that right is held by
investors who buy the smaller, riskiest slice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s &#8220;plowing new ground,&#8221; said Patrick Sargent, a
partner at Dallas law firm Andrews  Kurth LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is attempting to address concern that holders
of the riskiest pieces of commercial mortgage bonds in the $700
billion market may make decisions that favor their interest over
other investors in the transactions when loans sour. Late
payments on office buildings, shopping centers and other
properties jumped to a record 7.71 percent as of June 30, from
2.67 percent a year earlier, according to Moody&#8217;s Investors
Service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a big nod to the AAA buyers,&#8221; Lisa Pendergast, a
strategist at Jefferies  Co. in Stamford, Connecticut, said in
an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A unit of New York-based hedge-fund firm Elliott Management
Corp. bought the slice most likely to take losses in the latest
mortgage-bond offering by Goldman Sachs, according to the
marketing documents. Scott Tagliarino, a spokesman for Elliott,
and Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;B-Piece&#8217; Buyers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors who hold the most-junior slices, or B-pieces, are
first to be wiped out as losses mount and may have an incentive
to keep the debt outstanding rather than foreclose, punishing
other holders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some investors don&#8217;t like the link between the B-piece
buyer and the special servicer,&#8221; Sargent, a member of the
executive committee of the Commercial Real Estate Finance
Council, a New York-based trade group, said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;It was one of the points raised&#8221; by investors in
discussions about how to restart issuance, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Units of special servicers, which are firms that handle
troubled loans, often were buyers of the riskiest portions of
commercial-mortgage bonds, Sargent said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top-rated commercial mortgage-backed securities yield 2.73
percentage points more than Treasuries, compared with 3.95
percentage points more than the benchmark at the beginning of
the year, according to a Barclays Plc index. A year ago, the
debt was yielding a spread of 5 percentage points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Innovative Structure&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offering being marketed by Goldman Sachs and Citigroup
Inc., the fourth sale backed by newly originated commercial
mortgages this year, uses an &#8220;innovative structure,&#8221; according
to Andy Solomon, a managing director at Angelo Gordon  Co. with
$23 billion in assets under management. It still doesn&#8217;t
eliminate potential conflicts of interest, he said in an
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any reason to believe that AAA holders would
influence special servicers to make better decisions for all
bondholders as a group,&#8221; said Solomon, who is based in New York
and oversees $4 billion in commercial-mortgage-backed bonds.
&#8220;These are the same folks that wanted to liquidate loans at
fire sale prices into a no-bid market two years ago.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holders of the top-ranked debt get paid first if the loan
is liquidated, meaning it may be to their advantage to foreclose
sooner rather than later, even if property prices are at a
bottom. U.S. commercial property prices, down 39 percent from
2007 peaks, rose for the second straight month in May, according
to Moody&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher Yielding &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some investors may shy away from buying the lowest-ranked
portion of a commercial-mortgage backed bond deal if they can&#8217;t
exert control over soured loans, though the chase for higher-
yielding assets may make it an easier sell, Sargent said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is an environment where there are more investors for
that riskier slice,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An affiliate of BlackRock Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest asset
manager, bought the non-investment grade portion of a $716.3
million commercial-mortgage bond offering sold by JPMorgan Chase
 Co. on June 11, according to deal documents disseminated to
investors at the time of the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BlackRock affiliate retained &#8220;certain control
rights,&#8221; including directing the special servicer, the
documents show. Lauren Trengrove, a spokeswoman for BlackRock,
declined to comment, as did Brian Marchiony, a JPMorgan
spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs offering comes as banks are trying to
revive the market after sales tumbled 95 percent to $11.2
billion in 2008 from a record $234 billion in 2007, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks arranged $3.4 billion of the securities last year,
and about $1.7 billion has been issued in 2010. The lack of
sales chokes off funding to borrowers with maturing debt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama signed into
law a measure to narrow the sentencing disparity between crack
cocaine and powder cocaine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 1986 law created sentencing rules where it took
possession of 100 times more powder cocaine than crack cocaine
to trigger a five-to-10 year mandatory minimum sentence,
according to Senator Richard Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, chief
sponsor of the bill. The ratio is reduced to 18-to-1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sentences were based on a belief at the time that crack was
more dangerous, more addictive and generated more violence than
the powder form. Experts testifying before Congress said that&#8217;s
wrong, Durbin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 24-year-old law also affected blacks more than whites.
While blacks accounted for 30 percent of crack use, they make up
82 percent of the convictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When one looks at the racial implications of the crack-
powder disparity, it has bred disrespect for our criminal
justice system,&#8221; Attorney General Eric Holder told a Senate
Judiciary Committee in June 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new law also repeals the five-year mandatory minimum
for possession of crack cocaine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measure passed the Senate by voice vote on March 17 and
the House by voice vote on July 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill is S. 1789. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Jef Feeley" date="Aug 03, 2010 12:09 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-03/pfizer-wins-missouri-court-ruling-denying-neurontin-class-action-request.html"><headline>Pfizer Wins Missouri Court Ruling Denying Neurontin Class-Action Request</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, persuaded a Missouri judge to deny class-action
status for a lawsuit alleging the company illegally marketed its
Neurontin epilepsy medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Donald L. McCullin in St. Louis refused on July 27 to
allow Missouri Neurontin buyers to combine claims that Pfizer
sold the drug for unapproved uses and misled users about its
effectiveness, according to state-court filings. Two consumers
sought to have their case certified as a class action to recover
money spent on Neurontin prescriptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The evidence in the record shows Neurontin is effective
for treatment of many conditions,&#8221; McCullin wrote in his 13-
page decision. &#8220;The court cannot certify this putative class
because it appears from the record that it would include more
than a small number of uninjured individuals.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, based in New York, faces at least 400 lawsuits
accusing it of illegally promoting Neurontin. In March, a Boston
jury ordered Pfizer to pay more than $140 million in damages to
an insurer over its marketing practices in connection with the
drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also has settled at least two suits alleging
the drug played a role in users&#8217; suicides, paying almost
$400,000 in one of the accords, people familiar with the deals
said earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Far From Over&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is pleased with McCullin&#8217;s decision, spokesman Chris Loder said today in an e-mailed statement. The judge found the
case wasn&#8217;t suitable for class-action treatment because
potential class members had different types of claims depending
on how the drug worked for them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think this ruling is subject to challenge,&#8221; Gerald
Meunier, a New Orleans-based lawyer representing Missouri
plaintiffs Elizabeth Judy and Stephen Brown, said in a phone
interview. &#8220;This case is far from over.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Neurontin users contend that Pfizer&#8217;s Warner-Lambert
unit intentionally violated federal law by marketing the
epilepsy drug for more than a dozen medical conditions that
weren&#8217;t approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration
regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warner-Lambert officials pleaded guilty in 2004 to criminal
charges filed by the U.S. Justice Department and paid a $430
million fine over allegations the company illegally marketed
Neurontin. Pfizer bought Warner-Lambert for $120 billion in
2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer Law &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Missouri case, lawyers for Judy and Brown argued
that Neurontin purchasers overpaid for the drug based on the
company&#8217;s illegal marketing tactics and deserved to able to join
together in a group suit to recoup that money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also argued Neurontin wasn&#8217;t effective for the non-
approved uses that Warner-Lambert targeted in its marketing
effort. The plaintiffs brought the case under a Missouri
consumer statute, Meunier said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Missouri case is Judy v. Pfizer Inc., 042-01946-02,
Missouri Circuit Court, Twenty-Second Judicial Circuit (St.
Louis). &lt;/p&gt;

Flowers Said to Hire JPMorgan for Bid on Dublin-Based Lender EBS</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;J.C. Flowers  Co., the U.S. buyout
firm, hired JPMorgan Chase  Co. to advise on a bid for
Ireland&#8217;s largest customer-owned lender, three people familiar
with the situation said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J.C. Flowers, run by former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker
Christopher Flowers, retained JPMorgan as it prepared a bid for
EBS Building Society, based in Dublin, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The customer-owned society is seeking to raise 785 million
euros ($1.03 billion) to meet new capital standards set by the
country&#8217;s financial regulator. Irish banks are raising money as
bad debts increase after a decade-long real estate boom
collapsed, with prices falling by half. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ireland&#8217;s government has injected 350 million euros into
EBS and will provide more capital if the building society can&#8217;t
attract private money. Irish Life  Permanent Plc and Dublin-
based Cardinal Asset Management, backed by U.S. buyout firm
Carlyle Group, were also among four companies to submit initial
offers, a person with direct knowledge of the situation said on
July 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some or all of the government cash may be repaid by the
successful bidder. All four initial bids envisaged joint
ownership of EBS with the Irish government, according to another
person. Final bids are due Aug. 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J.C. Flowers said today it plans to inject 50 million
pounds ($79 million) into Kent Reliance Building Society as part
of a plan to acquire more customer-owned lenders in the U.K. The
company is also interested in investments in Spain and Ireland,
David Morgan, J.C. Flowers&#8217; managing director for Europe and
Asia Pacific, said on a conference call with reporters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokeswoman Marie Cheung and Gerry O&#8217;Sullivan, a

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks erased an early slide as
Pfizer Inc. led a rally in health-care companies after reporting
better-than-estimated earnings and energy companies advanced as
oil climbed above $82 a barrel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index slipped less than 0.1
percent to 1,124.86 at 11:38 a.m. in New York after dropping as
much as 0.8 percent earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
decreased 4.85 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 10,669.53
after sinking as much as 73 points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier declines came after weaker-than-estimated data on
home sales, factory orders and consumer spending cast doubt on
the economic recovery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blythe Masters, JPMorgan Chase amp;
Co.&#8217;s head of commodities, sought to reassure her team on an
internal conference call after &#8220;extremely difficult&#8221;
dismissals, defections and a first half in which some results
were as much as 20 percent below expectations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Don&#8217;t panic,&#8221; she said in summing up the 35-minute call,
a recording of which was obtained by Bloomberg News. &#8220;No one&#8217;s
going to get screwed. We&#8217;re not going to do crazy things on
compensation at the end of the year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Masters, who was named to run the business in late 2006,
said the bank began dismissals on July 21, a day before the
call, to trim overlap after buying parts of RBS Sempra
Commodities LLP. The bank cut less than 10 percent of the
combined front office, even as the oil unit lost &#8220;key people&#8221;
who needed to be replaced, she said. She was discussing results
with top executives after &#8220;we made a bit of a rookie error&#8221;
that left the firm &#8220;vulnerable to a squeeze,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 41-year-old banker, who helped develop credit-default
swaps while at JPMorgan in the 1990s, delivered her talk from a
conference room in New York, where the bank is based, less than
a month after the firm closed its $1.7 billion RBS Sempra
purchase. The deal almost doubled the number of corporate
clients the bank can serve for commodities, Jes Staley, Chief
Executive Officer of JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bank, said in
February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Loose Lips&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities trading, the target of new rules from the
regulators, can be volatile and unpredictable -- &#8220;a dangerous
business,&#8221; as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Financial Officer
David Viniar put it three years ago. Hedge fund Amaranth
Advisors LLC collapsed in 2006 under $6.6 billion of losses
after wrong-way bets on natural gas and later sued JPMorgan, its
broker at the time, for derailing a last-minute rescue by
Citadel Investment Group LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is a very, very difficult thing to trade for a
living,&#8221; Masters said. &#8220;And it is very difficult to put on
risk and try to generate results for the company that you work
for in a difficult trading market where chitchats and loose lips
and talk leads to widespread dissemination of both fact and
rumor.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony declined to comment on
the call and didn&#8217;t make Masters available for comment.
JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bank, which houses the commodities
division, employed 26,279 people as of June 30, according to the
company. The firm doesn&#8217;t break out the number of employees
within commodities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Significantly Below Plan&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s fixed-income revenue, which includes
commodities, fell 27.7 percent year-over-year to $3.6 billion in
the second quarter, compared with $4.9 billion a year earlier
and $5.5 billion in the first quarter. The company attributed
the drop to poor results in the credit and commodities markets,
and a squeeze in interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you look at our overall client-driven results across
the entire franchise over the first half of the year, the
printed number leaves us 20 percent below plan,&#8221; she said on
the call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said she hopes the second quarter &#8220;proves to be a
record bad quarter for us in that there&#8217;s nothing but upside
from here,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The outcome was both significantly
below plan, significantly below last quarter and significantly
below the year-ago linked quarter,&#8221; she said. The unit would
have been in position to meet goals for the first half except
for $83 million in revenue that the company deferred booking
during the first six months &#8220;for a variety of sensible
reasons.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competitors Are &#8216;Scared&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Masters said the market is still &#8220;choppy&#8221; and that
competitors who exited the market have returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve got too many banks chasing too little volume and
margins have compressed,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, competitors are &#8220;scared shitless of us,&#8221; said
Masters, who is based in New York and joined the bank in 1991
after internships that began in 1987. &#8220;They&#8217;d better be,
because this is a platform that&#8217;s going to win.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The layoffs, split about evenly between JPMorgan and RBS
Sempra, weren&#8217;t evidence of &#8220;panicking&#8221; by the bank, said
Masters, who received a bachelor&#8217;s degree in economics from
Cambridge University&#8217;s Trinity College, which says it has
produced 32 Nobel Prize winners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who left of their own accord mostly came from RBS
Sempra, Masters said, and were mainly in &#8220;global physical
oil.&#8221; Many of them joined smaller commodity-trading firms with
less capital, choices she characterized as &#8220;very interesting
career decisions.&#8221; Masters didn&#8217;t name any of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not &#8216;Running Away&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You should think of this as business as usual and
definitely not a reaction to losses in coal, or anything like
that,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not because we are panicking. It is not
because we are changing our minds, backing off, backing out,
backing down, running away, none of the above.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Masters said had she spent the previous several days in
meetings with Staley, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon and
the investment bank&#8217;s operating committee and was preparing a
&#8220;deep dive&#8221; with JPMorgan&#8217;s board and Chief Financial Officer
Doug Braunstein. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When you have a bad quarter or a bad year, you should
expect to spend a lot of time with senior management explaining
yourself,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I have worked very hard, number 1, to
own responsibility for what went on and to acknowledge it and
not excuse it. We made an error of judgment. Frankly, we made a
bit of a rookie error. We got overexposed in the market and made
ourselves vulnerable to a squeeze. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Ain&#8217;t That Bad&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;But if you take that out and recognize that we&#8217;re not
going to allow that to happen to ourselves again, the rest of
the story really ain&#8217;t that bad,&#8221; she said. &#8220;In fact, if you
look through it all, it&#8217;s extraordinarily encouraging.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coal derivatives trader Chan Bhima made an error of
judgment, not of character, in &#8220;taking a risk on our behalf,&#8221;
she said. Coal prices plunged 24 percent from January through
March and then surged 35 percent through June. Marchiony, the
bank spokesman, said Bhima wasn&#8217;t available for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company took an oversized position both relative to
their fledgling operation and relative to the market, Masters
said. The error cost the company as much as $250 million, the
New York Post reported June 8, without saying where it got the
information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Bigger Than Market&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loss was &#8220;larger than appropriate for a relatively
fledging business within the fabric of the overall commodities
franchise,&#8221; said Masters, who didn&#8217;t specify the size of the
loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan &#8220;became bigger than the market,&#8221; said Robin Bhar, a metals and energy analyst at Credit Agricole CIB in London. &#8220;They were the coal market,&#8221; Bhar said, adding,
&#8220;these mistakes could happen again.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Masters chastised employees after news of Bhima&#8217;s wrong-way
bet leaked to the media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t want us talking to the press,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t want us talking to the outside world, neither about
successes nor about failures. It&#8217;s not what top-class businesses
do to themselves. This constitutes treading on our own toe and
then kicking ourselves in our own shin in recompense for that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if trading conditions don&#8217;t improve, the commodities
unit could produce &#8220;a perfectly respectable return on equity,
net income and overhead ratio,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All it&#8217;s going to take is a little pop to the upside,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;We could be producing a 30 to 35 percent ROE and
looking like gods,&#8221; she said, referring to return on equity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewel in Crown &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan missed out on opportunities in recent years, such
as when oil prices surged in 2008, because it lacked the
infrastructure to store and ship oil and other commodities,
Masters said. JPMorgan has been expanding its commodities
operations ever since, buying Bear Stearns Cos.&#8217; energy business
in 2008 and UBS AG&#8217;s global agriculture and Canadian commodities
divisions, a purchase it completed in 2009. In March 2008, the
bank bought U.K.-based ClimateCare, which helps clients reduce carbon emissions and trades reduction credits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The London team has also since devised a way to provide
&#8220;synthetic storage&#8221; and the company now has physical assets
&#8220;at our fingertips&#8221; to store and ship commodities like oil and
metals across the globe, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBS Sempra brought JPMorgan the Henry Bath metals
warehousing unit, &#8220;one of the jewels in the crown&#8221; of the
deal, said Bhar of Credit Agricole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restructuring Contracts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are moving into physical commodities as regulators
globally impose new rules on derivative markets, making them
less attractive, Bhar said. JPMorgan could profit by renting the
warehouses to traders betting on different metals forward
contracts, he said. &#8220;Potentially there is a lot of money to be
made,&#8221; Bhar said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the year&#8217;s first half, JPMorgan completed several large
strategic structured transactions that have been in the works
for several years, Masters said, without identifying them. They
include storage transportation, long-dated power sales,
commodity-linked financing, new JPMorgan index products and
carbon derivatives, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also provides commodities services to the
airlines, a customer base it didn&#8217;t have in 2008, Masters said.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley were able to make
&#8220;a tremendous amount of money&#8221; as markets fell by
restructuring their clients&#8217; contracts, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Gutsiest and Ballsiest&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If that were to happen now going forward from here, we
would be just as well positioned as the next player in terms of
having opportunities to restructure business,&#8221; Masters said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although JPMorgan&#8217;s per-client revenue has dropped, the
bank is doing business with more clients -- 1,000 through the
first half, compared with 1,200 for all of last year, Masters
said. Once the merger with RBS Sempra is completed, JPMorgan
will add about 1,100 entirely new clients as well as 1,000
existing clients who weren&#8217;t previously using its commodities
services, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Every one of you needs to get away from the last six
months, myself included, of pain associated with mergers and
integration and the difficult market conditions, the losses that
we&#8217;ve encountered, the nonsense that&#8217;s been in the newspapers,&#8221;
Masters said. &#8220;Remember that you work for a business that is
one of the boldest and gutsiest and ballsiest businesses that
I&#8217;ve ever had the pleasure and privilege to work with.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Shiyin Chen" date="Aug 03, 2010  1:26 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-03/china-stocks-rebound-may-be-more-powerful-than-expected-jpmorgan-says.html"><headline>China Stocks Rebound May Be `More Powerful'' Than Expected, JPMorgan Says</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. said China
stocks may post a &#8220;longer and more powerful&#8221; rebound than the
brokerage previously expected as the government boosts efforts
to sustain economic expansion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI China Index advanced 4.1 percent in July, the most
in four months, on speculation that the government may ease
property curbs and allow more bank lending amid a slowdown in
growth. The Shanghai Composite Index climbed 10 percent during
the month, the most in a year, trimming its 2010 losses to 20
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recovery in stocks may be helped by the government&#8217;s
efforts to maintain a &#8220;relatively fast&#8221; pace of growth and
shift the economy toward consumption, JPMorgan analysts Frank Li
and Peng Chen said. The prospect of a &#8220;sharp sequential
slowdown&#8221; in July&#8217;s economic data is also boosting expectations
of an easing in policy tightening, the brokerage said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors should play the rebound, but watch out for the
potential risks,&#8221; the analysts wrote in a report dated
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data released in the past two days showed China&#8217;s July
manufacturing data were the weakest in more than a year as the
government clamped down on property speculation and investment
in polluting and energy-intensive factories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nation&#8217;s economic growth slowed to 10.3 percent in the
second quarter from an 11.9 percent increase in the January to
March period, property prices in 70 Chinese cities fell 0.1
percent in June from the previous month and bank lending cooled
last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Abnormal&#8217; Discount &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s yuan-denominated stocks will rally strongly in the
coming months as the government relaxes its tightening policies
with slowing growth, according to Pride Investments Group&#8217;s
Lewis Wan. Most of the country&#8217;s financial stocks are trading at
a discount to their Hong Kong-listed peers, which is
&#8220;abnormal,&#8221; Wan said in a Bloomberg Television interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re very bullish on China&#8217;s stock market,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Nomura Holdings Inc. and
Citigroup Inc. are also among brokerages that are predicting a
further rebound in Chinese stocks even after July&#8217;s advance,
while HSBC Private Bank said last week the rally may falter if
the government isn&#8217;t able to boost the economy and contain
inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan analysts said they will refrain from calling
for a &#8220;major turnaround&#8221; in Chinese equities, citing the
prospect of analysts lowering their earnings estimates and
industry-specific policy risks that could hurt company profits,
according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s Li was top-ranked for strategy in Institutional
Investor&#8217;s inaugural All-China research poll. He said on July 13
he remains &#8220;cautious&#8221; even as the MSCI China Index may rebound
in the near term. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Citigroup Inc. sold $788.5 million of bonds backed by commercial
mortgages in the fourth offering of the debt this year as Wall
Street seeks to jumpstart sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest top-rated portions of the transactions, a
$410.6 million slice maturing in 9.86 years, yields 135 basis
points more than the benchmark swap rate, according to a person
familiar with the offering who declined to be identified because
terms aren&#8217;t public. Similar debt sold in 2006 and 2007 when
sales peaked and underwriting bottomed yields about 320 basis
points over the benchmark, according to Deutsche Bank AG data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal is the third to pool loans from multiple property
owners this year, and included new features designed to appease
investors as banks attempt to revive the $700 billion market.
Sales tumbled 95 percent to $11.2 billion in 2008 from a record
$234 billion in 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The changes are a &#8220;sharp departure&#8221; from past transactions,
according to a Deutsche Bank report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The changes were no doubt made to better the structure
and make the deal more attractive to investors,&#8221; the New York-
based analyst Harris Trifon said in the report. &#8220;The sheer
number of changes makes it difficult to assess how smoothly the
deal will function in practice.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the key changes is giving buyers of the highest-
rated portions control of who manages troubled loans, a right
that has historically been held by investors who buy the
riskiest slice, the so-called B piece. Some investors are
concerned that those holders may make decisions that favor their
own interests when loans go bad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Material Impact&#8217; Unlikely &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stripping control from the buyers most susceptible to
losses could make it harder to sell the debt, Trifon wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With a relatively limited supply and strong demand, this
issue in isolation is not likely to have a material impact,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Assuming the new deal pipeline continues to grow, the
market might have a hard time finding enough B-piece buyers
willing to participate without some control rights.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks arranged $3.4 billion of securities backed by newly
originated commercial mortgages last year, and about $2.49
billion has been issued in 2010, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. asked a New
York judge to dismiss a $1 billion lawsuit by Australian hedge
fund Basis Capital, arguing that a June U.S. Supreme Court
decision bars the claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit by Basis Capital&#8217;s Basis Yield Alpha Fund
focuses on Goldman Sachs&#8217;s sale of the &#8220;Timberwolf&#8221;
collateralized debt obligation. The complaint, filed June 9 in
Manhattan federal court, says the fund was forced into
insolvency after buying mortgage-linked securities created by
Goldman Sachs, in what one of its own executives described
internally as a &#8220;shi**y deal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs argued that the suit is barred by the Supreme
Court&#8217;s June 24 ruling in Morrison v. National Australia Bank.
In that case, the high court held that U.S. securities laws
don&#8217;t apply to the claims of foreign buyers of non-U.S.
securities on foreign exchanges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This litigation presents a contract dispute between two
foreign entities, executed abroad and governed by English law,
and Morrison makes clear that it does not belong in this
court,&#8221; New York-based Goldman said in a filing dated Aug. 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric Lewis, a lawyer for Basis, said &#8220;there are significant
arguments to be made&#8221; that Morrison doesn&#8217;t bar the Basis
claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The credit-default swaps in the transaction were
derivatives of U.S. securities, Lewis said. The location of the
transaction was really New York, and Goldman Sachs International
was acting as an agent of New York-based Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. in the transaction, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the complaint, Basis alleged that Goldman falsely
claimed in June 2007 that the market for investments such as
Timberwolf had stabilized. Basis claims it closed on its deal
with Goldman to buy credit default swaps tied to Timberwolf at
the same time Thomas Montag, Goldman&#8217;s former head of sales and
trading for the Americas, sent the e-mail calling the Timberwolf
CDO &#8220;one shi**y deal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basis, which invested $78 million in Timberwolf, is seeking
compensatory and punitive damages from Goldman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Basis Yield v. Goldman Sachs, 1:10-cv-04537,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Thom Weidlich" date="Aug 04, 2010  3:16 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-04/bp-chevron-units-among-companies-settling-n-y-gasoline-additive-cases.html"><headline>BP, Chevron Units Among Companies Settling N.Y. Gasoline Additive Cases</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc, Chevron Corp. and Royal Dutch
Shell Plc units were among dozens of energy companies that
agreed to pay $42 million to settle claims brought by
communities on New York&#8217;s Long Island alleging contamination of
water with a gasoline additive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies and the plaintiffs, including water districts
and the towns of Southampton, East Hampton and Huntington, filed
notice today of their motion to dismiss the lawsuits. The suits,
part of larger litigation over methyl tertiary butyl ether, were
brought by 23 Long Island districts, said Marc Bern, a lawyer
for the plaintiffs, who said the pact&#8217;s financial terms were
confidential. The total amount was $42 million, according to a
person familiar with the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Everybody has signed onto the settlement and we&#8217;re just
waiting for the payments to be made,&#8221; Bern, of Napoli Bern
Ripka LLP in New York, said in a phone interview. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be
sending the districts their individual settlements in the next
two weeks or so.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 70 lawsuits filed by water providers and state
and local governments were consolidated before U.S. District
Judge Shira Scheindlin in Manhattan for pretrial information-
gathering, according to an energy industry website. In October,
a federal jury in New York ordered Exxon Mobil Corp. to pay
$104.7 million in damages after finding the company liable for
poisoning New York City water wells with the additive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Tanner, a spokesman for Shell, didn&#8217;t have an
immediate comment. Sean Comey, a spokesman for Chevron, and
Daren Beaudo, a spokesman for BP, didn&#8217;t immediately return
calls for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future Contamination &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the Long Island cases were filed as far back as
2003. Most of the litigation was over threatened future
contamination, Bern said. &#8220;There&#8217;s very little current
contamination.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additives such as MTBE are chemical compounds that raise
the oxygen content of gasoline to make it burn more cleanly and
efficiently. The U.S. Congress amended the Clean Air Act in 1990
to require companies to add an oxygenate to gasoline to reduce
air pollution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MTBE renders water undrinkable and can cause nausea and
other maladies, the plaintiffs have argued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Exxon Mobil trial, New York City argued that the
company could have used ethanol as an oxygenate and instead
opted to use MTBE to save money. New York State banned the use
of MTBE starting in 2004, as have dozens of other states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil has asked Scheindlin to overrule the jury,
order a new trial or reduce the damages award. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re: Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (&#8220;MTBE&#8221;)
Products Liability Litigation, 00-cv-1898, U.S. District Court,

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. are among the four banks that may manage a 20
percent stake sale in Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd.,
according to three people with direct knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICICI Securities Ltd. and SBI Capital Markets Ltd. may also
be hired, the people said, declining to be named before an
official announcement. Seventeen banks had bid to manage the
offering, with presentations ending yesterday in New Delhi,
according to a notice on the Gurgaon-based company&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government and Power Grid, India&#8217;s largest energy
transmission company, will sell a combined 841.8 million shares,
it said in July. Shares of Power Grid rose 0.3 percent to 100.15
rupees at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai yesterday, valuing a 20
percent stake at 84.3 billion rupees ($1.83 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power Grid Chairman S.K. Chaturvedi wasn&#8217;t immediately
available to comment on his mobile-phone yesterday. Spokespeople
at the banks didn&#8217;t immediately respond to e-mails. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lowest fees bid was 0.00000001 percent, one of the
people said. Banks shortlisted for the sale have to match the
lowest bidder to win the mandate, according to the government&#8217;s
guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are among U.S. banks seeking to
make more of their revenue in developing markets such as India
as tougher regulations and slower economic growth reduce
opportunities in the U.S. and Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan in June named Heidi Miller, a longtime associate
of Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, to a newly created
position focusing on overseas expansion. David Viniar, Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s chief financial officer, told analysts on July 20 that
the firm is investing more in faster-growing emerging markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bidders that vied for the mandate included Bank of America
Corp., Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc,
Nomura Holdings Inc., Morgan Stanley, Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc and UBS AG, the notice showed. The domestic banks were
Enam Securities Pvt., Edelweiss Capital Ltd., IDBI Capital
Market Services Ltd., IDFC Capital Ltd. and Kotak Mahindra
Capital Co., it said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cia. Brasileira de Distribuicao Grupo
Pao de Acucar dropped to a two-month low in Sao Paulo trading
after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its rating on the stock,
saying low profit margins may continue to hurt earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pao de Acucar, Brazil&#8217;s biggest retailer, slid 3 percent to
56.29 reais at 12:06 p.m. New York time. The shares dropped to
55.27 reais earlier, the lowest intraday price since May 27.
Goldman Sachs lowered its recommendation to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from
&#8220;buy,&#8221; according to a research report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our thesis of underlying improvements in the food retail
business did not play out,&#8221; Irma Sgarz, an analyst at New York-
based Goldman Sachs, wrote in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Impressive sales growth&#8221; was tempered by lower margins,
a trend that may persist, Sgarz said. Pao de Acucar last week
posted a 53 percent decline in second-quarter net income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &#8220;lack of visibility&#8221; related to its takeover of rival
Casa Bahia Comercial Ltda. also hurts the stock&#8217;s prospects,
Sgarz said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nomura Holdings Inc., Japan&#8217;s biggest

telecommunications and cable television industries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCormack will join the company&#8217;s U.S. unit, Nomura

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., suing to
overturn a $20.5 million arbitration award to creditors of the
failed hedge-fund firm Bayou Group LLC, got support from the
Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The association, which says it represents the interests of
&#8220;hundreds of securities firms, banks and asset managers,&#8221;
filed a brief in federal court in New York today in support of
Goldman Sachs, claiming the case &#8220;has potentially industrywide
implications, especially for clearing brokers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creditors claim Goldman Sachs facilitated the
$400 million fraud committed by Bayou co-founder Samuel Israel,
who is now serving 22 years in prison. Stamford, Connecticut-
based Bayou filed for bankruptcy protection in May 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the
independent regulatory group for the securities industry, on
June 24 issued a decision in favor of Bayou&#8217;s creditors in an
arbitration targeting Goldman Sachs Execution  Clearing LP for
its role as the prime broker and clearing broker for Bayou&#8217;s
hedge funds. Goldman sued last month to overturn the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In imposing liability on Goldman, the arbitrators
disregarded the long-recognized principle that a clearing firm
cannot be liable for merely processing transactions received
from an authorized source,&#8221; the trade association argued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Rich of New York&#8217;s Rich  Intelisano LLP, a lawyer for
Bayou&#8217;s unsecured creditors, defended FINRA&#8217;s finding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This was an experienced and well-seasoned arbitration
panel&#8217;s decision after an 18-day trial and lengthy closing
arguments on the law and facts,&#8221;&#160;he said in an e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Speed and Efficiency&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If clearing firms were required to analyze trading in
introduced accounts, or to make determinations concerning
whether the records and documents in their possession regarding
the activities of an introducing firm&#8217;s customers indicated
possible wrongdoing, the speed and efficiency demanded in the
contemporary securities markets would not be possible,&#8221; the
Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association said in
its filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Goldman Sachs Execution  Clearing LP v.
Official Unsecured Creditors&#8217; Committee of Bayou Group LLC, 10-
CV-5622, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A federal judge denied a motion by
two former JPMorgan Chase  Co. bankers to dismiss a Securities
and Exchange Commission suit alleging a pay-to-play scheme in
Jefferson County, Alabama, that allowed the bank to win almost
$5 billion in bond and interest-rate swap business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Abdul Kallon in Birmingham rejected
arguments by Douglas MacFaddin, the former head of JPMorgan&#8217;s
municipal derivatives desk, and investment banker Charles LeCroy
that the SEC doesn&#8217;t have jurisdiction over interest-rate swaps.
The unregulated derivatives were used by the county to lower
borrowing costs on debt issued to rebuild its sewer system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kallon said it was too early in the case to resolve the
question of whether the swaps were &#8220;security-based&#8221; and
therefore subject to SEC oversight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MacFaddin&#8217;s and LeCroy&#8217;s challenge to the SEC&#8217;s
jurisdiction failed because they relied on a disputed fact, that
the swaps were based on an interest-rate index, rather than an
index of securities, Kallon wrote in a 22-page opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC filed suit against the pair last year, alleging the
New York-based bank made more than $8 million in undisclosed
payments to friends of county commissioners. The associates
owned or worked at local broker-dealer firms that didn&#8217;t do any
work on the deals, which have nearly bankrupted the county, the
state&#8217;s most populous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry Langford, the former president of the Jefferson
County Commission and former mayor of Birmingham, is serving 15
years in prison after being convicted of accepting $235,000 in
designer clothes, Rolex watches and cash from an Alabama banker
who was paid almost $3 million by JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Charles E. LeCroy and Douglas W. MacFaddin., 09-CV-02238, U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of Alabama (Birmingham). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. senator who helped craft the
financial overhaul bill said he was gratified that Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. plans to discontinue its proprietary trading
business, a signal of Wall Street&#8217;s early response to the new
rules from Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It sounds clearly like this is a reaction,&#8221; Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat and chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee, said today in an interview. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad to hear it.
Nothing I&#8217;d like to see more than Goldman Sachs become Goldman
Sachs again instead of the hedge fund that it had become.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs may announce as soon as tomorrow that it will
transform its principal-strategies business, a group that makes
bets with the firm&#8217;s own capital, into a fund that would raise
outside money, a person with direct knowledge of the decision
said. The Dodd-Frank Act signed by President Barack Obama last
month prohibits banks such as Goldman Sachs from engaging in
proprietary trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law contains dozens of provisions that may affect the
banking business. The Volcker rule and restrictions on the
trading of derivatives may have the most immediate impact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is just the beginning of many adjustments and
responses that we&#8217;re going to see by large and small banks over
the next several years,&#8221; said Kevin Petrasic, a lawyer at Paul,
Hastings, Janofsky  Walker LLP in Washington and former special
counsel at the Office of Thrift Supervision. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s principal-
strategies business, a unit that makes bets with the firm&#8217;s own
capital, plans to transform into a fund and raise outside money,
a person with direct knowledge of the decision said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs may announce as soon as tomorrow plans to
discontinue the business, which is part of the New York-based
bank&#8217;s equities unit, the person said, declining to be named
because the decision hasn&#8217;t been made public. The team, which
aims to complete the process by the end of the year, hasn&#8217;t set
a target for the amount it wants to raise, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dodd-Frank Act signed by President Barack Obama last
month prohibits banks such as Goldman Sachs from engaging in
proprietary trading. Goldman Sachs Principal Strategies, led by
Hong Kong-based Morgan Sze, 44, may be keen to raise money
before competition emerges from proprietary-trading teams
leaving other banks, analyst Brad Hintz said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What you don&#8217;t want to be is the 50th prop desk being
spun out,&#8221; Hintz, at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in New York,
said in an interview. &#8220;I think what they&#8217;re saying is, &#8216;Get out
while the getting&#8217;s good.&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which doesn&#8217;t break out the size of teams
like GSPS or the revenue or profit they generate, has said it
derives about 10 percent of annual revenue on average from
proprietary-trading activities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviewing Operations &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucas van Praag, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York,
declined to comment. Last week, asked to comment on the firm&#8217;s
plans for its proprietary-trading teams, he said: &#8220;Given the
changes coming to financial regulation, we are as you would
expect reviewing those operations likely to be affected.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley is in talks to spin off its FrontPoint
Partners LLC hedge-fund unit, according to people familiar with
the plans. The New York-based bank may retain a stake in the
business, which is run by Daniel Waters and Michael Kelly, said
one of the people, who declined to be named because the talks
aren&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley purchased FrontPoint in 2006. The firm paid
$400 million for its stake, people familiar with the terms said
at the time. Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said in
February that the firm was &#8220;evaluating&#8221; its investments in
hedge funds, including FrontPoint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erica Platt, a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley, said she
couldn&#8217;t comment on market rumors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Good Opportunity&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some of these guys feel that now is a good opportunity to
strike out on their own,&#8221; said Steven Nadel, a New York-based
partner who specializes in advising hedge funds at law firm
Seward  Kissel LLP, who wasn&#8217;t speaking on Goldman Sachs or
FrontPoint specifically. Still, he added that &#8220;it&#8217;s not easy to
raise money&#8221; and new requirements for funds to register with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission can add to the
complexity of starting funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the so-called Volcker rule provision in the Dodd-
Frank Act, banks would be allowed to contribute up to 3 percent
of the equity in hedge funds or private-equity funds. Goldman
Sachs has a history of investing with former traders who start
hedge funds. Alumni who left to start hedge funds include Eric Mindich at Eton Park Capital Management LP, Dinakar Singh at
TPG-Axon Capital Management, and Daniel Och of Och-Ziff Capital
Management Group LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, about half the members of the Goldman Sachs
Principal Strategies team created a fund called Goldman Sachs
Investment Partners that remains housed in the firm&#8217;s money-
management division. Some traders who stayed in the principal-
strategies unit, including Pierre-Henri Flamand and Ali Hedayat,
left Goldman Sachs earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dodd-Frank law allows banks at least four years to
bring proprietary trading into compliance, with a potential
extension of as many as three years, according to a timeline
prepared by Davis Polk  Wardwell LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Ruth David" date="Aug 05, 2010  2:31 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-05/goldman-sachs-may-earn-4-cents-to-manage-first-state-company-sale-in-india.html"><headline>Goldman May Earn 4 Cents to Manage First State Sale in India</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., winning its
first job managing a share sale by an Indian state-owned company,
may earn next to nothing for the privilege. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most profitable securities firm in Wall Street history
tied for the lowest bid among 17 banks vying to manage the
$1.8 billion offer by Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd.,
three people with knowledge of the matter said. Goldman Sachs
and SBI Capital Markets Ltd. said they&#8217;d do the work for a fee
equal to 0.00000001 percent of the sale proceeds. That means the
firms stand to reap about 2 rupees (4 cents) each on the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian government&#8217;s plan to sell a record 400 billion
rupees of assets this year is producing near-zero fees for Wall
Street firms that charge an average of about 4 percent of money
raised for U.S. offerings, data compiled by Bloomberg show. As
many as 20 banks still compete for each state sale, betting the
league-table credits will help them win more investment-banking
work in Asia&#8217;s third-largest economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They bet they can absorb any losses through other state
or private sector deals,&#8221; said Ashvin Parekh, head of financial
services for India at Ernst  Young LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is among U.S. banks seeking to make more of
their revenue in developing markets such as India as tougher
regulations and slower economic growth reduce opportunities in
the U.S. and Europe. David Viniar, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s chief
financial officer, told analysts on July 20 that the firm is
investing more in faster-growing emerging markets after it
reported second-quarter net income plunged 82 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowest Fees &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. and ICICI Securities Ltd. may earn
similar fees to manage Gurgaon-based Power Grid&#8217;s sale, the
people said. Banks must match the lowest fees to be hired under
government guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S.K. Chaturvedi, chairman of Power Grid, India&#8217;s largest
electricity transmission company, declined to comment, as did
Christopher Jun, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in Seoul.
Spokespeople at the remaining banks also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs bid without success to manage offers from
state-owned Coal India Ltd. and Manganese Ore (India) Ltd. this
year. Both those sales may generate fees of 0.000001 percent for
underwriters including Citigroup Inc. and Edelweiss Capital Ltd.,
according to bankers with knowledge of the deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Goldman Sachs, ranked second globally for
equity sales, is No. 23 in India, where the average fee is 0.7
percent, including offerings by private companies, according to
Bloomberg data. SBI Capital, the Mumbai-based investment banking
unit of India&#8217;s largest lender, is No. 13 on share sales in the
nation, while New York-based Citigroup is the top-ranked
arranger, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Offers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup, whose local investment-banking operations are
run by Ravi Kapoor, has managed two offers by state-owned
companies this year and 10 sales by private firms, Bloomberg
data show. Sunil Sanghai, who was co-head of investment banking
at Goldman Sachs along with Brooks Entwistle, quit in June. The
company hasn&#8217;t named a replacement yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For state asset sales in India, rules governing the
selection of underwriters have helped squeeze fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bankers must have the lowest fees as well as the best
technical bids if they want to win the mandates, according to
government guidelines. The bids must include reimbursements for
arranging roadshows, conducting market research, placing
advertisements and other expenses incurred by the banks, the
government has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record Offers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s government plans to raise the 400 billion rupees in
the year that ends March 31 by selling stakes in companies
including Coal India, the world&#8217;s largest producer of the fuel,
and Steel Authority of India Ltd., the nation&#8217;s second-biggest
producer of the metal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government and Power Grid will sell a combined 841.8
million shares, according to a statement last month. Shares of
Power Grid have declined about 10 percent this year, valuing the
20 percent stake at about 83.2 billion rupees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presentations by the banks competing for the offering ended
Aug. 4 in New Delhi, according to a notice on the company&#8217;s
website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bidders included Bank of America Corp., Citigroup,
Deutsche Bank, HSBC Holdings Plc, Nomura Holdings Inc., Morgan
Stanley, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and UBS AG, the notice
showed. The domestic banks were Enam Securities Pvt., Edelweiss,
IDBI Capital Market Services Ltd., IDFC Capital Ltd. and Kotak
Mahindra Capital Co., it said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. and UBS AG
filed claims in London against the region of Lombardy, pre-
empting the municipal authority&#8217;s plan to sue the banks in the
Italian courts in a dispute about derivatives fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An investigation by Milan&#8217;s prosecutor said the banks hid
95 million euros ($125 million) in fees when they sold the
region derivatives that adjust payments on a $1 billion bond
from 2002. The prosecutor dropped his criminal probe because it
would breach the statute of limitations. Lombardy hired Italian
lawyers in June to prepare a civil suit against the firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit filed a claim at
London&#8217;s high court on July 13, and UBS submitted its claim on
July 21, court papers show. The banks are seeking to confirm
that contracts with the region are valid and that they met their
obligations, according to three people familiar with the claims
who declined to be identified because the dispute is private.
The London claims make it tougher for Lombardy to pursue the
banks locally, lawyers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The jurisdiction chosen by the parties at the time of the
swap was England,&#8221; said Dario Loiacono, a banking lawyer at
Loiacono e Associati in Milan who isn&#8217;t involved in the case.
&#8220;If the plaintiff sues in another jurisdiction, the defendant
can challenge it. The banks&#8217; claim was probably designed to
avoid having to challenge the jurisdiction in Milan, and it&#8217;s
unlikely that the High Court would back a challenge by
Lombardy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials at UBS and Bank of America declined to comment,
and a spokesman for the region of Milan declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Says High Court Case Bars Basis Capital Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. asked a New York judge to dismiss
a $1 billion lawsuit by Australian hedge fund Basis Capital,
arguing that a June U.S. Supreme Court decision bars the claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit by Basis Capital&#8217;s Basis Yield Alpha Fund
focuses on Goldman Sachs&#8217;s sale of the &#8220;Timberwolf&#8221;
collateralized debt obligation. The complaint, filed June 9 in
Manhattan federal court, says the fund was forced into
insolvency after buying mortgage-linked securities created by
Goldman Sachs, in what one of its own executives described
internally as a &#8220;shi**y deal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs argued that the suit is barred by the Supreme
Court&#8217;s June 24 ruling in Morrison v. National Australia Bank.
In that case, the high court held that U.S. securities laws
don&#8217;t apply to the claims of foreign buyers of non-U.S.
securities on foreign exchanges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This litigation presents a contract dispute between two
foreign entities, executed abroad and governed by English law,
and Morrison makes clear that it does not belong in this
court,&#8221; New York-based Goldman said in a filing dated Aug. 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Basis Yield v. Goldman Sachs, 1:10-cv-04537,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buffett Spared Deposition by Judge in Berkshire Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett was spared from giving a deposition in the
lawsuit brought by a former executive who said he was wrongly
dismissed by the recreational-vehicle unit of the billionaire&#8217;s
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Magistrate Judge Christopher Nuechterlein in South
Bend, Indiana, made the ruling Aug. 2 and said Berkshire Chief
Financial Officer Marc Hamburg may be questioned by lawyers for
the plaintiff, Brad Mart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mart said he was fired from the Elkhart, Indiana-based
Forest River RV unit after bringing allegations of fraud to
executives, including to Buffett in six phone conversations.
Mart had requested Buffett&#8217;s deposition to combat Omaha,
Nebraska-based Berkshire&#8217;s claim that it should be dropped from
the lawsuit for lack of jurisdiction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even Mart&#8217;s own recount of the conversations reveal that
Buffett communicated that he did not get involved in personnel
matters and that Mart should seek an audience elsewhere for
relief,&#8221; the judge wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forrest Krutter, Berkshire&#8217;s secretary, had no comment.
Stephen Kennedy, a lawyer for Mart, declined through an
assistant to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Mart v. Berkshire Hathaway Inc., 3:10-cv-00118,
U.S. District Court, Northern District of Indiana (South Bend). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank Wins Dismissal of Pforzheim Utility Swaps Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG won dismissal of a lawsuit by a German
municipal utility seeking damages related to derivatives it
bought from the lender. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Frankfurt higher regional court ruled in favor of the
bank, overturning a previous decision by a lower court that
backed the utility in Pforzheim, Germany, court spokesman Ingo
Noehre said yesterday. The ruling can be appealed, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court ruled that Deutsche Bank sufficiently informed
the utility about risks related to so-called spread-ladder
swaps, the bank said. The utility was seeking damages of 3.9
million euros ($5.2 million), according to a separate statement
from the Frankfurt court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pforzheim&#8217;s case is one of several filed by German local
governments, community-owned utilities and midsize companies
that claim the Frankfurt-based lender didn&#8217;t adequately disclose
the risks of investing in the derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven of nine higher-regional-court decisions have been in
favor of the bank, Deutsche Bank&#8217;s lawyer Christian Duve said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picower Settlement Talks Over Madoff Snagged, Lawyer Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trustee overseeing the liquidation of Bernard Madoff&#8217;s
firm has hit a pair of roadblocks in negotiations to settle a
lawsuit seeking $7.2 billion from the estate of investor Jeffry
Picower, a lawyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disputes over the settlement cost and the ability of
private investors to sue for more money have snagged the talks,
said William Zabel, a lawyer for the estate of Picower, a
Florida businessman who drowned last October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zabel is battling trustee Irving Picard, who claims Picower
should have known Madoff ran a Ponzi scheme before his 2008
arrest. Picard claims Picower, his charitable foundation and
related entities withdrew $7.2 billion from Madoff&#8217;s firm over
20 years, including $2.4 billion in the six years before
Madoff&#8217;s arrest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The negotiations still must resolve the overall dollar
figure&#8221; and block all third-party claims, said Zabel, of
Schulte Roth  Zabel LLP, in an interview. &#8220;The range is
between $2.4 billion and $7.2 billion.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard has recovered more than $1.5 billion for Madoff&#8217;s
victims that he determined lost more than they put into Bernard
L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC. He filed lawsuits seeking
to recover $15 billion from feeder funds, Madoff friends and
family, and others. Madoff, 72, pleaded guilty last year and is
serving a 150-year sentence for running the largest Ponzi scheme
in U.S. history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. Fox, 10-3114, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca Said to Pay $55 Million Over Seroquel &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca Plc, the U.K.&#8217;s second-biggest drugmaker,
agreed to pay about $55 million to settle around 5,500 lawsuits
related to side effects of the antipsychotic Seroquel, people
familiar with the accords said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlements, with an average payout of about $10,000
per case, resulted from mediation involving 26,000 suits filed
over Seroquel, the people said. The London-based company
previously agreed to pay $2 million to resolve more than 200
allegations that Seroquel causes diabetes in some users, people
familiar with those accords said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It implies that the overall exposure is very low&#8221; for
AstraZeneca, Navid Malik, an analyst at Matrix Corporate Capital
in London, said yesterday in an interview. &#8220;$10,000 per patient
doesn&#8217;t seem high&#8221; to settle drug-safety suits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca is moving to resolve Seroquel claims as it
faces expiring patents on the drug and the ulcer treatment
Nexium in the next four years. Seroquel, the company&#8217;s second-
biggest seller after Nexium, generated sales of $4.87 billion
last year, or 15 percent of AstraZeneca&#8217;s total revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 5,500 settlements include 4,000 that AstraZeneca
acknowledged in a July 29 regulatory filing, the people said.
The company hasn&#8217;t disclosed terms of the accords and wouldn&#8217;t
comment on them Aug. 3. The settlements stemmed from mediation
ordered by the judge in Orlando, Florida, who was overseeing all
federal-court litigation over the drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca &#8220;continues to participate in good faith in the
mediation process, with multiple mediation sessions scheduled
throughout the summer,&#8221; Tony Jewell, a company spokesman in
Wilmington, Delaware, said in an e-mailed statement. He declined
to comment further, citing the mediator&#8217;s request for
confidentiality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consolidated Seroquel case is In re Seroquel Products
Litigation, 06-MD-01769, U.S. District Court, Middle District of
Florida (Orlando). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intel Can&#8217;t Use Threats Under U.S. Accord, FTC Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel Corp., the world&#8217;s largest computer chipmaker, cannot
use threats or bundled prices to block customers from buying
competitors&#8217; products under a settlement of antitrust charges,
the U.S. Federal Trade Commission said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement covers graphics and central processors, the
FTC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This case demonstrates that the FTC is willing to
challenge anticompetitive conduct by even the most powerful
companies in the fastest-moving industries,&#8221; FTC Chairman Jon
Leibowitz said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FTC sued in December, accusing Santa Clara, California-
based Intel of illegally using its dominance for a decade to
block customers from buying competitors&#8217; products. The agency
said Intel forced computer makers into exclusive deals and
blocked rivals from making their chips work with Intel&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Intel official said in a statement yesterday that the
chipmaker hasn&#8217;t admitted any violation of the law or accepted
the facts alleged by the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This agreement provides a framework that will allow us to
continue to compete and to provide our customers the best
possible products and the best price,&#8221; said Doug Melamed,
Intel&#8217;s general counsel, in the statement. It &#8220;enables us to
put an end to the expense and distraction of the FTC
litigation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP, Chevron Settle Gasoline-Additive Pollution Cases &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc, Chevron Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc units were
among dozens of energy companies that agreed to pay $42 million
to settle claims brought by communities on New York&#8217;s Long
Island alleging contamination of water with a gasoline additive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies and the plaintiffs, including water districts
and the towns of Southampton, East Hampton and Huntington, filed
notice yesterday of their motion to dismiss the lawsuits. The
suits, part of larger litigation over methyl tertiary butyl
ether, were brought by 23 Long Island districts, said Marc Bern,
a lawyer for the plaintiffs, who said the accord&#8217;s financial
terms were confidential. The total amount was $42 million,
according to a person familiar with the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Everybody has signed onto the settlement and we&#8217;re just
waiting for the payments to be made,&#8221; Bern, of Napoli Bern
Ripka LLP in New York, said in a phone interview. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be
sending the districts their individual settlements in the next
two weeks or so.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 70 lawsuits filed by water providers and state
and local governments were consolidated before U.S. District
Judge Shira Scheindlin in Manhattan for pretrial information-
gathering, according to an energy industry website. In October,
a federal jury in New York ordered Exxon Mobil Corp. to pay
$104.7 million in damages after finding the company liable for
poisoning New York City water wells with the additive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Tanner, a spokesman for Shell, didn&#8217;t have an
immediate comment. Sean Comey, a spokesman for Chevron, and
Daren Beaudo, a spokesman for BP, didn&#8217;t return calls for
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MTBE renders water undrinkable and can cause nausea and
other maladies, the plaintiffs have argued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (&#8220;MTBE&#8221;)
Products Liability Litigation, 00-cv-1898, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total Purchase of OMV Gas Stations Ruled Valid by German Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total SA&#8217;s bid to acquire OMV AG&#8217;s chain of gas stations in
eastern Germany is lawful, a German court said yesterday,
rejecting an earlier veto of the deal over antitrust concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The planned merger won&#8217;t strengthen a dominant
position,&#8221; the Higher Regional Court in Dusseldorf said in a
statement on its website yesterday. The ruling isn&#8217;t yet
binding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bonn-based Federal Cartel Office last year blocked the
deal, involving 59 OMV filling stations, saying it would have
increased the dominant position Total holds with Royal Dutch
Shell Plc, BP Plc, ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil Corp. for
gasoline and diesel sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s ruling &#8220;doesn&#8217;t correspond to the findings by
the Federal Cartel Office in the fuel sector probe or the merger
case,&#8221; Andreas Mundt, president of the antitrust agency, said
in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We will thoroughly study the
possibilities of an appeal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator has a month to appeal the decision to the
Federal Court of Justice, Germany&#8217;s highest civil tribunal, the
Dusseldorf court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With close to 8 percent market share in Germany we are
definitely not part of an oligopoly,&#8221; Hans-Christian Guetzkow,
managing director of Total Germany, said in an e-mailed
statement. The acquisition &#8220;will strengthen&#8221; competition in
the German market, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Docket &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singapore Court to Hear U.K. Author&#8217;s Contempt Case on Aug. 30 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hearing of Alan Shadrake, the British author charged
with contempt of court for challenging the integrity and
independence of Singapore&#8217;s judiciary in a book, will resume on
Aug. 30, his lawyer M. Ravi said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shadrake&#8217;s trial was adjourned on July 30 after Ravi sought
time to file affidavits. The author of &#8220;Once a Jolly Hangman:
Singapore&#8217;s Justice in the Dock&#8221; will have to provide a list of
his sources by Aug. 13, Ravi said in a phone interview
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 75-year-old writer is also being investigated for
criminal defamation by Singapore authorities. His book suggests
that the government &#8220;succumbs to political and economic
pressures&#8221; in meting out the death penalty, the Attorney-
General&#8217;s Chambers has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Attorney-General vs Alan Shadrake OS720/2010 in
the Singapore High Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Anna Edney" date="Aug 05, 2010  6:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-05/pfizer-may-gain-as-u-s-devises-speedy-alternative-to-animal-safety-tests.html"><headline>Pfizer May Gain as U.S. Devises Speedy Alternative to Animal Safety Tests</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Drugmakers led by Pfizer Inc. will 
soon gain access to a new testing system that can shrink by 
months to years the time needed to determine an experimental
drug&#8217;s safety, potentially adding millions of dollars in
research savings and revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 1938, U.S. regulators have required pharmaceutical
companies to test for toxicity using animal studies before
costly human testing begins. That can take months for most 
compounds, and years for cancer medicines. The new system, 
developed by three federal agencies, uses computers to test
products against human and animal cells, rather than living
creatures, to find chemical reactions linked to toxicity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speeding approvals by just six months can lift net income
over the average 12.8-year, patent-protected sales life of a
typical product by 5.5 percent, based on the declining value of
the dollar over time, data compiled by Bloomberg shows. The new
test, which may be available for use as early as next year, may 
also be more precise, helping eliminate more dangerous compounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The earlier you can kill a drug&#8221; that&#8217;s unsafe &#8220;the
more economic sense it makes,&#8221; said David Jacobson-Kram, Food
and Drug Administration executive director for pharmacology
and toxicology, in a telephone interview. His agency last month
teamed up with the Environmental Protection Agency and the
National Institutes of Health in developing the system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wipro Ltd., Infosys Technologies Ltd.
and Patni Computer Systems Ltd., which provide technology
services to corporate customers, may see expenses for U.S. work
visas double if a bill passed by the U.S. Senate becomes law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan, passed unanimously by the Senate yesterday, would
add $2,000 to visa fees for companies with more than half of
their employees in the U.S. on such visas. Firms typically pay
about $2,000 to $2,250 per visa application now, Kaufman Bros.
analyst Karl Keirstead said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology companies such as Wipro and Infosys bring
skilled workers from overseas, often from India, into the U.S.
to develop software and manage projects for customers in the
country. The bill could cost such companies up to $250 million a
year, said Som Mittal, president of Nasscom, a trade association
for Indian information-technology companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There would certainly be a long-term negative impact from
this,&#8221; Mittal said. &#8220;This legislation would make many of the
services we provide not viable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of U.S. workers for Wipro, Infosys and Patni,
all based in India, are in the country on what are known as H-1B
and L-1 visas, the companies say in regulatory filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate fee increases are aimed at helping to finance a
$600 million effort to boost security at the U.S.-Mexican
border, including through the addition of 1,500 guards and other
officials. Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, who&#8217;s sponsoring
the bill, said the technology-services companies add to
unemployment in the U.S. by outsourcing jobs to foreign workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It will level the playing field for American companies
and American workers to compete,&#8221; Schumer told the Senate this
week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Relatively Innocuous&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law wouldn&#8217;t affect U.S. technology companies such as
International Business Machines Corp., Microsoft Corp. and
Google Inc. since less than half their workers use work visas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infosys, based in Bangalore, spent $12 million on H1-B and
L-1 visas in the second half of 2009, according to its
regulatory filings. The company, which files about 7,000 to
8,000 visa applications and renewals each year, could see $15
million in added costs from the bill, Keirstead said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the hikes are &#8220;relatively innocuous&#8221; for the
Indian services companies, he said, compared with their total
profit. Infosys posted net income of $1.3 billion for its fiscal
year ended in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is unfortunate that this tax is being levied on a
discriminatory basis when the need is to open markets to make
companies more competitive in the global market place,&#8221; the
company said in a statement. Infosys added that it is working
with industry associations to convey its views on the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radhika Mahadevan, a spokeswoman from Wipro, also based in
Bangalore, and Mike McConnell, a spokesman for Mumbai-based
Patni, didn&#8217;t immediately provide comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Arbitrage Opportunity&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infosys&#8217;s American depositary receipts dropped 34 cents to
$61.88 at 4 p.m. in Nasdaq trading. Patni&#8217;s receipts fell 24
cents to $21.06 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading,
while Wipro&#8217;s added 20 cents to $13.88. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $2,000 bump in visa costs may not be enough to make
companies hire U.S. workers instead of bringing overseas
employees in, said Ron Hira, a public policy professor at the
Rochester Institute of Technology. Companies can pay workers on
L-1 visas roughly what they would be paid in India, much less
than what they would have to pay American workers, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;ll continue to do it because the arbitrage
opportunity is still great,&#8221; Hira said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Daniel Kruger" date="Aug 06, 2010  3:47 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-06/fed-may-return-to-unconventional-easing-as-recovery-slows-goldman-says.html"><headline>Fed Easing Debate Intensifies as Economic Data Point to Slowing Recovery</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve may return to
&#8220;unconventional&#8221; monetary stimulus as early as next week&#8217;s
policy meeting as the U.S. economy continues to lose momentum,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm lowered its forecasts for gross domestic product
and raised its estimate for the jobless rate as growth slows and
the &#8220;reacceleration in U.S. output&#8221; expected for 2011 is made
more doubtful by &#8220;heighted Congressional resistance&#8221; to
additional fiscal stimulus, Goldman said in a note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed is likely to begin with reinvesting the proceeds
from maturing securities in its existing portfolio of mortgage-
backed debt in other debt instruments, Goldman economists said.
The measures could also include asset purchases, such as
Treasuries, or a more &#8220;ironclad&#8221; commitment to low short-term
policy rates, Goldman said. The central bank&#8217;s policy-setting
open market committee meets Aug. 10 in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This would be a &#8216;baby step&#8217; in the direction of renewed
unconventional easing, although it would probably be packaged as
a decision to prevent a gradual tightening of the overall
stance,&#8221; analysts led by chief U.S. economist Jan Hatzius in
New York said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Policy makers bought $1.7 trillion of mortgage and
government debt from March 2009 through March of this year to
keep borrowing costs low while the economy recovered from the
worst recession since the 1930s. Should the central bank decide
to resume purchasing fixed-income securities it would buy &#8220;at
least $1 trillion,&#8221; they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman lowered its forecast for economic growth in 2011 to
1.9 percent from 2.4 percent and said that the unemployment rate
will return to 10 percent by early next year and remain at that
level for the balance of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employers eliminated 131,000 positions in July after a
revised reduction of 221,000 in the previous month, the Labor
Department said today. The median forecast of 84 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was for a reduction of 65,000. The
unemployment rate stayed at 9.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley hired former JPMorgan
Chase  Co. analyst Francesca Tondi to join its equity research
team covering Italian and German banks in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Francesca will start in mid-October as managing director,
said Sebastian Howell, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley in London.
Her responsibilities won&#8217;t include Deutsche Bank AG, which is
covered by Huw van Steenis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tondi resigned in July after more than 10 years at
JPMorgan, where she covered lenders including UniCredit SpA,
Intesa Sanpaolo SpA, Commerzbank AG, Deutsche Postbank AG and
Aareal Bank AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before JPMorgan, Tondi worked for Fitch Ratings as a
banking analyst, starting in 1998, and for KPMG&#8217;s financial
business division, starting in 1995. A native of Italy, Tondi
has a bachelor&#8217;s degree in economics from Bocconi University in
Milan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley also hired Henrik Schmidt as executive
director to cover Nordic banks in mid-July to reinforce the
research team, said Howell on the phone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polish yields will likely drop to the
lowest since April as the government reduces its offering of
bonds while investors continue to show strong demand for the
country&#8217;s debt, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy two-year Polish government notes as
the yield will probably drop to 4.50 percent from 4.78
yesterday, JPMorgan analyst Mike Trounce in London wrote in a
research note dated yesterday. The zloty may appreciate to 3.82
per euro, the strongest since December 2008, from 3.99
yesterday, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poland plans to offer less domestic debt in August than in
any month so far this year after covering 70 percent of its 2010
funding needs, the Finance Ministry said on July 30. The yield
on the Polish two-year bond has not been below 4.5 percent since
April 22, when Moody&#8217;s Investors Service cut Greece&#8217;s sovereign
rating by one level, prompting investors to shun east European
assets on concern the debt crisis might spread to other parts of
the continent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The bond supply pipeline is starting to dry up, yet
demand remains strong,&#8221; Trounce wrote in the note. &#8220;Poland
will continue to be favored by emerging-market funds with a need
to allocate part of their inflows to the Europe, Middle East and
Africa region. This will help support the zloty.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Finance Ministry sold a combined 7.2 billion zloty
($2.38 billion) of two- and five-year bonds on Aug. 5 in two
auctions that attracted bids worth 12.5 billion zloty. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expedia Inc., the biggest Internet
travel agency, and International Business Machines Corp., the
world&#8217;s biggest computer services provider, sold bonds with
coupons at historic lows this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expedia sold 10-year notes at its lowest coupon for any
maturity and IBM, based in Armonk, New York, issued 1 percent
three-year notes that carry the lowest interest rate of the more
than 3,400 securities in the Barclays Capital U.S. Corporate
Index of investment-grade company debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debt sales reached $35.9 billion this the week, the most
since March 26, when issuance totaled $39 billion. Borrowers
took advantage of what Andrew Karp, head of investment grade
debt syndicate, the Americas, at Bank of America Merrill Lynch,
called &#8220;outstanding&#8221; demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Books have been multiple-times oversubscribed,&#8221; Karp
said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not uncommon to have deals five to eight times
covered. Given the depth of demand, this is a very benign
environment for spreads.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to own investment-grade
debt instead of U.S. Treasuries fell 1 basis point to 187 basis
points, according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S.
Corporate Master index. Average yields on the debt increased
half a basis point to 4.006 percent from the lowest since March
2004. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, the market
Bellwether, fell 0.4 basis point to 2.901 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newell, Expedia &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newell Rubbermaid Inc., the maker of Calphalon cookware and
Sharpie markers, and Expedia had record-low coupon interest
rates on their bonds. Atlanta-based Newell Rubbermaid sold 10-
year notes that carry the company&#8217;s cheapest coupon for debt of
similar maturity since at least 1976, according to Bloomberg
data that goes back to that year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expedia tapped the market for the first time in more than
two years, selling $750 million of notes in a boosted offering
after earlier marketing $500 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our hope had been to possibly exceed the $500 million but
we wanted to make sure demand was there in the market,&#8221; said
Chief Financial Officer Michael Adler. &#8220;We found significant
amounts of excessive demand which allowed us to upsize to $750
million.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 5.95 percent notes yielded 300 basis points more than
similar maturity Treasuries and were the company&#8217;s largest
offering, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expedia last sold debt in June 2008, when it issued $400
million of 8.5 percent notes due 2016. The Bellevue, Washington-
based company&#8217;s next lowest coupon is on its $500 million of
7.456 percent notes due 2018, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junk Spreads Narrow &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-yield, high-risk, or junk, spreads declined 6 basis
points to 651 basis points, according to the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch High Yield Master II Index. Yields on the debt
fell 5 basis points to 8.46 percent, the least since May 5, the
index data show. Junk debt is rated below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service and BBB- by Standard  Poor&#8217;s. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Deals seem to be pricing with smaller and smaller
concessions&#8221; to existing issues, Karp said. &#8220;That&#8217;s a function
of significant amounts of demand.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM and Xcel Energy Inc. led $30.6 billion of investment-
grade sales, Bloomberg data show. That&#8217;s 193 percent above this
year&#8217;s weekly average of $15.9 billion. High-yield sales reached
$5.2 billion, above the $4.6 billion average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utility Bonds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xcel, the Minneapolis-based owner of utilities that operate
in eight states, sold the cheapest 30-year bonds in the U.S.
market in at least 15 years, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Xcel&#8217;s Northern States Power Co. issued $250 million
of 4.85 percent, 30-year securities and $250 million of 1.95
percent, five-year notes, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;re not getting much of a concession&#8221; on some of the
new debt, said Rajeev Sharma, who oversees $1.4 billion of
investment-grade credit at First Investors Management in New
York. &#8220;At least you&#8217;re getting something - some chance for a
compression&#8221; in secondary-market spreads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newell Rubbermaid sold $550 million of 10-year notes that
pay less than half the coupon of its decade-long debt issued
last year, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 4.7 percent debt Bloomberg yielded 175 basis points
more than similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries, the data show.
Treasurer Dale Metz said &#8220;very strong&#8221; demand of four to five
times oversubscription at the time of pricing drove pricing for
the offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We hoped to get a low 5 percent coupon and crashed
through the 4 percent barrier and ultimately down to 4.7
percent,&#8221; Metz said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proceeds will help fund a tender offer for Newell&#8217;s 10.6
percent notes due in 2019 that the company sold in March 2009
and the repurchase of $500 million of stock, the company said in
an Aug. 2 statement distributed by Business Wire. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which makes
more money from trading than any other bank, estimates that 25
percent to 35 percent of its revenue comes from derivatives, a
spokesman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based firm, whose executives have said that
they didn&#8217;t know how much of their money came from derivatives,
provided the information in response to a request from the
Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, spokesman Lucas van Praag
said. The Wall Street Journal reported Goldman Sachs&#8217;s response
late yesterday on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the firm&#8217;s 2009 revenue of $45.2 billion, the
estimate means derivatives may have provided $11.3 billion to
$15.8 billion of revenue last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer David Viniar told members of the
FCIC in a July 1 hearing that Goldman Sachs doesn&#8217;t keep
separate records on derivatives because they are &#8220;integrated&#8221;
into the firm&#8217;s cash trading business. Derivatives are contracts
whose value is derived from assets such as stocks, bonds,
currencies or commodities, or events such as changes in interest
rates or the weather. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tucker Warren, a spokesman for the FCIC, said today that he
wasn&#8217;t able to confirm that the commission had received the
information from Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$49.1 Trillion &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs held a gross amount of $49.1 trillion of
derivatives contracts as of March 31, according to a June report
from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The OCC
lists Goldman Sachs among the five banks that together account
for 97 percent of the derivatives held by U.S. banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which is the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by
assets, reported $11.8 billion in revenue from trading fixed-
income, currencies and commodities in the first half of the year
and $3.57 billion from trading equities in the
same period. Combined, the two categories accounted for 71
percent of the firm&#8217;s $21.6 billion in net revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers appointed the 10-member FCIC in July 2009 to
investigate the causes of the worst U.S. financial crisis since
the Great Depression. The panel, led by Chairman Phil Angelides
and Vice Chairman Bill Thomas, has until December to
report its findings to Congress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest
payments network, may rise as growth in credit- and debit-card
usage offsets tighter regulation on fees, Barron&#8217;s reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa may be &#8220;terribly discounted&#8221; after the shares fell
20 percent as Congress passed and President Barack Obama
recently signed financial-overhaul legislation that included a
cap on fees for debit-card use, the weekly newspaper said in its
Aug. 9 edition, citing Julio Quinteros, an analyst at Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quinteros expects year-over-year earnings grow of more than
20 percent over the next several quarters as consumer spending,
debit-care use and margins rise, Barron&#8217;s said. The newspaper
didn&#8217;t say if Quinteros owns the shares, which he rates &#8220;buy&#8221;
and says they may rise as much as 30 percent to $93 within a
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa, based in San Francisco, rose 64 cents to $72.14
yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, while
dropping 18 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Kristen Schweizer" date="Aug 08, 2010  6:05 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-08/microsoft-yahoo-address-online-ads-by-letting-users-choose.html"><headline>Microsoft, Yahoo Address Online Ads by Letting Users Choose</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., Yahoo! Inc. and Hulu
LLC plan to make online advertisements less annoying and more
profitable -- by letting users choose which ones to watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting next month, websites including MSNBC.com,
Yahoo.com and Hulu.com will begin letting consumers decide which
ads show up in the video clips they watch online. A research
study of the new Hulu-designed format led by Vivaki, the digital
arm of French advertising company Publicis Group SA, showed that
users were twice as likely to click an ad when given a choice
than when one was selected for them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When you give people a choice they tend to love you
because you&#8217;re showing them respect,&#8221; said Beth Uyenco Shatto,
global research director at Microsoft&#8217;s ads unit. &#8220;If it wasn&#8217;t
for advertising they wouldn&#8217;t be getting the content for free.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new ad-selecting tool, called ASq, may step up
development of the $3.1 billion global video ads market, already
the fastest-growing part of online advertising, Bloomberg
Businessweek.com reported. While it may not end unwelcome
commercials for car insurance or weight-loss pills, it may help
websites command higher rates while letting marketers attract
more eyeballs and better target consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBS.com, AOL.com and Discovery.com plan to start using ASq
in September and Google Inc.&#8217;s YouTube is studying it. The new
offering would let the viewer of an online video choose from
three or more ads instead of a pre-roll clip. Yahoo and Hulu
plan to use it as does Microsoft&#8217;s MSNBC.com, which features
segments from the &#8220;Today&#8221; show, &#8220;NBC Nightly News&#8221; and
&#8220;Meet the Press.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re getting smarter about what makes more impactful
advertising,&#8221; said Uyenco Shatto. &#8220;The big aha! here is
understanding what makes a viewer choose a particular ad.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online Ad Surge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online advertising is expected to rise 12 percent this year
to $61.8 billion worldwide from $55.2 billion in 2009, according
to New York-based researcher eMarketer. Although text ads on
search pages such as Google or Microsoft&#8217;s Bing remain the
dominant form of online advertising, video ads are growing fast,
eMarketer says. According to IDC, global online video ad
spending, which was $2.2 billion in 2009, will expand to $11.3
billion in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube, which has more than 1 billion views a day, says
the company is &#8220;doubling&#8221; its efforts to get more viewers for
its video ads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are always looking to develop new formats and features
that make them more interactive,&#8221; the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While online ads may be seen as disruptive, they foot the
bill for much of the Internet&#8217;s content. They are expected to
get better at targeting individual consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fun and Engaging &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Online is much more individualist than television so
targeting is extremely important and effective,&#8221; said Dean
Donaldson, director of media experience at MediaMind
Technologies Inc., a maker of software for digital ad campaigns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People do like advertising if it&#8217;s fun and engaging and
that&#8217;s done by speaking to each user,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone is convinced allowing users to choose ads will
benefit the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you only watch what you like then how will it broaden
your appeal?&#8221; said Richard Wheaton, managing director at Ogilvy
 Mather&#8217;s Neo digital media agency, which works with clients
including Cisco Systems Inc., Eastman Kodak Co., International
Business Machines Corp. and American Express Co. &#8220;Everybody
isn&#8217;t happy to be advertised at, but the more iPads I see the
more I want an iPad.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wheaton said there&#8217;s a &#8220;real shortage&#8221; of quality of
video ads online because they are very expensive to shoot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experimental &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, most online video ads are nothing more than TV
commercials posted on the Internet, said David Hallerman, an
advertising analyst at eMarketer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The whole online video space is still experimental for
most advertisers and websites,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It definitely will
be growing, though search still remains No.1 in terms of dollars
spent and will remain dominant.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An estimated 9 percent of ads online are &#8220;touched&#8221; by a
user&#8217;s mouse for an average 43 seconds, Donaldson said. The
touch-time grows by 2 percent to 3 percent if the ad is a video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blinkx Plc, an online video-search operator spun off by
Autonomy Corp., is among companies that stand to benefit from
the expected surge in video ads, said Chief Executive Officer
Suranga Chandratillake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site, which gets 99 percent of its revenue from
advertising and was rated by ComScore as the fastest-growing
video site after Facebook, targets consumers with ads using
software that analyzes words and visual signs. Users can even
choose their own endings to some video ads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung 3-D &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung Electronics Co. is using interactive ads in one of
its campaigns for 3-D television. The company took a projection
of the late-19th-century Beurs van Berlage building in Amsterdam
and pasted it into a YouTube page. The building then cracks,
butterflies emerge from it, and users are instructed to click on
as many butterflies as possible to win a free TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Video is emotive,&#8221; said Chandratillake. &#8220;Search is a
terrible place to do branded advertising. When you think of your
favorite ads, they are never Google search ads.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 150 million online video watchers in the U.S. and
double that in China, said Sean Finnegan, chief digital officer
at Starcom MediaVest Group, a media buying and communications
agency owned by Publicis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The majority of brands we represent plan to increase
their allocation to online video this year and next,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starcom MediaVest was part of a research group put together
by Publicis&#8217;s Vivaki, along with Hulu, Microsoft and the others
to study the ASq model. The group included marketers such as
Allstate Corp., Applebee&#8217;s International Inc. and Capital One
Financial Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, video ads will become richer and accompany TV
audiences migrating online. They will have social and commercial
elements and target the right person at the right time, said
Jonathan Nelson, Omnicom Group Inc.&#8217;s digital chief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Video ads and interactive ads have lineage in TV;
extending that online is natural,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was sued by
five computer-network technicians who claim the bank denied them
overtime pay for their work as contractors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit seeks class-action status and unspecified
damages, Goldman Sachs said today in a filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. The plaintiffs contend they
deserve overtime pay for working more than 40 hours a week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s conduct was &#8220;willful and in bad faith,&#8221;
according to the technicians, who say the bank never paid them
overtime for work weeks that topped 70 hours. More than 100
employees in New York and New Jersey were underpaid as a result,
according to the lawsuit filed in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, based in New York, disputed the allegations
in a July 16 filing, saying the technicians weren&#8217;t
&#8220;employees&#8221; as defined by the states&#8217; labor laws. About 25
percent of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s staff works on technology, Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar said earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Technology is fundamental to everything we do, from
revenue-producing activities to enabling much of the control
infrastructure of the firm,&#8221; Viniar said in a presentation to
investors on Feb. 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July 2009, Goldman Sachs started including consultants
and temporary staff in quarterly employee numbers. The change
prompted the firm to revise its employee total to 29,800 at the
end of March 2009, up from 27,898 when the figure included only
full-time staff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bardouille v. Goldman Sachs  Co., 10cv4285,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive
director Fabrice Tourre had &#8220;very preliminary&#8221; talks with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to settle the agency&#8217;s
civil fraud claims against him, an SEC lawyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would characterize us as having very preliminary
discussions along those lines a while back, and that&#8217;s all,&#8221;
SEC lawyer Lorin Reisner said in a hearing today in U.S.
District Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC sued Goldman Sachs and Tourre in April, over claims
the firm misled investors in collateralized debt obligations
linked to subprime mortgages. Tourre, the only Goldman Sachs
executive sued individually, remains in the case after the firm
agreed to a $550 million settlement last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement includes a $300 million fine and $250
million in restitution for investors. The penalty is the largest
ever levied by the Securities and Exchange Commission against a
Wall Street firm, the SEC said. Goldman Sachs acknowledged it
made a &#8220;mistake&#8221; and that marketing materials for the
instruments had &#8220;incomplete information,&#8221; the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones in Manhattan granted
final approval to the settlement on July 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jones&#8217;s approval of the accord came a day after Tourre
filed court papers asking her to dismiss the lawsuit against
him. Tourre denied making any materially misleading statements
or omissions related to the sale of Abacus 2007-AC1 CDOs linked
to subprime mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documents, Witnesses &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the hearing today, before U.S. Magistrate Judge Michael Dolinger, the parties discussed possible outlines for pretrial
discovery in the case. Reisner said the SEC is turning over 9
million pages of investigative documents to Tourre&#8217;s lawyers. He
said the agency may seek to take pretrial testimony from 25
witnesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pamela Chepiga, one of Tourre&#8217;s lawyers, said Tourre may
seek to take testimony from as many as 50 witnesses. Chepiga
said the parties may also need to pursue evidence in the U.K.
and Germany in addition to the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is an enormously complicated case,&#8221; Chepiga said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dolinger set an Oct. 4 hearing to discuss the progress of
discovery in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Goldman Sachs, 10-CV-3229, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xcel Energy Inc., the owner of
utilities that operate in eight U.S. states, will buy the power
from a solar plant in southern Colorado that&#8217;s being developed
by Cogentrix Energy LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 30-megawatt solar field will concentrate the sun&#8217;s rays
onto photovoltaic panels that generate electricity, providing
enough power for about 6,500 homes, Charlotte, North Carolina-
based Cogentrix said today in a statement. Cogentrix is a unit
of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When completed, the concentrating photovoltaic, or CPV,
plant will be the largest of its kind in the world, Cogentrix
said. The technology represents less than 0.5 percent of total
installed global solar energy. Cogentrix will use panels
designed by Torrance, California-based Amonix Inc., which plans
to complete a factory near Las Vegas by the end of this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a much more efficient way of converting sunlight to
electricity,&#8221; Jef Freeman, a spokesman for Cogentrix, said
today in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Construction will begin early next year and the solar farm
should be generating electricity in the second quarter of 2012.
Financing for the project, the cost of which wasn&#8217;t disclosed,
is &#8220;in the works,&#8221; Freeman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xcel Energy&#8217;s Public Service Co. of Colorado, the state&#8217;s
largest utility, will buy power from the plant under a 20-year
agreement. The price of the electricity wasn&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the bank
that makes the most revenue trading stocks and bonds, lost money
in that business on 10 days in the second quarter, ending a
three-month streak of loss-free days at the start of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Losses on Goldman Sachs&#8217;s trading desks exceeded $100
million on three days during the period that ended June 30,
according to a filing today by the New York-based company with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. The firm also disclosed
that trading losses surpassed its value-at-risk estimate, a
measure of potential losses, on two days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading results across Wall Street firms declined after
Goldman Sachs and its biggest competitors posted perfect
results, with no losing days, in the first quarter. Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s $5.61 billion in second-quarter trading revenue exceeded
all its Wall Street competitors. The bank, overseen by Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, relied on trading
for 71 percent of its revenue in the first half of the year,
down from 80 percent a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s filing also shows that the firm&#8217;s traders generated
more than $100 million on 17 days during the quarter. Of the 65
days in the quarter, Goldman Sachs traders made money on 55
days, or 85 percent of the time. &lt;/p&gt;

Moore" date="Aug 09, 2010 12:05 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-09/goldman-morgan-stanley-have-20-billion-hedge-fund-private-equity-stakes.html"><headline>Goldman, Morgan Stanley Have $20 Billion Hedge-Fund, Private-Equity Stakes</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan
Stanley have invested almost $20 billion of their own money in
private-equity, private-debt, real-estate and hedge funds,
meaning they may each have to cut those stakes by more than 60
percent to comply with the so-called Volcker rule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs had $15.4 billion in such investments as of
June 30, while Morgan Stanley had $4.22 billion, the New York-
based companies said today in regulatory filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Volcker rule limits a bank&#8217;s total investments in such
funds to 3 percent of its Tier 1 capital. That means Goldman
Sachs and Morgan Stanley would have to reduce their stakes to
about $2.1 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, if the rule
were enforced today. U.S. banks may have as long as a dozen
years to cut their stakes under the financial-overhaul bill
President Barack Obama signed into law last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The regulators are likely to give them several years in
order to comply, so I think it will be a steady, slow process,&#8221;
said Richard Staite, a London-based analyst at Atlantic Equities
LLP. &#8220;I think they&#8217;ll find it fairly easy to sell those size
investments over a multiyear period.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said in the filing that &#8220;substantially all&#8221;
of the underlying assets of the funds will be liquidated within
10 years. Morgan Stanley said 46 percent of the fair value of
its private-equity funds and 49 percent of its real-estate funds
are likely to be liquidated in the next 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tier 1 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs had $7.32 billion invested in private-equity
funds, $4.18 billion in private-debt funds, $3.02 billion in
hedge funds and $910 million in real-estate funds, according to
its filing. The bank&#8217;s Tier 1 capital was $68.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley had a $1.59 billion investment in private-
equity funds, $1.75 billion in hedge funds and $887 million in
real-estate funds as of June 30, the bank said. Its Tier 1
capital rose to $53.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s total stakes were down from $15.9 billion
as of Dec. 31, 2009, according to the filing. Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
total stakes decreased from $4.62 billion as of March 31 and
$4.94 billion at Dec. 31, 2009, according to previous filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rules curbing banks&#8217; investments in their own funds would
take effect 15 months to two years after a law is passed,
according to the legislation. Banks would have two years to
comply, with the potential for three one-year extensions after
that. They could seek another five years for &#8220;illiquid&#8221; funds
such as private equity or real estate, according to a
presentation from law firm Davis Polk  Wardwell LLP. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo expanded his health-care credit card probe, which has
included subpoenas to JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Chase Health
Advance, Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s Citi Health and CareCredit, a division
of General Electric Co&#8217;s GE consumer finance unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Cuomo announced an investigation into what he
called &#8220;predatory health care lending&#8221; where consumers were
allegedly misled about financing terms for health-care credit
cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our ongoing investigation has uncovered conflicts of
interest and predatory practices in the health care industry
that are hurting New Yorkers and patients across the country,&#8221;
Cuomo said today in a statement. &#8220;Patients are being misled
into paying for services they never received by the people they
should be able to trust the most -- their doctors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuomo said he has issued subpoenas to 14 dental and health
care clinics. The subpoenas seek marketing materials,
applications, terms of credit, and contracts. He claimed some
providers pressure consumers into using the card and are
rewarded with &#8220;kickbacks&#8221; in the form of rebates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup spokesman Samuel Wang said in an e-mailed
statement that the bank will cooperate with Cuomo&#8217;s
investigation. Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for New York-based
JPMorgan, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, GE spokesman Stephen White said the company was
looking forward to working with Cuomo&#8217;s office. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks erased gains as Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. helped send financial shares lower after
disclosing that it lost money on 10 days during the second
quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index rose less than 0.1 percent
to 1,121.71 at 9:55 a.m. New York time, trimming its advance
from 0.4 percent earlier. Financial stocks in the index slumped
0.4 percent. Goldman Sachs had posted perfect results, with no
losing days, in the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
</body></entry><entry author="By Rita Nazareth" date="Aug 09, 2010  9:31 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-09/goldman-sachs-cuts-2010-s-p-500-forecast-to-1-200-on-slowing-u-s-economy.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Cuts 2010 S&amp;amp;P 500 Forecast to 1,200</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lowered its
year-end forecast for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index to 1,200
from 1,250 and reduced its 2011 earnings projection, citing
weakening economic forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP 500 companies will post combined profit of $89 a share
next year, compared with Goldman Sachs&#8217; prior estimate of $93,
according to David Kostin, the New York-based equity strategist.
Jan Hatzius, the firm&#8217;s chief U.S. economist, lowered his
prediction for 2011 growth in gross domestic product to 1.9
percent from 2.4 percent on Aug. 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The weak GDP growth forecast and specter of deflation
means top-line sales increases will be hard to achieve,&#8221; Kostin
wrote today in a note to clients. He raised his 2010 earnings
forecast for the SP 500 to $81 a share from $78. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 has rallied 9.7 percent since July 2 as profit
growth that exceeded analyst estimates helped overcome concern
the economy will slip into the second recession in three years.
Growth in the U.S. slowed to a 2.4 percent annual rate in the
second quarter, less than forecast, reflecting an easing in
consumer spending, according to Commerce Department data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before today, the average estimate of 12 strategists
tracked by Bloomberg called for the SP 500 to rise 20 percent
in the last six months of 2010 to 1,242. U.S. earnings will
increase 35 percent in 2010, the biggest annual gain since 1988,
more than 8,000 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve may return to &#8220;unconventional&#8221; monetary
stimulus as early as this week&#8217;s policy meeting as the U.S.
economy continues to lose momentum, economists led by Hatzius
wrote Aug. 6. The firm raised its estimate for the jobless rate
as growth slows and the &#8220;reacceleration in U.S. output&#8221; expected
for 2011 is made more doubtful by congressional resistance to
fiscal stimulus, the note said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Jeff Kearns" date="Aug 09, 2010  9:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-09/nomura-hires-foran-of-goldman-sachs-as-bank-analyst-amid-u-s-expansion.html"><headline>Nomura Hires Foran of Goldman Sachs as Bank Analyst Amid U.S. Expansion</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Nomura Holdings Inc., the Tokyo-based
brokerage that&#8217;s expanded its global workforce by almost half in
two years, hired Brian Foran of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. as a
senior analyst covering U.S. banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foran will join the company&#8217;s U.S. unit, Nomura Securities
International Inc., as a New York-based managing director,
according to Michael Rietbrock, the head of U.S. equity
research. Foran will work alongside Glenn Schorr, who joined
from UBS AG in June as a managing director and senior analyst
covering U.S. brokers and asset managers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We did a search that looked at every bank analyst on Wall
Street, and chose Brian to work with Glenn,&#8221; Rietbrock said in
an interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s very rare that you get a chance to build a
department from scratch, and that&#8217;s one of the things that&#8217;s
making it attractive to people who are joining.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Kenichi Watanabe, pushing to
transform Japan&#8217;s biggest brokerage into a global financial
firm, has increased staff 44 percent in two years to 27,393 as
of June after purchasing Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.&#8217;s Asian
and European units and boosting U.S. hires. Forty-three percent
of Nomura employees work outside of Japan, double the level two
years ago, according to Nomura filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foran wasn&#8217;t available for comment, according to Jonathan Hodgkinson, a Nomura spokesman in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nomura hired Rietbrock, 41, from Bank of America Corp. in
March to lead the three-year plan to build the stock research
department for the U.S., where it is investing 250 billion yen
($2.74 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;600 Stocks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm said in May that it plans to offer research
coverage for 600 companies in the U.S. in a bid to boost revenue
from the world&#8217;s biggest equity market. Nomura increased its
U.S. workforce to about 1,781 people at the end of March, from
1,079 a year earlier, and has boosted its fixed-income division
to more than 270 employees from 50. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foran covered 22 lenders at Goldman Sachs including Fifth
Third Bancorp, KeyCorp, Regions Financial Corp. and SunTrust
Banks Inc., according to Bloomberg data. Goldman Sachs, the most
profitable firm in Wall Street history, made him a managing
director last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nomura has added 10 senior analysts from 10 different firms
since April, Rietbrock said. It hired JPMorgan&#8217;s Michael McCormack last week as a senior analyst covering the
telecommunications and cable television industries, and Sanford
C. Bernstein  Co. analyst Michael Nathanson, the top-ranked
entertainment industry analyst in Institutional Investor
magazine&#8217;s 2009 survey, in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month it hired Paul Lejuez of Credit Suisse Group AG
as an analyst covering U.S. retail companies and Harry Curtis of
Lazard Capital Markets as a stock analyst covering the U.S.
gaming, hotel and leisure industries. &lt;/p&gt;

agree to a deal to sell the company&#8217;s stake in the Jubilee oil
field to ExxonMobil Corp., the Energy Ministry said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kosmos asked the West African nation&#8217;s government on June
28 to consent to the deal, according to a statement signed by
Energy Minister Joe Oteng-Adjei dated Aug. 7. The government set
up a committee to review the request, the minister said in the
statement, which was posted on the Ghanaian government&#8217;s

&lt;p&gt;Tata Consultancy Services Ltd.,
Infosys Technologies Ltd. and Wipro Ltd., India&#8217;s largest
software exporters, fell in Mumbai trading after the U.S. Senate
passed a bill that could double work-visa costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tata Consultancy fell as much as 2.2 percent, the biggest
intraday drop since July 13, and traded 0.3 percent lower at
862.10 rupees as of 9:56 a.m. local time. Infosys declined 0.4
percent to 2,853.75 rupees and was the biggest contributor to
the benchmark Sensitive Index&#8217;s less than 0.1 percent drop.
Wipro lost 0.9 percent to 429.10 rupees, making it the worst
performer on the Sensex. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill, passed unanimously by the Senate last week, would
add $2,000 in per-visa fees for companies with more than half of
their employees in the U.S. on such visas. Software exporters
typically pay about $2,000 per visa application now, Bhavtosh Vajpayee, head of technology research at CLSA Ltd. in Hong Kong,
wrote in a note to clients dated today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While the margin hit is manageable and not as much of an
issue, we remain worried by such direction of visa
legislation,&#8221; Vajpayee wrote. &#8220;The passage of this bill will
likely enthuse those supporting employment protectionism and
encourage similar pieces of legislation which combine unrelated
things and impose non-tariff barriers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate fee increases are aimed at helping to fund a
$600 million effort to boost security at the U.S.-Mexican
border. Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, who&#8217;s sponsoring the
bill, said the technology-services companies add to unemployment
in the U.S. by outsourcing jobs to foreign workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology companies such as Tata, Infosys and Wipro bring
skilled workers from overseas, often from India, into the U.S.
to develop software and manage projects for customers in the
country. The bill, if approved by the House of Representatives,
could cost such companies a total of as much as $250 million a
year, according to Som Mittal, president of Nasscom, a trade
association for Indian information-technology companies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its
growth forecasts for the world&#8217;s two largest economies on signs
that stimulus boosts will wane. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan will grow 1.4 percent in 2011, compared with an
earlier forecast of a 1.7 percent expansion, Tokyo-based senior
economist Chiwoong Lee said in a report dated Aug. 7. Goldman
last week lowered its projection of U.S. growth for the same
year to 1.9 percent from 2.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A report today showed Japan&#8217;s current-account surplus
narrowed for a second month as export gains cooled, adding to
concerns that the recovery is losing steam. Government
incentives that have bolstered spending at home are wearing off,
with economists forecasting second quarter gross domestic
product grew at half the pace of the previous period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect signs that growth is slowing to gradually
emerge in line with the disappearance of the government stimulus
boost both in Japan and abroad,&#8221; Lee wrote in a separate report
dated today. &#8220;The U.S. economic recovery has lost a
considerable amount of its momentum.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan will experience a &#8220;significant falloff&#8221; in consumer
spending, which has so far been propped up by government
measures, according to Lee. He noted that there is &#8220;little
chance&#8221; Prime Minister Naoto Kan will extend a program
scheduled to expire in December that encourages household to buy
energy-efficient electronics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven-Month High &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s jobless rate is at a seven-month high and factory
output fell in June. The GDP report due Aug. 16 may show that
the expansion moderated to an annualized 2.1 percent from 5
percent in the previous quarter, according to the median
estimate of 11 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee said Japan&#8217;s export gains are already losing steam and
will be &#8220;sluggish&#8221; in 2011 given a worsened outlook for the
expansion in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. growth will be slower in 2011 because of lawmakers&#8217;
resistance to extend several stimulus measures, Lee said. The
unemployment rate, which was at 9.5 percent in July, may climb
to 10 percent &#8220;by early 2011,&#8221; he said. That may prompt the
Federal Reserve to return to &#8220;unconventional monetary easing,&#8221;
such as increasing its purchases of Treasuries, he added. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Lee Vance retired in 2000, after
spending 20 years at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., he had several
goals. He wanted to get better at math, improve his squash game,
buy a helicopter and write a thriller. I can&#8217;t attest to his
flying or racquet skills, but his second novel is a dazzler. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Garden of Betrayal&#8221; opens with the kidnapping of 12-
year-old Kyle Wallace. We are introduced to &#8220;the man with the
burn,&#8221; a satisfyingly nasty villain, and to the happy nuclear
family whose life is about to be ruined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skip ahead seven years. Mark Wallace, his wife, Claire, and
teenage daughter, Kate, are still dealing with their lingering
guilt. Wallace and Kate have been searching for Kyle ever since
his abduction, but Claire has become detached. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, global crises tend to bring a family together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wallace&#8217;s work day begins with a news report about a
possible terrorist attack on a Russian natural gas pipeline. As
an &#8220;independent energy analyst,&#8221; he must scurry to inform his
wealthy clients of the potential market effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he begins calling around to learn more, it starts to
seem like many of his contacts are involved. Worse, connections
appear to exist between Kyle&#8217;s disappearance and the recent
attack. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co., the world&#8217;s biggest
media company, reported third-quarter sales and profit that beat
analysts&#8217; estimates on gains at the ESPN sports channel and a
rebound at the film studio led by &#8220;Toy Story 3.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income rose 40 percent to $1.33 billion, or 67 cents a
share, from $954 million, or 51 cents, a year ago, Burbank,
California-based Disney said today in a statement. Sales gained
16 percent to $10 billion in the period ended July 3, exceeding
the $9.34 billion average of 16 analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESPN recognized deferred revenue sooner, and the company&#8217;s
Marvel and Pixar studios enjoyed box-office successes with two
films in the period. &#8220;Iron Man 2&#8221; and &#8220;Toy Story 3&#8221; have
generated more than $300 million each at U.S. and Canadian
theaters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;ESPN should see some good growth as the automotive
industry returns to advertising,&#8221; Tony Wible, an analyst at
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia, said before results
were announced. He has a &#8220;neutral&#8221; rating on the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit beat the 59-cent average of 19 estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney gained 51 cents to $35.80 in extended trading. The
stock added 13 cents to $35.29 at 4:01 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading and has gained 9.4 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cable Profit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating profit at the media networks division increased
43 percent to $1.89 billion on $4.73 billion in revenue. Within
the division, cable properties contributed $1.68 billion in
operating profit, buoyed by $344 million of previously deferred
revenue at ESPN, advertising gains and affiliate fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Basketball Association finals between the Los
Angeles Lakers and the Boston Celtics drew record audiences to
ABC and ESPN. The two networks also carried World Cup soccer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit at Disney&#8217;s theme parks dropped 8.4 percent to $477
million on sales that rose 2.9 percent to $2.83 billion. The
company raised U.S. ticket prices on Aug. 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studio operating profit of $123 million compared with a
loss of $12 million a year ago, while revenue gained 30 percent
to $1.64 billion. Worldwide, &#8220;Toy Story 3&#8221; collected $895.6
million in ticket sales, while &#8220;Iron Man 2&#8221; garnered $621.4
million, according to Amazon.com Inc.&#8217;s Box Office Mojo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time,&#8221; which cost $200
million to produce and racked up $328.3 million in worldwide
ticket sales since its May 28 release, was a disappointment,
according to Anthony DiClemente, an analyst at Barclays Capital
in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Toy Story 3&#8221; also helped drive Disney&#8217;s consumer
product sales, with revenue advancing 19 percent to $606 million
and operating profit increasing 22 percent to $117 million. The
company&#8217;s interactive division, which includes video games, lost
$65 million on sales of $197 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors want to learn more about Disney&#8217;s plans for the
recently purchased online video-game companies Playdom and
Tapulous, DiClemente wrote today in a note. Disney may also
update investors on talks with Time Warner Cable Inc. over
retransmission rights to its television networks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Qatar, which signed an agreement
with Exxon Mobil Corp. in January to jointly build a $6 billion
petrochemicals complex, may choose a different partner for the
project, an official at state-run Qatar Petroleum said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qatar Petroleum will select as a partner the company that
makes the best proposal, said the official, who declined to be
identified because he wasn&#8217;t authorized to speak publicly on the
issue. The Qatari energy company and Exxon Mobil have ended
their agreement and Qatar is seeking new partners, Middle East
Economic Digest reported, citing people close to the companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qatari Energy Minister Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyah,
speaking today outside his office in the Qatari capital Doha,
declined to comment on the petrochemicals project. &#8220;I will tell
you later,&#8221; he said when asked if Qatar would try to build it
with a different partner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Neu, a Houston-based Exxon Mobil spokesman, said in
an e-mail that the company continues to work with Qatar
Petroleum on the project, repeating comments he made last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project represents the biggest single energy investment
in Qatar since Royal Dutch Shell Plc announced plans in July
2006 to build its $19 billion Pearl gas-to-liquids plant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planned petrochemical facility is to include a 1.6
million-ton-a-year steam cracker, two 650,000-ton polyethylene
plants and a 700,000-ton ethylene glycol unit. Construction was
to have been completed by 2015, Exxon and Qatar Petroleum said
in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qatar aims to raise its annual production of petrochemicals
to 28 million tons by 2014 by making use of its rising output of
natural gas, a feedstock for chemicals manufacturing, Energy
Minister Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyah said in May. Qatar,
holder of the world&#8217;s third-largest gas reserves, plans to pump
23 billion cubic feet of gas a day by 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil is the largest investor in Qatar&#8217;s plants that
liquefy natural gas for transport by ship, with partial
ownership in 12 of the country&#8217;s 14 plants. Exxon is also an
investor in a Qatari condensate refinery. Other international oil companies that have invested in Qatar include Shell, ConocoPhillips and Total SA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total owns stakes in four Qatari facilities that liquefy
gas and is a shareholder in Qatar Petrochemical Co. and Qatofin
Co.&#8217;s so-called linear low-density polyethylene plant. Qatofin
owns part of a new 1.3 million-ton-a-year ethane cracker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. hired
Michael Wise from Morgan Stanley as a partner to run the team
that helps manage equity offerings for financial institutions in
the Americas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wise, 52, will start in New York in November, according to
an internal memo sent to employees by John S. Weinberg and David M. Solomon, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s co-heads of investment banking. Wise
succeeds Stuart Bernstein, who now oversees investment banking
for clean technology and renewable energy companies. Andrea Rachman, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, confirmed the contents
of the memo and declined to comment further. Wise declined to
comment when contacted by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the most profitable securities firm in Wall
Street history, ranks fourth this year among managers of U.S.
equity and equity-linked offerings compared with second-place
Morgan Stanley, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Wise,
who was most recently chairman of equity capital markets at
Morgan Stanley, will report to Stephen Pierce, who runs the
equity capital markets division in the Americas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wise, who joined Morgan Stanley in 1997, covered media and
communications and then U.S. financial institutions for the
equity capital markets division at the firm. He later because
co-head of financial institutions global capital markets and
then co-head of equity capital markets in the Americas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs generated $593 million in revenue from equity
underwriting in the first six months of 2010, compared with $533
million at Morgan Stanley, according to company filings. Both
firms lag behind industry leader JPMorgan Chase  Co., which
reaped $767 million in the first six months of the year from the
business, and Bank of America Corp., which made $662 million,
filings show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported Goldman Sachs&#8217;s hire on
its website yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Matthew Leising" date="Aug 10, 2010 10:52 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-10/derivatives-rules-proposals-from-cftc-sec-due-by-december-goldman-says.html"><headline>Derivatives Rules Proposals From CFTC, SEC Due by December, Goldman Says</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission will issue
draft derivatives rules by December, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
analyst Daniel Harris said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harris attended a forum in New York sponsored by the
Futures Industry Association yesterday where officials from the
agencies discussed the timing of the draft rules, the analyst
said today in a note to clients. The CFTC, which may release its
proposals as soon as mid-November, has identified 30 rule-making
areas and the SEC has pinpointed 26 for its part in regulating
swaps markets, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The level of &#8216;unknowns&#8217; materially outweighs the
&#8216;knowns,&#8217;&#8221; Harris wrote. &#8220;One major takeaway is market
participants lack the detailed rule set from the SEC/CFTC to
accurately develop systems to implement almost any of the likely
requirements of the Dodd-Frank&#8221; law, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among changes to the $615 trillion over-the-counter
derivatives market signed into law last month by President
Barack Obama are requirements that standardized interest-rate,
credit-default and other swaps be processed by clearinghouses
and traded on exchanges or similar systems. New designations
must be defined as well, such as what constitutes a
&#8220;standardized&#8221; swap and which firms are &#8220;major swap
participants.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators have until July to set in place most of the new
rules based on the financial regulatory reform law. Industry
comments and public reaction will be sought by the regulators
after the drafts are released. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No &#8216;Tsunami&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC &#8220;noted it would likely provide &#8216;waves&#8217; of rules to
the industry for comment and discussion rather than a &#8216;tsunami&#8217;
of rules all at one time,&#8221; the analyst said. Harris noted that
the SEC has significant other areas of jurisdiction in which it
must write new rules under the Dodd-Frank Act while the CFTC is
only engaged in derivatives reform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The push to overhaul the market structure of OTC
derivatives follows the collapse of the housing bubble that
caused the financial crisis and credit markets to seize up,
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.&#8217;s bankruptcy and more than 8
million U.S. job losses. Private swaps complicated efforts to
solve the crisis when regulators and market users couldn&#8217;t
easily determine how interconnected banks had become through
trading the contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearinghouses, which are capitalized by their members,
increase stability in over-the-counter derivatives markets
because they lessen the effect of a default by sharing the risk
among the membership. They also use daily margining procedures
to keep accounts current and allow regulators to see market
positions and prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defining Terms &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One hurdle for the CFTC and SEC is defining terms in the
new law that will have wide consequences for swaps users. One
definition is &#8220;major swap participant,&#8221; which isn&#8217;t a dealer
in the market but a firm that &#8220;maintains a substantial position
in swaps&#8221; using leverage that creates &#8220;substantial
counterparty exposure,&#8221; according to the Dodd-Frank bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether large hedge funds, asset managers or other
investors qualify under this definition will be up to the
regulators over the next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The definitions &#8220;are still unclear and need further
clarity, given their prominence in the legislation,&#8221; Harris
said. &#8220;This also includes other more specific titles, including
securities based swaps dealers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Securities based swap dealers will be those banks that
trade some types of credit-default swaps and will be under SEC
regulation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India called a proposed U.S. bill
that could double visa costs as &#8220;highly discriminatory&#8221; and
said such a measure will erode the competitiveness of the
nation&#8217;s software services companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk, India&#8217;s
Trade Minister Anand Sharma said the legislation will hurt
primarily companies of Indian origin, according to a statement
on the government&#8217;s website today. If it becomes law, the bill
that was passed unanimously by the U.S. Senate on Aug. 5 is
likely to add $2,000 to fees for companies with more than half
their employees on work visas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate fee increases are aimed at helping to finance a
$600 million effort to boost security at the U.S.-Mexican border,
including the addition of 1,500 guards and other officials. Sen.
Charles Schumer of New York, who sponsored the bill, said the
technology-services companies add to unemployment in the U.S. by
outsourcing jobs to foreign workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Though the need of the U.S. government to strengthen
their border security is understandable, it is inexplicable to
our companies to bear the cost of such a highly discriminatory
law,&#8221; according to the Indian government statement. Indian
companies account for less than 12 percent of the visas issued
in the U.S., it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares Drop &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Infosys Technologies Ltd., Tata Consultancy
Services Ltd. and Wipro Ltd. declined in Mumbai trading. Tata
Consultancy, the country&#8217;s largest, fell 1.7 percent; Infosys,
the second-biggest dropped 1.6 percent and Wipro slid 2.1
percent on the Bombay Stock Exchange, compared with a 0.4
percent loss in the benchmark Sensitive Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology companies such as Wipro and Infosys bring
skilled workers from overseas, often from India, into the U.S.
to develop software and manage projects for customers in the
country. The bill could cost such companies up to $250 million a
year, Som Mittal, president of Nasscom, a trade association for
Indian information-technology companies, said Aug. 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of U.S. workers for the India-based companies
are in the U.S. on what are known as H-1B and L-1 visas, the
companies say in regulatory filings. The law wouldn&#8217;t affect U.S.
technology companies such as International Business Machines
Corp., Microsoft Corp. and Google Inc. since less than half
their workers use work visas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merrill Lynch  Co., the brokerage
unit of Bank of America Corp., won a U.S. judge&#8217;s ruling denying
a bid by 17 black financial advisers for group status in their
five-year-old discrimination lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broker George McReynolds of Nashville, Tennessee, sued in
2005, alleging Merrill Lynch&#8217;s practices and procedures favored
white financial advisers over their black counterparts,
impairing their ability to make comparable incomes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Robert W. Gettleman in Chicago on Aug.
5 rejected the bid by McReynolds and 16 other advisers for
certification of the case as a class action, or group, lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Plaintiffs&#8217; statistical evidence alone is insufficient to
establish companywide discrimination&#8221; affecting each member of
the proposed class the same way, the judge said. Each individual
group member&#8217;s claim must be tried before a jury, Gettleman
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McReynolds, along with the plaintiffs who joined the case
after he filed it, sought to represent about 700 advisers and
trainees who had worked in the firm&#8217;s Global Private Client unit
from January 2001 until now, according Gettleman&#8217;s decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America, the
largest U.S. bank by assets, acquired New York-based Merrill
Lynch last year for about $33 billion in stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linda Friedman, a lawyer for the advisers, said she would
ask a federal appeals court for permission to seek review of the
ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I continue to believe that a class action is the only way
to rid Wall Street of this horrific discrimination,&#8221; said
Friedman, a partner at Stowell  Friedman Ltd. in Chicago.
&#8220;However, the individuals who brought this lawsuit have no
intention of dropping it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Gettleman&#8217;s ruling stands, there could be as many as 200
trials, Friedman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re pleased with the court&#8217;s ruling,&#8221; Bank of America
spokesman William Halldin said in a phone interview. He declined
to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;

Smith Inc., 05-cv-06583, U.S. District Court, Northern District
of Illinois (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman, HSBC May Be Sued Over Worthless &#8216;Minibonds&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and HSBC Holdings Plc may be
sued over $1.6 billion in worthless securities sold to retail
investors, primarily in Hong Kong, a judge in New York ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III yesterday
reversed part of a decision by Lehman&#8217;s bankruptcy judge, who
threw out a suit by seven holders of structured financial notes
called minibonds. The plaintiffs seek to represent a class of
investors in the notes from June 16, 2003, to Sept. 15, 2008,
Pauley said in his decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pacific International Finance Ltd. issued the minibonds and
marketed them as linked to the credit of financially sound
companies and backed by AAA-rated collateral, Pauley said. The
minibonds became worthless as a result of the collapse of Lehman
Brothers, which filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history in
September 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Hong Kong regulatory authority investigation disclosed
that Lehman designed the minibonds program and used Pacific
Finance to issue them, Pauley said. Lehman selected HSBC Bank
USA as trustee of the collateral securing the notes, Pauley
said, citing testimony in the Hong Kong proceeding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In two orders, issued in November and December, U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge James Peck ruled that the plaintiffs lacked
standing to sue and that any attempt to revise their complaint
would be futile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In yesterday&#8217;s ruling, Pauley reversed the dismissal of one
count against HSBC and Lehman and permitted the plaintiffs to
amend two dismissed counts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neil Brazil, an HSBC spokesman, said the firm had no
immediate comment on the ruling. Kimberly Macleod, a Lehman
spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t return a voice-mail message seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;

District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff Judge Erred in Fake Profit Ruling, Court Told &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers defrauded by Bernard Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme
deserve repayment of as much as $500,000 each, even if they took
out more than they put into his investment business, a lawyer
argued yesterday to an appeals court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland erred when he ruled in
March that the Securities Investor Protection Corp. doesn&#8217;t
offer insurance to investors, and that Madoff customers can only
collect from SIPC if they put in more cash than they took out
from his business, attorney Helen Chaitman argued in a brief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaitman, who represents 700 investors, asked the U.S.
Court of Appeals in New York to reverse Lifland and rule that
SIPC trustee Irving Picard should review claims based on final
account statements in December 2008 that included fake profit
from the fraud. Those investors say they had no knowledge of the
fraud at New York-based Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities
LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Appellants are, typically, people in their 70s, 80s or
90s, whose assets, other than their homes, were invested in
BLMIS&#8221; and face &#8220;serious medical issues,&#8221; Chaitman wrote in
yesterday&#8217;s filing. &#8220;They live in constant fear that the
trustee will sue them for the amount they withdrew from BLMIS in
excess of their investments.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those investors are among more than 2,500 Madoff customers
who couldn&#8217;t collect any SIPC money under Lifland&#8217;s ruling,
which Picard sought. Picard, who is overseeing the liquidation
of Madoff&#8217;s business, has allowed more than 2,100 claims to
proceed.     Madoff, 72, who pleaded guilty last year, is
serving a 150-year sentence for running the largest Ponzi scheme
in U.S. history. Prosecutors said that Madoff falsely told
investors that they profited from stock trades that never took
place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard, hired by SIPC to repay victims of the fraud, has
said that using account statements to set claims would let
Madoff decide who gets what, and include profit from trades that
didn&#8217;t really happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victims wanted their final account statements from Madoff&#8217;s
firm to determine the size of their claims. They had argued to
Lifland that SIPC was required to base claims on customers&#8217;
legitimate expectations. Lifland disagreed, ruling the account
statements were &#8220;entirely fictitious.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Securities Investor Protection Corp. v. Bernard
L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, 08-01789, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEC, Goldman&#8217;s Tourre Had Preliminary Talks, Agency Lawyer Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive director Fabrice Tourre
had &#8220;very preliminary&#8221; talks with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission to settle the agency&#8217;s civil fraud claims
against him, an SEC lawyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would characterize us as having very preliminary
discussions along those lines a while back, and that&#8217;s all,&#8221;
SEC lawyer Lorin Reisner said in a hearing yesterday in U.S.
District Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC sued Goldman Sachs and Tourre in April, over claims
the firm misled investors in collateralized debt obligations
linked to subprime mortgages. Tourre, the only Goldman Sachs
executive sued individually, remains in the case after the firm
agreed to a $550 million settlement last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement includes a $300 million fine and $250
million in restitution for investors. The penalty is the largest
ever levied by the Securities and Exchange Commission against a
Wall Street firm, the SEC said. Goldman Sachs acknowledged it
made a &#8220;mistake&#8221; and that marketing materials for the
instruments had &#8220;incomplete information,&#8221; the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones in Manhattan granted
final approval to the settlement on July 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jones&#8217;s approval of the accord came a day after Tourre
filed court papers asking her to dismiss the lawsuit against
him. Tourre denied making any materially misleading statements
or omissions related to the sale of Abacus 2007-AC1 CDOs linked
to subprime mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the hearing yesterday, before U.S. Magistrate Judge
Michael Dolinger, the parties discussed possible outlines for
pretrial discovery in the case. Reisner said the SEC is turning
over 9 million pages of investigative documents to Tourre&#8217;s
lawyers. He said the agency may seek to take pretrial testimony
from 25 witnesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pamela Chepiga, one of Tourre&#8217;s lawyers, said Tourre may
seek to take testimony from as many as 50 witnesses. Chepiga
said the parties may also need to pursue evidence in the U.K.
and Germany in addition to the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dolinger set an Oct. 4 hearing to discuss the progress of
discovery in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Goldman Sachs, 10-CV-3229, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP and U.S. Agree on Oil Spill Compensation Fund &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. completed negotiations with BP Plc over the
company&#8217;s agreement to establish a $20 billion fund to
compensate victims of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico,
according to the Justice Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The negotiations followed an agreement made between the
London-based company and President Barack Obama on June 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased that BP made an initial contribution and
has taken an important step toward honoring its commitment to
the president and the residents and business owners in the gulf
region,&#8221; said Associate Attorney General Tom Perrelli in a
statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund, administered by lawyer Kenneth Feinberg, doesn&#8217;t
cap BP&#8217;s liability for cleanup costs and economic damage, Obama
said in June, and it doesn&#8217;t supersede the rights of individuals
or states to sue the company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Is Sued by Technicians for Overtime &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was sued by five computer-network
technicians who claim the bank denied them overtime pay for
their work as contractors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit seeks class-action status and unspecified
damages, Goldman Sachs said yesterday in a filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. The plaintiffs contend they
deserve overtime pay for working more than 40 hours a week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s conduct was &#8220;willful and in bad faith,&#8221;
according to the technicians, who say the bank never paid them
overtime for work weeks that topped 70 hours. More than 100
employees in New York and New Jersey were underpaid as a result,
according to the lawsuit filed in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, based in New York, disputed the allegations
in a July 16 filing, saying the technicians weren&#8217;t
&#8220;employees&#8221; as defined by the states&#8217; labor laws. About 25
percent of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s staff works on technology, Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar said earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bardouille v. Goldman, Sachs  Co., 10cv4285,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Accused of Air Pollution at Texas City Refinery &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A BP Plc unit allowed the emission of about 500,000 pounds
of air pollutants in violation of Texas environmental laws,
state Attorney General Greg Abbott alleged in a lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP &#8220;admitted to the release of air contaminants to the
atmosphere&#8221; at its Texas City refinery after an April 6 fire on
part of a ultracracking unit, according to the complaint filed
yesterday in Austin, Texas. BP restarted the ultracracker and
another unit before repairing a compressor, sending benzene and
other pollutants into the air for about a month, the state said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;BP decided to continue those units so as not to reduce
productivity,&#8221; the state said in the complaint. &#8220;BP made very
little attempt to minimize the emission of air contaminants
caused by its actions, once again prioritizing profits over
environmental compliance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state also has a pending action over a release of
contaminants related to a 2005 explosion at the Texas City
refinery, Abbott said in a statement yesterday. That blast
killed 15 workers and led to a $50 million fine by the U.S. for
a violation of the federal Clean Water Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP &#8220;will continue to cooperate with the attorney general&#8217;s
office&#8221; and the Texas environmental quality agency &#8220;to resolve
their concerns,&#8221; Scott Dean, a BP spokesman, said in an e-
mailed statement. The company declined further comment on the
litigation, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas lawsuit is State of Texas v. BP Products North
America Inc., District Court, Travis County, Texas. The class
action is Fontenot v. BP Products North America Inc., 3:10-cv-
295, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Texas
(Galveston). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Sued Over Gulf Oil Cleanup Chemicals, Sunday Telegraph Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc has been sued for the first time over alleged
environmental and health problems caused by chemicals used in
the Gulf of Mexico cleanup, the Sunday Telegraph reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP, based in London, sprayed 1.8 million gallons of Corexit
dispersant into the sea to break up the oil from the spill, the
newspaper reported Aug. 8. Two Gulf Coast residents, Glynis
Wright and Janille Turner, have filed a class action in Alabama,
alleging that the chemical is &#8220;four times more toxic than sweet
crude oil,&#8221; the newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit is also against Nalco Holding Co., Corexit&#8217;s
manufacturer, the Telegraph said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Wine, a BP spokesman, declined to comment on the
lawsuit when reached by e-mail. He said the type of dispersants
used and the method employed were approved by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legal Reviews &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuomo Subpoenas Citigroup, JPMorgan in Health Probe &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo expanded his health-
care credit card probe, which has included subpoenas to JPMorgan
Chase  Co.&#8217;s Chase Health Advance, Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s Citi Health
and CareCredit, a division of General Electric Co&#8217;s GE consumer
finance unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Cuomo announced an investigation into what he
called &#8220;predatory health care lending&#8221; where consumers were
allegedly misled about financing terms for health-care credit
cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our ongoing investigation has uncovered conflicts of
interest and predatory practices in the health care industry
that are hurting New Yorkers and patients across the country,&#8221;
Cuomo said yesterday in a statement. &#8220;Patients are being misled
into paying for services they never received by the people they
should be able to trust the most -- their doctors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuomo said he has issued subpoenas to 14 dental and health
care clinics. The subpoenas seek marketing materials,
applications, terms of credit, and contracts. He claimed some
providers pressure consumers into using the card and are
rewarded with &#8220;kickbacks&#8221; in the form of rebates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup spokesman Samuel Wang said in an e-mailed
statement that the bank will cooperate with Cuomo&#8217;s
investigation. Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for New York-based
JPMorgan, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, GE spokesman Stephen White said the company was
looking forward to working with Cuomo&#8217;s office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farrow Says Campbell Got &#8216;Huge Diamond&#8217; From Taylor &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actress Mia Farrow said Naomi Campbell told her she
received a &#8220;huge diamond&#8221; from men sent by former Liberian
President Charles Taylor, contradicting the supermodel&#8217;s
testimony at a war-crimes tribunal last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campbell &#8220;said that in the night she had been awakened,
some men were knocking at the door and they had been sent by
Charles Taylor and had given her a huge diamond,&#8221; Farrow, 65,
said yesterday during the war-crimes trial of Taylor at the
Special Court for Sierra Leone in Leidschendam, the Netherlands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campbell told the court last week that two strangers handed
her some &#8220;dirty looking stones&#8221; after a dinner at Nelson
Mandela&#8217;s home in South Africa in 1997. Campbell said she at
first didn&#8217;t know the stones were diamonds or who had given them
to her. Farrow said she hadn&#8217;t been shown any stones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taylor, who is on trial for crimes against humanity during
the Sierra Leone civil war, has been accused by Chief Prosecutor
Brenda Hollis of giving the British model a diamond after the
Mandela dinner. Conflict diamonds, also known as blood diamonds,
have been used to fund wars throughout Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taylor last year denied providing weapons to fighters in
the Revolutionary United Front, a Sierra Leone rebel movement,
in exchange for diamonds. The testimonies of Farrow and Carole
White, Campbell&#8217;s former agent, on the gift to the supermodel
may refute Taylor&#8217;s claim he never possessed rough diamonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ken Macdonald, a lawyer for Campbell, didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to e-mails seeking comment on yesterday&#8217;s testimonies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taylor has pleaded innocent to 11 counts including
enlisting child soldiers, murder and sexual slavery during the
1991-2002 civil war in Sierra Leone. As many as 250,000 people
were killed in the conflict. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dutch Prosecution Says Trafigura Fine Is Too Low &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dutch public prosecutor&#8217;s service appealed a ruling by
an Amsterdam district court against Trafigura Beheer BV for
shipping harmful waste to Ivory Coast, saying the fine of 1
million euros ($1.3 million) was too low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prosecution can also prove that the closely held
commodities trader committed fraud, Esther Schreur, spokeswoman
for the Dutch National Fraud Prosecutor said, confirming an
earlier report by the newspaper De Volkskrant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We vigorously deny all charges,&#8221; including fraud, said
Margaret van Kempen, an outside spokeswoman for Trafigura.
Trafigura has also appealed the ruling, she said. Ron van
Leeuwen, spokesman for the Amsterdam Appeals Court, said he
couldn&#8217;t yet confirm or deny the appeals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waste from a ship hired by Trafigura four years ago was
given to a local company, Compagnie Tommy, and was dumped near
Ivory Coast&#8217;s commercial capital, Abidjan. Residents claimed the
pollution caused deaths and widespread illness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca Settles Two-Thirds of Seroquel Lawsuits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca Plc will pay about $198 million to settle
17,500 lawsuits, or about two-thirds of the total cases alleging
its antipsychotic drug Seroquel causes diabetes in some users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlements resulted from court-ordered mediation, the
London-based drugmaker said in a statement yesterday.
AstraZeneca previously agreed to pay at least $55 million to
resolve more than 5,500 cases alleging the company knew Seroquel
could cause diabetes and failed to adequately warn patients,
people familiar with those settlements said. These earlier
agreements are part of the 17,500 settlements, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca, the U.K.&#8217;s second-biggest drugmaker, is closer
to wiping out the 26,000 total Seroquel cases and at a lower
cost than expected, analysts said. Average payments are $10,000
to $11,000 for former Seroquel users, according to previous
announcements and people familiar with earlier accords. The
settlements are &#8220;probably lower than the worse-case estimate,&#8221;
according to Jeremy Batstone-Carr, an analyst at Charles Stanley
 Co Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While the terms remain confidential and are subject to
non-monetary agreements, we believe it was in the best interest
of the company to explore resolving these cases through the
mediation process,&#8221; Tony Jewell, AstraZeneca&#8217;s spokesman, said
in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We remain committed to a strong
defense effort, but will also continue to participate in good
faith in court-ordered mediation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the company and former Seroquel users met last
week with Stephen Saltzburg, a George Washington University Law
School professor who is the mediator in the case, the people
familiar said. Saltzburg said in a February court filing that
AstraZeneca faces as many as 26,000 suits over Seroquel and a
global settlement wasn&#8217;t likely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Company officials said earlier this month that lawyers for
other former Seroquel users are scheduled to meet Saltzburg to
see if their claims can be resolved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ken Bailey, a Houston-based lawyer representing former
Seroquel users who hasn&#8217;t settled his cases, said he was
encouraged that AstraZeneca was willing to talk about resolving
patients&#8217; claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Seroquel users contend research has shown patients
have developed diabetes while on the drug and AstraZeneca&#8217;s own
researchers acknowledged the link in internal documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consolidated Seroquel case is In re Seroquel Products
Litigation, 06-MD-01769, U.S. District Court, Middle District of
Florida (Orlando). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mexico&#8217;s congress asked the
government to void an auction for wireless airwaves sought by
Grupo Televisa SA and partner NII Holdings Inc. (NIHD), which operates
the Nextel brand in Latin America, saying the top bid doesn&#8217;t
reflect the value of the spectrum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The bid offered by Televisa-Nextel doesn&#8217;t satisfy
reality in terms of the market,&#8221; said the non-binding
resolution approved today by lawmakers and published in the
parliamentary gazette. &#8220;The restrictions imposed in the auction
blocked any type of effective competition.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa and NII are awaiting approval from the Federal
Telecommunications Commission for their bid of 180 million pesos
($14 million) to claim 30 megahertz of national airwaves in the
1.7 gigahertz band. The companies plan to use the capacity to
offer third-generation services such as high-speed Internet
within 12 months to 18 months after receiving the airwaves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa, the world&#8217;s largest Spanish-language broadcaster,
and Reston, Virginia-based NII made the sole bid for one-third
of the 90 megahertz of airwaves auctioned because they were the
only participants qualified for that spectrum under rules that
limit each company&#8217;s total holdings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America Movil SAB (AMX), Mexico&#8217;s largest mobile carrier with
about 71 percent of the market, and Telefonica SA (TEF) spent a
combined 5.1 billion pesos to acquire a total of 30 megahertz of
airwaves, equal to what Televisa and NII bought. They had to bid
higher because all four auction participants were qualified to
compete for that spectrum. America Movil has said Televisa and
NII should have to pay more for the airwaves they won. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An additional 30 megahertz offered in the auction went
unsold because no company was qualified to bid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The congress sent the approved resolution to the
Communications  Transportation Ministry, which can choose
whether to act on it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Financiero Galicia SA rose to
a three-year high in Buenos Aires trading after JPMorgan Chase 
Co. raised the financial holding company to &#8220;overweight.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galicia rose 5.7 percent to 2.96 pesos at 4 p.m. New York
time, the highest price since July 25, 2007. Argentina&#8217;s Merval
index fell 2.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan raised its rating from &#8220;underweight,&#8221; saying in
an e-mailed note to clients that the owner of Argentina&#8217;s
second-largest private bank by revenue is set to increase
profitability on acquisitions, efforts to &#8220;clean up its balance
sheet&#8221; and Argentina&#8217;s more favorable economic outlook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Galicia is now our top pick among banks outside of
Brazil,&#8221; analyst Saul Martinez wrote. &#8220;We prefer Galicia over
Banco Macro SA based on relative valuation and what we consider
to be greater leverage to an improving macro backdrop.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banco Macro slid 3.4 percent to 15.75 pesos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grupo Galicia had second-quarter profit of 46.4 million
pesos, according to a statement posted yesterday on the Buenos
Aires exchange&#8217;s website. That compares with net income of 36.8
million pesos a year earlier, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s largest
drug company, sued Iceland&#8217;s Actavis Group hf asking a judge to
block sales of a generic version of the cholesterol drug Lipitor
until a patent expires in 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Pfizer contends Actavis has applied to the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration to make copies of the drug in
violation of the 1999 patent, according to a complaint filed
today in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Plaintiffs will be irreparably harmed&#8221; if Actavis
markets its product before the patent-protection expires, Pfizer
lawyers said in the complaint, which also seeks legal fees and
expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipitor is the best-selling medicine worldwide, with sales
of $11.4 billion in 2009. Pfizer said July 6 it received
approval from the European Commission for a new chewable form of
Lipitor for children over age 10. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capmark Financial Group Inc.&#8217;s
creditors sought court permission to sue Citigroup Inc. and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. over a $1.5 billion loan made to the
commercial property lender. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loan provided &#8220;little to no value&#8221; to Capmark and
merely ensured the lenders were paid ahead of other creditors,
unsecured creditors said in a papers filed yesterday in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of assets available to pay unsecured creditors
&#8220;is the direct result of this troubling transaction,&#8221; the

creditors are seeking court permission to sue on behalf of the

&lt;p&gt;The ruble will strengthen more than
9 percent against the dollar and the Ukrainian hryvnia and
Kazakhstan&#8217;s tenge will rise about 5 percent as central banks
allow the currencies to appreciate to combat quickening
inflation led by food prices, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruble, which closed at 30.05 per dollar yesterday, may
strengthen to 27.5 over the next 12 months, analysts led by
London-based Anna Zadornova wrote. The hryvnia could rise to 7.5
per dollar in the next six months, from 7.89 per dollar
yesterday, and the tenge may strengthen to 140 per dollar over
the next year, from 147.32 today, Zadornova wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia&#8217;s worst drought in five decades and bad weather in
Canada could lead to 36 percent-higher wheat prices over the
next three to 12 months compared with the average price in the
first half of this year, Zadornova wrote in the note, e-mailed
late yesterday. All three countries buy and sell dollars and
euros to prevent currency swings that harm exporters and
undermine confidence in the exchange rate. A stronger currency
helps combat inflation by reducing prices of imports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank lending is still &#8220;depressed&#8221; in Ukraine and
Kazakhstan, and the prospect of higher rates is &#8220;premature,&#8221;
Zadornova wrote in the note. &#8220;However, given relatively higher
inflation risks, the central banks may view currency
appreciation as more acceptable to curb short-term inflation
pressure.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Bullish View&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruble weakened 0.8 percent to 30.29 per dollar by the 5
p.m. close of trading in Moscow and added 0.3 percent to 39.36
per euro. That left it 0.2 percent stronger at 34.37 versus the
dollar-euro basket used by the central bank to manage the ruble.
The hryvnia was little changed and traded at 7.89 per dollar.
The tenge fell 0.2 percent to 147.5 per dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank Rossii is already scaling back its foreign currency
purchases, a sign it is willing to allow ruble strength, which
&#8220;reinforces our bullish view on the ruble,&#8221; Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors increased bets that the ruble will weaken today,
with non-deliverable forwards showing the currency at 30.64 per
dollar compared with yesterday&#8217;s 30.2225 per dollar, the biggest
decline in three-month NDFs since June 4. The contracts, known
as NDFs, are a way of gauging market expectations of a
currency&#8217;s movements as they allow companies to hedge against
possible fluctuations in an exchange rate and foreign investors
to speculate on currencies in countries that limit their
participation in the markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian inflation, which hit a record low annual 5.5
percent last month, will probably accelerate by 1.3 percentage
points this year, Zadornova wrote. Inflation in Ukraine and
Kazakhstan may quicken by 1.8 percentage points, Goldman said,
from 6.8 percent and 6.7 percent respectively last month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chalmette refinery in Louisiana,
a joint venture between Exxon Mobil Corp. and Petroleos de
Venezuela SA, experienced a power disruption early yesterday,
according to a company spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There was some intermittent flaring that resulted, but
production continued throughout and all customer needs were
met,&#8221; Kevin Allexon, a company spokesman, said in an e-mail.
&#8220;The problem has been resolved.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incident took place at 2:50 a.m. local time yesterday,
according to a filing with the National Response Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plant has catalytic reforming, fluid catalytic
cracking, hydrocracking, delayed coking and aromatics processing
units, according to a permit on file with Louisiana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery produces gasoline, diesel, benzene, toluene,
xylene and distillates and has a capacity of 207,000 barrels a
day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italy&#8217;s finance police seized a
rare, 3-meter (9.8-foot) albino python that a group of Rome drug
dealers used to guard their stash of cocaine and intimidate
customers who owed them money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The dangerous python was seated on top of 200 grams of
cocaine, which has a street value of up to 50,000 euros
($65,340),&#8221; Lieutenant Luca Gelormino, who took part in the
operation, said in a phone interview. &#8220;When we found it, we got
scared and called a team of experts for help.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twelve people were arrested in the operation, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Wiretapping and surveillance videos show that some
customers got very scared after going to pick up the cocaine,&#8221;
Gelormino added. &#8220;The snake was used to threaten them&#8221; to pay
their debts, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The snake was transferred to the Rome zoo, police said. &lt;/p&gt;

Harrington" date="Aug 12, 2010  6:46 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-12/ubs-hires-chung-from-goldman-sachs-as-investment-bank-s-co-general-counsel.html"><headline>UBS Hires Chung From Goldman Sachs as Investment Bank''s Co-General Counsel</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;UBS AG hired Chul Chung from Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. to be co-general counsel for its investment
bank as Switzerland&#8217;s largest bank navigates the biggest
overhaul of U.S. financial regulation since the Great
Depression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chung, who worked at Goldman Sachs for 16 years, most
recently as head of derivatives clearing strategies in its
securities division, will begin in the newly created position in
New York in late October, UBS General Counsel Markus Diethelm
said in an Aug. 4 memo to employees. Spokeswoman Kelly Smith in
New York confirmed the contents of the memo. Chung will work
alongside David Graham, now general counsel to the investment
bank, who becomes co-general counsel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chung&#8217;s work will &#8220;help the investment bank more
assertively play a role in industry discussions regarding market
structures and regulations, and -- critically -- to ensure that
the investment bank remains in full compliance with all relevant
laws and regulations in the markets in which we operate,&#8221;
Diethelm said in the e-mailed memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama last month signed financial-industry
legislation into law that will give U.S. regulators oversight of
privately negotiated derivatives markets. The law creates a
mechanism for liquidating failing financial firms whose collapse
could roil markets and creates a consumer bureau at the Federal
Reserve to monitor banks for credit-card and mortgage lending
abuses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearinghouses &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the rules, banks will be required to move much
of the $615 trillion over-the-counter derivatives market through
clearinghouses designed to absorb losses from the failure of a
dealer or major investment firm. The measure was prompted by the
collapse in 2008 of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and near-
bankruptcy of American International Group Inc., which had sold
derivatives protecting banks against losses on mortgage-linked
securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision also is
proposing rules that would impose higher capital requirements on
banks worldwide. The rules would tighten control of what goes
into banks&#8217; calculation of risk, redefine what counts as capital
and levy higher charges against holdings including derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chung, reached on his mobile phone, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While at Goldman, Chung worked with industry committees of
the International Swaps and Derivatives Association as the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York and other regulators pressed
dealers to curb risks from derivatives markets and to begin
moving trades through clearinghouses. Chung, a graduate of
Georgetown University&#8217;s law School, spent the first three years
of his career at New York law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher
and Flom LLP, Diethelm said in the memo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethiopian economic growth may
average 14.9 percent annually over the next five years, during
which the country&#8217;s gross domestic product is expected to
double, Prime Minister Meles Zenawi was cited as saying by the
Walta Information Service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meles said the increase in growth is &#8220;achievable,&#8221; Walta
reported. The five-year Growth and Transformation Plan will
focus on improving food security and the situation of women and
children in the country, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, Ethiopia&#8217;s GDP was $25.6 billion, according to the
World Bank. The government said GDP growth in the fiscal year
through July 7 was 10.1 percent, while the International
Monetary Fund estimated the figure to be about 7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. appointed
James P. Esposito, who worked in the debt capital markets unit,
to succeed Howard Schiller as chief operating officer of the
firm&#8217;s investment-banking division, according to an internal
memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esposito will report to David Solomon and John S. Weinberg,
co-heads of investment banking, who reported the change in the
memo to employees. The contents of the memo were confirmed by
Michael DuVally, a spokesman at the firm. Schiller is retiring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Jim will focus on increasing global connectivity and
driving best business practices across products and regions,&#8221;
Solomon and Weinberg said in the memo. &#8220;In addition, Jim will
oversee the activities related to the division&#8217;s key day-to-day
operations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s investment-banking division, which includes
merger advisory and debt and equity underwriting, contributed 6
percent of the firm&#8217;s pretax earnings in the first half of 2010,
compared with 5 percent in the same period last year.
Esposito had been global head of the teams that help raise debt
financing for investment-grade borrowers, the public sector and
infrastructure projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Fine, managing director on the U.S. investment-
grade syndicate desk, will become head of the desk, DuVally
said. Fine was promoted to managing director in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esposito, who joined Goldman Sachs in 1995 in emerging-
markets sales, will continue to serve the financing needs of
some large global clients, the memo said. He became a managing
director in 2002 and a partner in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dow Jones Newswires reported Esposito&#8217;s new role and Fine&#8217;s
promotion earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s largest
software company, is seeking a patent on a system that would
allow gestures to be used to input data to a computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to application 20100199228, which was published
in the database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Aug. 5,
the system includes a camera that captures gesture, and a
&#8220;gesture recognizer engine&#8221; to identify the significance of
the gesture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system can read American Sign Language gestures, which
is a manual language used by the deaf in the U.S., according to
the application. It can be used with a prop such as a
conductor&#8217;s baton or a tennis racket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to being used to generate words, gestures can
be used to indicate emotions or to control game activities,
according to the patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft applied for the patent in February 2009 with the
assistance of Woodcock Washburn LLP of Philadelphia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interpump Group Unit Sued Over Patent by Colorado Competitor &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A unit of Italy&#8217;s Interpump Group SpA was sued for patent
infringement by a Colorado competitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint, filed Aug. 4 in federal court in Beaumont,
Texas, accuses Interpump&#8217;s NLB Corp. of infringing two patents
for high-pressure nozzles for waterjet tools held by StoneAge
Inc. of Durango, Colorado. The tools are used to clean sewer
pipes and to bore through stone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to court papers, NLB is a former StoneAge
customer now making its own products that infringe the patents.
StoneAge claims NLB&#8217;s Typhoon 10 nozzles use the patented
technology and design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In dispute are patents 7,635,096 and D617,870, which were
issued in December 2009 and June 2010, respectively. They cover
StoneAge&#8217;s Banshee line of products, the company said in its
court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;StoneAge complained that NLB&#8217;s infringing products were
shown at a trade show in Louisville, Kentucky, in February, and
that NLB&#8217;s sales representatives are contacting StoneAge&#8217;s
European customers, offering the allegedly infringing Typhoon
devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company claims it has lost sales it would have made
&#8220;but for NLB&#8217;s infringement&#8221; and that it will continue to
suffer &#8220;irreparable harm&#8221; if NLB continues to make and sell
infringing products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;StoneAge asked the court for money damages, &#8220;no less than
a reasonable royalty,&#8221; and for an award of profits NLB gained
from its allegedly infringing products. The company also asked
for awards of attorney fees and litigation costs and a court
order barring NLB from future infringement of the patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BLP didn&#8217;t respond immediately to an e-mailed request for
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is represented by Brian A. Carpenter, Eric W.
Buether and Christopher M. Joe of Buether Joe  Carpenter LLC of
Dallas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is StoneAge Inc. v. NLB Corp., 1:10-cv-00460, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Texas (Beaumont). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Sues Iceland&#8217;s Actavis Over Lipitor Patent &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s largest drug company, sued
Iceland&#8217;s Actavis Group hf asking a judge to block sales of a
generic version of the cholesterol drug Lipitor until its patent
5,969,156 expires in 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Pfizer contends Actavis has applied to the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration to make copies of the drug in
violation of the 1999 patent, according to a complaint filed
yesterday in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Plaintiffs will be irreparably harmed&#8221; if Actavis
markets its product before the patent-protection expires, Pfizer
lawyers said in the complaint, which also seeks legal fees and
expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipitor is the best-selling prescription drug worldwide,
with sales of $11.4 billion in 2009. Pfizer said July 6 it
received approval from the European Commission for a new
chewable form of Lipitor for children over age 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actavis spokeswoman Hjordis Arnadottir didn&#8217;t immediately
return voice and e-mail messages seeking comment on the lawsuit
after Icelandic business hours yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Pfizer Inc. v. Actavis Group hf, 10CV675, U.S.

&lt;p&gt;UBS Sued for Copying Oil Reports in Investor Research &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS AG&#8217;s U.K. unit was sued for allegedly copying articles
from oil and gas publications and reprinting them in the
investment research it distributed to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy Intelligence Group Inc., based in New York, said its
publications, which include International Oil Daily, World Gas
Intelligence and Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, were copied by
UBS Ltd. at least 10 times during 2006 and 2007, according to
the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Articles from Energy Intelligence or portions of them were
reprinted in UBS&#8217;s own investment research publication, Daily
Oil News, according to the suit filed in a London court last
month and made public this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month in a similar scenario, Deutsche Bank AG research
analyst Pankaj Jha left after the bank told clients one of his
reports contained &#8220;significant similarities&#8221; to an article
from Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the UBS case, analyst Jon Rigby had a single-user
subscription for the Energy Intelligence publications beginning
as long as 10 years ago, according to the suit. Rigby, based in
London, is the global coordinator of the bank&#8217;s Daily Oil News
publication, which is distributed in at least 17 countries
including the U.S., U.K., Germany, Russia and China, Energy
Intelligence said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS, based in Zurich, has been copying the publications
&#8220;in a systematic manner over a long period of time for the
purposes of enhancing its profile and reputation amongst its
customers and potential customers,&#8221; according to the complaint.
&#8220;The defendant threatens and intends to repeat the acts of
infringement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS spokesman Dominik von Arx declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The publisher&#8217;s suit seeks unspecified damages from UBS for
copyright infringement and an injunction to stop UBS and its
employees from copying the articles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The acts of the defendant were carried out flagrantly and
in the belief that the benefit to be so gained far exceeded the
damages at risk,&#8221; according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy Intelligence charges subscribers an additional fee
to reproduce an article from one of its publications, according
to the lawsuit. The publisher said it was unable to determine
how many times UBS copied stories or &#8220;the full extent&#8221; to
which they were distributed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank showed &#8220;cynical disregard&#8221; by printing its own
copyright prohibiting the redistribution of the material on each
publication of Daily Oil News, according to Energy Intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., the Copyright Clearance Center in Danvers,
Massachusetts, licenses a wide range of written content for
business and other purposes. These licenses can include works
from academic and other specialty publishers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viacom Appeals YouTube Copyright-Infringement Ruling &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viacom Inc., the owner of MTV Networks and Paramount
studios, is appealing a ruling that Google Inc.&#8217;s YouTube video-
sharing website didn&#8217;t infringe Viacom copyrights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viacom appealed the June decision to the U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in New York, according to a filing yesterday in
federal court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Louis Stanton ruled that YouTube hadn&#8217;t
infringed Viacom&#8217;s copyrights because it&#8217;s protected by the
safe-harbor provision of the federal Digital Millennium
Copyright Act. The law states a service provider isn&#8217;t liable if
it removes infringing material when notified by the copyright
owner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Viacom International Inc. v. YouTube Inc.,

York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RadioShack Sues Former Iowa Licensee for Trademark Infringement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RadioShack Corp., a chain of consumer electronic stores
based in Fort Worth, Texas, sued a former licensee for trademark
infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somebody Cares Inc. of Fairfield, Iowa, is accused of
infringing RadioShack marks by continuing to operate a store
under the RadioShack designation one year after the license
agreement was terminated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint filed Aug. 10 in federal court
in Iowa, Somebody Cares had a license from RadioShack from
August 2000 to August 2009. RadioShack said it warned Somebody
Cares to quit using the marks in October 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter to Somebody Cares, which is included in the
court filing, mentions that Somebody Cares was also offering its
franchise for sale on the Craigslist website, &#8220;which is not
possible, as you do not have a franchise.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RadioShack said the public is likely to be confused by
Somebody Care&#8217;s actions, and that its business, reputation and
goodwill are damaged. The Texas company asked the court to order
Somebody Cares to stop the alleged infringement, and the
destruction, at Somebody Cares&#8217; expense, of all offending signs
and other promotional material. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the company asked for money damages, and
requested that they be tripled. RadioShack also requested awards
of litigation costs and attorney fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RadioShack is represented by Timothy J. Zarley of the
Zarley Law Firm Plc of Des Moines, Iowa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is RadioShack Corp. v. Somebody Cares Inc., 4:10-
cv-00367-REL-RAW, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Iowa
(Des Moines). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mile High Festival Promoters Seek Permission to Seize Fake Goods &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Promoters for Colorado&#8217;s Mile High Music Festival filed a
preemptive trademark infringement suit against vendors who would
sell unauthorized merchandise in the festival&#8217;s vicinity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit, filed Aug. 9 in federal court in Denver, accused
100 unidentified female defendants, 100 unidentified male
defendants and one unidentified company of selling counterfeit
T-shirts and other merchandise. These sales will damage the
authorized seller and confuse the public, according to the
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiff is AEG Life - Rocky Mountains LLC of Denver,
which promotes the festival and sells festival merchandise. The
festival, which opens Aug. 13 at a park north of Denver, drew
more than 90,000 attendees in 2009, its second year of
existence, and AEG Life says it derived &#8220;substantial income&#8221;
from the sale of authorized festival merchandise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It asked the court for an order barring infringement of its
marks and for authorization for law enforcement officials and
agents of AEG to seize and deliver for destruction all
unauthorized merchandise sold in the vicinity of the arena. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AEG also asked for money damages, attorney fees and
litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The festival promoter is represented by Cara R. Burns of
Hicks, Mims, Kaplan  Burns of Santa Monica, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm represents many entertainment figures and events
with reference to licensed merchandise, including Aerosmith,
Toni Braxton, Coca-Cola Co, Walt Disney Co., Hard Rock Cafe,
Glenn Danzig, Don Henley, H.R. Giger, INXS, Judy Garland, Korn,
Lollapolloza, Mattel, Metallica, Morrissey, Nirvana, Paul Simon,
The Eagles, Thomas the Tank, Warner Bros., and Dwight Yocum
according to the Hicks, Mims website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is AEG Live - Rocky Mountains LLC, v. John Does,
1:10-cv-01896-WYD, U.S. District Court, District of Colorado
(Denver). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trafficker in Fake Trojan Condoms Gets 37 Months in Prison &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A U.S. immigrant from China was sentenced to 37 months in
prison for trafficking in more than a million counterfeit Church
 Dwight Co. Trojan condoms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jian &#8220;Jimmy&#8221; Wang was sentenced yesterday by U.S.
District Judge Brian Cogan in Brooklyn, New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Condoms tested from the same batch as Wang&#8217;s were found to
burst, leak and lack spermicide, prosecutors said. The brands
seized were Trojan Magnum, Trojan-ENZ, Trojan Ultra Ribbed and
Trojan Mint Tingle, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang is also accused of trademark infringement in an
ongoing civil case brought by Church  Dwight in the same court.
Wang is one of more than 40 defendants accused of distributing
fake Trojan condoms in the area comprising the federal judicial
district known as the Eastern District of New York and in
Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to court papers in the civil case, the
counterfeit condoms were sometimes packaged two to a box rather
than three, were the wrong size and the lubricated condoms were
packed with a silicon lubricant Church  Dwight doesn&#8217;t use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K.&#8217;s Times reported in November that the making of
fake condoms was &#8220;rampant&#8221; in China and that just one workshop
in central Hunan province turned out 2.19 million condoms
produced in unsanitary settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The civil case is Church  Dwight Inc. v. Kaloti
Enterprises of Michigan LLC, 1:07-cv-00612-BMC-VVP, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron
said his coalition government will make it easier for people
from China and India to get visas to visit Britain as part of an
attempt to promote tourism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ministers will work together in seeking opportunities to
promote the U.K. as a destination, Cameron said in a speech to
tourism officials in central London today. Tourism contributes
115 billion pounds ($180 billion) a year to the British economy
and employs 10 percent of the workforce, Cameron said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re going to take a good look across government at all
those policies that don&#8217;t fit neatly into the tourism or
Department for Culture, Media and Sport departmental box but
which nonetheless impact on tourism in a big way,&#8221; Cameron
said. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to remove some of the obstacles that put
people off coming here, for example, by working more closely
with our international partners to improve the local delivery of
visa services in key markets like China and India.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online applications for visas will be increased from one
third to 75 percent by 2011, with 100 percent coverage by 2014,
Cameron said. The government will also give more power to local
authorities to set tourism policy and remove bureaucracy that
discourages small businesses, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overseas tourists made 7.35 million visits to the U.K. in
the second quarter, 3 percent fewer than a year earlier, the
Office for National Statistics in London said today. U.K.
residents&#8217; visits abroad dropped 9 percent to 13.7 million. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gold may rally to a record $1,300
an ounce in six months, driven by low interest rates and the
prospect of renewed quantitative easing in the U.S., according
to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The recent selloff has left speculative long positions
in gold oversold relative to U.S. real interest rates,&#8221;
analysts David Greely and Damien Courvalin, wrote in a note
yesterday. This has &#8220;set the stage for a rally to our six-
month gold-price target of $1,300 an ounce,&#8221; they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve has resorted to direct bond purchases,
also known as quantitative easing, as part of its response to
the world financial crisis. The U.S. central bank said this
week that it would reinvest principal payments on mortgage
holdings into long-term Treasury securities to support growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold for immediate delivery, set for a 10th annual advance,
touched an all-time high of $1,265.30 an ounce on June 21. The
precious metal was at $1,201.35 at 3:10 p.m. in Singapore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long positions are bets that prices may gain. Real
interest rates are the difference between nominal interest
rates and inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, there may be a considerable risk gold will drop in
the longer term if the Fed tightens monetary policy earlier than
expected, the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman recommended buying platinum for October delivery
on the New York Mercantile Exchange as recovering global
automobile demand will likely continue to put &#8220;upward
pressure&#8221; on autocatalyst demand, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research In Motion Ltd. is seeking
to reassure Wall Street customers about the security of its
BlackBerry e-mail service as countries including Saudi Arabia
and India press for more access to its network, said two people
familiar with the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIM has held at least one conference call in the past week
with clients including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. to discuss BlackBerry operations, said the people
who didn&#8217;t want to be named because the talks were private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least one corporate customer has told RIM it&#8217;s not
satisfied with the explanations so far and is seeking an
additional meeting, according to one person. The company needs
to persuade customers of the security of its messaging system,
said Scott Sutherland, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. in
San Francisco, who recommends buying the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talks underscore the challenges for Waterloo, Ontario-
based RIM as it expands in emerging markets as growth in North
America slows. Sales outside North America rose to 37 percent of
RIM&#8217;s $15 billion in revenue in the last fiscal year, up from 23
percent in the fiscal year ended February, 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate customers such as Wall Street banks favor RIM&#8217;s
BlackBerry because its encryption and other safeguards protect
communications from prying eyes. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and India have pushed for more access to BlackBerry
services, out of concern the smartphone could be used to
coordinate terrorist attacks or violate national mores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loopholes In System? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi authorities decided this week to allow the BlackBerry
messaging service to continue in the country, after threatening
a ban. RIM and the kingdom&#8217;s wireless operators are making
progress in implementing a system to allow monitoring of user
data, the state-owned Saudi Press Agency said, citing the
country&#8217;s telecommunications regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such reports have prompted questions from corporate
customers about whether RIM is making concessions on the
security of its software, said one of the people familiar with
the conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This whole issue has come up very quickly,&#8221; Sutherland
said. &#8220;Trying to solve something this quickly obviously
triggers concerns that there will be loopholes created in the
system.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIM fell 77 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $53.40 at 4 p.m. New
York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Since the U.A.E. said
on Aug. 1 that it plans to suspend BlackBerry service, the
shares have lost 7.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consistent Cooperation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIM said on Aug. 4 it cooperates with governments around
the world on a consistent basis and any claims it&#8217;s providing
special access to one government are inaccurate. The company
also said it can&#8217;t meet requests from governments for codes to
users&#8217; data because the BlackBerry corporate service was
designed to prevent RIM, or anyone else, from being able to read
encrypted information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governments have gone public with their demands. The U.A.E.
said on Aug. 1 it would ban BlackBerry Messenger, e-mail and
Web-browsing services because of security concerns beginning
Oct. 11. The Indian government yesterday said RIM and wireless
operators had to give regulators access to mobile communications
by Aug. 31 or face a shutdown of its service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, a government official said RIM will provide India
with the means to monitor BlackBerry instant messages next week.
The company may also offer tools to monitor e-mails from RIM&#8217;s
corporate customers, the official, who declined to be identified
in line with government policy, told reporters in New Delhi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Crow, RIM vice president of government relations,
said earlier today he is &#8220;still hopeful&#8221; of solving security
issues concerning BlackBerry services in India, after meeting
the South Asian country&#8217;s Home Secretary G.K. Pillai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIM&#8217;s Response &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIM issued a statement yesterday to customers that it said
was in response to government comments in India. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Although RIM cannot disclose confidential regulatory
discussions that take place with any government, RIM assures its
customers that it genuinely tries to be as cooperative as
possible with governments in the spirit of supporting legal and
national security requirements, while also preserving the lawful
needs of citizens and corporations,&#8221; the statement said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also said the &#8220;security architecture&#8221; of its
corporate e-mail system hasn&#8217;t been modified for any country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tenille Kennedy, a spokeswoman for RIM, declined to comment
beyond the statement yesterday. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for
Goldman Sachs, and Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for JPMorgan,
also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Heebner&#8217;s Capital Growth
Management LP sold stakes in Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan
Stanley and exited its biggest mining holdings during the second
quarter, according to a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm, based in Boston, sold miners Freeport-McMoran
Copper  Gold Inc., Teck Resources Ltd. and Cliff Natural
Resources Inc. during the quarter, according to a document filed
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today. The
firm&#8217;s biggest new purchase was 5.2 million shares of SanDisk
Corp., the largest maker of flash-memory cards for digital
cameras and phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heebner, who runs the $3.64 billion CGM Focus Fund, is
known for building concentrated positions in industries and
making rapid moves in and out of stocks. His fund rose an
average of 1.2 percent annually in the past five years to beat
84 percent of rivals through Aug. 12, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The fund is down 11 percent in 2010, the third
straight year of lagging behind the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs had been a top holding in the first quarter
with 2.64 million shares valued at $451 million as of March 31.
The SEC sued the New York-based investment bank in April for not
disclosing the role of hedge-fund firm Paulson  Co. in helping
design a mortgage-backed security that lost value. Goldman Sachs
declined 23 percent in the second quarter, and agreed in July to
pay a $550 million penalty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy, Natural Resources &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heebner, whose fund climbed 80 percent in 2007 because of
his bet on energy and natural resources, reversed course this
year as commodity prices fell on concerns that economic growth
is slowing. The Reuters Jefferies CRB Index declined 5.6 percent
during the three months ended June 30. Energy companies
accounted for less than 1 percent of Heebner&#8217;s holdings,
Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heebner bought new stakes in Whirlpool Corp., the world&#8217;s
largest appliance maker, and car parts retailer O&#8217;Reilly
Automotive Inc. during the second quarter, bringing his combined
stake in consumer-oriented companies to 32 percent, according to
Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heebner added to Citigroup Inc. and PNC Financial Services
Group Inc. during the second quarter. He also bought real estate
investment trusts such as Equity Residential and AvalonBay
Communities Inc. to raise his combined ownership of financial
companies to 31 percent, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money managers who oversee more than $100 million of
equities or more must file, within 45 days of the end of each
quarter, a Form 13F with the SEC that lists their U.S. exchange-
traded stocks, options and convertible bonds. The filings don&#8217;t
show non-U.S. securities or how much cash the firms hold. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp., ConocoPhillips,
Mubadala Development Co. and TX Oil Limited, chaired by Neil Bush, brother of former U.S. President George W. Bush, may gain
rights to explore in Turkmenistan&#8217;s Caspian Sea blocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov told the
government to make a choice on bids from those companies for
blocks 9 and 20 in the Caspian, according to the government&#8217;s
website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkmenistan allows international investors the ability to
gain equity in offshore exploration while limiting onshore
access to its state oil and gas companies. The bulk of
Turkmenistan&#8217;s known resources, including the world&#8217;s fourth-
largest reserves of natural gas according to BP Plc data, are in
onshore fields in the country&#8217;s east. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Majors are more interested in bigger gas plays onshore,
but may believe that a presence offshore would help them achieve
this ultimate objective,&#8221; Ed Chow, a senior fellow at the
Center for Strategic International Studies, said by e-mail
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ConocoPhillips and Abu Dhabi-backed Mubadala have a venture
to explore a block in the Kazakh sector of the Caspian together.
In April, the two companies had a plan to team up in accessing
Turkmen offshore areas, a person familiar with the strategy said
at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TX Oil was formed this year to develop opportunities in
Turkmenistan. Neil Bush visited the country in February with a
letter to his father, President George H.W. Bush, to the Turkmen
president, according to the website Turkmenistan.ru. Bush again
visited the Turkmen president in June, according to the website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E-mails to Chevron asking for confirmation of the bid
weren&#8217;t immediately returned. TX Oil didn&#8217;t immediately return
calls. ConocoPhillips didn&#8217;t respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stock-index futures retreated,
indicating the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index will extend its
weekly drop, as investors awaited reports on consumer confidence
and retail sales to gauge the strength of the economic recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel Corp. declined 1.4 percent in European trading as two
people familiar with the matter said Nvidia Corp. is working on
a microprocessor for tablet devices that would directly compete
with Intel products. Freeport-McMoRan Copper  Gold Inc. climbed
as gold rose for a second day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;September contracts on the SP 500 fell 0.3 percent to
1,075.5 as of 7:48 a.m. in New York. Dow Jones Industrial
Average futures dropped 0.2 percent to 10,247, while Nasdaq-100
Index futures declined 0.4 percent to 1,820. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Consumer confidence and retail sales will be crucial data
this afternoon as the U.S. economy is very dependent on
consumption,&#8221; said Michael Koehler, the head of strategy at
Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg in Mainz, Germany. &#8220;The recovery
will take time and the equity market will remain nervous in the
coming weeks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks fell yesterday, sending the SP 500 to the
biggest three-day decline since July 1, after an unexpected
increase in unemployment claims added to evidence the economy is
weakening. The gauge has retreated 3.4 percent so far this week
as the Federal Reserve said the pace of recovery will probably
be &#8220;more modest&#8221; than forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Double Dip&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As signs of slower U.S. growth have multiplied, market
participants have become worried about the possibility of a
double-dip recession,&#8221; Ed McKelvey, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s
senior U.S. economist in New York, wrote in a note to clients.
&#8220;The probability is unusually high -- between 25 percent and 30
percent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks retreated in Europe today amid renewed concern that
the region&#8217;s sovereign debt crisis will curb economic growth in
the second half of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield premium that investors demand to hold Greek 10-
year bonds instead of benchmark German debt of similar maturity
rose to 800 basis points for the first time since June 28.
Demand fell at an auction of Italian debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European stocks had opened higher as Germany&#8217;s economy grew
in the second quarter at the fastest pace since the country&#8217;s
reunification two decades ago. German gross domestic product
surged 2.2 percent from the first quarter, fueling euro-area
growth of 1 percent, the fastest in four years. Economists had
forecast GDP would rise 1.3 percent in Germany and 0.7 percent
in the currency bloc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth Differential &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany&#8217;s performance highlights the growth differential
across the euro region in a quarter that saw the Greek fiscal
crisis threaten to break the bloc apart. France&#8217;s economy
expanded 0.6 percent in the period, Italy&#8217;s 0.4 percent and
Spain&#8217;s 0.2 percent, while Greece experienced a 1.5 percent
contraction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Retail sales increased 0.5 percent in July after a 0.5
percent drop the prior month, according to the median estimate
of 77 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News before the Commerce
Department&#8217;s data is released at 8:30 a.m. in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preliminary Reuters/University of Michigan confidence
index for August is forecast to increase to 69 from 67.8 in
July, economists said. The report is due at 9:55 a.m. Other data
may show consumer prices were restrained and business
inventories gained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel declined 1.4 percent to $19.17 in Switzerland. Nvidia
has a team of engineers developing chips that could be used by
computer makers instead of Intel, said the people, who declined
to be identified because the project hasn&#8217;t been made public.
Nvidia began working on a tablet chip after an earlier effort to
create laptop processors didn&#8217;t pan out, the people said. Those
chips weren&#8217;t cheap enough to compete with Intel&#8217;s Atom chips,
according to the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nvidia shares rose 2.7 percent to $8.96 in early New York
trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freeport-McMoRan, owner of the world&#8217;s largest gold mine,
climbed 0.7 percent to $70.89 in early New York trading as gold
traded at a four-week high in London. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VirnetX Holding Corp., which reached
a $200 million settlement with Microsoft Corp. over patents for
ways to communicate privately over the Internet, sued Apple Inc.
and Cisco Systems Inc. over the same technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VirnetX also named Aastra Technologies Ltd. and NEC Corp.
in the complaint filed Aug. 11 in federal court in Tyler, Texas.
The Scotts Valley, California-based company is seeking cash and
an order to ban further use of its patented inventions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patents cover use of a domain-name service to set up
virtual private networks, through which a website owner can
interact with customers in a secure way or an employee can work
at home and access a company&#8217;s electronic files. The technology
stemmed from work performed for the U.S. Central Intelligence
Agency, VirnetX has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple, Cisco, Aastra and NEC are accused in the complaint
of infringing at least one of five patents. Cupertino,
California-based Apple&#8217;s iPhone, iPod music player and iPad
tablet computer infringe two patents, according to VirnetX. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint also lists communications manager products,
routers and servers made by San Jose, California-based Cisco;
Clearspan and Pointspan products from Concord, Ontario-based
telecommunications equipment maker Aastra, and Communications
Server by Tokyo-based NEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messages seeking comments from Apple, Cisco, NEC and Aastra
weren&#8217;t immediately returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s biggest software maker, agreed to
pay $200 million in May to end a patent dispute that involved
some of the same patents as in the latest case. Defense
contractor SAIC Inc. received a portion of the payment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is VirnetX Inc. v. Cisco Systems Inc., 10cv417,
U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas (Tyler). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan Patents His Initials, NTV Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan patented his
initials, NTV television reported on its website yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erdogan applied to the Turkish Patent Institute and was
granted a patent for the initials &#8220;RTE,&#8221; written in a blue
font, to be used as a brand, the Istanbul-based news channel
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RTE brand is to be used for &#8220;items like printed
documents, publications, calendars, posters and photographs&#8221; in
the fields of public relations, radio and television broadcasts
and education, NTV said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prime minister also applied this month for the web
address www.rte.com.tr, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, Datel End Patent Fight Over Xbox 360 Controllers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. settled its patent fight with Datel
Holdings Ltd. over controllers used in the Xbox 360 video-game
system. An antitrust dispute remains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terms are confidential, Kevin Kutz, a spokesman with
Microsoft, said yesterday. The agreement ends a case with the
U.S. International Trade Commission in Washington and a mirror
lawsuit in federal court in Seattle. The two companies &#8220;have
reached an agreement to resolve all of the issues&#8221; in the
pending ITC case, they said in an Aug. 10 filing with the trade
agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft had filed infringement claims over the TurboFire
and WildFire controllers made by Staffordshire, England-based
Datel, saying they copied patented designs. The controllers can
turn single-shot pistols used in games such as &#8220;Call of Duty&#8221;
into fully automatic weapons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an Aug. 11 filing in the federal antitrust case in San
Francisco, Martin Glick, Datel&#8217;s lawyer, said the company
&#8220;continues to assert that its initial controllers did not
infringe Microsoft&#8217;s design patents and that those patents are
invalid.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Datel&#8217;s antitrust lawsuit accuses Microsoft of trying to
monopolize the market for multiplayer, online gaming systems and
for accessories not sold with the Xbox. Datel claims that
Microsoft deployed a software update to the Xbox to ensure that
Datel memory cards wouldn&#8217;t work with the system. This created
fear among consumers about using other Datel products, including
the controllers, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a telephone interview, Glick said the antitrust case
&#8220;is continuing forward full-steam.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it was within its rights to provide the
update to protect its copyrights, and any depression in sales
was because consumers &#8220;have not shown any interest in Datel&#8217;s
controllers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 74 million Xbox 360 game controllers have been
sold worldwide since 2005, including about 40 million in the
U.S., according to the ITC complaint. Microsoft said it has sold
or licensed more than $7 billion worth of products whose designs
are covered by the patents in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In the Matter of Certain Game Controllers, 337-
715, U.S. International Trade Commission (Washington). The
antitrust case is Datel Holdings Ltd. v. Microsoft Corp.,
09cv5535, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DuPont Sues Carpet-Cleaning Company over Teflon Trademark Use &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DuPont Co. sued a Florida carpet-cleaning company for
trademark infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magic Touch Cleaning  Restoration Inc., of Tavares,
Florida, is accused of infringing DuPont&#8217;s Teflon trademarks for
its polytetrafluoroethylene products. According to the complaint
filed Aug. 11 in federal court in Orlando, Florida, the carpet-
cleaner is using the Teflon mark without a license. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DuPont says customers are misled by Magic Touch&#8217;s ads, and
mistakenly assume there is an affiliation between the two
companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wilmington, Delaware-based chemical company asked the
court to bar Magic Touch&#8217;s unauthorized use of the Teflon mark,
and for awards of money damages, attorney fees and litigation
costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magic Touch couldn&#8217;t reached for comment. A telephone
number listed for the company had been disconnected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DuPont is represented by Philippe W. Deve of Miami&#8217;s Adorno
 Yoss LLP, and Dickerson M. Downing and Julia K. Smith of
Washington&#8217;s Crowell  Moring LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is  E.I. duPont de Nemours  Co v. Magic Touch
Cleaning and Restoration Inc., 5:10-cv-00381-MMH-GRJ, U.S.
District Court, Middle District of Florida (Orlando). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Target Sued over Farouk&#8217;s &#8216;Chi&#8217; Trademark for Hair Irons &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Target Corp., the Minneapolis-based discount retailer, was
sued for trademark infringement by a Dallas-based maker of hair
goods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farouk Systems Inc. claims Target is selling counterfeit
versions of Chi hair irons. The products aren&#8217;t made or approved
by Farouk, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas company&#8217;s &#8220;valuable reputation and significant
goodwill associated with the Chi mark&#8221; have been damaged and
consumers have been deceived by Target&#8217;s alleged sales of fakes,
according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farouk asked the court for awards of money damages,
litigation costs and attorney fees. Additionally, the company
requested an order barring further infringement of its mark, and
asked that the money damages be tripled to punish Target for its
actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Target didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mailed request
for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farouk is represented by Anthony F. Matheny and Mark
Chretien of Miami-based Greenberg Traurig LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Farouk Systems Inc., v. Target Corp., 4:10-cv-
02860, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Texas
(Houston). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Jersey Shore&#8217; Regular Can&#8217;t Register Name as Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole Polizzi, a member of the cast on &#8220;Jersey Shore,&#8221;
was denied her request to register &#8220;Snooki&#8221; as a trademark,
according to the database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polizzi is known as &#8220;Snooki&#8221; on &#8220;Jersey Shore,&#8221; a
program on Viacom Inc.&#8217;s MTV network. She applied for the
trademark in February. The patent office refused her
application, saying the name sounded too much like part of an
existing mark, &#8220;The Adventures of Snooky,&#8221; which is used for a
series of children&#8217;s books. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her application isn&#8217;t totally rejected. The patent office
said it was only impermissible to register it for printed
matter. She also seeks to register it for &#8220;entertainment in the
nature of personal appearances,&#8221; which the patent office found
acceptable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polizzi is represented in her quest for a trademark by Tara
Hart-Nova of Phillips Lytle LLP of Buffalo, New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louisiana Man Acknowledges Pirating Xboxes, Video Games &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Louisiana resident pleaded guilty to violation of the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act, according to an Aug. 11
statement from the U.S. attorney&#8217;s office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reno Jean Daret IV, 28, of Thibodaux, advertised the
modification of Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s Xbox 360 video-game consoles
and the sale of &#8220;back up&#8221; copies of games, prosecutors said in
the statement. The term &#8220;back up copies&#8221; is frequently used to
describe pirated software, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Modification&#8221; generally refers to illegal circumvention
of copyright-protection features on game consoles so that
pirated copies can be used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undercover agents contacted Daret in November to have a
game console modified and to buy pirated games. Following the
purchase, agents raided Daret&#8217;s residence and found &#8220;numerous&#8221;
Xbox 360 game consoles and computer-related items used to modify
Xbox consoles and pirate video games, according to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daret, who pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Kurt
Engelhardt, faces a maximum prison term of five years, a
$500,000 fine and one year of supervised release &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangkok TV Company Wins $8.3 million in Thai Copyright Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangkok Broadcasting  Television Co. was awarded $8.3
million in damages in a copyright and trademark case, Northwest
Asian Weekly reported yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IPTV Corp. and BKT Group and its management were found
liable for copying, selling and broadcasting BBTV&#8217;s programs
without authorization, according to the publication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangkok Broadcasting sued in May 2009. After a five-week
trial in May 2010, the jury found all defendants liable,
according to the publication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to awarding Bangkok Broadcasting damages, the
court ordered the defendants not to do anything that could
infringe the television station&#8217;s rights in the future,
Northwest Asian Weekly reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Inc., Coca-Cola Co. and Walt
Disney Co. are among the favorite holdings of Morris Mark,
president of Mark Asset Management Corp., Barron&#8217;s reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, the owner of the world&#8217;s most popular search
engine, and Coca-Cola, the world&#8217;s largest soft-drink maker, are
underpriced because &#8220;the market is overlooking that you can buy
quality today at no premium,&#8221; the New York-based asset manager,
who oversees about $500 million, told Barron&#8217;s in its Aug. 16
edition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Google&#8217;s management is constantly improving its product
and is constantly out there being willing to develop something
internally or buy something externally to really make Google a
better product,&#8221; Mark told Barron&#8217;s. Buying YouTube Inc. in
2006 will pay off a &#8220;big way&#8221; because almost every television
sold will allow access to web video starting next year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola earnings growth will accelerate because it has a
global brand and a presence in emerging markets such as China,
he said. Disney, the world&#8217;s biggest media company, should have
a higher valuation than it already does compared with rivals
Time Warner Inc. and Viacom Inc., he said. Disney&#8217;s Marvel and
Pixar studios are strengthening and its ESPN sports channel has
&#8220;strong&#8221; audience demographics that allow it to charge more
for advertising, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, based in Mountain View, California, is down 22
percent this year, compared with a 2.2 percent drop for Atlanta-
based Coca-Cola and 4.4 percent advance for Disney in Burbank,
California. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Billionaire George Soros&#8217;s Soros
Fund Management LLC sold shares of JPMorgan Chase  Co., PNC
Financial Services Group Inc. and U.S. Bancorp in the second
quarter as financial stocks dropped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based hedge fund, which oversees $25 billion,
sold about 2.4 million shares of JPMorgan during the quarter,
according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission today. Soros had 107,500 shares valued at $3.9
million at the end of June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The KBW Bank Index of 24 financial-services companies such
as New York-based JPMorgan and Citigroup Inc. fell 11 percent
during the second quarter. Soros reduced his holdings in U.S.
Bancorp to 22,600 shares from 2.03 million shares at the end of
the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soros sold all of his stock in Petroleo Brasileiro SA,
Brazil&#8217;s state-controlled oil producer, previously one of his
largest holdings with a value of $233 million as of March 31.
Shares of Petrobras dropped 22 percent in the second quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money managers who oversee more than $100 million in
equities must file a Form 13F listing their U.S.-traded stocks,
options and convertible bonds. The filings don&#8217;t show non-U.S.
securities or how much cash the firms hold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Vachon, a Soros spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

according to a filing today with the U.S. Securities and

&lt;p&gt;Most U.S. stocks rose, with the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index ending a four-day slump, as
technology companies helped the market overcome an earlier slide
driven by concern about an economic slowdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EBay Inc. gained 2.6 percent on speculation its PayPal
service will be used by Google Inc.&#8217;s smartphone. Newmont Mining
Corp. climbed 1.8 percent as gold prices jumped to a six-week
high and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reiterated its &#8220;overweight&#8221;
rating on commodities. Washington Post Co. and Corinthian
Colleges Inc. sank at least 8.1 percent on concern they will
lose access to federal financial-aid programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About five stocks rose for every three that fell on U.S.
exchanges. The SP 500 gained less than 0.1 percent to 1,079.38
as of 4 p.m. in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
decreased 1.14 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 10,302.01.
Trading volume on U.S. stock exchanges amounted to 5.93 billion
shares, near the 2010 low of 5.85 billion set on Aug. 9,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re in a bridge period,&#8221; said Quincy Krosby, chief
market strategist for Newark, New Jersey-based Prudential
Financial Inc., which oversees $690 billion. &#8220;The earnings
season has been solid even as we got mixed data on the global
backdrop. If we get better economic figures over the next few
days, it will suggest that the soft patch is easing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic Concern &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks tumbled in early trading after weaker-than-forecast
reports on New York manufacturing and Japan&#8217;s economy added to
concern the global recovery is slowing. About $1.9 trillion has
been wiped away from the value of global equities since the
Federal Reserve said Aug. 10 that the pace of economic recovery
will probably be &#8220;more modest&#8221; than forecast. The 3.8 percent
drop in the SP 500 last week threatened the index&#8217;s rebound
from a 10-month low on July 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Russell 2000 Index of small companies rose 0.9 percent,
breaking a four-day losing streak. Measures of telephone, raw-
materials, technology, consumer and energy companies in the
gauge advanced more than 1 percent. 3Par Inc. jumped 87 percent
after Dell Inc., the world&#8217;s third-largest personal-computer
maker, agreed to buy it to gain equipment and software to
bolster its growing corporate data-center business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology shares, the biggest group in the SP 500,
rallied 0.4 percent. Cisco Systems Inc., the world&#8217;s largest
maker of networking equipment, led the gains in the Dow, rising
2.6 percent to $21.91. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EBay &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EBay rose 2.6 percent to $22.05. Its PayPal business is in
talks to add its payment service to Google Inc.&#8217;s Android
smartphone software, making it easier for users to pay for
applications, three people familiar with the matter said. Users
of Android phones, such as Motorola Inc.&#8217;s Droid X and HTC
Corp.&#8217;s Droid Incredible, may be able to pay for apps with
PayPal as soon as this year, said the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gauge of raw-materials producers had the biggest gain in
the SP 500 among 10 industry groups, rising 0.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold prices rose to a six-week high on signs the global
economy is faltering, boosting demand for the metal as a
protector of wealth. Copper rose in New York and London as the
dollar weakened and orders to draw metal from stockpiles jumped
the most in more than two months, signaling steady demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Dollar Index, a six-currency gauge of the
greenback&#8217;s strength, fell as much as 0.9 percent today after
five gains in a row. A weaker dollar makes metals priced in the
currency cheaper in terms of other monies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newmont Mining, the largest U.S. gold producer, gained 1.8
percent to $57.71. Freeport-McMoRan Copper  Gold Inc., the
world&#8217;s largest publicly traded copper producer, rose 0.8
percent to $70.63. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Overweight&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities demand from emerging markets and limited growth
in supplies will help to support prices toward the end of the
year, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which backed oil,
gold, copper, zinc and platinum. The firm reiterated an
&#8220;overweight&#8221; recommendation on commodities, analysts led by
Allison Nathan and Jeffrey Currie wrote in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a good indication that the rally is being triggered
by groups most-tied to economic growth,&#8221; said Mark Bronzo, an
Irvington, New York-based fund manager at Security Global
Investors, which oversees $21 billion. &#8220;Earnings have been
good, with respectable top-line growth. A lot of money has flown
out of equities into bonds. The stock market is attractive on a
valuation basis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks vs. Bonds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors are moving more money than ever before out of
stocks and into bonds, widening a valuation gap and convincing
the biggest money managers that now is the time to buy equities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About $33 billion flowed out of funds owning U.S. shares
this year even as the economic recovery sent free cash flow for
American companies excluding banks to 6.8 percent of their
market value. That&#8217;s the highest level compared with corporate
debt yields since 1960, Credit Suisse Group AG data show. About
$185 billion was sent to bond funds through July 31, the most on
record, according to the Investment Company Institute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People would rather overpay for bonds than underpay for
stocks,&#8221; said David Kelly, who helps oversee $445 billion as
chief market strategist for JPMorgan Funds in New York. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
reflection of an extraordinary prejudice. If people are at an
emotional extreme, it means that at some point there&#8217;s got to be
reallocation of cash away from the bond market toward the stock
market. Ultimately, it&#8217;s bullish.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic Data &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 fell as much as 0.9 percent today after a
report showed that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York&#8217;s
general economic index rose to 7.1 this month from 5.1 in July.
Economists forecast the measure would rise to 8, according to
the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. Readings greater
than zero signal expansion in the so-called Empire State Index
that covers New York, northern New Jersey and southern
Connecticut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo
confidence index fell to 13 this month, the lowest level since
March 2009, from 14 in July, data from the Washington-based
group showed. Economists forecast a reading of 15, according to
the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. Readings lower
than 50 mean more respondents said conditions were poor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross domestic product in Japan rose an annualized 0.4
percent in the second quarter, the country&#8217;s Cabinet Office said
today, pushing the economy into third place behind the U.S. and
China. The median estimate of 19 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News was for growth of 2.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Economic momentum has slowed and that&#8217;s worrisome,&#8221; said
Alan Gayle, senior investment strategist at RidgeWorth Capital
Management in Richmond, Virginia, which oversees $63 billion.
&#8220;The numbers show a very tepid recovery in developed economies.
Corporate earnings have been good, but the overall economic
momentum has been disappointing. That plays into expectations
for sales growth and the stock market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Student Loans &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colleges owned by Corinthian Colleges, Career Education
Corp. and Washington Post have campuses where fewer than 20
percent of federal student loans are being repaid, according to
the U.S. Department of Education, which wants to use the data to
determine whether programs can remain eligible for aid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nationally, for-profit colleges have a 36 percent student-
loan repayment rate, compared with 54 percent at public
universities and 56 percent at private nonprofits, according to
an analysis of the Education Department data by the Institute
for College Access  Success, an Oakland, California nonprofit
research and advocacy group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corinthian Colleges sank 22 percent to $5.22. The Santa
Ana, California-based company was downgraded to &#8220;equal weight&#8221;
from &#8220;overweight&#8221; at Barclays Plc and cut to &#8220;market
perform&#8221; from &#8220;outperform&#8221; at BMO Capital Markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington Post slumped 8.1 percent to $315.65. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAC Capital Advisors LP, the hedge-
fund firm run by Steven Cohen, increased its stakes in energy
companies Exxon Mobil Corp. and BP Plc during the second
quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAC Capital added 2.3 million shares of Exxon Mobil, more
than doubling its stake to 3.64 million shares valued at $207.9
million, the Stamford, Connecticut-based firm said in a filing
today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The firm
bought 2.93 million BP American depositary receipts, lifting its
holding to about 2.94 million shares worth $84.4 million as of
June 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of Cohen&#8217;s energy holdings rose to 16 percent of
assets from about 13 percent, Bloomberg data show. He joined
money managers including Fairholme Capital Management LLC&#8217;s
Bruce Berkowitz in adding BP shares, as the London-based
company&#8217;s stock plunged following the April 20 explosion in the
Gulf of Mexico that caused the worst oil spill in U.S. history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Irving, Texas-based Exxon Mobil fell 14 percent
in the quarter, while BP&#8217;s ADRs slumped 49 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money managers who oversee more than $100 million of
equities or more must file, within 45 days of the end of each
quarter, a Form 13F with the SEC that lists their U.S. exchange-
traded stocks, options and convertible bonds. The filings don&#8217;t
show non-U.S. securities or how much cash the firms hold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market value of SAC Capital&#8217;s holdings as disclosed in
today&#8217;s filing was $9.7 billion, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp., the second-largest
U.S. oil company, announced another natural-gas discovery in the
Carnarvon Basin off Australia&#8217;s western coast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Acme-1 well encountered about 896 feet (273 meters) of
net gas pay, San Ramon, California-based Chevron said today in a
statement. The well was drilled to a depth of 15,469 feet in
2,880 feet of water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery is the company&#8217;s ninth and biggest off the
coast of western Australia in the past 12 months, Vice Chairman
George Kirkland said in the statement. Chevron announced Aug. 12
that its Brederode-1 exploration well in the Carnarvon Basin
found 49 feet of net gas pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is operator of the WA-205-P permit area, which
includes the Acme-1 well, and has a 67 percent stake in the
prospect. A unit of Europe&#8217;s Royal Dutch Shell Plc owns the
rest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Chief Executive Officer John Watson is looking to
increase oil and gas production with projects in places such as
the Gulf of Mexico and Australia. The company has said its
proposed Wheatstone and Gorgon liquefied-natural-gas ventures
are centerpieces of its global growth plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest find is expected &#8220;to help underpin&#8221; possible
expansions at the Wheatstone gas hub, Jim Blackwell, president
of Chevron Asia Pacific Exploration  Production, said in the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron rose 31 cents to $77.71 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. Shell declined 0.3 percent to
1,772 pence in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. is the largest U.S. oil company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global crude oil demand may have
exceeded supply in the past two months as inventories stored on
tankers fell to an 18-month low, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Now that floating storage has dropped to its lowest
levels in over 18 months, we expect to experience declining
onshore inventories in coming months,&#8221; Goldman Sachs analysts
including David Greely and Stefan Wieler said in a report today.
&#8220;Given that world demand tends to increase seasonally in the
second half, we would expect the draw on world inventories to
accelerate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil held on ships may have dropped by as much as 40 million
to 45 million barrels in June and July, in part due to the
clearing of a &#8220;large portion&#8221; of Iranian floating storage,
Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The June-July discharge of floating storage suggests that
the draw at sea has more than offset the build on shore, which
the International Energy Agency estimates at 21 million
barrels,&#8221; Goldman analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World oil demand exceeded supply by 600,000 barrels a day,
or 36.9 million barrels more than normal in June and July, based
on the IEA estimate of a 13.3 million barrels draw on combined
onshore OECD inventories and global floating storage, Goldman
said in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West Texas Intermediate crude time spreads, the difference
between monthly futures contracts, have strengthened, suggesting
a tighter physical oil market, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman said that the time spread from the first to the
60th month gained as much as $10 a barrel to trade at about
minus $8 to minus $10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to expect the WTI forward curve to flatten in
the second half, lifting prompt WTI prices into the $85-$95 a
barrel range,&#8221; Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company reiterated its recommendation to buy December
WTI crude futures, which traded up 44 cents to $77.38 a barrel
at 11:49 a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commodities demand from emerging
markets and limited growth in supplies will help to support
prices toward the end of the year, according to Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., which backed oil, gold, copper, zinc and platinum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank reiterated an &#8220;overweight&#8221; recommendation on
commodities, analysts led by Allison Nathan and Jeffrey Currie
wrote in a report. Goldman pared its 12-month forecast for the
SP GSCI Enhanced Total Returns Index to a 19 percent gain from
21.6 after recent gains in agricultural commodities and metals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities last week had the worst weekly performance in
six after the Federal Reserve said the recovery is weakening and
European industrial output fell, stoking concern that there may
be a double-dip recession. Reports also showed China&#8217;s retail
sales and new lending grew in July at a slower pace than June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are not overly optimistic about commodities prices in
the second half,&#8221; Ni Xiaolei, a trader at Donghai Futures Co.,
said from Jiangsu today. &#8220;&#8216;We saw a very sharp ascent in
commodity prices last month,  which will be hard to sustain as
global macroeconomic data emerges weaker than expected.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s commodity &#8216;&#8216;overweight&#8217;&#8217; call was maintained even
as the bank has been paring forecasts for U.S. and Japanese
economic growth for next year. Ed McKelvey, Goldman&#8217;s senior U.S.
economist in New York, has also said that the chance the U.S.
may tumble back into recession is as high as 30 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold, Crude &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold, which surged to a record $1,265.30 an ounce in June
amid concern sovereign-debt levels in Europe may be excessive,
traded at $1,29.60 at 2:11 p.m. in Singapore, 11 percent higher
this year. Goldman forecast a rise to $1,260 in three months and
to $1,300 in six. New York crude futures were at $75.86 a barrel,
4.4 percent lower over 2010. Goldman&#8217;s report put them at $92 a
barrel in three months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;The current softness in economic data, combined with
increasingly mixed signals from the underlying commodity markets,
is likely to continue to generate choppy commodity-price action
in the near term,&#8221; the Goldman analysts wrote in the Aug. 13
report. Still, &#8220;high and rising emerging-market demand levels
against limited supply growth in key commodities are likely to
increasingly tighten balances,&#8221; they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s economy expanded at an annualized 0.4 percent in
the three months to June 30, the Cabinet Office said today.
That&#8217;s the slowest pace in three quarters. U.S. industrial
production figures are due for release tomorrow, the same day as
data on investor confidence in Germany. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese Demand &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodity prices may advance into the end of the year on
evidence of increased oil demand in China, a decline in crude
stockpiles in Europe and the U.S., and further falls in metals
inventories, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect upside to be greatest for crude oil, copper,
zinc, platinum and gold,&#8221; it said. &#8220;Improved data will likely
be required to sustain rising prices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs last week backed gold to resume a rally and
climb to a record $1,300 an ounce within six months on renewed
investor interest. The precious metal, which has risen for nine
years to last year, may also climb in 2011, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ban on wheat exports by Russia helped to drive futures to
$8.68 a bushel earlier this month, the highest price in almost
two years. The country is battling reduced grains production
amid the worst drought in at least 50 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Sharp Gains&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Commodity returns rose over the past month led by sharp
gains in the agricultural complex owing to weather-related
supply shocks in wheat,&#8221; according to the Goldman report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zinc, trading today at $2,080 a metric ton, has fallen 19
percent this year, making it the worst performer on the London
Metal Exchange. Goldman&#8217;s analysts forecast that the metal may
climb to $2,121 a ton in six months, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper rose 1.3 percent to $7,246.50 a metric ton, paring
this year&#8217;s loss to 1.7 percent, while platinum gained 0.8
percent to $1,535.75 an ounce, 5 percent stronger this year.
Goldman forecast copper at $7,925 a ton in six months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan will grow 1.4 percent in 2011, compared with an
earlier forecast of 1.7 percent, Goldman&#8217;s Tokyo-based senior
economist Chiwoong Lee said in a report dated Aug. 7. The week
before that Goldman lowered its projection for U.S. growth for
the same year to 1.9 percent from 2.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. said the yen
may strengthen to 79 versus the dollar by the end of 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company earlier predicted the currency would end the
year at 93 against the greenback, Tohru Sasaki, chief foreign-
exchange strategist in Tokyo, wrote in a report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yen may strengthen to 80 per dollar by next month from
an earlier estimate of 90, Sasaki forecast in the note. The
currency will rise to 99 per euro by year-end from an earlier
target of 116, JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yen traded at 85.86 per dollar and 109.79 versus the
euro as of 7:01 a.m. in London. Japan&#8217;s currency climbed to a
post-World War II high of 79.75 per dollar in April 1995. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wall Street banks led by JPMorgan
Chase  Co. and Morgan Stanley stand to make a combined $120
million on General Motors Co.&#8217;s initial public offering. If it
weren&#8217;t for Goldman Sachs Group Inc., they could have made four
times as much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a pitch to the U.S. Treasury in May, Goldman Sachs
offered to accept a fee of 0.75 percent, according to people
with direct knowledge of the matter. That&#8217;s a fraction of the 3
percent banks typically charge on the largest IPOs and well
below the 2 percent offered by Bank of America Corp. and other
banks that presented to Treasury, said the people, speaking
anonymously because the matter is private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which had just been sued for fraud by
federal regulators and has ties to GM competitor Ford Motor Co.,
didn&#8217;t get a top role in the IPO. The government imposed the fee
pitched by Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn and his five-person
team on all underwriters, angering the banks, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fact the other banks are furious at Goldman is not
surprising,&#8221; said Samuel Hayes, a professor emeritus of
investment banking at Harvard Business School in Boston. &#8220;They
feel it gave the government a real lever to force down fees on
the underwriters. But the deal still has a lot of marquee
value.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsidized Car Purchases &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks involved in the deal include lead managers JPMorgan
and Morgan Stanley, as well as Bank of America and Citigroup
Inc., among others. Some banks made different concessions in
their pitches to the Treasury. Charlotte, North Carolina-based
Bank of America and Zurich-based Credit Suisse Group AG offered
to use some of their fees to buy GM vehicles or to subsidize
employee purchases of GM cars and trucks, according to the
people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs spokeswoman Andrea Rachman and spokespeople
for the other banks declined to comment. Treasury spokesman Mark Paustenbach also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will have a role in the offering, as will
Credit Suisse, said the people. Five U.S. banks pitched GM and
the Treasury on May 19 in Washington, and non-U.S. lenders made
presentations in early June. All sent top executives, such as
JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon and John Mack,
chairman of Morgan Stanley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasury officials including Ronald Bloom, chief of the
auto task force, and GM executives were concerned that if it
became public the government hadn&#8217;t picked Goldman Sachs&#8217;s low
bid, they would face criticism for wasting taxpayer money
because of a bias against the firm, the people said. The
officials and executives decided, in conjunction with Lazard
Ltd., which is advising Treasury, to use the Goldman Sachs bid
and impose it on other banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Probably Serious&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs signaled that it was willing to make a bid
for pretty much any amount, according to two people who saw the
bank&#8217;s presentation. Rivals grumbled that Goldman Sachs knew it
couldn&#8217;t win the lead on the GM offering, so it submitted a low
bid knowing that would force Treasury to squeeze whichever banks
did win the job, these people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The investment banks have always been cutthroat in their
competition,&#8221; Hayes said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think they did it just to
squeeze their competitors. They were probably serious.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the U.S. banks, apart from Bank of America and Bermuda-
based Lazard, have their headquarters in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4-Cent Fee &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In India, Goldman Sachs this year tied for the lowest bid
among 17 banks vying to manage a $1.8 billion offer by state-
owned Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd., three people with
knowledge of the matter said. Goldman Sachs and SBI Capital
Markets Ltd. said they&#8217;d do the work for a fee equal to
0.00000001 percent of the sale proceeds -- equivalent to about 2
rupees (4 cents) each on the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of the pitch, Goldman Sachs and the Securities
and Exchange Commission were at odds over allegations Goldman
Sachs had sold mortgage-related securities designed to fail. The
firm settled the suit last month for $550 million and
acknowledged it made a &#8220;mistake.&#8221; A June poll showed that the
firm suffered the worst reputational decline among its largest
competitors, according to a global quarterly poll of 1,001
investors and analysts who are Bloomberg subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM, 61 percent owned by the government after a $50 billion
taxpayer bailout, aims to raise $12 billion to $16 billion in
the IPO and plans to file the registration statement as early as
today, according to people familiar with the situation. At that
size, the IPO would be the second-largest in the U.S. after San
Francisco-based Visa Inc.&#8217;s $19.7 billion offering in March
2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Trails &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the IPO is paying a quarter of the usual rate for the
largest initial offerings in the U.S., fees would equal about 16
percent of the total $728.4 million of revenue generated from
all U.S. IPOs this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which won the biggest share of fees from
underwriting U.S. IPOs in 2009, has slipped to third this year
behind Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan, the data show. The firm&#8217;s
first-half revenue from underwriting equity sales also trailed
JPMorgan and Bank of America, according to company reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the most profitable firm in Wall Street
history, has been credited with 12.6 percent of the $11.3
billion in initial sales this year. Last year, it had 21.3
percent, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, American companies that used Goldman Sachs as the
lead underwriter got the highest prices for their shares in the
first half, selling at an average 1.4 percent discount to their
offering range, the data show. Companies that didn&#8217;t hire the
141-year-old firm to lead their IPOs took an average discount of
14 percent for their shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford Backs Goldman &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs bankers have advised Ford since 1953 and the
firm managed Ford&#8217;s IPO in January 1956, the biggest ever at the
time. Sidney Weinberg, the Goldman Sachs chairman who managed
the sale and was later named to Ford&#8217;s board, used Ford &#8220;to
leapfrog his firm&#8217;s standing on Wall Street into the top tier of
underwriters,&#8221; according to Charles Ellis&#8217;s book &#8220;The
Partnership: The Making of Goldman Sachs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford publicly backed Goldman Sachs after the firm was sued
for fraud by the SEC. &#8220;We have a long relationship with Goldman
Sachs and expect it to continue,&#8221; Ford spokesman Mark Truby
said on April 20, four days after the SEC sued Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economists are paring forecasts for
declines in the Argentine peso, pushing the median year-end
estimate to the strongest in five months, on speculation policy
makers will limit losses to rein in inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peso will fall 5.7 percent to 4.17 per dollar by the
end of the year, according to the median estimate of 13
economists in a Bloomberg survey. The consensus forecast is
stronger than the previous 4.2 per dollar prediction after
Barclays changed its estimate to 4.13 from 4.3 and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. revised its outlook to 4.10 from 4.25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accelerating growth in South America&#8217;s second-largest
economy and rising commodity prices pushed inflation to 11.2
percent in July, the highest in four years, according to the
National Statistics Institute. The peso has weakened 3.4 percent
this year as the central bank&#8217;s dollar purchases pushed reserves
to a record $51 billion last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The government is currently prioritizing the role of the
currency as an anchor for inflation expectations over its role
of maintaining high competitiveness,&#8221; said Vladimir Werning, a
JPMorgan economist, in a telephone interview from New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peso&#8217;s decline this year makes it the worst performer
among six major Latin American currencies tracked by Bloomberg.
The Brazilian real dropped 0.6 percent in the same period, while
the Colombian peso has rallied 13 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil Trade &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argentine trade with Brazil, South America&#8217;s largest
economy, may help stem the peso&#8217;s decline, said Douglas Smith,
chief economist for the Americas for Standard Chartered Bank in
New York. Brazilian Trade Secretary Welber Barral said on Aug.
12 that trade with Argentina may rise to a record this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re both big trade partners,&#8221; said Smith in an
interview. &#8220;As the real strengthens, the peso gains
competitiveness, so that gives the peso a boost without the
government weakening the currency.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economists and government officials including Vice
President Julio Cobos have questioned the accuracy of the
inflation data, saying officials have underreported price
increases since January 2007, when former President Nestor Kirchner made personnel changes at the statistics agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflation Estimate &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annual inflation in the nation is likely running at about
25 percent, former Undersecretary of Finance Miguel Kiguel said
at a seminar in Buenos Aires on Aug. 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argentina&#8217;s money supply, as measured by the M2 gauge that
includes cash in circulation and deposits in savings and money
market accounts, rose 23.8 percent in July from a year earlier
to 217.8 billion pesos ($55.4 billion), exceeding a target of
214.4 billion pesos, the central bank said in a monthly report
released Aug. 12. Policy makers target M2 instead of using a
benchmark lending rate to control inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign exchange reserves climbed 3.5 percent from June 30
to end of July, as the central bank bought dollars after a
record 55 million-ton soybean harvest swelled exports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The accumulation of international reserves is a pillar of
the Argentine macroeconomic model,&#8221; central bank President
Mercedes Marco del Pont said in a July 15 statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to hold Argentine dollar
bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries fell 21 basis points, or 0.21
percentage point, to 669 today, according to JPMorgan. The
difference is down from 846 on July 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dollar Bond Yields &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of protecting Argentine debt against non-payment
for five years with credit-default swaps fell 22 basis points to
817, according to data compiled by CMA DataVision. Credit-
default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the
underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a government
or company fail to adhere to debt agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on Argentina&#8217;s benchmark dollar bonds due in 2015
climbed 37 basis points to 11.02 percent today. Warrants linked
to economic growth rose 0.11 cent to 10.01 cents on the dollar.
GDP will expand 9.7 percent in 2010, the fastest pace since
1992, according to a forecast from Morgan Stanley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner completed a
restructuring of $12.9 billion worth of defaulted debt in June,
opening the way for the country to tap international markets for
the first time since the government&#8217;s record $95 billion default
in 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not just the trade surplus, but the overall balance
of payments surplus that remains supportive of the peso,&#8221; said
Werning. &#8220;Capital outflows have moderated in the second quarter
and are likely to moderate further as the settlement of the debt
swap and global conditions provide a positive backdrop for
foreign inflows into Argentine bonds.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Moffat, the former
International Business Machines Corp. executive who pleaded
guilty in the Galleon Group LLC insider-trading scheme, said
accused tipster Danielle Chiesi &#8220;played him&#8221; to obtain tips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moffat, 54, who pleaded guilty to securities fraud and
conspiracy in March, made the claim in court papers seeking
leniency when he&#8217;s sentenced Sept. 13. Moffat claimed he had an
&#8220;intimate relationship&#8221; with Chiesi, 44, a former executive at
New York-based New Castle Funds LLC who was arrested along with
Galleon Group co-founder Raj Rajaratnam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ms. Chiesi was not the passive recipient of information
from Mr. Moffat,&#8221; his lawyers said in the court filing today.
&#8220;To the contrary, she manipulated or &#8216;played&#8217; him to obtain
information she could use to New Castle&#8217;s advantage.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moffat, who started at IBM as a junior programmer in 1978,
admitted that he leaked Chiesi information about IBM, Lenovo
Group Ltd. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. He said he wasn&#8217;t
asked to cooperate with prosecutors in the case and hasn&#8217;t done
so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors yesterday asked U.S. District Judge Deborah Batts to sentence Moffat to six months in prison. Moffat is
seeking probation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danielle Chiesi &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moffat met Chiesi in 2002 and the two became professional
friends, according to the papers filed by Moffat today. Chiesi
often told Moffat her ideas about how IBM could best present
itself to investors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Pfizer Inc. unit is seeking to
duck responsibility for two women&#8217;s breast cancers linked to its
Prempro menopause drug, a lawyer argued at the end of a trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth subsidiary rejected Sharon Buxton&#8217;s and Joy
Henry&#8217;s claims that its hormone-replacement medicine helped
cause their cancers in the face of a wealth of evidence to the
contrary, Zoe Littlepage, a lawyer for the women, told a state
court jury today in Philadelphia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Wyeth accepts responsibility for not a single breast
cancer,&#8221; Littlepage said in closing arguments in the trial of
the two women&#8217;s lawsuit against the drugmaker. The pair seek at
least $100,000 total in damages in the first phase of the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 6 million women took the menopause drugs to treat
symptoms such as hot flashes and mood swings before a 2002 study
highlighted their links to cancer. Wyeth&#8217;s sales of the
medicines, which are still on the market, topped $2 billion
before the Women&#8217;s Health Initiative, a National Institutes of
Health-sponsored study, concluded they posed an increased cancer
risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Premarin,
Wyeth&#8217;s estrogen-based drug, with Upjohn&#8217;s progestin-laden
Provera, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth later combined the two
hormones in its Prempro pill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyeth&#8217;s witnesses testified during the five-week trial that
researchers haven&#8217;t conclusively found Prempro causes breast
cancer, and Buxton&#8217;s and Henry&#8217;s lawyers didn&#8217;t produce enough
evidence linking their cancers to the drug to win, Beth Wilkinson, one of the company&#8217;s attorneys, told jurors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Lot of Proof&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We brought you a whole lot of proof&#8221; that Prempro wasn&#8217;t
the culprit in the cancers, Wilkinson argued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyeth has lost seven of the 11 Prempro cases decided by
juries since trials began in 2006. The drugmaker got some of
those verdicts thrown out at the post-trial stage and or had
awards reduced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer also has won dismissals of more than 3,000 cases at
either the pretrial stage or after the cases were set for
trials, according to court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A judge in Philadelphia refused in May to throw out a
$9.4 million jury award to a woman who blamed Prempro for her
breast cancer. The case is on appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buxton, 66, took Prempro over six years before the retired
scheduler for a surgical practice developed breast cancer, court
filings show. Henry, a 76-year-old owner of a moving company,
took the drug for eight years before being diagnosed with the
disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clash Over Cause &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Littlepage contends Wyeth knew the hormone-based Prempro
could promote the growth of cancer and should be held liable.
Wyeth officials counter that researchers can&#8217;t pinpoint a single
cause of breast cancer and the medicine can&#8217;t be held
responsible for the disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If jurors find for the women, they can award money for
medical expenses, lost wages and pain and suffering. The panel
then will be asked to decide whether Wyeth failed to adequately
warn patients and doctors about Prempro&#8217;s risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, completed its
$68 billion purchase of Wyeth last year. It acquired Upjohn in
2003 as part of a $54 billion buyout of Pharmacia Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Buxton v. Wyeth, 00202, Philadelphia Court of
Common Pleas (Philadelphia). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SA and NII Holdings
Inc. will offer wireless services such as mobile downloads and
web surfing across Mexico after the Federal Telecommunications
Commission approved their bid for airwaves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies&#8217; offer of 180.3 million pesos ($14.2
million), to be paid in the next 45 days, for 30 megahertz of
nationwide spectrum in the 1.7-gigahertz band met the
government&#8217;s requirements, the regulatory agency decided by vote
yesterday, according to an e-mailed statement. Televisa and NII
can claim the spectrum after making the payment, according to
the auction rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision gives Televisa and NII the capacity they need
to offer third-generation services to lure customers from
America Movil SAB, Mexico&#8217;s largest wireless provider. NII has
said it plans to start selling service on the new network in
parts of Mexico as soon as 12 months after it gets the airwaves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gustavo Cantu, a vice president of NII&#8217;s Mexico unit, said
the companies plan to invest 19 billion pesos over the next six
years to improve wireless service in addition to the payments
for the airwave rights. He spoke in an interview broadcast
yesterday on Radio Formula in Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re ready to bring third- and fourth-generation to
Mexico,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NII rose $1.45, or 3.8 percent, to $39.90 in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading at 9:41 a.m. New York time. Televisa gained 1.3
percent to 49.27 pesos in Mexico City trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paying Too Little &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America Movil has said Mexico City-based Televisa and NII
paid too little for the airwaves in the government auction that
concluded last month. America Movil, controlled by billionaire
Carlos Slim, will pay 3.8 billion pesos to get 20 megahertz of
spectrum across the country and 10 additional megahertz in three
regions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telefonica SA will spend 1.3 billion pesos for 10 megahertz
in six regions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa and Reston, Virginia-based NII were able to get
the same amount of airwaves as the combined total of America
Movil and Madrid-based Telefonica for a lower price because they
were the only bidder that qualified for the nationwide block of
spectrum under the auction rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No legal impediment exists&#8221; to prevent the auction
winners from assuming control of the airwaves, Mexico&#8217;s
Communications and Transportation Ministry said in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America Movil, based in Mexico City, is Mexico&#8217;s largest
wireless carrier with about 71 percent of users. Telefonica is
second, followed by Grupo Iusacell SA and NII. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India said it may lodge a complaint
against the U.S. at the World Trade Organization over
legislation that may double visa costs, threatening to erode the
competitiveness of Indian software-services companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increase in visa fees is &#8220;WTO-incompatible,&#8221; Indian
Trade Secretary Rahul Khullar, the top bureaucrat in the
Department of Commerce, told reporters in New Delhi today. &#8220;If
the U.S. wishes to put up its protectionist barriers to hurt
itself, let them do it. But where a measure is specifically
targeting my commercial interest, I cannot keep quiet.&#8221; He
didn&#8217;t say when India planned to approach the Geneva-based WTO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Senate last week passed a bill that is likely to
add $2,000 to fees for companies that would affect applicants
for H-1B visas, which are used for skilled workers, and L visas,
which are used for transfers at multinational companies. The
increase could cost software-services companies based in India,
such as Infosys Technologies Ltd. and Wipro Ltd., as much as
$250 million a year, Som Mittal, president of Indian industry
trade group Nasscom, said on Aug. 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian Trade Minister Anand Sharma wrote a letter to U.S.
Trade Representative Ron Kirk on Aug. 10 describing the bill as
&#8220;highly discriminatory&#8221; and saying the legislation would
primarily hurt companies of Indian origin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Infosys, Wipro and Tata Consultancy Services
Ltd., the country&#8217;s largest software-services provider, have
dropped since the news about the bill came out on Aug. 6. Wipro
has fallen 4.5 percent on the Bombay Stock Exchange while Tata
has lost 3.2 percent and Infosys has declined 4.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology companies such as Wipro and Infosys send skilled
workers from overseas, often from India, to the U.S. to develop
software and manage projects for customers in the country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects headline and first paragraph to show that
Vanguard bought Visa stock, rather than selling it, in the
second quarter.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marsico Capital Management was among
the biggest sellers in the second quarter of Visa Inc., the
world&#8217;s largest payments network, and Vanguard Group Inc. added
to its holdings, as the stock posted its steepest decline in
almost two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marsico liquidated its remaining 10.4 million shares and
also closed out its investment in No. 2 network MasterCard Inc.,
selling 5.21 million shares. Vanguard increased its stake to 17
million shares from 16.3 million shares, the company confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stocks are &#8220;trading near Armageddon levels,&#8221; Morgan
Stanley analyst Adam Frisch wrote yesterday in a research note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa and MasterCard both fell more than 20 percent in the
three months ended June 30 as Congress approved limits on debit-
card interchange, or &#8220;swipe&#8221; fees, charged to merchants. The
companies and their investors are waiting for the Federal
Reserve to determine fees that are &#8220;reasonable and
proportional&#8221; to the cost of processing debit transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The sudden change in the regulatory backdrop has
introduced a significant amount of uncertainty, and there&#8217;s
nothing the Street hates more than uncertainty,&#8221; Jason
Kupferberg, an analyst at UBS AG, said in an interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law also directs the Fed to issue rules barring the
networks from requiring that their debit cards be used on only
one processor. That non-exclusivity provision may create an
opportunity for competing networks, including one run by KKR 
Co. subsidiary First Data Corp., to gain market share. Visa
accounted for 73 percent of U.S. debit purchase volume in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interchange Revenue Decline &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa and MasterCard, based in Purchase, New York, set
interchange fees and pass the money to card-issuing banks such
as Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Citigroup
Inc. The caps, scheduled to take effect next year, could reduce
Bank of America&#8217;s annual revenue by as much as $2.3 billion, the
Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks may seek to mitigate the decline in interchange
revenue by renegotiating their contracts with Visa and
MasterCard. The contracts are the biggest revenue sources for
the networks, generating $3.17 billion, or 46 percent of net
revenue, for Visa in fiscal 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa spokesman Will Valentine and Chris Monteiro of
MasterCard declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MasterCard and Visa continue to grow profit amid a
worldwide consumer shift from cash and checks to plastic. Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s Frisch is among 33 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg who
recommend investors buy the companies&#8217; shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundamentals &#8216;Solid&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stocks are &#8220;relatively cheap,&#8221; Frisch said in his
research note. &#8220;Fundamentals remain solid.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa fell 24 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $73.12 at 11:42 a.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. MasterCard dropped
78 cents to $213.25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viking Global Investors LP, the hedge fund co-founded by
Andreas Halvorsen, also closed out its position in Visa, selling
9.71 million shares valued at $687 million. Children&#8217;s
Investment Fund Management UK LLP, the hedge fund founded by
Christopher Cooper-Hohn, sold 7.01 million shares, or almost
half its stake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa&#8217;s 22 percent plunge in the April-through-June quarter
was the steepest since the three months ended September 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s menopause drug Prempro
didn&#8217;t cause two women&#8217;s cancers, and the drugmaker doesn&#8217;t have
to pay damages over those illnesses, a jury decided. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jurors in state court in Philadelphia deliberated about
four hours before concluding today that Prempro wasn&#8217;t a
&#8220;factual cause&#8221; of Sharon Buxton&#8217;s and Joy Henry&#8217;s breast
cancers. The women sought at least $100,000 in damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While we have great sympathy for Mrs. Buxton, Mrs. Henry
and their families, we believe the verdicts in this case confirm
our position,&#8221; Pfizer said in a statement. &#8220;The vast majority
of women who take hormone therapy do not get breast cancer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Premarin,
Wyeth&#8217;s estrogen-based drug, with Upjohn Co.&#8217;s progestin-laden
Provera, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth later combined the two
hormones in Prempro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, completed the $68
billion purchase of Wyeth last year. It acquired Upjohn in 2003
as part of a $54 billion buyout of Pharmacia Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 6 million women took hormone drugs to treat
menopause symptoms such as hot flashes and mood swings before
the Women&#8217;s Health Initiative, a National Institutes of Health-
sponsored study, concluded they posed an increased cancer risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victoria Davis, a spokeswoman for New York-based Pfizer,
said in an interview that the study also showed that &#8220;99.6
percent of users&#8221; didn&#8217;t get breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jury Trials &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyeth has lost seven of the 12 Prempro cases decided by
juries since trials began in 2006. The drugmaker got some of
those verdicts thrown out at the post-trial stage or had awards
reduced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A judge in Philadelphia refused in May to throw out a $9.4

&lt;p&gt;Buxton, 66, took Prempro for six years before the retired
scheduler for a surgical practice developed breast cancer, court
filings show. Henry, a 76-year-old owner of a moving company,
took the drug for eight years before being diagnosed with the
disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beth Wilkinson, an attorney for Pfizer, said in a phone
interview that the trial with two plaintiffs was &#8220;incredibly
challenging.&#8221; Her team was helped by being &#8220;allowed to focus
on the science first&#8221; and show jurors that &#8220;there&#8217;s no
evidence that Prempro causes breast cancer&#8221; based on testimony
from practicing cancer doctors, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoe Littlepage, a lawyer for Buxton and Henry, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a phone call or an e-mail seeking comment on
the verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, which reported $50 billion in sales last year, fell
17 cents to $16.10 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading
at 4 p.m. The shares have dropped 11 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Buxton v. Wyeth, 00202, Court of Common Pleas
(Philadelphia). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Elizabeth Lopatto, Michelle Fay Cortez and Meg Tirrell" date="Aug 18, 2010  4:05 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-18/lilly-alzheimer-failure-threatens-prospects-for-similar-pfizer-j-j-drugs.html"><headline>Lilly Alzheimer''s Setback Threatens Rivals'' Prospects</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc., Johnson  Johnson and a
half dozen competitors are committed to a research strategy for
Alzheimer&#8217;s disease that has resulted in a string of study
failures, the most recent involving Eli Lilly  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dozen potential products designed to slow or stop clumps
of protein from forming in the brain, a condition linked to the
disease since 1906, have failed in mid- to late-stage testing
since 2003. The experimental drug from Lilly, semagacestat,
didn&#8217;t improve cognition in a study and worsened the ability of
patients to perform daily activities, the Indianapolis-based
company said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lilly said it would no longer develop the product, one of
the company&#8217;s two Alzheimer&#8217;s drugs in the final stage of
testing usually required for U.S. regulatory approval. The Lilly
failure, on top of seven years of other unsuccessful tests,
calls into question ongoing research into similar treatments,
and leaves patients with little hope. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is definitely going to make people a lot more
pessimistic about many drugs&#8221; already in late-stage
development, P. Murali Doraiswamy, head of the biological
psychiatry division at Duke University School of Medicine in
Durham, North Carolina, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;This
will cast a shadow on those trials as well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lilly rose 3 cents to $34.78 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have declined 2.6 percent
this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Cure &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current therapies for the disease, including Forest
Laboratories Inc.&#8217;s Namenda and Pfizer and Eisai Co.&#8217;s Aricept,
address only Alzheimer&#8217;s symptoms; they don&#8217;t cure or even slow
it. Alzheimer&#8217;s and other dementias will afflict 35.6 million
people in 2010, and will rise to 115.4 million by 2050,
according to a report from Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease International. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers have announced setbacks with experimental
treatments from GlaxoSmithKline Plc and AstraZeneca Plc, both of
London; Martek Biosciences Corp., of Columbia, Maryland; New
Brunswick, New Jersey-based JJ; Abbott Laboratories of Abbott
Park, Illinois; New York-based Pfizer, Medivation Inc. of San
Francisco, and Myriad Genetics Inc. of Salt Lake City, Utah, in
the past several years, many targeting amyloid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the drugs, Pfizer and JJ&#8217;s bapineuzumab, reduced
the buildup of amyloid plaque in the brains of patients with
Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, according to a study published March 1.
Patients getting the medicine in the trial, though, didn&#8217;t show
a clear improvement in mental function. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elan Product &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Aug. 9, Dublin-based Elan Corp. and Transition
Therapeutics Inc. of Toronto said their experimental Alzheimer&#8217;s
disease drug, ELND005, will move into the final stage of human
tests, even though the drug failed to meet an interim study&#8217;s
main goals of improving patients&#8217; mental status or daily living
activities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugs from Pfizer and Elan are in the final stage of
testing usually required by the Food and Drug Administration to
approve the marketing of new treatments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lilly&#8217;s other final-stage drug is an antibody called
solanezumab that binds to and removes beta amyloid, the protein
clumps in the brain. Baxter International Inc.&#8217;s blood product
Gammagard also is in late-stage testing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The problem is that amyloid is still not the unanimous
choice for what causes Alzheimer&#8217;s,&#8221; said Les Funtleyder, an
analyst with Miller Tabak  Co. in New York, in a telephone
interview. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t understand how the disease starts and
operates, it&#8217;s going to be hard to find a cure or a treatment.
That&#8217;s what we are up against.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain Swelling &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and JJ&#8217;s bapineuzumab, when given at high doses,
was linked to a side effect similar to swelling in the brain.
Researchers stopped giving the highest dose of the drug in the
last stage of study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The failed Lilly medicine inhibits an enzyme called gamma
secretase that&#8217;s tied to the production of amyloid. Attempting
to lower the levels of amyloid is also at the center of action
by bapineuzumab, Lilly&#8217;s solanezumab, and Elan&#8217;s ELND005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lilly Chief Executive Officer John Lechleiter said
yesterday in a telephone interview that the failure of
semagacestat &#8220;doesn&#8217;t in any way impact our commitment to
Alzheimer&#8217;s.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gwen Fisher, a spokeswoman for Pfizer, said in an e-mail
that Pfizer is testing a variety of pathways thought to be
implicated in Alzheimer&#8217;s and the failure of a specific compound
isn&#8217;t enough to dismiss a particular approach given the
complexity of the disease and the methods being studied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JJ&#8217;s View &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellen Rose, a spokeswoman for JJ&#8217;s Janssen Alzheimer
Immunotherapy RD LLC, said in an e-mail that Lilly&#8217;s setback
doesn&#8217;t &#8220;disprove the amyloid hypothesis and it does not change
our commitment to our development programs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beta amyloid clumps were first identified during autopsies
of patients with memory loss by Alois Alzheimer. From the early
1900s, many doctors and scientists believed the protein caused
the disease, the most common form of dementia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between the protein clumps and the disease
was strengthened two decades ago with the discovery of a gene
that inexorably leads to an early form of Alzheimer&#8217;s. People
who carry it make an abundance of amyloid, and typically are
diagnosed with Alzheimer&#8217;s disease in their 40s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allen Roses, director of the Deane Drug Discovery Institute
at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina,
isn&#8217;t convinced by the amyloid-based research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Overemphasized&#8217; Hypothesis &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Alzheimer&#8217;s research has overemphasized the amyloid
hypothesis for a very long time,&#8221; Roses said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;When the leading candidates for Alzheimer&#8217;s disease
appear to fail for one reason or another, to me it&#8217;s simply
evidence that the hypothesis is not right.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amyloid hypothesis has been tested by a variety of
agents for the past decade, and each has raised concerns that
derailed the drugs, said Roses, who discovered a gene that
predisposes certain people to the disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The genetics have led me down a different path,&#8221; said
Roses, who is discussing a large prevention trial with a major
pharmaceutical company he declined to name. &#8220;Amyloid may or may
not be an accelerator for Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, but it&#8217;s not the
basic trigger,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Rafii, co-director of the Memory Disorders Clinic
at the University of California, San Diego, said treating
patients with mild to moderate symptoms with these drugs may be
akin to treating heart attack patients with the cholesterol drug
Lipitor. Like fat in arteries, amyloid deposits form in the
brain for years before patients become forgetful, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Never Going&#8217; Back &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Once you&#8217;ve reached a certain level of pathology, you&#8217;re
never going to come back,&#8221; Rafii said. If so, other trials in
patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer&#8217;s will probably fail,
despite the number of drugs under study, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rudolph Tanzi, professor of neurology at Harvard Medical
School and director of the genetics and aging research unit at
Massachusetts General Hospital&#8217;s Institute for Neurodegenerative
Disease, said the failure of the Lilly drug may be specific to
the compound being used rather than the entire approach of
controlling amyloid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Gamma secretase has dozens of proteins it must cleave to
have a healthy brain and a healthy body,&#8221; Tanzi said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;You can&#8217;t hit that enzyme with a
sledgehammer because it&#8217;s vital, and has lot of different
functions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. is pursuing two different research
strategies in attacking Alzheimer&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigating Tau &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based drugmaker is developing a medicine that
acts like Lilly&#8217;s, blocking gamma secretase. It is also
targeting a protein called tau, which is found abundantly in
abnormal form in the brains of patients with some dementias
including Alzheimer&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our gamma secretase inhibitor program is moving
forward,&#8221; Sonia Choi, a spokeswoman for Bristol-Myers, said
yesterday in a telephone interview. Results from a phase 2 study
will be available this year, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When tau is normal, it supplies nutrients to nerve cells in
the brain. When damaged, it becomes tangled and shuts off
nutrients. There&#8217;s a clear connection between the amount of
aggregated tau in the brain and the state of dementia, said
Claude Wischik, a professor at the University of Aberdeen,
Scotland, and chairman of TauRX Pharmaceuticals, a company
testing a compound called Rember that targets tau. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn&#8217;t a similar connection between cognition and
amyloid plaques, he said, noting that amyloid plaques form
before people become forgetful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the existing drugs don&#8217;t work, advances in genetics are
giving researchers a growing list of targets to slow or prevent
Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, Harvard&#8217;s Tanzi said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Four genes account for 30 percent to 50 percent of
Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, but they are driving most of what we do in
terms of drug development,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m optimistic that some
of the existing anti-amyloid drugs will work, but you have to
always prepare for the worst. If everything crashes and burns,
we&#8217;ll still have something.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. are among 11 lenders that could suffer $133.8
billion in combined losses as mortgage-bond investors and
insurers demand refunds for soured loans, according to an
analysis by Compass Point Research and Trading LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s the base estimate by analyst Chris Gamaitoni, who
told clients costs may range from $55.3 billion in a best-case
scenario to $179.2 billion at worst. The losses would be in
addition to $28 billion of buyback demands by Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac that Compass previously predicted. Deutsche Bank AG
and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are among lenders confronting the
biggest potential impact, according to Gamaitoni&#8217;s report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders have been barraged by claims from mortgage buyers
and insurers who say banks sold housing debt to investors based
on untrue or misleading data about home loans. The estimated
losses exceed 10 percent of tangible book value at eight of the
banks Gamaitoni cited. While solvency isn&#8217;t at risk, the drain
on profit could last for years, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The investor community overall doesn&#8217;t understand the
magnitude of the problem,&#8221; Gamaitoni said in a telephone
interview. Gamaitoni was a senior financial analyst at Fannie
Mae before joining Compass Point, a Washington-based research
and investment banking firm founded in 2007 by former executives
of Friedman Billings Ramsey  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legal Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bond insurers including MBIA Inc. and investors including
three of the government-chartered Federal Home Loan Banks have
sued securities underwriters and issuers, citing inaccurate
claims over property values and quality of underlying assets.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac collapsed into U.S. conservatorship,
while MBIA saw its stock price slide more than 80 percent as
losses mounted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, the biggest U.S. lender by assets, doesn&#8217;t
comment on research reports, said Jerry Dubrowski, a spokesman
for the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company. Spokesmen
Michael DuVally at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan&#8217;s Thomas Kelly
declined to comment; both firms are based in New York. John
Gallagher of Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank wasn&#8217;t immediately
available to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compass Point focused on the risks to underwriters of home-
loan securities during the peak years of the housing boom, which
included 2005 through 2007. The conclusions were based on
estimates of the amount of bonds underwritten by banks backed by
so-called subprime and Alt-A mortgages, which typically had the
worst repayment records, plus the average default rates on the
loans and a base estimate that 80 percent of defaulted loans
were invalid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Book Value &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, which acquired Countrywide Financial Corp.
in 2008, faces a $35.2 billion loss under Compass Point&#8217;s base-
case scenario, or 17 percent of tangible book value. JPMorgan
Chase, which acquired Bear Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual
Inc., may lose $23.9 billion, or 13 percent of book value, while
Deutsche Bank may lose $14.1 billion, or 21 percent of book
value, according to the report. Goldman Sachs may face an $11.2
billion hit equal to 11 percent of book value, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not going to cause any solvency issues because the
banks have other earnings, and it&#8217;s going to happen over time,&#8221;
Gamaitoni said, estimating most of the losses will be recorded
over the next three years. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be more like a slow
bleed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks, which underwrote securities made up of mortgage
loans, face years of legal disputes because they are &#8220;the ones
left standing&#8221; after the failure of hundreds of subprime
lenders who dealt directly with home buyers, Gamaitoni said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ratings Impact &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fitch Ratings, in a separate report today, said the four
biggest U.S. banks may have combined losses of $17 billion to
$42 billion due to repurchase requests from Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac. More aggressive demands from the two companies
subject Bank of America, JPMorgan, Citigroup Inc. and Wells
Fargo  Co. to &#8220;losses that have not been previously
incorporated into Fitch&#8217;s existing exposures and effectively
into current ratings,&#8221; according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underwriters typically didn&#8217;t make many contractual
promises about the quality of loans in mortgage bonds, and so
may be less legally liable than the companies that issued the
debt or securities, according to Jonathan C. Wishnia, a lawyer
at Lowenstein Sandler PC in Roseland, New Jersey, who has
represented financial companies including loan servicers and
investment firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It seems uphill to me to go after the underwriters,&#8221;
said Jason H. P. Kravitt, a lawyer in New York at Mayer Brown
LLP who represents clients including banks and asset-backed
issuers and serves as deputy chair of the American
Securitization Forum trade group. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much ink is being spilled over the
meaning of China&#8217;s economy surpassing Japan&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more important is what it doesn&#8217;t mean: greater
Chinese purchasing power, longer life spans, better health care
and education, freedom of speech, assembly, religion and
expression, safer roads, building standards, free elections,
clean air and water or social harmony. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s great that China is growing 10 percent. Just don&#8217;t get
carried away about what this moment means. China faces the
daunting task of getting per-capita income into the orbit of
Japan&#8217;s, which is 10 times higher. That&#8217;s what matters and we
are a decade away from knowing how China will do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China is altering the global economy, and not always for
the better. Two phenomena growing before our eyes are the spread
of an authoritarian model and the dominance of the &#8220;Wal-Mart
economy,&#8221; both of which represent a race to the bottom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, I&#8217;m not betting against China. Only the most cynical
and short-sighted among us would want China to fail. A fifth of
humanity enmeshed in crisis is in no one&#8217;s best interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China, though, must beat history. No economic giant has
avoided a major crisis. If China is to eclipse the U.S. by 2027,
as London-based economist Jim O&#8217;Neill of Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. predicts, it must grow at today&#8217;s rates indefinitely.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the world&#8217;s largest professional-
services organization, says it will happen in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, China&#8217;s trajectory is anathema to what Adam Smith taught us about the nature of economic development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authoritarian Example &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;China legitimizes a market-authoritarian example,&#8221; says
Stefan Halper, a senior fellow at Magdalene College in
Cambridge, England, and the author of &#8220;The Beijing Consensus.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With American-style capitalism in tatters and Europe
unraveling, developing nations are clamoring for new role
models. Countries from Angola to Myanmar to Venezuela see
China&#8217;s state-directed capitalism combined with authoritarian
rule as a better path than liberalization and democracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How you create thriving markets over time without
transparency and a free press is beyond me. Wall Street took
things too far and acted shamefully thanks to too little
oversight. China has the opposite problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#8217;s a reason investors question China&#8217;s data. The
country somehow comes up with a single figure in a structurally
imbalanced system of 1 billion-plus people at very different
levels of development, a healthy gray economy and local
governments whose budgets rely on reporting rapid growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Number &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With modest resources, officials settle on one number
purporting to capture the daily activities of the nation --
almost always within the range of expectations of economists
from Shanghai to New York. Try explaining that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spread of the &#8220;Wal-Mart economy,&#8221; an ever-growing
effort to mass-produce at the cheapest cost, also bears
watching. China&#8217;s reluctance to let the yuan strengthen
underlines the primacy of its exports. As China grows, so does
the scope and efficiency of this trade machine. That would be
fine if output were translating into rapid increases in domestic
consumption. It&#8217;s not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been rays of hope on that front, such as demands
for higher wages among factory workers. There are limits,
though, to how much the government will allow income to
skyrocket, lest it fuels inflation or reduces competitiveness.
Chinese, like Germans, will continue to produce more than they
consume. Companies are reinvesting much of what they earn in
increasing capacity, upgrading the machine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deceiving Trends &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News reports that China is now the biggest market for cars
and cell phones and that LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA is
making a beeline there are deceiving. They suggest vast pockets
of consumers can afford such goods. They can&#8217;t. China&#8217;s
purchasing power is growing slower than its ability to undercut
all competitors in the production of goods and services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As China becomes better at churning things out cheaply,
other developing nations will be at a loss. Until recently,
Asian countries such as Indonesia and the Philippines were
ecstatic about China&#8217;s growth. Now they see it&#8217;s more of a zero-
sum game than they anticipated. Expect this dynamic to grow with
China&#8217;s size. This is a budding, but major, geopolitical issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China may have regrets about passing Japan. More will now
be asked of its leaders on climate change, North Korea, energy
deals that support dodgy regimes, and even human rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Size matters less than the quality of growth. China, for
example, surpassed Japan in trademark patent filings in 2009.
Further progress here means China may well be home to the next
Silicon Valley. That is, if the nation&#8217;s state-economy model
doesn&#8217;t smother innovation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entrepreneurial potential is a key reason investors are
bullish on China. Japanese are doing lots of soul-searching this
week, wondering why they became No. 3. Here&#8217;s why: In China, you
have 1.3 billion people working hard to circumvent government
regulations so they can make a quick yuan. Japan has 126 million
complaining about how the government isn&#8217;t fixing their lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever happens, China has some work to do before it can
topple the U.S. from the top slot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(William Pesek is a Bloomberg News columnist. The opinions
expressed are his own.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Sarah Mulholland" date="Aug 18, 2010  2:22 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-18/jpmorgan-said-to-plan-1-billion-mortgage-backed-offering-biggest-of-year.html"><headline>JPMorgan Said to Plan Sale of Commercial Mortgage Bonds</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. plans to sell
$1 billion of commercial mortgage-backed bonds, giving control
of soured loans to a holder of the riskiest portion after
another offering ceded power to investors in the safest pieces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s sale, the largest this year of the debt, would
grant hedge fund H/2 Capital Partners LLC, the buyer of the
bottom $50 million slice, primary authority over troubled loans,
according to people familiar with the transaction who declined
to be identified because negotiations are private. Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. gave those rights to investors of
the highest-rated portions in a $788.5 million offering on Aug.
4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concern that holders of the riskiest pieces may make
decisions favoring their own interests prompted Goldman Sachs to
switch from the traditional structure of securities backed by
hotels, shopping malls and skyscrapers. Spreading control among
numerous senior bondholders may create confusion in the event of
defaults, according to NewOak Capital LLC&#8217;s Ron D&#8217;Vari. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s very difficult to come to terms with delinquent
borrowers as it is,&#8221; said D&#8217;Vari, chief executive officer of
the advisory and asset-management firm in New York, and
previously the head of structured finance at BlackRock Inc. &#8220;If
you multilayer that with additional bureaucracy, it becomes more
difficult.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales Decline &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H/2, the Stamford, Connecticut-based commercial-real estate
fixed-income manger, will receive a yield of more than 14
percent on its 10-year investment, assuming the loans take no
losses, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That compares with an 8.55 percent average yield for
speculative-grade companies, according to the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield Master II Index. High-yield, high-
risk, or junk, debt is ranked below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s Investors
Service and lower than BBB- by Standard  Poor&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The higher-ranked portions of the deal are set to be
offered next month, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a spokesman for JPMorgan, Michael DuVally of
Goldman Sachs and Alex Samuelson at Citigroup, all in New York,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spencer Haber, chief executive officer of H/2 Capital,
didn&#8217;t respond to a phone call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of commercial mortgage-backed securities plunged 95
percent to $11.2 billion in 2008 from a record $234 billion in
2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Banks arranged
$3.4 billion of the securities last year, and about $2.4 billion
has been issued in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B-Pieces &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top-ranked securities yield 2.76 percentage points more
than Treasuries, compared with 3.95 percentage points at the
start of the year, and 4.84 percentage points a year ago,
according to a Barclays Plc index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late payments on commercial mortgages bundled and sold as
bonds are at a record 8.25 percent as of July, compared with
3.04 percent a year earlier, according to Fitch Ratings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors who hold the most-junior slices, or B-pieces, are
first to be wiped out as losses mount and may have an incentive
to keep the debt outstanding rather than foreclose, potentially
punishing other holders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kosmos Energy LLC, the U.S.-based
oil explorer focusing on West Africa, ended its plans for a $4
billion sale of fields in Ghana to Exxon Mobil Corp. after
government opposition to the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will focus on further exploration of Ghana&#8217;s
deposits and together with partners plans to start pumping oil
from the offshore Jubilee field in the fourth quarter, Dallas-
based Kosmos said today in a statement. The field, operated by
Tullow Oil Plc, will reach 120,000 barrels a day of production
next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision highlights the risk of oil and gas investment
in Africa, analysts said. In October, the explorer agreed to an
exclusive sale of its 23 percent stake in Jubilee to Exxon, in a
deal valued at $4 billion. The same month, Ghana National
Petroleum Corp. said it would buy the stake from Kosmos after
the government declined to approve the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s bad news for Ghana, because it&#8217;s going to put off
some potential investors,&#8221; said Dougie Youngson, an analyst at
Arbuthnot Securities Ltd. in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emma Heywood, a spokeswoman at Exxon in the U.K., declined
to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strategy Diversion &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kosmos, backed by Blackstone Group LP and Warburg Pincus
LLC, will become an oil producer with the Jubilee start-up,
diverging from its strategy focusing on exploration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are very encouraged by our recent exploration results,
other discoveries we are appraising, and additional developments
being planned,&#8221; Kosmos Chief Operating Officer Brian Maxted
said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tullow, the U.K. explorer with the most licenses in Africa,
in July said that together with partners including Kosmos it
discovered a &#8220;major new oil field&#8221; offshore Ghana after
drilling the Owo-1 well. The explorers had been targeting a 1.4
billion-barrel find of oil equivalent in the Owo-Tweneboa-Ntomme
area, according to Tullow&#8217;s July presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With potential resources of 1.8 billion barrels, the
Jubilee field, discovered in 2007, has attracted attention from
Chinese producers as well as BP Plc. It will be the first field
to pump oil and gas off Ghana&#8217;s coast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tullow is lead operator of the $3.1 billion Jubilee
project, where it holds 34.7 percent. Anadarko Petroleum Corp.
controls 23.49 percent; Sabre Oil  Gas has 2.81 percent and EO
Group 1.75 percent. GNPC holds 13.75 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The probability that the Bank of
Japan will intervene in foreign-exchange markets for the first
time since March 2004 is at a six-year high of 51 percent,
according to a Morgan Stanley model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strengthening of the yen and its misalignment from
economic fundamentals is increasingly likely to spur government
response, Stephen Hull, London-based head of global currency
strategy at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note dated yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese policy makers are facing pressure to aid the
economy after the yen&#8217;s climb to a 15-year high of 84.73 against
the dollar on Aug. 11 stoked concern that exporters&#8217; earnings
could weaken and deflation might deepen. Trade Minister Masayuki Naoshima said yesterday that the yen is too strong against the
dollar and should drop about 6 percent to help exporters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan hasn&#8217;t intervened in the currency markets since March
16, 2004, when the yen was at about 109 per dollar. The Bank of
Japan sold 14.8 trillion yen during the first three months of
2004, after record sales of 20.4 trillion yen in 2003. The
currency ended 2004 at 102.63 to the dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan last bought the currency in 1998, purchasing 3.05
trillion yen as the exchange rate weakened to 147.66. The yen
was little changed at 85.39 per dollar yesterday in New York.

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. is marketing
$484.6 million of bonds backed by a loan to Centro Properties
Group, the Australian shopping center owner seeking to refinance
$2.7 billion of debt from its U.S. business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loan is secured by 72 retail properties owned by the
Glen Waverley, Australia-based company, according to people
familiar with offering who declined to be identified because
terms are private. Shopping centers in Texas account for 39
percent of the pool, while properties in New York and New Jersey
represent 21 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction is the sixth sale of commercial mortgage-
backed securities this year as Wall Street seeks to revive sales
after issuance plummeted 95 percent to $11.2 billion in 2008
from a record $234 billion in 2007, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The most recent offering, also tied to a single
loan, was a $660 million deal for Vornado Realty Trust earlier
this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of commercial-mortgage bond sales in 2010, three have been
linked to the properties of a single borrower. Offerings grew to
be as large as $7.6 billion and bundled as many as 300 loans
from borrowers across the U.S. as sales peaked in 2007,
Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street banks have been writing new loans to pool for
so-called multi-borrower offerings, though many property owners
are unable to pay off the existing mortgage amid tighter
underwriting standards and prices down 41 percent from 2007
peaks, according to Moody&#8217;s Investors Service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Moody&#8217;s/REAL Commercial Property Price Index dropped 4
percent in June, the company said today in a report. The decline
was the biggest since July 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is preparing a $1 billion deal for September,
people familiar with that sale said. The offering, the largest
this year, will be made up of about 38 loans to different
property owners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Chanyaporn Chanjaroen" date="Aug 19, 2010  9:52 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-19/platinum-to-rise-on-changes-to-south-african-mining-rules-jpmorgan-says.html"><headline>Platinum to Rise on Changes to South African Mining Rules, JPMorgan Says</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Platinum and palladium will rise on
concern about implementing changes to mining rules in South
Africa, said Ian Henderson, who manages about $7 billion in
natural-resource assets at JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve been long platinum for a long time,&#8221; he said today
in an interview in London, referring to a bet on higher prices.
&#8220;It&#8217;s not a gem today, but a gem tomorrow.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concern about rule changes intensified in recent weeks as
Anglo American Plc and Lonmin Plc said the government deprived
them of mining rights. The ruling party in South Africa, the
world&#8217;s largest platinum producer, is preparing to discuss mine
nationalization at a congress next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My anxiety is the South African politics,&#8221; Henderson
said. &#8220;The news that came out recently has been unfriendly to
mines and confusing to investors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government has upheld its award of some prospecting
rights at a mine of Anglo&#8217;s Kumba Iron Ore Ltd. unit to a
company whose biggest shareholder has been in business with the
son of South Africa&#8217;s president. Lonmin in May lost prospecting
rights for some metals to a company led by a former government
official who once sat on its board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Africa is struggling to draw foreign capital as
investment costs rise because of laws aimed at redressing the
inequalities of apartheid that compel the sale of stakes in
mines to black South Africans. The youth wing of the ruling
African National Congress and labor unions want the country&#8217;s
citizens to gain more benefit from its mineral resources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stronger Rand &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gains by the South African currency also helped to increase
local production costs, Henderson said. The rand has advanced 24
percent against the dollar since the end of 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platinum for immediate delivery advanced $4.60, or 0.3
percent, to $1,538.85 an ounce at 2:23 p.m. London time, for a 5
percent gain this year. Palladium rose $4.65, or 0.9 percent, to
$494.65 an ounce, up 21 percent in 2010. Both metals have uses
from automotive pollution-control gear to jewelry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government said Aug. 17 a six-month moratorium on
processing prospecting applications would go into effect on
Sept. 1 as steps are taken to ensure that the system is
&#8220;clean.&#8221; South Africa also plans to clarify ambiguities in
mining laws to address investor concerns over awards of rights,
Mines Minister Susan Shabangu said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country supplies about four-fifths of the world&#8217;s
platinum. Anglo controls the largest miner of the metal, and
Lonmin is third-biggest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Jesse Riseborough and Andrea Catherwood" date="Aug 19, 2010  9:27 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-19/jpmorgan-s-henderson-says-china-may-rival-bhp-billiton-offer-for-potash.html"><headline>JPMorgan''s Henderson Says China May Rival BHP Bid for Potash</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Ian Henderson, manager of $7 billion
in resource assets at JPMorgan Chase  Co., said China may bid
for Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., after a $40 billion BHP
Billiton Ltd. offer, while a Brazilian proposal is less likely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China is &#8220;dependent upon potash exports so they are a big
customer of Potash Corp.,&#8221; Henderson, who manages mining stocks
including BHP and Brazil&#8217;s Vale SA, said today on Bloomberg
Television&#8217;s &#8216;The Pulse with Andrea Catherwood.&#8217; &#8220;Brazil does
have its own potash reserves and these can be developed and I
think Vale is increasing their own production plans already.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potash Corp., the world&#8217;s largest fertilizer maker, this
week rejected a $130-a-share offer from BHP, describing the bid
as &#8220;grossly inadequate.&#8221; Rival bidders may include Vale, Rio
Tinto Group and groups in Russia and China, the world&#8217;s biggest
user of fertilizer with about 30 percent of global consumption,
according to Macquarie Group Ltd. analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the absence of a higher BHP bid, Potash Corp. sees the
best alternative offers coming from businesses backed by China
or India, or companies such as Vale, said two people familiar
with the matter. The likeliest from China are Sinochem Group,
the nation&#8217;s largest chemical trader, China Investment Corp.,
the sovereign wealth fund, or Sinofert Holdings Ltd., they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;China has been acquiring production across a number of
commodity classes,&#8221; Macquarie analysts led by Duncan McKeen
wrote on Aug. 17. &#8220;Given that it is still a large net importer
of potash, it may be a logical buyer of potash production.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A concern for Potash Corp. would be that Chinese companies
move too slowly for the Canadian takeover code, which may force
a potential acquirer to act within a few months, they wrote in a
research report. UBS AG said in an Aug. 17 note that it doesn&#8217;t
expect Vale to lodge a competing offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hostile Bet &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BHP, the world&#8217;s biggest mining company, has arranged $45
billion of loans for its hostile bid, the most debt to finance a
takeover since February 2008. Melbourne-based BHP is seeking to
take control of Potash Corp. to become the leading producer of
fertilizer, betting on rising demand as global food needs grow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What we&#8217;ve got on the table is a full offer and that&#8217;s
the only thing that I can talk about,&#8221; BHP Chief Executive
Officer Marius Kloppers said on a conference call with analysts
yesterday. &#8220;I can&#8217;t speculate about anything else.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand for potash, mined from deposits left by evaporated
seas, will rebound to 50 million metric tons this year from less
than 30 million tons in 2009, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-based
Potash Corp.&#8217;s CEO Bill Doyle said on a conference call Aug. 17.
Potash is a form of potassium mined in countries including
Canada, Brazil, Germany and the U.S. and used by farmers to help
boost crop yields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potash market is bottoming after prices slumped more
than 50 percent amid the global economic crisis. Saskatchewan
prices rallied to $374 a ton in the second quarter, according to
Salman Partners, from $359 a ton in the prior three months.
Potash Corp. has about 20 percent of global output capacity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s like the Ritz, there is only one Ritz hotel around
and there is no doubt about it that this is a fantastic asset,&#8221;
Henderson said. &#8220;Clearly 2010 has been a huge recovery year for
the potash market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BP Plc&#8217;s former head of commodities
trading Quek Chin Thean and three other ex-employees countersued
the oil company after being accused of misusing confidential
information and helping BP&#8217;s rival set up a competing business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quek, former regional operating unit manager Clarence Chang
and ex-trading manager John Foo claim in papers filed in
Singapore High Court yesterday that they were wrongly fired and
are owed an unspecified amount of money by BP. Former executive
assistant Laura Kuan claims she is owed S$379,000 ($280,000)
that BP wrongfully withheld after she left. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP, based in London, sued Quek, Chang, Foo, Kuan and two
other former employees, accusing them of breaching their
obligations by misusing confidential information including oil
trading &#8220;cheat sheets&#8221; to help Shenzhen Brightoil Group set up
a competing business in Singapore. BP sued as it seeks to stem
employee defections, which the former workers partly blamed on a
change in bonus payments in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gulf of Mexico oil spill, which led to a record loss in
the second quarter, may also have prompted some BP workers to
leave, Quek said in court papers. At least 40 employees have
left BP&#8217;s Asian trading operations this year, Quek said. The
unit had employed 200 workers, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quek, 41, was fired July 9 after BP said it found evidence
of wrongdoing, according to the court papers. Quek submitted his
resignation in May and his last day was supposed to be July 16,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP also sued the former head of operations Paul John
Bradshaw and legal manager Simon Cheong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lau Lu Ching, a Singapore-based BP spokeswoman, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foo and Chang said the firings caused them &#8220;great
distress&#8221; and damaged their reputations. All six of the former
employees had accepted a signing bonus from Brightoil. They
denied misusing any of BP&#8217;s trade secrets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is BP Singapore Pte v. Quek Chin Thean  Ors
S482/2010 in the Singapore High Court. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc won court approval for its $298 million
settlement with the U.S. over dealings with nations including
Sudan, Libya and Iran, a day after the judge on the case delayed
the accord. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan in Washington on Aug. 17
requested more information about the settlement, which he called
a &#8220;sweetheart deal.&#8221; London-based Barclays will pay $149
million each to the U.S. and New York state, according to a
deferred-prosecution agreement filed this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During an hour-long hearing yesterday, Sullivan criticized
the accord for not going after individuals who perpetrated the
crime and punishing shareholders instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Why do the shareholders have to pay for this venture?&#8221;
Sullivan asked. &#8220;If I own stock, why do I have to pay?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays was accused of violating U.S. financial sanctions
against Cuba, Iran, Libya, Sudan and Burma from about March 1995
through September 2006. Barclays followed the directions of
banks in those countries to omit their names in payment messages
sent to the New York branch and to other financial institutions,
according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a fair and appropriate resolution for this case,&#8221;
said Kevin Gerrity, a U.S. prosecutor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company admitted wrongdoing and reported it to
regulators, Gerrity said. Barclays spent $250 million
investigating the crime, though no individuals are likely to be
prosecuted, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They spent $250 million and they couldn&#8217;t find anyone?&#8221;
Sullivan asked yesterday, calling it &#8220;shocking.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When corporations self-disclose their criminal wrongdoing
to us, as Barclays did, they will not get a pass, but we will
take their disclosure, cooperation and remedial efforts into
consideration,&#8221; Lanny Breuer, head of the Justice Department&#8217;s
criminal division, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Barclays Bank Plc, 10-cr-218, U.S.
District Court, District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Jersey Settles SEC Fraud Claims Over $26 Billion in Bonds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state of New Jersey settled claims that it fraudulently
misled municipal-bond investors while underfunding the state&#8217;s
two biggest pension plans in the first Securities and Exchange
Commission case to target a state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Jersey consented to a cease-and-desist order, the SEC
said in a statement yesterday. Documents for more than $26
billion in bond offerings from 2001 to 2007 &#8220;created the false
impression&#8221; that the Teachers&#8217; Pension and Annuity Fund and the
Public Employees&#8217; Retirement System were adequately funded,
masking the fact that the state couldn&#8217;t make contributions
without raising taxes or cutting services, according to the
SEC&#8217;s statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All issuers of municipal securities, including states,
are obligated to provide investors with the information
necessary to evaluate material risks,&#8221; SEC Enforcement Director
Robert Khuzami said in the statement. &#8220;The State of New Jersey
didn&#8217;t give its municipal investors a fair shake, withholding
and misrepresenting pertinent information about its financial
situation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Jersey didn&#8217;t admit or deny wrongdoing in the
settlement, the SEC said. The regulator said it considered the
state&#8217;s cooperation and &#8220;certain remedial acts&#8221; in reaching
the accord. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Menopause Drug Didn&#8217;t Cause Cancers, Jury Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s menopause drug Prempro didn&#8217;t cause two
women&#8217;s cancers, and the drugmaker doesn&#8217;t have to pay damages
over those illnesses, a jury decided. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jurors in state court in Philadelphia deliberated about
four hours before concluding yesterday that Prempro wasn&#8217;t a
&#8220;factual cause&#8221; of Sharon Buxton&#8217;s and Joy Henry&#8217;s breast
cancers. The women sought at least $100,000 in damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While we have great sympathy for Mrs. Buxton, Mrs. Henry
and their families, we believe the verdicts in this case confirm
our position,&#8221; Pfizer said in a statement. &#8220;The vast majority
of women who take hormone therapy do not get breast cancer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Premarin,
Wyeth&#8217;s estrogen-based drug, with Upjohn Co.&#8217;s progestin-laden
Provera, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth later combined the two
hormones in Prempro. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swiss Man&#8217;s Jail Term for Vandalizing Singapore Train Extended &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swiss executive Oliver Fricker must spend an additional two
months in jail for breaking into a Singapore depot and spray-
painting a commuter train, an appeals judge ruled, extending the
sentence to seven months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appeals Judge V.K. Rajah dismissed Fricker&#8217;s appeal of the
original five-month sentence for trespassing and vandalism
yesterday, agreeing to a request by prosecutors for a longer
prison term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fricker, 32, along with a British accomplice, broke into
SMRT Corp.&#8217;s depot and spray-painted a train with the words
&#8220;McKoy Banos&#8221; on May 17. The executive, in an orange jumpsuit
with a beige windbreaker and a crew cut, hung his head as the
judge read the sentence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fricker&#8217;s act was &#8220;audacious&#8221; and the two months he
received for trespassing was &#8220;manifestly inadequate,&#8221; Rajah
said prior to handing down the sentence that extended the term
to four months. Fricker&#8217;s three-month sentence for vandalism and
three strokes of the cane remain unchanged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fricker had been in Singapore since October, 2008, and had
worked as a software consultant at Zurich-based financial
software maker Comit AG. Comit hasn&#8217;t been in touch with Fricker
since he pleaded guilty, Fricker&#8217;s lawyer Derek Kang said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fricker is &#8220;obviously disappointed,&#8221; Kang told reporters.
&#8220;It was never meant to be a big publicity stunt. He&#8217;s paying a
very heavy price for a single, foolish, act.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Fricker Oliver v Public Prosecutor MA232/2010

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Sues to Prevent Stuytown Foreclosure &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. and U.S. Bancorp sued to block an
entity seeking to foreclose on the equity interests of the owner
of Manhattan&#8217;s Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village
apartment complex. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entity, PSW NYC LLC, has scheduled an Aug. 25
foreclosure auction. The group is a joint venture between Bill
Ackman&#8217;s Pershing Square Capital Management LP and Winthrop
Realty Trust, who together bought $300 million in defaulted
mezzanine loans on the 80-acre property. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joint venture wants to foreclose on the equity
interests of the company that owns the apartment complex and is
responsible for paying the $3 billion first mortgage. If
successful, the venture will place the entity into bankruptcy,
and avoid paying the mortgage, according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The future of this iconic enclave in the Borough of
Manhattan is in imminent jeopardy,&#8221; lawyers for Bank of America
N.A. and U.S. Bank said in the complaint filed yesterday in New
York State Supreme Court in Manhattan. The Pershing and Winthrop
plan violates terms of the intercreditor agreement for the
property, according to the suit. The agreement, which governs
how the loan is to be repaid among competing creditors, says
junior lenders get second priority after the senior mortgage
holders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America and U.S.
Bank, a subsidiary of Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp, acting
&#8220;by and through&#8221; special servicer CW Capital Asset Management
LLC, have already sought foreclosure on behalf of creditors of
the senior mortgage. That was packaged with other commercial-
property loans and sold as securities. The biggest holders
include government-owned mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ackman didn&#8217;t respond to an e-mail seeking comment. Michael
Ashner, chairman and chief executive officer of Boston-based
Winthrop Realty, declined to immediately comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bank of America Corp. v. PSW NYC LLC, 10-
651293, New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan (New York
County). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairfield Must Face Investor Suit, U.S. Judge Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairfield Greenwich Group, an operator of &#8220;feeder funds&#8221;
channeling money into Bernard Madoff&#8217;s fraudulent investment
scheme, must face claims in a lawsuit filed in New York, a U.S.
judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero in Manhattan yesterday
declined to dismiss most of the claims in the case while
narrowing the investor lawsuit against Fairfield and several
firms that provided it with administrative and accounting
services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairfield, a hedge fund co-founded by Walter Noel, earned
an estimated $919 million from placing investors&#8217; money with
Madoff. The suit, which seeks class-action status, contends the
defendants shut their eyes to Madoff&#8217;s fraud, and seeks recovery
of the investors&#8217; losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;According to plaintiffs, FGG fulfilled a critical role
for Madoff, who knew that secrecy and obfuscation were key to
prolonging how long he could keep his big lie afloat and his
sand castles grounded,&#8221; Marrero said in a 198-page opinion
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also sued in the case are Citco Group Ltd., GlobeOp
Financial Services LLC and the accounting firm
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A call to Amsterdam-based Citco Group after business hours
wasn&#8217;t answered. A voice-mail message left with the New York
office of London-based GlobeOp wasn&#8217;t returned. Steven Silber, a
spokesman for PricewaterhouseCoopers, based in New York, had no
immediate comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GlobeOp provided administrative services to Fairfield&#8217;s
Fairfield Sentry fund, Marrero said in his opinion. Citco served
as an administrator, custodian, bank and depository for
Fairfield funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re pleased that Judge Marrero dismissed many of the
claims against many of the individual and corporate
defendants,&#8221; said Mark Cunha, a lawyer representing Fairfield
in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cunha said that important claims in the suit, which Marrero
was required to assume as fact for purposes of deciding whether
to dismiss them, aren&#8217;t true. Fairfield will have a chance to
disprove the plaintiffs&#8217; remaining claims later, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Anwar v. Fairfield Greenwich, 09-cv-118, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terra, Citigroup Said to Plan Settlement Talks Before Trial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guy Hands&#8217;s Terra Firma Capital Partners Ltd. and Citigroup
Inc. plan settlement talks in September before a trial on the
2007 sale of music label EMI Group Ltd., two people with
knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hands is seeking to reach an accord with Citigroup, EMI&#8217;s
lender, over the music label&#8217;s debt before the trial starts in
October in New York, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the talks are confidential. Officials at
Citigroup and Terra Firma in London declined to comment
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move comes after the British financier raised 105
million pounds ($135 million) from investors in June to meet its
debt requirements. In March, Citigroup, EMI&#8217;s lender, was denied
a request to move Terra&#8217;s lawsuit, which accuses the bank of
misrepresenting facts and tricking Hands into buying EMI, to
England from Manhattan. Citigroup has denied wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca Gets Verus&#8217;s Asthma-Drug Suit Dropped &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca Plc won dismissal of a lawsuit in which it was
accused of backing out of a deal with Verus Pharmaceuticals Inc.
to develop a children&#8217;s asthma drug and instead aligning with
competitor Map Pharmaceuticals Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verus, based in San Diego, sued in New York state court in
May 2009, seeking at least $280 million in compensatory damages
and $1 billion in punitive damages from AstraZeneca, the U.K.&#8217;s
second-biggest drugmaker. Verus claimed that once AstraZeneca
entered a deal with Map, it sought to kill any competition by
destroying Verus&#8217;s ability to develop the drug on its own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case, which doesn&#8217;t name Map as a defendant, was later
moved to federal court in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Verus&#8217;s causes of action fail to state claims for which
relief can be granted,&#8221; U.S. District Judge Barbara S. Jones
said in an Aug. 16 order dismissing the case. She didn&#8217;t rule on
the merits of Verus&#8217;s accusations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are disappointed with the decision,&#8221; Blair
Fensterstock, a lawyer for Verus at Fensterstock  Partners LLP
in New York, said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;AZ&#8217;s actions are
examples of a wrongful pattern of activity to monopolize a
sector of the pharmaceutical space to the detriment of the
public at large.&#8221; Fensterstock said he will appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When preclinical studies failed to show the safety of the
pediatric asthma product in development, AstraZeneca exercised
its legal rights to terminate its collaboration with Verus
Pharmaceuticals and to discontinue development of the product,&#8221;
Tony Jewell, a spokesman for AstraZeneca, said in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Verus Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. AstraZeneca AB,
09-cv-5660, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satyam Founder Raju Granted Bail by Indian Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ramalinga Raju, who resigned as chairman of Satyam Computer
Services Ltd. after saying he overstated the Indian company&#8217;s
assets by $1 billion, won bail from a court in Hyderabad, his
lawyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raju, whose bail petition on health grounds was rejected by
the country&#8217;s Supreme Court in March, was granted bail by Judge
Raja Elango, his lawyer S. Bharat Kumar said by telephone. Kumar
said he couldn&#8217;t immediately provide any further details as he
was yet to receive a copy of the judgment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Satyam founder has been in custody in India since
January last year when he wrote a letter to the board explaining
the financial irregularities. The letter touched off India&#8217;s
biggest corporate-fraud inquiry. The admission triggered a stock
slump and a government takeover that led to sale of the
Hyderabad-based software-services exporter to Tech Mahindra Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It appears that the bail has been granted on health
grounds, and if that is the case then it does not dilute charges
against Raju,&#8221; said Barunesh Chandra, a New Delhi-based
independent legal consultant. &#8220;It is surprising that the
investigation is on even after one-and-a-half years. Ideally the
investigating agencies should have completed that process and
the trial should have started.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raju was allowed to be freed on bail on condition he stays
in Hyderabad, Press Trust of India reported. He will have to
provide two bonds of 2 million rupees ($43,000) each, according
to the report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hughes Hubbard Litigation Chief Ted Mayer to Run New York Firm &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hughes Hubbard  Reed LLP partner Ted Mayer, one of Merck 
Co.&#8217;s chief lawyers in its $4.85 billion Vioxx painkiller
settlement, will replace Charles Scherer as the law firm&#8217;s
managing partner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayer, co-head of the litigation group, and Gerard Cruse,
who joined the firm as chief operating officer last month from
Apollo Global Management LLC, will take over Scherer&#8217;s duties
Jan. 1, Hughes Hubbard Chairwoman Candace Beinecke said
yesterday in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scherer, who served as managing partner for more than two
decades, has &#8220;guided us through more than 15 straight years of
record profits,&#8221; Beinecke said in the statement. He is retiring
from Hughes Hubbard, according to the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beinecke also appointed Mayer and Kenneth Lefkowitz, co-
head of Hughes Hubbard&#8217;s corporate and mergers-and-acquisitions
groups, as deputy chairs to advise on strategic and practice-
management issues, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cruse will handle day-to-day management duties of the firm,
the law firm said. He was global director at New York-based
Apollo, the buyout firm headed by Leon Black. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayer will maintain his product-liability practice at the
law firm, Hughes Hubbard said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.K. Antitrust Regulator Pays Most in Legal Fees Since 2006 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britain&#8217;s antitrust regulator has seen its legal costs soar
after setbacks in court battles in the past year, including
cases against BAA Airports Ltd., Barclays Plc and Tesco Plc,
according to Competition Commission data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legal fees reached a four-year high of 1.91 million pounds
($3 million) between April 1, 2009, and March 31, 2010, more
than double the amount a year earlier and over 10 times the
140,586 pounds paid in 2006-07, according to data obtained by
Bloomberg News under a Freedom of Information Act request. The
commission paid 644,515 pounds in external legal costs in the
period from April 1 to June 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The costs have increased because we&#8217;ve been through an
exceptional period where we&#8217;ve faced a significant number of
important legal challenges,&#8221; commission spokesman Rory Taylor
said in an e-mailed response to questions. &#8220;Not everything has
gone our way in these cases but that is inevitable, nobody can
guarantee unblemished success in these situations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers from Farrer  Co were paid 640,854 pounds for legal
advice between 2007 and 2010, the most among the 16 legal firms
named in the disclosed data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Essex Court charged a total 300,169 pounds for work
involving BAA, owned by Madrid-based Ferrovial SA, and
competition in the mobile-phone industry in the same period.
Monckton Chambers were paid 191,764 pounds for work on market
and merger regulation involving Barclays, BAA, British Sky
Broadcasting Group Plc, Sports Direct International Plc, Tesco
and Virgin Media Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gjensidige Forsikring BA, the
largest Norwegian property and casualty insurer, hired Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. as sole global coordinator for its initial
public offering this year, Chief Financial Officer Tor Loennum
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp., DnB NOR ASA, Pareto Securities and
Keefe, Bruyette  Woods Inc. will also help manage the sale,
which is expected to happen this year, Loennum said in a phone
interview yesterday. The Norwegian insurer will sell a stake of
35 percent to 40 percent, said Loennum, who declined to comment
on the possible value of the stake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gjensidige will be seeking about 1 billion euros ($1.3
billion) in its initial sale, said two people with knowledge of
the transaction, who declined to be named because the
information is private. At that amount, the IPO will be the
biggest in Norway since at least 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The money raised in the first-time stock sale will all go
to existing shareholders, said Loennum, who also serves as
deputy chief executive of the Oslo-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gjensidige proposed in March that the mutually owned firm
be converted into a public company, following legislation in
Norway that allows such companies to organize clients&#8217; ownership
into financial foundations. The insurer in 2007 delayed a sale
of share certificates, or so-called primary-capital certificates
that wouldn&#8217;t give the buyers ownership rights, because of
market turmoil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Norwegian insurer has been on a buying spree in recent
years. In March, it agreed to buy Nykredit Realkredit A/S&#8217;s non-
life insurance division for 2.5 billion kroner ($458 million) to
add 230,000 clients in Denmark, its seventh takeover outside
Norway since 2006. It bought Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s consumer finance
operations in Norway last year and purchased Lithuania&#8217;s RESO
Europa in 2008 to expand its market share in the Baltics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Massoud A. Derhally" date="Aug 19, 2010  4:48 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-19/jordan-to-select-jpmorgan-hsbc-credit-suisse-for-500-million-bond-sale.html"><headline>Jordan to Select JPMorgan, HSBC, Credit Suisse for $500 Million Bond Sale</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Jordan will select banks including
JPMorgan Chase  Co., HSBC Holdings Plc, Credit Suisse Group AG
and Arab Bank Plc to manage the sale of a $500 million Eurobond,
Finance Minister Mohammad Abu Hammour said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government plans to offer debt maturing in five years
by the fourth quarter of this year to help finance the nation&#8217;s
budget deficit, Abu Hammour said in an interview by telephone
from Amman today. In June, Abu Hammour said Jordan was
considering either the sale of conventional or Islamic bonds,
known as sukuk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are in the final stages of granting these banks the
right to manage the sale,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We want to finance the
budget deficit externally rather than internally, leaving the
liquidity in the local market for the private sector.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jordan imports more than 90 percent of its oil and
typically relies on foreign investment and grants to finance its
budget deficit. Economic growth may reach 4 percent this year,
Abu Hammour said in May, compared with an International Monetary
Fund forecast of about 3.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The projected budget deficit for this year after grants has
been revised to about 1 billion dinars ($1.4 billion), or 6
percent of gross domestic product, down from about 9 percent
last year, according to Ministry of Finance estimates. Overseas
grants increased 65 percent in the first six months of 2010 to
157.9 million dinars from a year earlier, the ministry said in a
preliminary report on its website Aug. 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jordan&#8217;s long-term foreign currency debt is rated Ba2 at
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and BB at Standard  Poor&#8217;s, the
second highest junk ranking. It had 3.87 billion dinars of
overseas public debt outstanding as of June this year, according
to a preliminary report by the Ministry of Finance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Crayton Harrison" date="Aug 19, 2010 12:01 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-19/slim-defends-mexico-wireless-empire-as-telefonica-televisa-step-up-fight.html"><headline>Slim Defends Mexico Turf as Telefonica, Televisa Step Up Fight</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Carlos Slim is facing the Mexican
government&#8217;s biggest effort in years to bring more competition
to the wireless market dominated by his America Movil SAB. (AMXL) The
billionaire is likely to turn back the challenge, analysts say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SA (TLEVICPO) and Telefonica SA (TEF) plan to offer wireless
high-speed Internet across Mexico for the first time after
winning airwaves in a government auction, the nation&#8217;s first
since 2005. The companies also won the right this year to use
public fiber-optic lines to fortify their networks and compete
against America Movil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While those new assets may bring Mexicans lower prices for
mobile phones and services such as Web access, they&#8217;re unlikely
to do real damage to Slim&#8217;s profits in Mexico, said Richard Dineen, an analyst at HSBC Holdings Plc. America Movil&#8217;s Mexican
division is its most profitable and the fourth most profitable
carrier in the world, according to Merrill Lynch  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Their budget for various activities, whether it&#8217;s
engineering, investment, marketing, is often equivalent to the
summed budgets of their competitors,&#8221; Dineen said in an
interview. &#8220;That is a formidable competitor.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through March, the Mexican unit, called Telcel, had 71
percent of Mexican phone subscribers, while Telefonica, its
next-biggest rival, held 21 percent. Telcel&#8217;s share of the
market was the largest of operators in 50 countries studied by
Merrill Lynch in a report released in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America Movil is the foundation of Slim&#8217;s wealth, helping
make him the richest man in the world according to Forbes
magazine. His stake in the company now makes up almost three-quarters of his $57 billion in publicly disclosed holdings,
according to data collected by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Slim&#8217;s Control &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s shares have increased 166 percent over the
past five years, compared with a 122 percent increase in
Mexico&#8217;s IPC index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America Movil acquired a stake of 59 percent this year in
Telefonos de Mexico SAB, Mexico&#8217;s largest land-line phone
carrier. Through last quarter, the Mexican wireless unit
represented about half the profits of America Movil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the companies operate separately and Telmex must
accept traffic from America Movil rivals, having Telmex under
its control can help America Movil plan investments, such as
where to put its equipment to align with Telmex&#8217;s network, said
Tomas Lajous, an analyst at UBS AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What&#8217;s going to be key for this war is infrastructure,&#8221;
Lajous, who recommends buying America Movil shares, said in an
interview. &#8220;It now becomes about execution and investment, and
that&#8217;s where it&#8217;s really tough to compete.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An America Movil spokeswoman declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of Scale &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telcel also benefits from government rules for phone calls.
Mobile-phone carriers are allowed to charge their rivals a fee
for calls connected to their users. That rule means it&#8217;s cheaper
for people who use the same carrier to call each other than to
call people who use a rival carrier. Since Telcel has the most
users, it has a cost advantage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NII Holdings Inc. (NIHD), which bid for airwaves with Televisa,
has pushed Mexico&#8217;s government to reduce such interconnection
fees. The company, which operates the Nextel brand in Mexico,
also has access to network infrastructure at competitive rates,
said Gustavo Cantu, a vice president of NII&#8217;s Mexican unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is no doubt that Nextel will impact the market,&#8221;
Cantu said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More 3G Choices &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Telecommunications Commission signed off Aug.
16 on a bid for airwaves from Televisa and NII that will allow
them to enter the 3G market across Mexico for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telefonica began investing in its third-generation, or 3G
network, even before it officially acquired new airwaves last
month. The company is offering 3G services in 32 cities,
including Mexico City, said Sergio Chueca, deputy director of
value-added services for Telefonica&#8217;s Mexican unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Telefonica believed and bet strongly on this project,&#8221;
Chueca said. &#8220;In a country like Mexico, price can&#8217;t be a
barrier. It has to be an accessible price.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telefonica may also add assets in the country. Maxcom
Telecomunicaciones SAB (MAXCOMCP), Mexico&#8217;s fifth-largest phone carrier, is
for sale and seeking bids from Telefonica and France&#8217;s Vivendi
SA (VIV), two people with knowledge of the situation said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telefonica has nicked Telcel&#8217;s market share. Slim&#8217;s
company&#8217;s portion of customers has fallen three percentage
points from 74 percent in 2007 while Telefonica added five
percentage points to reach 21 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same span, Telcel&#8217;s profit margin has climbed to 59
percent from 53 percent, leaving out interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization. The margin for wireless service
in Mexico, leaving out equipment costs, hit a record 70 percent
last quarter, said Walter Piecyk, an analyst at BTIG LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Telefonica&#8217;s Defense &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even though there&#8217;s some competition coming, they&#8217;re not
dramatically new operators in the market,&#8221; Piecyk said. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s enough to change the trajectory of where their
margins go.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telcel&#8217;s head start in offering 3G in Mexico has given it
more time to build a nationwide network, and further investments
would improve the speed and reliability of its coverage.
Telefonica and NII, meanwhile, are starting from scratch with
their 3G networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As long as America Movil keeps its foot on the gas and
maintains a base-station count advantage over rivals, it will
enjoy superior service,&#8221; said Dineen, who has a neutral rating
on the shares. &#8220;It would be a decent strategy, it seems to me,
to keep those high-end 3G data users loyal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Dawn Kopecki" date="Aug 20, 2010  3:16 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-20/jpmorgan-is-said-to-revamp-asset-management-division-to-counter-blackrock.html"><headline>JPMorgan Is Said to Revamp Asset-Management Division to Counter BlackRock</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank, will revamp its $1.6 trillion asset
management unit to compete against investment firms such as
BlackRock Inc. and Pacific Investment Management Co., a person
with direct knowledge of the changes said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George Gatch, 46, who has worked at JPMorgan since 1986,
will replace Eve Guernsey as chief executive officer of
Investment Management Americas, the person said, speaking
anonymously because the changes haven&#8217;t been announced publicly.
Gatch will assume Guernsey&#8217;s duties and keep running mutual fund
and retirement units, the person said. Gatch will work with a
new global manager overseeing the institutional business to be
named in September, according to an e-mail from Gatch to
employees dated Aug. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Now is the time to ensure that we have a structure that
supports our future success as we confront challenges from
passive managers, ETFs and a generational shift in the way our
country saves for retirement,&#8221; Gatch said in the e-mail. So-
called passive managers typically follow indexes instead of
picking individual stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes underscore efforts by asset management head
Mary Callahan Erdoes, 42, to double revenue in five years,
expanding after competitors such as Bank of America Corp. and
Barclays Plc shed such units following the worst economic crisis
since the Great Depression. Erdoes previously ran JPMorgan&#8217;s
private bank and succeeded Jes Staley in September. Staley took
over the investment bank after JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon ousted
investment bank co-CEO Bill Winters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Rounding Adjustment&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokeswoman Mary Sedarat declined to comment on the
changes, which were reported earlier today by the New York
Times&#8217; Dealbook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s asset management division, which generated $391
million in net income during the second quarter, provides the
bank with &#8220;a buffer to the variability of investment banking
revenues,&#8221; said Geoffrey Bobroff, a mutual fund consultant in
East Greenwich, Rhode Island. For many large investment banks,
&#8220;it&#8217;s a rounding adjustment in good days,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In bad
days, it may be the only source of revenue.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garibaldi Named &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Garibaldi will run institutional advisory and sales in
investment management, reporting to both Gatch and the new
global head for institutional clients, Gatch wrote in the e-
mail. Garibaldi replaces John Hunt, who is leaving in October,
the person with knowledge of the changes said. Guernsey is
retiring after 32 years at the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gatch, who most recently ran the retail business for
investment management in North America, is one of three regional
division heads. Jamie Broderick will continue to run the retail
and institutional businesses for investment management in the
U.K., Europe and Latin America while David Hsu will do the same
in Asia, according to the person. All three report to Clive Brown, the chief operating officer for asset management, the
person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan ranked 12th among U.S.-based stock and bond mutual
fund managers as of June 30, according to Morningstar Inc. data.
The bank had $103 billion of assets under management, excluding
money market funds. The asset management unit oversees $1.6
trillion in investments, which includes $1.2 trillion it
directly manages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank, ranked second behind Bank of America in deposits
and assets among U.S. lenders, was the only large Wall Street
bank to remain profitable through the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp., the second-largest
U.S. oil company, said it&#8217;s investigating an oil spill in
Angola, which vies with Nigeria as Africa&#8217;s top oil producer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The size and source of the leak are unknown, Chevron said
today in a statement. Oil washed up on a beach in the region of
Cabinda where Chevron&#8217;s local unit, the Cabinda Gulf Oil Co., is
the operator of two concessions with partners including Total SA
of France, Italy&#8217;s Eni SpA and Angola&#8217;s state oil company
Sonangol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The origin of the material is not identified, but the
Cabinda Gulf Oil Co. immediately enacted its response plan for
spills in order to minimize the environmental impact,&#8221; Chevron
said. &#8220;The company reaffirms that the origin of the substance
is unknown.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chevron unit pumped about 500,000 barrels a day off the
coast of Cabinda last year, compared with Angola&#8217;s daily
production of 1.8 million barrels. Cabinda is an exclave of
Angola, separated from the rest of the country by a sliver of
the Democratic Republic of Congo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BP Plc fired back at Transocean Ltd.
in a dispute over the withholding of information about possible
causes of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Neath, BP&#8217;s associate general counsel, said an Aug.
18 letter from a Transocean attorney asserting BP wasn&#8217;t
releasing critical data contained &#8220;many false and misleading
assertions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given its content and tone, your letter is nothing more
than a publicity stunt evidently designed to draw attention away
from Transocean&#8217;s potential role in the Deepwater Horizon
tragedy,&#8221; Neath wrote Steven Roberts, the Transocean attorney,
in a response yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executives of London-based BP and Vernier, Switzerland-
based Transocean have publicly disputed responsibilities for
operations of the BP well and the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig
that it leased from Transocean. The companies engaged in finger-
pointing before Congress over steps that may have contributed to
the April 20 explosion that killed 11 workers and triggered the
largest U.S. oil spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transocean said in its letter that BP&#8217;s &#8220;continued refusal
to provide documents&#8221; was blocking efforts to determine the
cause of the spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP hasn&#8217;t provided documents requested by Transocean since
June 21, Roberts said in the letter sent to BP and copied to
officials in the Obama administration and members of Congress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neath said that BP made available on July 16 more than
100,000 pages of documents to Transocean &#8220;for access, download
and review.&#8221; Neath copied his letter to the same administration
officials and lawmakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our commitment to cooperate with these investigations has
been and remains unequivocal and steadfast,&#8221; Neath said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HSBC Should Reveal Reports on Madoff Risk, Judge Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC Holdings Plc, Europe&#8217;s biggest bank, should turn over
internal reviews of potential fraud and other operational risks
at Bernard Madoff&#8217;s business from 2006 and 2008, a New York
judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland, in an Aug. 17 ruling,
agreed to ask the High Court in London to order HSBC to hand
over reports, contracts, audio recordings and documents related
to examinations conducted by an affiliate of KPMG International.
HSBC acted as custodian bank for several funds that invested
with the con man. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC commissioned the last review in September 2008, about
three months before Madoff&#8217;s arrest, according to the ruling.
London-based HSBC and trustee Irving Picard in New York reached
an agreement on which documents should be turned over if the
order is issued, Manhattan court filings show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC and UBS AG, based in Zurich, face dozens of investor
lawsuits in Europe over claims they failed in their duties as
custodians for European Union-regulated funds. Banco Santander
SA, the Spanish bank that lost $3.2 billion in the scam, was
sued by investors for allegedly identifying as early as 2006
risk tied to Madoff&#8217;s secrecy and accounting practices without
notifying customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard is suing hedge funds and other parties that profited
from the $65 billion fraud to repay victims. Madoff, 72, pleaded
guilty last year and is serving a 150-year sentence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC spokesman Adrian Russell said the company can&#8217;t
comment on ongoing litigation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEC&#8217;s New Jersey Fraud Case May Be Harbinger in Muni Crackdown &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s fraud case
against New Jersey may presage a wave of lawsuits seeking to
crack down on misdeeds by public officials who raise money in
the $2.8 trillion municipal bond market, Bloomberg News&#8217; William
Selway and Dunstan McNichol report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Jersey settled claims Aug. 17 that it didn&#8217;t disclose
to investors that it failed to put enough cash into its two
biggest pension plans when it sold $26 billion of bonds from
2001 to 2007. The case is the first SEC fraud charge against a
state and follows the creation of a unit set up this year to
focus on municipal securities and pension funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They will be looking for other cases,&#8221; said James Doty,
a former SEC general counsel who&#8217;s now an attorney with Baker
Botts LLP in Washington. &#8220;It&#8217;s a harbinger that they expect
disclosure standards to be scrutinized and be increased.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC Chairwoman Mary Schapiro has pressed for tougher
disclosure rules for municipal bonds, whose history as a safe
investment has been jeopardized by dwindling tax collections,
record budget deficits and rising defaults by state and local
borrowers. Investment losses also left states $500 billion short
of funds to cover promised pensions by mid-2008, even before the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. sent stocks tumbling,
the Pew Center on the States said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are a lot of states that are significantly
underfunded,&#8221; said Lynn Turner, a former SEC chief accountant
who served on an independent panel that investigated San Diego&#8217;s
pension fund. The SEC sanctioned the city in 2006 for hiding
gaps in its retirement system after the Internet stock bubble
burst. &#8220;There&#8217;s likely to be a dozen that have the same type of
problems as New Jersey, and it&#8217;s not just states but cities
too.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wesizwe AGM Halted by Court Order Amid Investor Spat &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wesizwe Platinum Ltd., which agreed in May to a takeover by
China&#8217;s Jinchuan Group Co., was forced to cancel its annual
general meeting yesterday after shareholders obtained a court
order blocking the event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting was postponed as stockholders dispute who has
the right to vote using the shares of South Africa&#8217;s Bakubung
community, represented by Bakubung-Ba-Ratheo Community
Development Corp. and Newshelf 925, Wesizwe Chairman Dawn
Mokhobo said at the scheduled start of the AGM in Johannesburg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court application was filed by four members of the
Bakubung community, resident in the Ledig area near Sun City,
where Wesizwe plans to build its first platinum mine at the
Bushveld Geological Complex, the world&#8217;s richest deposit of the
metal. The community controls about 17.9 percent of the
company&#8217;s shares, Wesizwe said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disagreement relates to &#8220;whether the community shares
have been alienated into the hands of third parties, where the
shares are, and who has the right to vote these shares,&#8221;
Mokhobo said in an e-mailed statement, adding that the company
is &#8220;deeply concerned about the dispute.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bakubung-Ba-Ratheo Traditional Community appointed
Roseman Sipho Matshoba and Keneilwe Danke at an Aug. 17 meeting
to vote the 73.6 million shares held by BCDC and 43.9 million of
the 70 million shares held by Newshelf at the AGM yesterday,
according to a copy of the court application. The community
lodged the application after being advised that other entities
were nominated by BCDC to vote its shareholding at the AGM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jinchuan &#8220;understands&#8221; the issue and the court order
doesn&#8217;t have any bearing on the two companies&#8217; talks, Wesizwe&#8217;s
Chief Executive Officer Mike Solomon said in an interview
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Sues Natixis in London Over Credit-Default Swaps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sued Natixis SA in London over
whether the French bank can terminate bond transaction
protection it sold to Goldman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a lawsuit filed last month, Goldman said that Natixis,
the investment-banking unit of BPCE SA, France&#8217;s second-largest
lender by branches, shouldn&#8217;t terminate three credit-default
swaps. New York-based Goldman bought the swaps with a potential
value of around $530 million three years ago and is seeking
damages for breach of contract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a hearing on Aug. 4, Justice David Steele at the High
Court in London said the case should go to trial Nov. 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs spokeswoman Pavla Shaw declined to comment in
a telephone interview. Natixis spokeswoman Viviane Desailly
didn&#8217;t respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Goldman Sachs International v. Natixis, High
Court of Justice, Queen&#8217;s Bench Division. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ford Wins New Trial in $31 Million SUV Rollover Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford Motor Co. won a new trial in a lawsuit over brain
injuries suffered by a teenager in a Bronco II rollover accident
that resulted in a $31 million jury award against the U.S.
automaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The South Carolina Supreme Court found a judge overseeing
Jesse Branham III&#8217;s case allowed the teen&#8217;s lawyers to use
inadmissible evidence to convince jurors Ford officials knew the
sport-utility vehicle was defectively designed and had a
propensity for rolling over. The judge also shouldn&#8217;t have
allowed Branham&#8217;s attorneys to offer evidence of Ford
executives&#8217; pay when seeking punitive damages against the
automaker during the 2006 trial, the court said Aug. 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branham&#8217;s case was one of 12 verdicts against second-
biggest U.S.-based automaker involving rollovers of the
company&#8217;s vehicles stretching back to June 2004, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Juries ordered Ford to pay a total
of $568 million in damages over the accidents. The teen&#8217;s
verdict also was one of the largest jury awards in 2006 against
an automaker, according to the data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branham was disappointed with the appellate court&#8217;s
decision, said Ronnie Crosby, a Hampton, South Carolina-based
lawyer for the family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe there is ample evidence to demonstrate the
Bronco II is defective and unreasonably dangerous and we&#8217;re
eager to present that evidence to another jury,&#8221; Crosby said in
a phone interview. Marcey Evans, a spokeswoman for Dearborn,
Michigan-based Ford, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The South Carolina case is Jesse Branham Jr., et. al. v.
Ford Motor Co., 26860, Supreme Court of South Carolina

&lt;p&gt;Legal Reviews &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuomo Said to Subpoena AIG, Lincoln in Benefits Probe &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo subpoenaed American
International Group Inc. as part of a fraud investigation
focusing on life insurers&#8217; retention of death benefits, said two
people briefed on the demands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lincoln National Corp., Aetna Inc., CNO Financial Group
Inc. and Principal Financial Group Inc. also were ordered to
turn over records, said one of the people, who declined to be
identified because the subpoenas hadn&#8217;t been publicly disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuomo is widening a probe after saying on July 29 that he
subpoenaed MetLife Inc. and Prudential Financial Inc., the two
largest U.S. life insurers. Bloomberg Markets magazine reported
July 28 that more than 100 carriers earn investment income on
$28 billion owed to life-insurance beneficiaries. The companies
hold money in so-called retained-asset accounts, which include a
&#8220;checkbook&#8221; for clients to access their funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The substantial interest earned on these accounts mostly
benefit and enrich the insurers at the expense of the families
to whom the money really belongs,&#8221; Cuomo said in a statement
last month. &#8220;Beneficiaries are not adequately informed by the
insurers of the details of these accounts including the fact
that the insurers are making huge profits at the expense of the
grieving family.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG, the bailed-out insurer, said it will cooperate with
Cuomo, as did Hartford, Connecticut-based Aetna and Carmel,
Indiana-based CNO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Aetna believes that its checkbook program provides a
valuable service to our beneficiaries,&#8221; Michener said.
Employers sponsoring group life benefits programs through Aetna
&#8220;appreciate the convenience, immediate access to funds, and
additional interest that the checkbook program provides.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG &#8220;will assist with Mr. Cuomo&#8217;s examination, as is our
standard practice,&#8221; said Mark Herr, a spokesman for the New
York-based insurer. CNO, previously known as Conseco Inc.,
&#8220;will, in fact, respond to the request,&#8221; said Tony Zehnder,
spokesman for the insurer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lincoln&#8217;s Laurel O&#8217;Brien didn&#8217;t return messages seeking
comment. Lincoln has about $800 million in retained-asset
accounts, company executives said in a July 29 conference call. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PG Must Pay Former Wella Shareholders More, Court Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Procter  Gamble Co., the world&#8217;s largest consumer-products
company, was ordered by a Frankfurt court to increase payments
to former shareholders of its Wella unit by 23 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PG must pay 16.97 euros more per preferred share and 16.46
euros more per common share to minority investors who were
bought out in 2005, Judge Michael Mueller ruled in a commercial-
court decision on Aug. 4 that was released Aug. 17. The decision
may cost PG at least 230 million euros ($295 million), a lawyer
for the investors said. PG plans an appeal, spokeswoman Petra
Popall said by phone, declining to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shareholders are challenging as too low the 72.86 euros
a share that PG offered in April 2004 as the Cincinnati-based
company moved to buy full control of the hair-care products
maker. The figure was less than the 92.25 euros a share PG paid
the Stroeher family, who held 78 percent of Darmstadt, Germany-
based Wella&#8217;s voting rights, in March 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I am very confident that we would repeat this success&#8221;
should the U.S. company appeal the ruling, Peter Dreier, a
lawyer at the Dreier Riedel Rechtsanwaelte law firm representing
Wella minority shareholders, said yesterday in a phone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Procter  Gamble faces a minimum payment of 230 million
euros, based on the 13 million shares held by the investors who
filed suit plus legal costs, Dreier said. PG must file any
appeal in two weeks, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aquarius Settles Five-Year Mining Contract Dispute &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aquarius Platinum Ltd., the fourth-largest producer of the
metal, settled a five-year contract dispute with Moolman Mining,
a unit of Aveng Ltd.&#8217;s engineering division, by paying 86.8
million rand ($12 million). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The settlement amount represents a payment for work
actually done by Moolman Mining&#8221; at South Africa&#8217;s Marikana
mine, Aquarius said yesterday in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company canceled an open-cast mining contract with
Moolman at Marikana in December 2005, saying there was
&#8220;misrepresentation&#8221; in the foreign-exchange component of the
agreement, according to the statement. Aquarius later withdrew a
claim for damages while retaining a claim for costs. Moolman
filed four counterclaims for 486.3 million rand, withdrawn in
June this year, Aquarius said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Wilmot, managing director of Moolman, wasn&#8217;t
immediately available for comment when Bloomberg News called. &lt;/p&gt;

note said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philippine lawmakers may sanction a
colleague who&#8217;s facing trial in Hong Kong for drug possession,
House Speaker Feliciano Belmonte said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ilocos Sur Representative Ronald Singson was granted bail
of HK$1 million ($129,000) at Tsuen Wan District Court yesterday,
the Philippine Daily Inquirer reported on its website. Singson
was arrested a month ago at Hong Kong International Airport
carrying 6.7 grams of cocaine and two tablets of Valium, Romero
Quimbo, vice chairman of the House of Representatives justice
committee said by phone from Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quimbo had been dispatched to Hong Kong to observe the
court hearing and determine the facts of the case and will
report to an ethics committee to rule on the incident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we can just close our eyes to the fact that
all of this happened,&#8221; Belmonte said in an interview with ANC
News Channel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singson, 41, is the son of Ilocos Sur Governor Luis
&#8221;Chavit&#8221; Singson, who in 2000 accused former President Joseph Estrada of receiving protection money from gambling operators,
eventually leading to Estrada&#8217;s ouster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case against Singson is due to begin Sept. 7, according
to Sherlin Fu, an information officer at the Department of
Justice. Singson was initially charged with drug trafficking,
according to a document at the Hong Kong court. That was reduced
after chemical analysis showed the 26.1 grams of white powder
found in his possession contained only 6.7 grams of cocaine,
Quimbo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singson also produces pop concerts, including one by Usher
in Manila July 9. The U.S. singer was due to perform in Macau on
July 13 and Singson was traveling there, ABS-CBN News reported,
citing his father. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ronald Singson, in a telephone interview aired today on
ABS-CBN, said he hopes people won&#8217;t pass judgment as the case is
ongoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The House is seriously looking at this matter and the
implication it has on the reputation of the institution,&#8221;
Quimbo said by phone from Hong Kong. &#8220;This matter is
unprecedented. It&#8217;s the first time that a member of the House is
indicted and incarcerated outside of the Philippine territory.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia&#8217;s King Abdullah named
David O&#8217;Reilly, who built Chevron Corp. into the world&#8217;s fourth-
largest publicly traded oil company, to be a board member at
state-run Saudi Aramco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Reilly, Chevron&#8217;s chairman and chief executive officer
for a decade, will serve a three-year term on oil producer
Aramco&#8217;s board, according to a statement posted on the website
of the official Saudi Press Agency yesterday. King Abdullah also
confirmed Khalid Al-Falih as Aramco&#8217;s president and CEO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Aramco, the world&#8217;s largest crude exporter, completed
a development plan last year to boost oil production capacity to
more than 12 million barrels a day. Saudi Arabia, the largest
producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,
is only generating about 8.3 million barrels a day after the
group agreed on production cuts in December 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amin Nasser, Aramco&#8217;s senior vice president for exploration
and production, will become a director and James W. Kinnear, a
former Texaco Inc. chief executive officer, stands down from the
board. Saudi Oil Minister Ali Al-Naimi will continue to serve as
board chairman and Finance Minister Ibrahim al-Assaf also
remains a director, according to the announcement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s cancer treatment
Sutent failed in a large-scale study to improve overall survival
in patients with a form of lung cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug, when combined with Roche AG&#8217;s Tarceva, improved
the length of time patients lived without their tumor
progressing, though that didn&#8217;t translate into an overall
benefit in survival when compared with Tarceva alone, the New
York-based company said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sutent was approved in 2006 to treat cancer of the kidneys
and digestive tract by chocking off a tumor&#8217;s blood supply.
Researchers from Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker,
theorized the drug would show similar effects in other tumor
types and began studying it in a wide range of cancers. Since
its approval, Sutent has failed to show a benefit in cancer of
the liver, breast, and colon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe that the statistically significant improvement
in progression free survival is an important finding,&#8221; said
Mace Rothenberg, vice president of clinical development and
medical affairs for cancer at Pfizer, in the statement. &#8220;Over
the next few months, we will conduct an in-depth analysis to
gain further insight into these results and determine whether we
can identify one or more subgroups of non-small cell lung cancer
patients for a future trial in either previously untreated or
recurrent disease.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further Analysis &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said it will analyze the results to see if there
were any subgroups of patients who may have benefited. The
drugmaker is continuing to study Sutent for certain types of
prostate cancer and kidney cancer, the statement said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s study was from the final stages of testing required
to get U.S. approval for treating advanced non-small cell lung
cancer. In the study, Pfizer looked at the effects of Sutent in
combination with Tarceva in about 900 previously treated
patients. The company started the study in September 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lung cancer killed 159,000 people in the U.S. last year and
219,000 new cases were diagnosed, according to the National
Cancer Institute. About 85 percent of people with lung cancer
will die within five years of being diagnosed because the
disease usually isn&#8217;t caught until its late stages and there are
few effective treatments, according to the American Cancer
Society. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said it plans to release the full results of the
study, called SUN-1087, in October at the European Society for
Medical Oncology Congress in Italy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A California man accused of leaking
Walt Disney Co.&#8217;s earnings information pleaded guilty to
conspiracy and wire fraud in Manhattan federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yonni Sebbag, 30, and his girlfriend, Bonnie Hoxie, the
former assistant to Disney corporate communications chief Zenia Mucha, were arrested in California on May 26 for leaking
confidential stock tips about the entertainment company&#8217;s
earnings. Sebbag has been jailed since his arrest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;From March 2010 to May 26, 2010, I agreed with others to
commit securities fraud and wire fraud,&#8221; Sebbag told U.S.
Magistrate Judge James Cott in Manhattan today. &#8220;I disclosed
material, non-public information about the Walt Disney Company
to outside investors,&#8221; he said, adding later, &#8220;I transmitted
via electronic mail that material, non-public information.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sebbag, who is a Moroccan citizen, faces deportation and a
prison term of as long as 33 months in prison when he is
sentenced by U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones, Cott said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors say Sebbag sent letters in March to at least 33
investment companies, including hedge funds, offering to sell
confidential information about Burbank, California-based Disney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 11, an undercover agent with the Federal Bureau of
Investigation began reaching out to the pair, according to a
criminal information filed in New York. On May 8, the two gave
undercover FBI agents internal Disney documents, according to
the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the funds acted on the tips, a person familiar with
the matter said. Disney said it cooperated with prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wire Fraud &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charge of wire fraud carries a statutory term of as
long as 20 years in prison, Cott said today. As part of his
guilty plea, Sebbag also agreed to forfeit the $15,000 he
received from the undercover FBI agent as part of a scheme. The
government said the evidence against Sebbag included audiotape
and videotaped evidence of Sebbag soliciting the FBI agent who
was posing as a hedge fund manager. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His lawyer, Steven Kartagener, said his client isn&#8217;t
cooperating with prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Sebbag has come forward and accepted full
responsibility for his misconduct,&#8221; Kartagener said in an
interview after court. &#8220;The foundation of this guilty plea was
a fair basis to go forward and ultimately resolve this matter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cott set a Nov. 16 court date in the case. No sentencing
date has been set by Judge Jones, Cott said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Criminal charges are pending are pending against Hoxie, who
remains free on bail. Her lawyer, Robert Baum, couldn&#8217;t be
immediately be reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Hoxie, 10-mag-01113, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yonni Sebbag, accused of attempting
to leak Walt Disney Co. earnings information, will plead guilty
to criminal charges, his lawyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sebbag&#8217;s lawyer, Steven Kartagener, said that his client
will plead guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud and
conspiracy to commit wire fraud before a federal magistrate
today in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Sebbag has accepted responsibility for his misconduct
and I&#8217;m pleased the case has been resolved as it has been,&#8221;
Kartagener said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sebbag and his girlfriend, Bonnie Hoxie, were arrested in
California on May 26 for allegedly attempting to sell
information about the entertainment company&#8217;s earnings. Sebbag

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Icecek AS, a bottler of
coke drinks in Turkey and adjacent countries, said profit in the
second quarter more than halved as margins narrowed and revenue
per unit fell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income at Coca-Cola Icecek was 73.8 million liras
($48.6 million) compared with 151.8 million liras in the second
quarter of last year, the company said in a filing with the
Istanbul Stock Exchange today. Profit was expected to be 80.6
million liras, according to the average estimate of seven
analysts in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales rose an annual 8.9 percent to 811.4 million liras,
the company said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merck  Co. sued Impax Laboratories
Inc. to prevent U.S. sales of a generic version of the
cholesterol drug Vytorin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impax, based in Hayward, California, is seeking U.S. Food
and Drug Administration approval to sell a copy of Vytorin.
Merck and its Schering-Plough unit sought to block approval by
filing a patent-infringement lawsuit Aug. 19 in federal court in
New Jersey, Impax said in a statement Aug. 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck acquired full rights to Vytorin with its $50 billion
purchase of Schering-Plough Corp. last year. Global 2009 sales
of the drug were $2.1 billion, Whitehouse Station, New Jersey-
based Merck said Feb. 16. Vytorin combines the compound
ezetimibe that&#8217;s in Merck&#8217;s Zetia with simvastatin, the active
ingredient in Zocor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck has also sued Mylan Inc. and Teva Pharmaceutical
Industries Ltd., the world&#8217;s biggest generic-drug maker, to
prevent them from selling a copy of Vytorin until a patent
expires in 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients Should Stay with Pfizer&#8217;s Patented Lipitor, Study Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switching to a generic cholesterol-lowering drug from
Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s patented Lipitor raised heart disease rates, a
study of Dutch patients found. Lipitor, the top-selling drug in
the world, is set to lose patent protection next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers used a simulation to predict that 22 percent of
patients taking a generic copy of Merck  Co.&#8217;s Zocor would
develop heart disease during a 20-year period, compared with 20
percent of those on Lipitor, according an abstract of the study
posted on the website of the European Society of Cardiology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prescribing Lipitor is &#8220;sound from a health economic
perspective,&#8221; the Dutch researchers said in the abstract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors in the Netherlands have been required to justify
prescribing brand-name cholesterol medicines since January 2009,
the researchers from Pfizer and the University of Melbourne in
Australia said. The study took into account that some patients
were switched to the generic drug at a dose that wasn&#8217;t
equivalent to the brand-name Pfizer cholesterol pill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study will be presented at the European Society of
Cardiology conference set to start Aug. 28 in Stockholm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Seeks Patent on Enhanced Security for Electronic Devices &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc., maker of the iPad and iPhone, is seeking a
patent on a method of excluding unauthorized users for portable
electronic devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Application 20100208821, published in the database of the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Aug. 19, is for a system that
can bar access to the device to those who fail to meet
predetermined criteria. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The identity of the authorized person can be confirmed by
comparing it to stored data in the device, either the person&#8217;s
facial appearance, the voice or the heartbeat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method of identification can help prevent others from
using credit card numbers, passwords, social security number,
bank information or other personal data stored in the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The device can also detect suspicious behavior, such as
entering an incorrect password a predetermined number of times
in a row. According to the application, &#8220;jailbreaking,&#8221; -- the
unlocking of the operating system to permit downloading of
applications not approved by Apple -- also constitutes
suspicious behavior. In July the Librarian of Congress said
jailbreaking doesn&#8217;t violate copyright protections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When suspicious behavior is detected, the technology
covered by the application enables the device to collect
information related to the unauthorized use, including the
device&#8217;s location, and transmit it to what is definite as a
&#8220;responsible party.&#8221; This information could come in the shape
of a message such as &#8220;Warning, your electronic device may have
been stolen.&#8221; Such data could be sent to a social media or blog
application. The device can also be disabled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple, based in Cupertino, California, applied for this
patent in February, 2009, with the assistance of New York&#8217;s
Kramer Levin Naftalis  Frankel LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;University of Illinois Top Undergraduate Source of Patent Bar &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of Illinois is the leading school where
members of the patent bar received their undergraduate degrees,
according to a study done by three law school professors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professors Thomas G. Field Jr. and Jon R. Cavicchi of the
the Franklin Pierce Law Center, and Ralph D. Clifford of the
University of Massachusetts analyzed patent-bar applications
submitted to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, according to
the Patently-O Blog written by Professor Dennis Crouch from the
University of Missouri School of Law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study looks at patent attorneys registered through May
2006 and ranks the schools by the numbers of their graduates
that have applied to be admitted to the patent bar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other top-nine schools are, in order, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, University of Michigan, Cornell
University,  University of California at Berkeley, Purdue
University, University of Texas, University of Wisconsin,
University of Maryland and University of Wisconsin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applicants who wish to be admitted to the patent bar
generally need to have an undergraduate degree in science or
engineering. The study, which also argues that the Patent Office
should consider a degree in computer science an appropriate
background for admission to the patent bar, was published in the
North Carolina Journal of Law and Technology. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Righthaven Accused of Misconduct; Says it Sues to Save Newspaper &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Righthaven LLC, the Las Vegas entity that has filed more
than 95 copyright infringement suits since March 2010 against
websites that have posted stories from the Las Vegas Review-
Journal, was accused of legal misconduct by one of the companies
it sued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realty One Group Inc., a Las Vegas-based real estate firm,
was sued for infringement in June 2010. Righthaven said the firm
infringed the newspaper&#8217;s copyright by posting on a website an
article about housing sales that was published originally in the
newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a July 29 court filing, counsel for Reality One
responded, saying Righthaven is committing the form of legal
misconduct known as barratry, which is defined by Black&#8217;s Law
Dictionary as &#8220;the offense of frequently exciting and stirring
up quarrels and suits.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realty One claimed that Righthaven buys the copyright to a
Review-Journal article after the alleged infringement occurs,
and &#8220;likely purchases the copyright with the specific intention
of pursuing this action.&#8221; The posting of the Review-Journal
article, in any case, fell within copyright law&#8217;s &#8220;fair use&#8221;
doctrine, Realty One said in its posting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Righthaven responded in an Aug. 16 filing, saying its
pursuit of the copyright infringement claim &#8220;is well-founded
both in fact and in law, and is entirely devoid of illegality or
transgression.&#8221; The posting of the article on the blog wasn&#8217;t
fair use, Righthaven said, and it &#8220;materially impaired the
value of and potential market for the work.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response also addressed the fiscal crisis presently
affecting the newspaper industry. &#8220;It is no secret that
newspapers across the country are in distress as readership
numbers of drastically declined,&#8221; Righthaven said. Newspapers
&#8220;must be protected in light of the aggregate effect of
Internet-based copyright infringement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Righthaven then laid out its strategy, saying it has begun
&#8220;a systematic, well-founded approach directed towards stemming
the tide of Internet-based infringements, and protecting the
potential market for, and value of, the tide of Internet-based
infringements.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other newspapers are &#8220;prudently beginning to adopt the
Righthaven approach,&#8221; Righthaven said in its filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Last Vegas Review-sun is owned by Stephens Inc.&#8217;s
Stephens Media Group unit. The media group, based in Las Vegas,
published newspapers in Arkansas, Hawaii, Nevada, Missouri,
North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and Washington state,
according to the Columbia Journalism Review. Additionally, it
operates the CasinoGaming.com website, and a number of websites
associated with its various newspaper holdings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realty One and two named defendants associated with Reality
one are represented by Sergio Salzano of Las Vegas-based Lynch,
Hopper  Salzano LLP. Righthaven is represented by Steven A.
Gibson and J. Charles Coons, who are both in-house counsel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Righthaven LLC v. Realty One Group Inc., 2:10-
cv-01036-LRH-PAL, U.S. District Court, District of Nevada (Las
Vegas). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time Warner Seeks to Ban &#8216;Harry Popper&#8217; Condom Packaging &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time Warner Inc.&#8217;s Warner Brothers Entertainment unit filed
a trademark infringement suit in Switzerland against a Swiss
condom maker, United Press International reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company objects to the packaging for the &#8220;Harry
Popper&#8221; condom made by Magic X, the wire service reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for Magic X insisted the condom -- whose packaging
shows a humanoid condom wearing round glasses and waving a magic
wand -- &#8220;has nothing to do with Harry Potter,&#8221; according to
UPI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case will be heard by the Cantonal Court in Schwyz,
Switzerland, which will decide if the packaging should be
banned, the wire service reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madonna Sued by Clothing Company Over &#8216;Material Girl&#8217; Mark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pop entertainer Madonna was sued for trademark infringement
by a California clothing company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L.A. Triumph Inc. of Cerritos, California, says it and its
predecessor have been selling a line of women&#8217;s clothing under
the trade name &#8220;Material Girl.&#8221;  The predecessor company -- OC
Mercantile Corp. -- registered a state trademark for the term in
1997 in California, according to the complaint filed Aug. 19 in
federal court in Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madonna&#8217;s line of &#8220;Material Girl&#8221; clothing, and an
associated website, which were introduced in 2010, infringe the
trademarks and cause confusion in the marketplace, L.A. Triumph
claims in its court filings. The company also objects to an
application filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in
December 2009 to register &#8220;Material Girl&#8221; as a trademark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L.A. Triumph claims because it used the mark first, Madonna
and her MGB Inc. company have no right to the trademark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It asked the court to declare it alone has the right to the
&#8220;Material Girl&#8221; mark for clothing, and that the pending
trademark application should be denied. The company also
requested money damages. It said it will add as defendants the
retailers that are selling Madonna&#8217;s clothing line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L.A. Triumph is represented by Christopher W. Arledge,
Imran Farooq Vakil, and Peter R. Afrasiabi of One LLP of Newport
Beach, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is L.A. Triumph Inc., v. Madonna Louise Veronica
Ciccone, 2:10-cv-06195-SJO-JC, U.S. District Court, Central
District of California (Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trademark Application Filed for &#8216;.Secure&#8217; by Wisconsin Company &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Wisconsin company has filed an application to register
&#8220;.secure&#8221; as a trademark, according to the database of the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application, filed by Asif LLC of Fitchburg, Wisconsin,
is for use of the term with domain-name registration services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008 the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
Numbers voted to allow new top-level domain names. These are
suffixes in web addresses such as &#8220;.com,&#8221; &#8220;.org,&#8221; and
&#8220;.edu.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other top-level domain names already in use are &#8220;.jobs,&#8221;
&#8220;.travel,&#8221; and &#8220;.biz.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks declined, sending the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index to a seven-week low, as a record
plunge in home sales cast further doubt on the viability of the
economic recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boeing Co., Alcoa Inc. and Caterpillar Inc. lost at least
2.7 percent to lead declines in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average. Dell Inc. tumbled 3 percent amid reports it will
increase its offer for 3Par Inc. Pfizer Inc. dropped 1.7 percent
after its cancer treatment Sutent failed to improve overall
survival in patients with a form of lung cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 tumbled 1.5 percent to 1,051.87 as of 4 p.m. in
New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated 133.96
points, or 1.3 percent, to 10,040.45 after earlier falling as
low as 9,991. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The big shock is the housing numbers,&#8221; said Bruce McCain, who oversees $25 billion as chief investment strategist
at the private-banking unit of KeyCorp in Cleveland. &#8220;We
probably should have expected that because the housing market
has given a number of signs of weakness up to this point. We
knew the incentive pulled forward quite a bit of demand. When
you see the number in print it&#8217;s always a bit of a shock.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 has fallen 14 percent from its 2010 high on
April 23 as reports on U.S. jobs and manufacturing pointed to a
slowdown and the Federal Reserve said a recovery may take longer
than expected. The decline has pushed the gauge&#8217;s valuation to
14 times its companies&#8217; reported earnings, the lowest level in
about six weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home Sales &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s losses came after the National Association of
Realtors said sales of U.S. previously owned homes plunged 27.2
percent to a 3.83 million annual rate in July. The pace compares
with the median forecast of a 4.65 million rate and 13.4 percent
decline, according to a Bloomberg News survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dell fell 3 percent to $11.59. The company is readying a
sweetened offer for data-storage provider 3Par after its earlier
bid was bested by a $1.6 billion proposal by Hewlett-Packard
Co., according to a person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offer may be sent in the coming days, said the person,
who declined to be identified because the plans aren&#8217;t public.
Last week, Dell had agreed to pay about $1.15 billion. It
couldn&#8217;t be determined how much Dell planned to boost its price.
HP said yesterday it&#8217;s willing to pay more than twice what
3Par&#8217;s shares were worth before Dell&#8217;s bid was announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global announced mergers and acquisitions have totaled $1.3
trillion so far this year, up 23 percent from the same time last
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Bright Spot&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think there&#8217;s a bright spot around the Labor Day
corner,&#8221; Dick Grasso, former chief executive officer of the New
York Stock Exchange from 1995 to 2003, said today on Bloomberg
Television&#8217;s &#8220;In Business With Margaret Brennan.&#8221;
&#8220;Corporations have a record amount of cash, you&#8217;re starting to
see targeted strategic acquisitions, you&#8217;re starting to see
private equity firms come in and make bids.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer lost 1.7 percent to $15.82. The cancer treatment
Sutent failed in a large-scale study to improve overall survival
in patients with a form of lung cancer. The drug, when combined
with Roche AG&#8217;s Tarceva, improved the length of time patients
lived without their tumor progressing, though that didn&#8217;t
translate into an overall benefit in survival when compared with
Tarceva alone, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Device Makers Slip &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medtronic Inc. helped drag health-care stocks to the
second-biggest retreat among 10 groups in the SP 500, falling
11 percent to $31.21, the biggest drop in the gauge. The world&#8217;s
largest maker of heart devices lowered its fiscal-year 2011
adjusted earnings forecast to $3.45 to $3.53 a share from $3.54
to $3.64 a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other medical device makers also slipped, sending the SP
500 Health Care Equipment  Services Index down the second-most
of 24 industry groups. Stryker Corp. dropped 6.4 percent to
$43.20 and Zimmer Holdings Inc. fell 4.9 percent to $46.97. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freeport-McMoRan Copper  Gold Inc. declined 4.7 percent to
$67.05, helping drag materials stocks to the biggest loss of 10
industry groups in the SP 500. The world&#8217;s second-largest
copper producer was cut to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;overweight&#8221; at
HSBC Holdings Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SanDisk Corp. fell 6 percent to $38.27, the third-biggest
drop in the SP 500. The largest maker of flash-memory cards
declined after Pacific Crest Securities Inc. said its share
price was &#8220;unwarranted,&#8221; given that NAND memory prices may
plunge in coming months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xerox Corp. declined 3.9 percent to $8.46. The world&#8217;s
largest maker of high-speed color printers won final approval
for the $69 million settlement of a shareholder lawsuit
challenging its $6 billion takeover of Affiliated Computer
Services Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homebuilders, Utilities Rally &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homebuilder stocks rose after Citigroup Inc. said today
marks the end of the tax-credit-skewed housing data and
continued to recommend investors &#8220;go long some homebuilder
exposure.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With investor expectations very low, homebuilder stocks
at the low end of their valuation range and housing headline
risk likely abating over the next few days, we think the risk-
reward profile is more favorably skewed,&#8221; New York-based
Citigroup analyst Josh Levin wrote in a note to clients today.
Meritage Homes Corp. climbed 3 percent to $16.87. KB Home jumped
2.5 percent to $10.04. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of utilities companies advanced after Standard 
Poor&#8217;s upgraded the sector to &#8220;market weight&#8221; from
&#8220;underweight,&#8221; citing weakening U.S. economic growth
projections and slumping expectations for consumer spending as
causes for investors to buy defensive stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Southern Co. rose the most in the SP 500, jumping 1.5
percent to $36.42. Ameren Corp. had the third-biggest gain in
the gauge, increasing 1.4 percent to $28.04. PGE Corp. climbed
1.2 percent to $46.73. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve will probably
ease monetary policy further as the U.S. economy weakens, said
Jan Hatzius, chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in
New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Fed will eventually move to additional monetary
stimulus via asset purchases or other unconventional measures,&#8221;
Hatzius said in a radio interview today with Tom Keene on
&#8220;Bloomberg Surveillance.&#8221; Should the Fed opt for more
securities purchases, he said, there is &#8220;no point in doing
anything less than&#8221; $1 trillion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed policy makers on Aug. 10 made their first attempt to
bolster the economy in more than a year, saying they will
maintain their holdings of securities at $2.05 trillion to
prevent money from draining out of the financial system. The
Federal Open Market Committee, in its statement, said &#8220;the pace
of recovery in output and employment has slowed in recent
months.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of previously owned U.S. homes slumped 27 percent in
July, the National Association of Realtors said today in a
report that pointed to further weakening of the economy.
Hatzius, speaking before the home-sales data, predicted gross
domestic product will expand at a 1.5 percent annual pace in the
second half of the year, and unemployment will rise to 10
percent next year from 9.5 percent currently. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghana may face damage to its
&#8220;reputation as a safe haven for Western investment&#8221; after
Kosmos Energy LLC&#8217;s cancellation of a deal with Exxon Mobil
Corp. to sell its oil stake in the country, said forecaster
Exclusive Analysis Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closely held, Dallas-based Kosmos, which had previously
focused on exploration, will become an oil producer when pumping
begins at the offshore Jubilee field by the end of year, the
company said Aug. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country&#8217;s credibility for investors &#8220;is likely to be
hampered by this development,&#8221; Natznet Tesfay, a forecaster in
London-based Exclusive&#8217;s Africa division, said in a phone
interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic growth, which according to the African Development
Bank averaged 6 percent annually over the past five years,
helped lure investors with projects worth $662.7 million during
the second quarter of this year, a sixfold surge from 2009, the
Ghana Investment Promotion Center said July 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kosmos announcement ended a $4 billion sale and
purchase agreement with Exxon for Kosmos&#8217;s Ghanaian assets,
including Jubilee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ghana said after the deal was announced in October that it
wanted to purchase Kosmos&#8217;s stake through state-owned Ghana
National Petroleum Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Asian Players&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The way the whole thing has been handled has created the
perception that the country may turn east to Asian players,&#8221;
said Sebastian Spio-Garbrah, an analyst with New York-based
DaMina Advisors, in a phone interview Aug. 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state-run oil company may look to buy Kosmos&#8217;s share
with financing from a Chinese company such as Cnooc Ltd.,
China&#8217;s largest offshore oil explorer, Spio-Garbrah said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nana Boakye Asafu-Adjaye, Ghana National&#8217;s managing
director, declined to comment when reached by phone Aug. 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ghana had accused Kosmos of violating the terms of its
agreement with the company, allegations the company denied.
Energy Ministry spokesman Edward Bawa said Aug. 18 that the
cancellation of the sale was not related to the state-owned oil
company&#8217;s desire to purchase Kosmos&#8217;s stake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The government of Ghana has not done anything to
discourage any investor from investing in Ghana,&#8221; Bawa said in
a phone interview yesterday. &#8220;Companies that have come to this
country and have followed and respected the laws governing their
activities have always had terms of their agreements well-
respected.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KfW Group, Germany&#8217;s development
bank that bailed out IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG, said it has
received $150 million that Goldman Sachs Group Inc. agreed to
pay to IKB in a settlement with U.S. regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KfW got the money &#8220;in the past days,&#8221; Nathalie Druecke, a
spokeswoman for Frankfurt-based KfW, said by telephone today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, based in New York, agreed to pay $550
million to settle U.S. regulatory claims that it misled
investors over collateralized debt obligations linked to
subprime mortgages, the Securities and Exchange Commission said
last month. As part of the settlement, the bank agreed to pay a
$300 million fine and $250 million in restitution to investors,
including IKB and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IKB spokesman Patrick von der Ehe has said a unit of
Rhineland Funding, IKB&#8217;s former investment vehicle, bought the
Goldman Sachs securities. Rhineland Funding ran out of money
amid the global credit crunch in 2007, forcing KfW to assume 8.1
billion euros of IKB&#8217;s financing obligations to prevent a
collapse of the lender. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An appeals court refused to
reconsider a decision compelling the Federal Reserve Board to
release documents identifying banks that might have failed
without the U.S. government bailout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full U.S. Court of Appeals in New York, denied a May 4
request by the Fed to review a three-judge panel&#8217;s unanimous
March 19 decision requiring the agency to release records of the
unprecedented $2 trillion U.S. loan program. The full court&#8217;s
ruling was contained in a docket entry dated Aug. 20, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless the court stays its decision, the Fed will have
seven days to disclose the documents. In the event of a stay,
the central bank and the Clearing House Association LLC, an
organization of 20 commercial banks that joined the Fed in
defense of the lawsuit, will have 90 days to petition the U.S.
Supreme Court to consider their appeal. The Clearing House has
already said it will ask the high court to rule on the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are reviewing the decision and considering our options
for appeal,&#8221; said David Skidmore, a Fed spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At issue are 231 &#8220;term sheets&#8221; documenting Fed loans to
financial firms during 2008. The records, which include the
banks&#8217; names, the amounts borrowed and the collateral posted in
return, were originally requested by late Bloomberg News
reporter Mark Pittman through the Freedom of Information Act,
which allows citizens access to government papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The March appeals court ruling upheld a decision of a
lower-court judge in Manhattan who in August 2009 ordered that
the information be released. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bloomberg LP v. Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System, 09-04083, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals (New York). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lehman Made &#8216;Best Deal It Could&#8217; in Barclays Brokerage Sale &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. made &#8220;the best deal it
could&#8221; when it sold its brokerage to Barclays Plc in &#8220;one of
the most uncertain weeks in financial market history,&#8221; a former
Lehman restructuring executive told a judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Lehman was the largest broker-dealer to go bankrupt in
history,&#8221; said Mark Shapiro, who worked on the deal with former
Lehman President Herbert &#8220;Bart&#8221; McDade. &#8220;The absence of a
sale would have led to near-term liquidation and a piecemeal
sale for much less.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shapiro, now a Barclays restructuring executive, was
yesterday&#8217;s first witness in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan
as the London-based bank defended itself against Lehman&#8217;s claim
that it should pay as much as $11 billion for an allegedly
undisclosed &#8220;windfall&#8221; on the defunct brokerage. The deal,
approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck, closed a week
after Lehman&#8217;s Sept. 15, 2008, bankruptcy, the biggest in U.S.
history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nonjury trial, which resumed yesterday after a summer
holiday, pits the U.K.&#8217;s third-biggest bank, represented by
lawyer David Boies, against Lehman, which wants money from
Barclays to pay creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The money would help Lehman creditors, who may recoup only
15 cents to 44 cents on the dollar, Lehman has said, and hurt
Barclays, which made 2.4 billion pounds ($3.7 billion) in the
first half. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shapiro told the judge that Lehman, in the days before the
bankruptcy filing, focused on listing assets it &#8220;had to sell&#8221;
as part of the brokerage business. Lehman fought with Barclays
over the price for its New York headquarters building, boosting
it to about $1 billion, and slashed a $250 million breakup fee
demanded by Barclays in case the deal fell apart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Lehman assets had no fixed valuations as the markets
declined, Shapiro said. Preparing to sell a portfolio of
securities to Barclays, Lehman wasn&#8217;t even sure what it could
deliver as lenders seized collateral and trading partners closed
out trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other assets Barclays bought, such as intellectual property
and securities indexes, had only &#8220;scrap value&#8221; to Lehman as a
liquidating firm, although they could be valuable to Barclays as
an operating business, Shapiro said. Liabilities that Barclays
assumed, such as contracts, also couldn&#8217;t be fixed, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We didn&#8217;t have precise numbers,&#8221; Shapiro said under
questioning by Boies. &#8220;We categorized things but we had no
specific numbers for many things.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-
13555, and Giddens v. Barclays Capital Inc., 09-01732, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Funding of Embryonic Stem Cell Research Halted &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal judge yesterday halted U.S. funding of embryonic
stem cell research approved by President Barack Obama. U.S.
District Judge Royce Lamberth in Washington ruled that the work
violates a law passed to bar the destruction of human embryos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge issued an order temporarily stopping the U.S.
Health  Human Services Department and the National Institutes
for Health from conducting the studies. The judge cited the
still-in-force 1996 Dickey-Wicker Amendment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The language of the statute reflects the unambiguous
intent of Congress to enact a broad prohibition of funding
research in which a human embryo is destroyed,&#8221; Lamberth said
in a 15-page decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama in March 2009 reversed an executive order of former
President George W. Bush that limited stem cell research to
about 20 existing lines of embryonic cells. Obama&#8217;s order
allowed research on cells derived from embryos that would
otherwise be disposed of after in vitro fertilization
procedures. Lamberth said the administration was attempting to
separate the derivation of the embryonic stem cells from
research on them, and &#8220;the two cannot be separated.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Simply because embryonic stem cell research involves
multiple steps does not mean that each step is a separate &#8216;piece
of research&#8217; that may be federally funded,&#8221; Lamberth wrote.
&#8220;If one step or &#8216;piece of research&#8217; of an embryonic stem cell
research project results in the destruction of an embryo, the
entire project&#8221; is barred from getting federal funds, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama&#8217;s directive said the National Institutes of Health
could &#8220;support and conduct responsible, scientifically worthy
human stem cell research&#8221; using embryonic cells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Sherely v. Sebelius, 09-cv-1575, U.S. District
Court for the District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GE Fails to Get Mitsubishi Antitrust Claims Dismissed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Electric Co. failed to win dismissal of allegations
brought by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. that it seeks to
monopolize U.S. sales of wind turbines through litigation,
intimidation and fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge J. Leon Holmes in Fayetteville,
Arkansas, yesterday denied GE&#8217;s request to dismiss the antitrust
lawsuit. The judge granted GE&#8217;s request to halt the case until
the company&#8217;s patent-infringement claims against Mitsubishi,
which the Japanese company has characterized as &#8220;sham&#8221;
litigation, have been resolved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If GE prevails in any of the infringement actions, then
Mitsubishi&#8217;s claims in this action will be moot because GE will
have the right to exclude Mitsubishi from the market,&#8221; Holmes
said in his decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitsubishi is seeking damages that might exceed $1 billion
in the lawsuit filed in May. The Tokyo-based company accuses GE
of embarking on an anticompetitive scheme to drive Mitsubishi&#8217;s
suppliers out of the U.S. market. The lawsuit, which focuses on
patent claims that GE first lodged against Mitsubishi in 2008,
escalated a dispute between the two industrial companies over
the growing U.S. market for wind turbines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitsubishi is planning to build a turbine-assembly factory
in Fort Smith, Arkansas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The judge did decide to stay discovery for the present,&#8221;
Sonia Williams, a spokeswoman for Mitsubishi Power Systems
America, said in a statement. &#8220;Nevertheless, we are heartened
by his suggestion that he may terminate the stay if he finds
appropriate circumstances.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan Nelson, a spokesman for Fairfield, Connecticut-based
GE, said in an e-mailed statement that the company strongly
disagrees with allegations it has monopolized any market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The court found it inappropriate to go forward with the
case and therefore stayed the case pending the outcome of GE&#8217;s
patent infringement cases,&#8221; Nelson said. &#8220;GE is confident that
the outcome of those cases will remove any doubts about the
meritless nature of MHI&#8217;s claims.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. v. General
Electric Co., 10-05087, U.S. District Court, Western District of
Arkansas (Fayetteville). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sebbag, Who Leaked Disney Earnings, Pleads Guilty to Conspiracy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A California man accused of leaking Walt Disney Co.&#8217;s
earnings information pleaded guilty to conspiracy and wire fraud
in Manhattan federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yonni Sebbag, 30, and his girlfriend, Bonnie Hoxie, the
former assistant to Disney corporate communications chief Zenia
Mucha, were arrested in California on May 26 for leaking
confidential stock tips about the entertainment company&#8217;s
earnings. Sebbag has been jailed since his arrest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;From March 2010 to May 26, 2010, I agreed with others to
commit securities fraud and wire fraud,&#8221; Sebbag told U.S.
Magistrate Judge James Cott in Manhattan yesterday. &#8220;I
disclosed material, non-public information about the Walt Disney
Co. to outside investors,&#8221; he said, adding later, &#8220;I
transmitted via electronic mail that material, non-public
information.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sebbag, who is a Moroccan citizen, faces deportation and a
prison term of as long as 33 months in prison when he is
sentenced by U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones, Cott said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors say Sebbag sent letters in March to at least 33
investment companies, including hedge funds, offering to sell
confidential information about Burbank, California-based Disney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 11, an undercover agent with the Federal Bureau of
Investigation began reaching out to the pair, according to a
criminal information filed in New York. On May 8, the two gave
undercover FBI agents internal Disney documents, according to
the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the funds acted on the tips, a person familiar with
the matter said. Disney said it cooperated with prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charge of wire fraud carries a statutory term of as
long as 20 years in prison, Cott said yesterday. As part of his
guilty plea, Sebbag also agreed to forfeit the $15,000 he
received from the undercover FBI agent as part of a scheme. The
government said the evidence against Sebbag included audiotape
and videotaped evidence of Sebbag soliciting the FBI agent who
was posing as a hedge fund manager. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His lawyer, Steven Kartagener, said his client isn&#8217;t
cooperating with prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Sebbag has come forward and accepted full
responsibility for his misconduct,&#8221; Kartagener said in an
interview after court. &#8220;The foundation of this guilty plea was
a fair basis to go forward and ultimately resolve this matter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cott set a Nov. 16 court date in the case. No sentencing
date has been set by Judge Jones, Cott said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Criminal charges are pending are pending against Hoxie, who
remains free on bail. Her lawyer, Robert Baum, couldn&#8217;t be
immediately reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Hoxie, 10-mag-01113, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capitol Investments Ex-Owner to Plead Guilty in Fraud Scheme &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevin Shapiro, the former owner of Capitol Investments USA
Inc. accused of leading an $880 million Ponzi scheme, is to
plead guilty, court papers showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shapiro, 41, of Miami Beach, Florida, is charged with
defrauding more than 60 investors in his bogus wholesale grocery
distribution business. He is accused of using new investors&#8217;
money to pay earlier ones, as well as to fund his lavish
lifestyle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said Shapiro stole $35 million to pay illegal
gambling debts and make payments on a $5.3 million house, a $1.5
million yacht, a Mercedes-Benz and seats to Miami Heat
basketball games. He also bought a pair of diamond-studded
handcuffs to give to a prominent professional athlete and
donated $150,000 to the University of Miami for an athletic
lounge, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shapiro, who pleaded not guilty on July 22, is scheduled
for a &#8220;plea agreement hearing&#8221; on Sept. 15 in federal court in
Newark, New Jersey, where he was indicted, according to an Aug.
20 court docket entry. The entry doesn&#8217;t specify what charges
Shapiro will admit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebekah Carmichael, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Paul
Fishman, declined to comment. Shapiro&#8217;s attorney, Maria E.
Perez, didn&#8217;t immediately return a call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shapiro was accused in a July 14 indictment of conspiracy,
securities fraud, two counts of wire fraud and two counts of
money laundering. The securities and wire fraud counts each
carry prison terms of as long as 20 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shapiro and his co-conspirators promised investors from
January 2005 to November 2009 that their money would fund his
grocery distribution business, according to the indictment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also sued
Shapiro. The agency, which estimated Shapiro raised about $900
million, said he used $769 million of incoming funds to pay
returns to earlier investors. The SEC wants him to forfeit ill-
gotten gains and pay unspecified fines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shapiro also paid $13 million in undisclosed commissions
and fees to individuals who attracted other investors, according
to the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. Shapiro, 10-cr-00471, U.S.
District Court, District of New Jersey (Newark). The SEC case is
Securities and Exchange Commission v. Nevin K. Shapiro, 10-cv-
21281, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida
(Miami). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jailed Apple Manager Devine Must Post $600,000 Bail, Judge Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Devine, the Apple Inc. manager jailed on charges that
he took kickbacks in exchange for company secrets, won&#8217;t be
released until he posts a bond of $600,000 and signs over funds
in his foreign accounts, a judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Magistrate Judge Howard Lloyd in San Jose, California,
said the unknown total of funds in foreign accounts makes him
&#8220;uneasy.&#8221; Lloyd also said Devine must grant the government
access to two safe deposit boxes after Assistant U.S. Attorney
Michelle Kane said they may contain &#8220;proceeds of the fraud.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kane told the judge agents found $150,000 in cash,
including some foreign notes, in shoeboxes during a search of
Devine&#8217;s home, and that the government wants to know what&#8217;s in
the security boxes before agreeing to his release on bond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We know about some accounts and some statements but not
statements for all the accounts we believe are out there,&#8221; Kane
told the judge, referring to bank statements found during the
search. &#8220;We&#8217;d ask that we be allowed to see what&#8217;s in those
safe deposit boxes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prosecutor and the judge agreed to Devine&#8217;s pledge that
the foreign funds will be transferred to a trust account for his
lawyers&#8217; firm, Berkeley, California-based Arguedas, Cassman 
Headley, and then posted to the court. Lloyd said Devine&#8217;s bail
must be secured by his and his mother&#8217;s homes and that his
brother will be responsible for $50,000 of the $600,000 bail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devine, 37, a global-supply manager, was accused of money
laundering and wire fraud in a 23-count indictment unsealed Aug.
13. He has pleaded not guilty to charges that he took at least
$1 million in kickbacks from Asian suppliers. Prosecutors
objected to his release on bail, arguing he is a flight risk,
which Devine denies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devine gave the suppliers of iPhone and iPod accessories
confidential data that helped them win better contracts from
Cupertino, California-based Apple in exchange for payments,
according to the indictment. Each count of wire fraud, wire
fraud conspiracy, and money laundering may bring a 20-year
prison sentence, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple hasn&#8217;t provided information on Devine&#8217;s employment
status since his arrest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack Gillund, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s office in
San Francisco, and Devine&#8217;s lawyer, Raphael Goldman, declined to
comment yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Devine, 10-cr-603, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of California (San Jose). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferson County to Get $25 Million From JPMorgan Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferson County, Alabama, will receive $25 million from a
fund set up by the Securities and Exchange Commission after it
settled last year with JPMorgan Chase  Co. in a probe of
derivatives sales to local officials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the terms of the settlement, JPMorgan agreed to pay
the county $50 million and wipe out $647 million in termination
fees it claimed the county owed in swap transactions. The
additional $25 million penalty paid by the bank, which has been
invested in short-term U.S. Treasury bills, was intended to
compensate &#8220;harmed investors and the county.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC said last week that Jefferson County suffered
&#8220;direct economic harm&#8221; and therefore should receive all of the
funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission alleged that JPMorgan, through former
managers Charles LeCroy and Douglas MacFaddin, paid $8.2 million
to local firms in exchange for naming JPMorgan to underwrite
bonds and engineer swap agreements awarded by the county in 2002
and 2003 to refinance debt on reconstruction and expansion of
its sewer system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan neither admitted nor denied the allegations. The
$3.2 billion debt incurred for repair of the sewer system has
put Alabama&#8217;s most populous county on the brink of bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In awarding the money only to the county, the SEC
determined that the interest rates the original bondholders
received weren&#8217;t affected by the payment scheme, and that harm
suffered by the investors was due to failure in the markets
unrelated to the bank&#8217;s actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The money will be awarded after a 30-day period for public
comment, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;URS Pays $52 Million to Settle Minnesota Bridge-Collapse Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;URS Corp., an engineering and construction company, agreed
to pay more than $52 million to settle claims that it failed to
spot problems with a Minnesota bridge that collapsed and killed
13 people three years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s insurers will pay the settlement, which
covers 145 people injured in the collapse of the Interstate 35W
bridge outside Minneapolis along with the families of those
killed, San Francisco-based URS officials said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m happy that the lawsuit has reached this conclusion,
but there&#8217;s no doubt in my mind that any of us would trade this
settlement for a bridge that was structurally safe in the first
place,&#8221; Garrett Ebling, a survivor of the collapse, said at a
news conference yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The August 2007 collapse of the 40-year-old bridge was one
of the worst U.S. bridge failures in the past 30 years,
according to environmentalgraffiti.com, which tracks such
disasters. The failure led to widespread concern over the safety
of U.S. bridges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;URS officials, hired by the state of Minnesota to assess
the safety of its bridges, didn&#8217;t know about a design flaw in
the structure that left it vulnerable to collapse, the company
said in the e-mailed statement. National Transportation Safety
Board officials found in 2008 that the bridge&#8217;s steel plates
weren&#8217;t hardy enough to handle traffic flow on the structure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe we have exposed exactly why the bridge fell,&#8221;
said Chris Messerly, a Minneapolis-based lawyer for the bridge
victims. He said victims are holding URS responsible for its
role in the collapse through the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We can&#8217;t directly change how corporate America conducts
its business and treats people,&#8221; Messerly said in an interview
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;URS officials said the settlement wasn&#8217;t an &#8220;admission of
liability or fault&#8221; on behalf of the engineering firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;URS believes it is in the best interest of the company
and its shareholders to resolve this matter and avoid the cost
and distraction of protracted litigation,&#8221; officials said in
the release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victims sued URS in state court in Minneapolis in 2009. The
case was set for trial in April. In March, URS agreed to pay $5
million to the state of Minnesota over its claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messerly said Judge Deborah Hedlund gave final approval to
the settlement Aug. 14 after the parties concluded negotiations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re I-35W Bridge Collapse Litigation, 27-cv-
09-16985, District Court of Hennepin County, Minnesota
(Minneapolis). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xe Services to Pay $42 Million to Settle U.S. Export Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. security company once known as Blackwater Worldwide
will pay the U.S. State Department $42 million to settle claims
about illegal weapons exports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xe Services LLC, based in Moyock, North Carolina, supplies
guards and trainers in areas of armed conflict. The company was
accused of 288 violations involving the unauthorized export of
defense articles and services to foreign end-users between 2003
and 2009, the State Department said yesterday in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alleged violations didn&#8217;t involve sensitive
technologies or cause a known harm to national security, the
State Department said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Wesleyan Investment Chief Sued by Connecticut &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Kannam, the former Wesleyan University Chief
Investment Officer was sued by Connecticut over using endowment
assets to benefit private investment groups he had ties with,
the state attorney general said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kannam didn&#8217;t disclose links to firms including Belstar
Group LLC, Vietnam Capital Partners LLC and Advanced Device
Technology Inc., Richard Blumenthal said yesterday in the
statement. Kannam &#8220;misused, at a minimum, tens of thousands of
dollars in university assets,&#8221; according to Blumenthal&#8217;s
office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wesleyan, ranked the 12th-best liberal-arts college in the
country by U.S. News  World Report magazine, sued Kannam in
Connecticut Superior Court on Nov. 24, saying he &#8220;defrauded the
university of thousands of dollars&#8221; and &#8220;engaged in outside
employment in breach of his duty of loyalty, his employment
agreement and the university&#8217;s conflict of interest policy.&#8221;
The Middletown, Connecticut, school, fired him in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wesleyan&#8217;s claims against Kannam are being heard by an
arbitrator, consistent with his employment agreement with the
school, his lawyer, Stephen Fitzgerald, said yesterday in a
phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s no need for the attorney general to file this,
what I call a &#8216;me too&#8217; lawsuit, on behalf of an institution as
large and powerful as Wesleyan,&#8221; Fitzgerald said. &#8220;Alumni,
faculty and students should also be distressed that the
university&#8217;s leadership has chosen to spend thousands of dollars
in legal fees on a case that will ultimately produce million-
dollar counterclaims against the school by those whose
reputations have been severely injured by Wesleyan&#8217;s reckless
allegations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blumenthal, who said in January he planned to review
Wesleyan&#8217;s complaint, will support Wesleyan&#8217;s suit against
Kannam, he said in yesterday&#8217;s statement. The Connecticut
lawsuit will also allow the state to pursue penalties under the
Solicitation of Charitable Funds Act, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wesleyan &#8220;shares the concerns expressed by Mr. Blumenthal
and we remain ready to help,&#8221; said David Pesci, a school
spokesman, who declined to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, Wesleyan named Anne Martin of Yale University&#8217;s
fund as its new chief investment officer. Martin oversaw venture
capital, energy and commodities investments at Yale&#8217;s fund, in
New Haven, Connecticut, according to a June 11 blog post by
Michael Roth, Wesleyan&#8217;s president. Wesleyan&#8217;s fund was valued
at $532 million as of March 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lexmark Seeks to Block Imports of Copycat Cartridges &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lexmark International Inc., the maker of laser and inkjet
printers, filed a patent-infringement claim with U.S. trade
officials to block what it calls copycat toner cartridges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lexmark cited 24 companies that it says make and sell
unauthorized replacement cartridges overseas. It filed a
complaint on Aug. 20 with the U.S. International Trade
Commission in Washington, which has the power to block imports
of products found to infringe U.S. patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selling printer supplies is Lexmark&#8217;s &#8220;profit engine,&#8221;
the Lexington, Kentucky-based company said in its most recent
annual report. Laser and inkjet supplies accounted for $2.75
billion in sales last year, or 71 percent of $3.88 billion in
revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has said that clones, counterfeits and
remanufactured cartridges can drive down prices, which may hurt
its financial results. Lexmark also filed a civil suit in
federal court in Cincinnati seeking cash compensation for the
infringement of 15 patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among companies included in the ITC complaint is Ninestar
Image International Ltd. of China, which also was named in a
patent case filed in June by Lexmark&#8217;s rival, Canon Inc., and
one filed last year by another competitor, Hewlett-Packard Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lexmark complaint is In the Matter of Toner Cartridges,
2750, U.S. International Trade Commission (Washington). The
civil suit is Lexmark International Inc. v. Ink Technologies
Printer Supplies LLC, 10cv564, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of Ohio (Cincinnati). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Docket &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama-Poster Copyright-Infringement Trial Is Set for March 21 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A March 21 trial is set in the copyright case between
artist Shepard Fairey and the Associated Press over an election
poster of Barack Obama Fairey made from an AP photo. He will
testify, his lawyers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein in Manhattan
yesterday also set a Dec. 17 deadline for Fairey and AP to file
motions for summary judgment, which if granted could make a
trial unnecessary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Fairey will testify how he did it,&#8221; his attorney,
Geoffrey Stewart, said at a hearing in Manhattan yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairey sued last year seeking a ruling that his Obama Hope
poster didn&#8217;t infringe AP&#8217;s copyright. The news organization
countersued. Fairey&#8217;s lawyers will try to prove that the poster
was a &#8220;fair use&#8221; of the photograph and thus didn&#8217;t infringe a
copyright. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge asked the lawyers about a court filing Aug. 20
stating that another party in the case, Mannie Garcia, had
dropped his lawsuit. Garcia, the photographer who took the photo
of Obama for AP, had sued AP and Fairey for illegal use of the
picture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve all consented to it,&#8221; Dale Cendali, a lawyer for
AP, said in court yesterday. &#8220;Mr. Garcia will be removed from
the case.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Fairey v. Associated Press, 09-cv-01123, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy bearish 3M Co.
options because the maker of items from stethoscopes to
sandpaper may struggle to deliver profit and revenue growth at
the level investors expect, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity derivatives strategists Amyn Bharwani and Marko Kolanovic recommended buying put options with a strike price of
$80 expiring in October while selling $70 puts expiring the same
month, a strategy known as a put spread that reduces the cost of
the trade while capping potential profit. 3M rose 0.5 percent to
$81.08 yesterday. Put options give the buyer the right to sell
shares at a pre-agreed price on or before a set date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourteen analysts who cover the Minnesota-based company
rate its shares a buy and three a "sell," data compiled by
Bloomberg show. JPMorgan analyst C. Stephen Tusa downgraded 3M
to "underweight" from "neutral" on Aug. 16, saying it may not be
able to live up to the bullish ratings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors maximize their profit if 3M closes at $70 or
below by Oct. 15 expiration, while the most an investor can lose
is the premium paid to enter into the put spread, which was
$1.85 yesterday. This will happen if the stock closes at $80 or
more by expiration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is nothing wrong here, it&#8217;s just that risks look to
be to the downside versus high expectations,&#8221; Tusa wrote in an
Aug. 17 report. &#8220;Consensus estimates look like a high bar,
baking in organic growth rates that seem aggressive in the
context of slowing end market growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit Growth &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3M posted second-quarter profit on July 22 that beat
analysts&#8217; estimates by 4.5 percent as sales climbed at all
divisions for the third straight quarter. Chief Executive
Officer George Buckley has boosted revenue by expanding into
emerging markets and sales climbed 18 percent to $6.73 billion
in the quarter. The company raised its forecast for sales-volume
growth from existing businesses to as much as 15 percent from 12
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t disagree that growth has been strong; however,
we are hard pressed to use two quarters as a straight line
indicator that growth is back at 3M,&#8221; Tusa wrote. &#8220;We think
it&#8217;s tough to use any period in which growth compares are close
to the easiest short cycle comparisons on record to validate a
long-term strategy/target.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average of 13 analyst estimates for third-quarter
profit is $1.51 a share excluding some items, according to a
Bloomberg survey, compared with $1.37 in the same period the
prior year. The mean prediction for the fourth quarter is profit
of $1.36 a share, compared with $1.30 a share in the comparable
period in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3M is down 1.9 percent this year, compared with a 4.3
percent loss for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. The stock is
up 8.5 percent from its 2010 low on June 7. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard Co. held the top
spot in the server-computer market for the second straight
quarter, gaining share as International Business Machines Corp.
and Oracle Corp. lost ground, research firm Gartner Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HP&#8217;s share increased to 32 percent last quarter, with sales
of $3.54 billion, compared with 28.9 percent a year earlier for
the Palo Alto, California-based company, Gartner said today in a
statement. Global server sales climbed 14 percent to $11.1
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard, the world&#8217;s largest personal-computer
maker, is benefitting from demand for machines based on a new PC
chip from Intel Corp., Stamford, Connecticut-based Gartner said.
IBM stayed at No. 2, though its market share slipped to 27.7
percent from 32.5 percent, a second straight decline. IBM held
the top ranking for two years until the first quarter of this
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dell Inc., which ranked third with a share of 16.3 percent,
posted the biggest sales growth of 40 percent. Oracle was
fourth, holding 8.4 percent of the market. Oracle completed its
purchase of Sun Microsystems Inc., the fourth biggest server-
computer maker, in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HP fell 15 cents to $38.24 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. IBM, based in Armonk, New York,
climbed 37 cents to $125.27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Andrew Frye and Katherine Burton" date="Aug 25, 2010  4:07 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-25/loews-chief-tisch-says-buy-exxon-mobil-j-j-stock-as-bond-yields-decline.html"><headline>Loews Chief Tisch Says Buy Exxon, J&amp;amp;J as Bond Yields Fall Close to `Zero''</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Jim Tisch, chief executive officer
of Loews Corp., said investors should buy stocks like Exxon
Mobil Corp. and Johnson  Johnson after the decline in Treasury
and municipal-bond yields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are equities that are rather intriguing, especially
when compared to fixed income,&#8221; Tisch said today in an
interview at Bloomberg headquarters in New York. &#8220;When I look
at what we&#8217;re earning on T bills and round it to the closest
whole number, it&#8217;s zero.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on two-year Treasuries dropped to a record low of
0.45 percent yesterday amid a slowing growth in the economy and
a dip in expectations for inflation. Tax-free yields on
municipal bonds are at their lowest in four decades, according
to Thomas Doe, chief executive officer of Municipal Market
Advisors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re actually investing in stocks, in large cap, good
dividend-paying stocks,&#8221; said Tisch, 57. &#8220;Who would have
thought five or 10 years ago that a 3 percent yield on a stock
would be a good yield? But actually today it&#8217;s a very good
yield.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tisch oversees a portfolio of companies spanning insurance,
hotels and offshore oil drilling. CNA Financial Corp., the
property-casualty insurer 90 percent owned by Loews, has been
paring holdings of Treasuries and municipal debt while adding
corporate bonds. The Chicago-based insurer had about $7.6
billion in municipal debt as of June 30, down from $8.6 billion
18 months earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate Debt &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holdings of Treasuries and agency debt fell to about $150
million from more than $2.8 billion, according to regulatory
filings. Corporate debt investments surged to $19.7 billion from
$13 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re in the insurance business, and like it or not we
have to have a fixed-income portfolio,&#8221; Tisch said. &#8220;Right now
we see corporate debt as the cheapest sector.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil&#8217;s dividend yield, or the ratio of payout to
share price, is 3 percent based on yesterday&#8217;s closing price of
$58.94 and a quarterly payment of 44 cents a share. Irving,
Texas-based Exxon, the largest U.S. oil company, had slipped 14
percent this year before today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JJ, the maker of Tylenol and Listerine, has a 3.7 percent
dividend yield based on yesterday&#8217;s closing price of $58.01. The
New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company had declined 9.9 percent
this year. Both Exxon and JJ have Aaa ratings from Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service, the highest grade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Municipal Debt &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holders of municipal bonds aren&#8217;t always getting paid
enough to shoulder the risk of default, Tisch said. Billionaire
Warren Buffett and Thomas Wilson, CEO of Allstate Corp., have
warned that public officials may have difficulty repaying debts
as the economic slump curbs tax revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Municipal bonds yield just over 2 percent and, man, I
think some of the credits could have some trouble, Tisch said.
&#8216;&#8216;When you look at the state of some of the state and city
finances it sort of makes Greece look like it&#8217;s a solid
credit.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10-year tax-exempt rate was 2.6 percent as of Aug. 24
and the 30-year rate was 4.16 percent, according to MMA&#8217;s
indexes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saudi Aramco and Exxon Mobil Corp.
are scheduling the next major maintenance shutdown at their
Yanbu refinery in 2013 after completing work there earlier this
year, a person with knowledge of the plan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery, on Saudi Arabia&#8217;s Red Sea coast, plans to
close for about 45 days starting in February 2013, said the
person, who asked not to be named because maintenance schedules
are not publicly disclosed. Saudi Aramco Mobil Refinery Co.,
known as Samref, will boost the reliability of the fluid
catalytic cracker as part of the maintenance program, the person
said. The FCC helps turn crude oil into gasoline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refinery operators generally schedule major maintenance
shutdowns, known as turnarounds, every three or four years,
stopping most of the units. The 400,000 barrel-a-day Samref
refinery completed a shutdown in April, and all units are now
running, said the person. Work lasted 50 days after the FCC had
technical problems, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aramco also operates a wholly owned refinery in Yanbu that
is planning a turnaround in February, according to another
person with knowledge of the maintenance schedule. A Dhahran-
based spokesman at Aramco, which has a policy of not discussing
joint-venture refineries, declined to comment on either project.
A Yanbu-based spokesman at Samref also declined to comment.
Kevin Allexon, an Irving, Texas-based spokesman for Exxon, said
the company doesn&#8217;t comment on maintenance schedules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia is expanding refining capacity to produce more
gasoline and diesel as domestic demand rises. The kingdom is
building three refineries at Jubail, on the Persian Gulf coast,
another at Yanbu and one at Jazan in the southwest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fuel Imports &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While countries in the Persian Gulf hold more than half the
world&#8217;s crude oil reserves, they import fuels for lack of
processing capacity. Imports help cover supply when refineries
undergo maintenance when temperatures are cooler. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Aramco is buying gasoline from September through the
end of the year, traders with knowledge of the tenders said last
week. The company is buying at least four cargoes of gasoline a
month, according to the traders, who asked not to be identified
since the talks aren&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aramco&#8217;s gasoline tenders indicate refinery units are
offline, the traders said. Rabigh Refining and Petrochemicals
Co., a joint venture of Aramco and Sumitomo Chemical Co. of
Japan, experienced a technical malfunction that cut output this
month. It did work this week on oxygen and nitrogen production
units, which are part of the chemicals plant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Chief Global Economist
Jim O&#8217;Neill said a spate of &#8220;disappointing&#8221; U.S. economic
reports may prompt the Federal Reserve to embark on a fresh
round of quantitative easing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent reports on jobless claims and manufacturing point to
slower growth in the world&#8217;s largest economy. Sales of existing
houses plunged by a record 27 percent in July, figures from the
National Association of Realtors showed yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If we carry on with data like this, yes, it&#8217;s coming,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neill said, referring to quantitative easing. He spoke in an
interview on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;InsideTrack&#8221; with Deirdre
Bolton today. &#8220;September might be a little bit soon, but by
October I would say for sure if the data carries on being as
disappointing as it&#8217;s been.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed policy makers on Aug. 10 made their first attempt to
bolster the economy in more than a year, saying they&#8217;ll maintain
their holdings of securities at $2.05 trillion to prevent money
from draining out of the financial system. The Federal Open
Market Committee said in a statement that &#8220;the pace of recovery
in output and employment has slowed in recent months.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed officials held mixed views of the outlook, according to
the minutes of their June meeting. The minutes said &#8220;a few
participants&#8221; saw &#8220;some risk of deflation,&#8221; while others
&#8220;thought inflation was unlikely to fall appreciably.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief
Global Economist Jim O&#8217;Neill said German domestic demand may
overtake exports as the drivers of growth in Europe&#8217;s largest
economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Germany may be entering a period of self-sustaining
domestic demand growth,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;InsideTrack&#8221; with Deirdre Bolton
today. &#8220;If that were true it would be of major importance for
the rest of Europe.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade exports have been the mainstay of
German economic growth and foreign demand has helped pull the
country out of the worst recession since World War II. German
business confidence today unexpectedly rose to a three-year
high, driven by a jump in retailer sentiment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What is coming through more and more is evidence of
improving domestic demand,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said. &#8220;It&#8217;s been such a
long time since the German consumer has been spending. If it
were for real, it&#8217;s going to turn out to be major.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Neill said the Ifo report is &#8220;a pretty good leading
indicator of Europe.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Munich-based Ifo institute said its business climate
index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives, increased to 106.7
from 106.2 in July. That&#8217;s the highest level since June 2007.
Economists expected a drop to 105.7, according to the median of
36 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. plans to open an
office in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, this year as it vies for
access to oil and gas in the resource rich Central Asian nation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Exxon Mobil is interested in pursuing upstream

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the bank
with the biggest trading profits on Wall Street, is losing
market share underwriting corporate bonds as it seeks to boost
its image as a company adviser rather than a $900 billion hedge
fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most profitable firm in Wall Street history has slipped
to 10th in helping the world&#8217;s companies raise debt, down from
ninth last year and as high as third place in 2003, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Its share of this year&#8217;s $1.9
trillion in global offerings dipped to 3.7 percent, from an
average 4.8 percent in the previous 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein is working to
restore the New York-based firm&#8217;s reputation as an advocate for
its customers after agreeing last month to pay a record fine to
settle U.S. allegations it misled clients over sales of a
mortgage-linked security. Goldman Sachs&#8217;s 35,000 employees help
governments finance schools and roads and provide advice and
capital to companies &#8220;to invest in their growth,&#8221; Blankfein,
55, said before Congress in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman is struggling a little bit here,&#8221; said Richard Bove, an analyst at Rochdale Securities in Lutz, Florida. &#8220;It
has to overcome some pretty sizable public relations issues,
which are related to the way it does business and the products
it creates. The company is good enough to overcome all of this
stuff, but it would be hard for me to imagine that there&#8217;s no
impact as a result of what we&#8217;ve seen over the last 12 to 18
months.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking &#8216;a Hit&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein has said the firm&#8217;s clients have stuck with it
after agreeing to pay a $550 million fine to the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission in connection with allegations that it
misled investors in securities that bet on subprime mortgages.
While not acknowledging or refuting improper conduct, Goldman
Sachs said it made a &#8220;mistake&#8221; by failing to disclose a hedge
fund that helped construct the investment was also planning to
bet against it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Definitely Goldman Sachs&#8217;s reputation took a hit,&#8221;
Blankfein said in a Bloomberg Television interview in May. &#8220;And
that&#8217;s certainly reflected in people&#8217;s attitudes to the firm
now. And that&#8217;s something that we have to work on.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has retained its top spot in advising
companies on mergers and acquisitions, with 165 deals this year
and is second in equity offerings, with a 9.5 percent market
share of the $258 billion raised. Equity offerings amount to 13
percent of the total raised through corporate bonds this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bond Bonanza &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When you think of Goldman Sachs and you think of our investment-banking and our market-making across the board and
our money-management, we have one of the biggest client
franchises out there, maybe the biggest,&#8221; Blankfein said.
&#8220;This is a tough, competitive market with clients that can
sometimes border on the cynical in terms of their
expectations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York,
declined to comment on the firm&#8217;s bond underwriting business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deposit-rich lenders JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Deutsche Bank
AG have climbed in the league tables at the expense of Goldman
Sachs as companies tap the bond market for some of the lowest
yields on record. The banks began to dominate the market more
than a decade ago after the repeal of Depression-era laws that
separated investment and commercial banking. They won business
in part by using their bigger balance sheets to lend directly to
companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks Rise &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank, is leading global
underwriting for the third straight year while Deutsche Bank, Germany&#8217;s biggest lender, is ranked second, up from an average
rank of 4.6, Bloomberg data show. New York-based JPMorgan has a
6.8 percent share of the market, down from an average 7.3
percent, while Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank has 5.9 percent, up
from an average 5.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Barclays Capital in London, which bought Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.&#8217;s North American division in 2008, has climbed to
fourth from an average of eighth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs also has dropped in U.S. corporate bond
underwriting, where it holds a bigger share. The bank is sixth
this year, down from as high as third in 2005, Bloomberg data
show. Its U.S. share has dwindled to 7.3 percent from as high as
9 percent in 2005 and an average of 7.9 percent the previous 10
years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Core Deposits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borrowers want an underwriter that has &#8220;the balance-sheet
strength of a real commercial bank with investment banking
capabilities as opposed to an investment bank with these nominal
commercial banking facilities like Goldman Sachs,&#8221; said Charles Geisst, a finance professor at Manhattan College in Riverdale, New York, who has written about Wall Street&#8217;s history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had quarterly average assets of $1.99 trillion
last year, including $112.8 billion in commercial and industrial
loans, Federal Reserve filings show. It held $548.2 billion of
core deposits. Goldman Sachs&#8217;s quarterly average assets of
$880.3 billion included $1.5 billion of commercial and
industrial loans. It had core deposits of $19.4 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is &#8220;generally bullish on opportunities across
markets,&#8221; Therese Esperdy, the global head of debt capital
markets at the bank in New York, said in a statement.
Spokespeople for Deutsche Bank and Barclays didn&#8217;t comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is holding steady in businesses where profit
margins are highest. It&#8217;s second in global equity underwritings,
in line with an average rank of 1.7 the previous 10 years,
Bloomberg data show. The average fee in that market this year
has been 3.3 percent, compared with 0.5 percent in corporate
bond underwriting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MA Dominance &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also has advised on more mergers and acquisitions than
any other firm, with $289.7 billion in deals this year. MA
advisory generates about 40 percent of the investment-banking
industry&#8217;s revenue, according to a Sanford C. Bernstein  Co.
report reviewing the industry&#8217;s performance from 2000 to 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading of fixed-income securities and derivatives,
currencies and commodities generated an unprecedented $7.39
billion of revenue in the first quarter for Goldman Sachs,
following overall record net earnings of $13.4 billion in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs averaged $348.5 million a quarter in revenue
from debt underwriting the last 20 quarters. That&#8217;s less than 10
percent of the average $3.68 billion a quarter during the same
period from trading in fixed income, currency and commodity
markets, data compiled by Bloomberg from earnings presentations
show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expanding Competition &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a little early to tell that there&#8217;s been major
reputational damage,&#8221; said Ricardo Kleinbaum, a credit analyst
at BNP Paribas in New York. &#8220;In periods of lower economic
growth, there tends to be less financing needs and less MA and
advisory business, and therefore it is a negative for investment
banking in general.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the erosion may be at the expense of all
underwriters as competition intensifies. The average amount of
deals for the top 10 underwriters has shrunk to $93.4 billion
this year from $118.7 billion in the corresponding period of
2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New bond issues earned bankers $18.8 billion in fees in
2009 from debt underwriting, a 31 percent increase over 2008 and
equal to the record set in 2007, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Securities firms haven&#8217;t dominated debt underwriting league
tables since 1999 when Congress repealed the Glass-Steagall Act.
For more than 60 years, the law separated investment and
commercial banking by prohibiting federally insured banks from
underwriting securities and other investment banking activities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merrill Lynch  Co., which was bought in 2009 by Bank of
America Corp., Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs were ranked
first, third and fourth in global bond underwriting in 1999,
with a combined market share of 19.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Historically, they were 1, 2 or 3,&#8221; Geisst, 63, the
author of &#8220;Wall Street: A History,&#8221; said of Goldman Sachs
before the repeal of Glass-Steagall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2000 to 2009, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s average rank in global
corporate bond underwriting was 6.7. Morgan Stanley, which
slipped to seventh the past two years, averaged 5.4 percent. Its
share this year is 4 percent, down from an average 5.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner&#8217;s growing confrontation with the country&#8217;s
largest newspaper is exacerbating the biggest tumble in its
dollar bonds in two months and prompting JPMorgan Chase  Co. to
recommend investors cut holdings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on the South American country&#8217;s benchmark 7
percent securities due in 2015 increased 74 basis points, or
0.74 percentage point, from Aug. 23 through yesterday, the
biggest two-day jump since June 7, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Emerging-market bond yields climbed an average of 18
basis points during the same period, according to JPMorgan
indexes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York bank advised investors to sell holdings of the
securities, citing concern that &#8220;domestic political conflicts
are escalating&#8221; and global growth is slowing, after benchmark
yields fell to their lowest since November 2007 this month.
Fernandez, 57, asked a court this week to review the 1976
purchase of a newsprint producer by Grupo Clarin SA, a move
opposition leaders say is an attempt to silence critics in the
media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s the type of news that starts to unnerve the market,
particularly against this global backdrop and after prices have
rallied a lot,&#8221; said Alberto Ramos, an economist with Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to hold Argentine dollar
bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries widened 10 basis points at
10:26 a.m. in New York, the most in emerging markets, to 760,
according to JPMorgan&#8217;s EMBI+ index. The spread, up from a
three-month low of 653 on Aug. 9, also swelled on concern
slowing global growth will curb demand for the country&#8217;s
commodity exports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Less Supportive&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Following a sharp outperformance, Argentine asset prices
now confront a global and domestic environment that is becoming
less supportive of immediate spread compression,&#8221; Vladimir
Werning, a JPMorgan analyst, wrote in a report yesterday. The
bank cut Argentine debt to &#8220;market weight&#8221; from
&#8220;overweight.&#8221; Werning declined to comment further when
contacted by telephone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government may push back plans to sell bonds in
international markets for the first time since its 2001 default
as it &#8220;focuses on domestic political conflicts&#8221; and yields
exceed the government&#8217;s target, according to Werning&#8217;s report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economy Minister Amado Boudou postponed plans to sell as
much as $1 billion worth of bonds due in 2017 as part of
Argentina&#8217;s restructuring of $12.9 billion in defaulted debt in
June, saying the country doesn&#8217;t need the money and would wait
for benchmark yields to fall below 10 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alfredo Scoccimarro, Fernandez&#8217;s spokesman, didn&#8217;t respond
to calls seeking a comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Default Swaps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on the 2015 bonds climbed 26 basis points to
11.18 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of protecting Argentine debt against non-payment
for five years with credit-default swaps jumped 47 basis points
to 891 yesterday, according to data compiled by CMA DataVision.
Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
government or company fail to adhere to debt agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warrants linked to growth in South America&#8217;s second-biggest
economy rose 0.04 cent today to 9.56 cents, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argentina&#8217;s peso slid 0.1 percent to 3.9459 per dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy the peso instead of Argentine bonds,
which are more likely to slump as slackening global growth
reduces demand for higher-yielding assets, according to Eduardo
Suarez, an emerging-markets strategist at Royal Bank of Canada
in Toronto. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Political Noise&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drop in Argentine bonds this week is drawing more
attention to the country&#8217;s political tensions, according to
Henry Stipp, who helps manage $98 billion of assets, including
Argentine bonds, at Threadneedle Asset Management in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People start to talk more about political noise when the
market turns,&#8221; said Stipp, who holds Argentine bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fernandez said Aug. 24 the sale of paper maker Papel Prensa
SA to Clarin, La Razon and La Nacion was illegal because the
owner, Grupo Graiver, was under pressure by the country&#8217;s
military dictatorship to agree to the transaction. Buenos Aires-
based Clarin now holds a 49 percent stake in Papel Prensa after
buying La Razon&#8217;s share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clarin and La Nacion, in a joint statement, said that in
court testimony made after the country returned to democracy in
1983, the Graiver family said it had sold Papel Prensa and other
assets to settle large amounts of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Flare Up&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isidoro Graiver, a member of the family that sold Papel
Prensa, said in a statement published in both newspapers
yesterday that the transaction was voluntary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opposition lawmakers, including former Buenos Aires
Governor Felipe Sola and Elisa Carrio, said Fernandez&#8217;s
administration is trying to pressure the media for coverage
favorable to the government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This kind of flare up reminds people what the issues are
and that&#8217;s why spreads are still significantly distressed
despite the fact that they have a rallied a lot recently,&#8221;
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Ramos said. &lt;/p&gt;

Nakheel&#8217;s ability to redeem the principal in 2015,&#8221; JPMorgan
analyst Zafar Nazim wrote in a research note e-mailed today.
Nakheel will face the risk of running out of cash in 2015 unless
it starts new developments and sell land in three to five years,
the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nakheel, which is building palm tree-shaped islands off
Dubai&#8217;s coast, said on July 14 a group of its creditors
unanimously supported a plan on altering the terms on $10.5
billion of loans and unpaid bills. The company expects to pay 40
percent of the money owed to trade creditors in cash and 60
percent through a tradeable sukuk, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nakheel and Dubai World, one of the emirate&#8217;s three main
holding companies, are seeking to renegotiate terms on their
debt after the deepest financial crisis since the 1930s roiled
Dubai&#8217;s real-estate market and left companies unable to raise
new funding. Property prices have fallen more than 50 percent in
the city as banks cut mortgage lending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dubai World may raise as much as $19.4 billion in eight
years by selling assets, a person with knowledge of the matter
said yesterday. If it sold those assets now it would probably
get $10.4 billion, the person said, declining to be identified
because the information is private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nakheel has no plans to sell assets and expects to resume
work on six projects in October, Al Khaleej reported on Aug. 22,
citing an interview with Chairman Ali Lootah. The company said
on Aug. 24 it paid 2.5 billion dirhams ($681 million) it owed
trade creditors in July. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time Warner Cable Inc.&#8217;s
negotiations to renew rights to ESPN may be held up on a demand
by the sports channel&#8217;s owner, Walt Disney Co., to be paid for a
related website, two people with knowledge of the talks said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney is seeking a fee of about 10 cents a month per Web
customer for ESPN3.com, said one of the people, who declined to
be identified because the talks haven&#8217;t concluded. Time Warner
Cable is resisting the fee, both people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESPN, the most-profitable unit of Burbank, California-based
Disney, has honed a strategy of buying sports broadcast rights
and charging cable systems industry-leading fees for games. An
agreement with Time Warner Cable would add more than 9 million
paying customers to the website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maureen Huff, a spokeswoman for New York-based Time Warner
Cable, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re very focused on reaching a fair agreement with Time
Warner Cable, and we will not comment on the specifics of the
negotiations,&#8221; ESPN, based in Disney and Bristol, Connecticut,
said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time Warner Cable, the fourth-largest U.S. pay-TV provider,
rose $1.11 to $51.67 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. The shares have gained 25 percent this year.
Disney, the world&#8217;s biggest media company, climbed 84 cents to
$32.78 and has gained 1.6 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESPN is the most expensive national pay-TV channel, costing
providers on average $4.08 per subscriber a month, according to
researcher SNL Kagan. Time Warner Inc.&#8217;s TNT is second at 99
cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fastest-Growing Business &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An agreement with Time Warner may raise questions among
advocates of so-called net neutrality rules that have been
proposed to prevent some websites from gaining priority access
to Internet users. ESPN3.com is the first and only site to
charge Web-service providers a subscriber-based access fee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet service is Time Warner Cable&#8217;s fastest-growing
residential product and is more profitable than video largely
because the operator doesn&#8217;t have to pay programmers for
content. Last quarter, Time Warner Cable&#8217;s high-speed data
revenue climbed 9.7 percent to $1.23 billion, with the company
gaining 85,000 new home Internet customers to 9.29 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cable operator has previously said it doesn&#8217;t agree
with ESPN3.com&#8217;s business model, which requires payment based on
the total number of Internet subscribers. Although Time Warner
Cable has said it acknowledges the site&#8217;s appeal, its Internet
customers shouldn&#8217;t have to pay for programming they may never
watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broader Talks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time Warner Cable is negotiating pricing for Disney&#8217;s cable
outlets, including the Disney Channel and ABC Family, for all of
its 12.7 million video subscribers. In addition, the companies
are negotiating rights to Disney&#8217;s ABC broadcast stations in New
York, Los Angeles and Raleigh, North Carolina. The existing
contract expires on Sept. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formerly called ESPN360, ESPN3.com carries 3,500 live
events a year, including World Cup soccer and the Little League
World Series. ESPN.com, the flagship website doesn&#8217;t provide
start-to-finish live broadcasts or replays. ESPN3.com offers
programming not available on TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comcast Corp., Cox Communications Inc., Charter
Communications and phone companies ATT Inc. and Verizon
Communications Inc. have ESPN3.com agreements with Disney,
according to the website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A car bomb exploded outside the
offices of Grupo Televisa SA, the world&#8217;s largest Spanish-
language broadcaster, in the northern Mexican state of
Tamaulipas, said Carlos Loret de Mola, an anchor for the
station. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bomb, which went off early this morning, didn&#8217;t cause
any injuries and caused material damages outside the offices,
Loret de Mola said on the Twitter social networking site. Last
month, two journalists from another Televisa affiliate, in
Durango state, were kidnapped by suspected drug gangs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tamaulipas, which borders Texas, has become an epicenter of
violence in Mexico&#8217;s fight against drug cartels. The navy found
72 bodies in a mass grave there this week that were the remains
of migrants from other Latin American countries killed while
trying  to make their way to the U.S. Rodolfo Torre Cantu, a
gubernatorial candidate in the state, was assassinated in June. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goutham Dindukurthi had already
turned in a dozen essay questions as part of a job-application
process when he received a message: &#8220;Sorry, we don&#8217;t hire
international students.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was one of many obstacles he faced as a recently
graduated international student seeking work in the U.S. at
computer game and animation companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dindukurthi, 24, was one of 18,000 students who traveled
from India to study science or engineering in the U.S. in 2008.
He won a coveted spot in the Entertainment Technology Masters
program at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. Like many
of his compatriots, though, Dindukurthi discovered that the
struggling U.S. economy and his immigration status stymied him
as he looked for a job after graduation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We heard of companies going on a hiring freeze,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Being Indian made it harder since some of the companies
refused to sponsor a working visa.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dindukurthi&#8217;s plight illustrates a widening problem that&#8217;s
long been a sore point for chief executives of the U.S.
technology industry. Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft, says U.S.
visa curbs on immigrants with special skills in science, math or
technology must be overhauled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If we don&#8217;t, American companies simply will not have the
talent to innovate and compete,&#8221; Gates said in testimony to the
House Committee on Science and Technology on March 12, 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sime Darby Bhd. rose the most in
three months after brokerages including JPMorgan Chase  Co.
raised their forecasts for the stock on speculation the worst
may be over for the world&#8217;s biggest listed palm-oil producer
after posting its latest loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares gained 2.8 percent to close at 8.10 ringgit in
Kuala Lumpur trading, the biggest gain since May 27. The advance
pared the decline this year to 11 percent, the most on the
Malaysian stock index. Chief Executive Officer Mohd Bakke Salleh
said yesterday the company has &#8220;identified&#8221; problems it faced
in the oil and gas business and expects a turnaround. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simone Yeoh, an analyst at JPMorgan, upgraded Sime to
&#8220;overweight&#8221; from &#8220;neutral,&#8221; lifting her share forecast to
9.40 ringgit from 8.40 ringgit. Hoe Lee Leng, an analyst at RHB
Research Institute Sdn., raised the recommendation on the stock
to &#8220;market perform&#8221; from &#8220;underperform,&#8221; while AmResearch
Sdn. rated the stock a new &#8220;buy&#8221; with a 9.20 ringgit target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Consistency in performance under leadership of the new
CEO is key for a sustainable re-rating,&#8221; Yeoh said in a report.
&#8220;We see prospects for shorter term opportunity in Sime shares
with the overhang from further provisions now behind us, stable
to strong core profits from most divisions, and our recent more
positive outlook on crude palm oil prices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kuala Lumpur-based company posted a second consecutive
quarterly loss yesterday after adding provisions of 777.3
million ringgit ($247 million) for oil and gas projects, largely
in the Middle East. This brought its total provisions to 2.1
billion ringgit for its fiscal year ended June 30, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 100-year-old Malaysian company reported a fourth-
quarter net loss of 77.4 million ringgit, a reversal from a 984
million-ringgit profit a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sime is currently under-owned by institutional funds due
to the losses across the group&#8217;s energy and utilities
operations,&#8221; Alex Goh, an analyst at AmResearch, wrote in a
report today. &#8220;We believe that the stock is at an inflection
point for an upward re-rating.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Koebeli, who joined on Aug. 1, is responsible for the New

commodities units in Switzerland, Goldman Sachs said today in a
statement. He replaces Stefan R. Bollinger, who relocated to
Hong Kong as head of the Pan-Asian private investor product
group business, and will report to Philip Holzer, head of the
securities business in Germany, Switzerland and Austria. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Nomura, Koebeli was most recently a managing director
and head of equity derivatives structured sales in Europe,
Middle East and Africa, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., UBS AG and
15 other banks are competing to manage the share sale of state-
run Steel Authority of India Ltd., part of a record asset-sale
program by the government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks will be asked to make presentations on Aug. 31
and Sept. 1, Steel Secretary Atul Chaturvedi said today in a
phone interview from New Delhi. Morgan Stanley, Bank of America
Corp., Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc, Nomura Holdings Inc.
and SBI Capital Markets Ltd. also submitted bids for managing
the public offer, likely to be made in January, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steel Authority plans to sell a 5 percent stake and the
government will sell an equal share in a follow-on public sale.
The offer is part of the Indian government&#8217;s plan to sell a
record 400 billion rupees ($8.5 billion) of assets this year as
it aims to contain fiscal deficit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We plan to have at least five banks for managing the
share sale,&#8221; Chaturvedi said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Steel Authority rose as much as 1.9 percent to
188.75 rupees and traded at 188.15 rupees as of 12:17 p.m. in
Mumbai. The key Sensitive Index, or Sensex, was little changed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Share sales by government-controlled companies are
producing near-zero fees for Wall Street banks that charge an
average of about 4 percent of money raised for U.S. offerings,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. As many as 20 banks still
compete for each state sale, betting the league-table credits
will help them win more investment-banking work in Asia&#8217;s third-
largest economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH may be the
first drugmaker to win U.S. approval of a revolutionary
alternative for preventing strokes. It likely won&#8217;t be the last. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, and Bayer AG
will present data at a medical meeting tomorrow on pills racing
to overtake Boehringer&#8217;s Pradaxa, which U.S. regulatory advisers
will review Sept. 20. The prize: a bigger stake in a blood-
thinner market that may be worth $10 billion to $20 billion a
year, said Seamus Fernandez, an analyst with Leerink Swann  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Positive findings for Pfizer and Bayer may put their pills
in line to replace warfarin, a 65-year-old drug that can cause
dangerous bleeding at high doses and deadly blood clots when too
little is given. Pradaxa was more effective than warfarin at
preventing strokes in atrial fibrillation patients, a study last
year found. Research tomorrow will give clues on whether the
Pfizer and Bayer pills are as good as, or better, than Pradaxa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pradaxa has set a pretty high bar,&#8221; said Deepak Bhatt,
chief of cardiology at the VA Boston Healthcare System. &#8220;It
showed superiority. That is really a tough threshold that has
been set in terms of apixaban and Xarelto.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, based in New York, rose 19 cents to $16.09 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading at the 4 p.m. close on
Aug. 27. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., also of New York, gained 27
cents to $26.12. Johnson  Johnson, of New Brunswick, New
Jersey, increased 34 cents to $57.60, and Leverkusen, Germany-
based Bayer climbed 32 cents to 47.15 euros in Frankfurt
trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drug Partnerships &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is partnering with Bristol-Myers on apixaban, while
Bayer has teamed with JJ on Xarelto. Boehringer, based in
Ingelheim, Germany, is the world&#8217;s biggest family-owned
drugmaker and isn&#8217;t publicly traded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors now rely on aspirin and warfarin, a powerful but
difficult-to-control medicine crafted from rat poison, to help
prevent strokes in 2.2 million Americans with an irregular
heartbeat, a condition also known as atrial fibrillation, Bhatt
said. For patients at risk for developing clots in the leg or
veins deep within the body as the result of other conditions,
physicians use the generic drug heparin or Sanofi-Aventis SA&#8217;s
Lovenox, with 3.08 billion euros ($3.9 billion) in 2009 sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these drugs, though, have flaws making them difficult
and dangerous to use, Bhatt said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow&#8217;s data, to be presented at the European Society of
Cardiology meeting in Stockholm, will provide early insight into
whether apixaban or Xarelto can match last year&#8217;s finding on
Pradaxa, said Tony Butler, an analyst at Barclays Capital in New
York, in an Aug. 25 note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Positive Results &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts are expecting positive results from Pfizer and
Bristol-Myers&#8217;s product after the companies stopped their study
comparing apixaban to aspirin ahead of schedule when an early
analysis showed it cut the rate of strokes and certain clots,
said Leerink Swann&#8217;s Fernandez, in an Aug. 20 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apixaban may have trimmed the relative risk of having a
stroke in the study by 38 percent, compared with aspirin,
Fernandez said in a June report after the study was halted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Pfizer and Bristol-Myers, getting apixaban to market is
critical as they brace for generic competition to their top-
selling pills. Next year, Pfizer will start losing the majority
of revenue for its cholesterol pill Lipitor, the world&#8217;s biggest
drug with $11.4 billion in sales last year. The company has had
a string of research setbacks this year, halting late-stage
testing on four medicines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bristol-Myers is expected to face generic competition in
2012 for its anti-clotting drug Plavix, the world&#8217;s second-best
selling medicine generating $6.1 billion last year for Bristol-
Myers. It markets the drug with Paris-based Sanofi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Einstein &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bayer trial, dubbed Einstein-DVT, found that Xarelto
was as effective as the standard therapy of Lovenox plus
warfarin at preventing clots in the lungs and legs, the company
said on Aug. 4. Investors will be looking at the specific
bleeding rates when the full results of the study are presented
tomorrow to determine how it compares to Pradaxa, Butler said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boehringer has said it expects approval of Pradaxa for
atrial fibrillation patients later this year or early next year.
Bayer has said it will request regulatory approval for Xarelto
in both deep vein thrombosis and atrial fibrillation by the end
of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s apixaban may not come to market in the U.S. until
2012 as the company waits for results from a larger 18,000-
patient study of atrial fibrillation patients comparing apixaban
with warfarin, said Deutsche Bank analyst Barbara Ryan. The
results from that study should be presented early next year, she
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sold in Europe &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Xarelto and Pradaxa are sold in Europe, mainly to
prevent blood clots from forming after hip and knee surgery.
European regulators may approve apixaban next year for blood
clots following surgery, Ryan said in a July 13 note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and Bristol-Myers&#8217;s study to be presented tomorrow,
dubbed Averroes, compared apixaban to aspirin for preventing
strokes in patients with atrial fibrillation who couldn&#8217;t
tolerate or chose not to take warfarin. Almost half of atrial
fibrillation patients choose aspirin over warfarin because it
has a lower risk of bleeding, fewer drug interactions and
requires less monitoring, said Bhatt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atrial fibrillation means the heart doesn&#8217;t properly pump
blood out of its upper chamber, allowing it to pool and clot,
according to the American Heart Association. A stroke can result
if part of that clot breaks off and gets lodged in the artery to
the brain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Physicians and patients are sick of warfarin and there is
a lot of hope of not having to deal with it anymore,&#8221; Bhatt
said. &#8220;If something comes along that is as good or better than
warfarin, that would be a very big improvement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should continue buying
mortgage bonds tied to U.S. home loans because they are unlikely
to suffer a wave of refinancings that would cut yields,
according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congressional action would be required to trigger any
significant &#8220;government-sponsored refi wave&#8221; in the market for
bonds owned or guaranteed by mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac, JPMorgan analysts led by Matthew Jozoff wrote in an
Aug. 27 note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to believe that such a large-scale event is
highly unlikely,&#8221; Jozoff wrote. &#8220;Fannie and Freddie could not
unilaterally cut mortgage rates on existing private mortgages
around the country, nor could the Treasury.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government-backed mortgage bonds rallied compared with U.S.
Treasuries last week by the most since July 23, according to
Barclays Capital index data. Too many mortgage refinancings
would hurt bondholders by reducing the average interest rate
backing securities they purchased. While applications to
refinance existing mortgages are at the highest in more than a
year, Jozoff said he doesn&#8217;t expect another major increase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mortgage bond buyers are being &#8220;well compensated for the
prepayment uncertainty,&#8221; Jozoff wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only congressional action could force large-scale loan
modifications on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac-backed bonds, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While we thought all along that the odds of the &#8216;nuclear&#8217;
refi option were low, we point out that the mechanics of
implementing such a program are not quite as simple as a stroke
of the pen,&#8221; he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Brien, who most recently ran BlackRock&#8217;s institutional
investment-management business, will report directly to the
division&#8217;s chief executive Officer, Mary Callahan Erdoes, the
New York-based company said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan hired O&#8217;Brien, who will be based in London, to
&#8220;bolster its client coverage model to reflect institutional
clients&#8217; increasingly more global approach to asset allocation
and investments,&#8221; according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s hiring on Aug.
27. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everstone Capital Management, the
private-equity and real-estate fund adviser started by two
former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executives, may raise as much as
$350 million for a new fund to invest in warehouses in India. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everstone has invested 25 percent of the $240 million
Indospace Logistics Parks fund, said Sameer Sain, co-founder at
Everstone Investment Advisors Pvt. The private-equity firm with
offices in Mumbai and Singapore may start raising money for the
second fund at the end of 2011 after it has allocated 75 percent
of the money in Indospace Logistics, said Sain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;India is in the stone ages in terms of quality
warehousing,&#8221; Mumbai-based Sain said in an interview in Mumbai
Aug. 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everstone, which manages $1.5 billion across various funds,
wants to invest in developing industrial real estate and
warehousing facilities as India&#8217;s government changes the current
regional tax structure, which has led to delays in the movement
of products, in favor of a goods and services tax regime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With the country moving from regional and state levies to
a central goods and services tax, the need for regional
warehouses in every state will be greatly reduced and companies
will move to large central warehouses and distribution
centers,&#8221; said Sain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private-equity firms invested about $2.4 billion in 67
deals in India during the quarter ended June 2010, according to
a study by Venture Intelligence, a researcher based in the
Southern Indian city of Chennai. Investments have jumped
threefold to $4.57 billion in the six months to June compared to
$1.5 billion in the same period a year ago, the study showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fund Raising &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indospace fund, which develops industrial real estate
and warehouses across India, is a joint venture between
Everstone and U.S.-based industrial real estate firm Realterm
Global. The fund has developed 1.6 million square feet (149,000
square meters) of warehouses and manufacturing facilities at
Chakan, in the western state of Maharashtra, and an 800,000
square foot facility in Chennai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $425 million Everstone Capital Partners I has made 17
investments, including Faces Cosmetics Plc, a maker of beauty
products, and financial services firm Centrum Capital Ltd. The
fund has made two exits, in apparel maker Lilliput Kidswear Ltd.
and Capital Foods Exports Pvt., a producer of packaged meals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everstone Capital Partners II, launched in December, has
achieved its first close raising $250 million last month
primarily from investors in Europe and the U.S., Sain said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The environment for fundraising remains challenging,&#8221;
said Sain. &#8220;Investors have become highly selective about where
they put their money and the level of scrutiny and diligence is
extremely high.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bearish on Commercial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private-equity firms raised $41 billion in the second
quarter, the lowest amount since 2003, as endowments, pensions
and wealthy individuals hesitated to back new funds, according
to London-based research firm Preqin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sain left Goldman Sachs in 2006 to start Future Capital
Holdings Ltd. with Kishore Biyani, owner of India&#8217;s biggest
publicly traded retailer. Future Capital raised 4.9 billion
rupees ($105 million) in a share sale in 2008 to expand its
consumer finance businesses in India. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everstone was spun off this year when Future Capital
reorganized its businesses. Everstone is run by Sain and
Singapore-based Atul Kapur, a former Goldman Sachs managing
director in the Principal Strategies Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm, which also manages the $350 million Horizon
Realty LLC, may raise another real-estate fund next year
depending on market conditions, Sain said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are short-term bearish on commercial real estate over
the next two to three years as we see an oversupply,&#8221; he said.
Everstone&#8217;s real estate funds have not made a single investment
in that sector in the past three years, he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everstone, with offices in Mauritius, Singapore, Mumbai,
Delhi and Bangalore, may list its real-estate assets in the 3
billion rupee Kshitij fund on Indian exchanges, he said. It may
also explore listing the Horizon fund on the Singapore exchange,
Sain added. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. told traders
who bet on commodities for the firm&#8217;s account that their unit
will be closed as the company, the second-biggest U.S. bank by
assets, starts to shut down all proprietary trading, according
to a person briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank eventually will close all in-house trading to
comply with new U.S. curbs on investment banks, said the person,
who asked not to be identified because New York-based JPMorgan&#8217;s
decision hasn&#8217;t been made public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closing the proprietary trading desk for commodities
affects fewer than 20 traders, one in the U.S. and the rest in
the U.K., the person said. The unit is based in London, and
traders there were given notice on Aug. 27 that their jobs were
at risk as required by U.K. law, according to the person.
Proprietary traders in fixed-income and equities, who account
for 50 to 75 employees, will need to find jobs when those desks
are shut down, this person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress passed restrictions on financial firms this year
designed to prevent a recurrence of the 2008 credit crisis,
which almost caused the banking system to collapse. Proprietary
trading involves transactions made on behalf of the bank rather
than its customers. The curbs are known as the Volcker rule,
named after former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, who
campaigned for limits on risk-taking by lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Volcker rule may cost JPMorgan as much as $1.4 billion
in annual profit, analysts at Barclays Capital led by Jason Goldberg estimated in a June 28 research report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue Goes Away &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This revenue and the risk it carries with it now goes
away,&#8221; said Christopher Whalen, a Federal Reserve Bank of New
York analyst in the 1980s and co-founder of Institutional Risk Analytics in Torrance, California. &#8220;This will put more pressure
on JPM to look for growth outside the U.S. market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan traders will be given a chance to apply for jobs
elsewhere in the company, according to the person. JPMorgan
spokeswoman Kimberly Weinrick declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coal derivatives trader Chan Bhima, who made a bad bet on
coal prices that the New York Post said cost JPMorgan as much as
$250 million in the second quarter, isn&#8217;t affected by the cuts,
the person said. The proprietary trading desk reports to
commodities head Blythe Masters, who discussed Bhima&#8217;s trade and
other matters in a July conference call with her team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. banks are exploring ways to comply with the new
trading rules. Citigroup Inc. was looking at three options to
meet the new rule, including moving a team of proprietary
traders into its hedge-fund unit, people briefed on the matter
said in July. The bank would set up the traders as hedge-fund
managers and seed their funds, then raise money from outside
investors to redeem its stakes, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. and Bayer AG revealed
study results today that may give their medicines a foothold in
a $10-billion-a-year market to prevent clots that cause strokes
and deadly lung damage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research provided evidence that Pfizer&#8217;s apixaban and
Bayer&#8217;s Xarelto are as safe as existing therapy, which may ease
concerns among doctors who are seeking a replacement for
warfarin, a powerful and unwieldy blood thinner used for more
than a half-century. Apixaban beat aspirin at preventing strokes
in patients with irregular heartbeat, while Xarelto matched
standard treatments for clots in the legs and lungs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At stake is a share in a warfarin-replacement market that
could reach $10 billion to $20 billion a year, according to an
estimate from Seamus Fernandez, an analyst with Leerink Swann 
Co. Doctors and patients will &#8220;insist&#8221; on using a replacement
as soon as one is available for warfarin, which requires regular
blood tests and can leave patients vulnerable to deadly clots or
uncontrollable bleeding at too low or high a dose, said Ralph
Brindis, president of the American College of Cardiology and a
cardiologist at Oakland Medical Center in California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re getting pretty close to the holy grail in finding a
replacement for warfarin,&#8221; Brindis said in an interview. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know which one is going to win or lose in that family, but
the body of evidence is growing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer rose 5 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $15.91 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading, while partner
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. rose 23 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
$26.08. Bayer rose 1.15 euros, or 2.4 percent, to 48.18 euros in
Frankfurt trading, and partner Johnson  Johnson fell 28 cents,
or 0.5 percent, to $57.02 in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boehringer&#8217;s Pradaxa &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH may be the first drugmaker to win
U.S. approval of a revolutionary alternative to warfarin, which
is derived from rat poison. U.S. regulatory advisers will review
Pradaxa, already approved in Europe to prevent clots following
hip and knee surgery, on Sept. 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pradaxa, apixaban and Xarelto interfere with the body&#8217;s own
clotting mechanisms to minimize strokes, lung clots and extended
leg clots, commonly at a risk of increased bleeding, Brindis
said. Apixaban, which is still being tested, and Xarelto, which
is approved in Europe for hip and knee surgery patients, appear
to be effective and safe, perhaps safer than the current
standard, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apixaban Results &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients who took apixaban were 54 percent less likely to
have a stroke or damaging clot than those who took aspirin in a
study of 5,600 patients who couldn&#8217;t use warfarin, researchers
said today at the European Society of Cardiology conference in
Stockholm. Apixaban and aspirin showed a similar risk of major
bleeding, a feared side effect of blood thinners, according to
the study, dubbed Averroes after a 12th century Islamic
philosopher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The use of aspirin will probably be reduced after this
study,&#8221; said Harald Arnesen, a professor at Ullevaal University
Hospital in Oslo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warfarin typically reduces the rate of stroke 40 percent
more than aspirin, Larry Biegelsen, a New York-based analyst for
Wells Fargo Securities, wrote in a note to investors on Aug. 30.
That&#8217;s a less potent effect than apixaban showed in today&#8217;s
trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results from the larger 18,000-patient Aristotle study
comparing apixaban with warfarin in patients with an irregular
heartbeat called atrial fibrillation are expected in the first
half of next year, Tim Anderson, a New York-based analyst with
Bernstein Research, said today in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xarelto Results &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Aspirin isn&#8217;t the recommended treatment simply because
there&#8217;s significant amounts of clinical data that shows that in
fact protection is greater on warfarin,&#8221; said Nick Turner, a
London-based analyst at Mirabaud Securities, in a telephone
interview today. &#8220;So exactly how well a drug compares to
aspirin is probably not that significant.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xarelto matched the standard therapy of Sanofi-Aventis SA&#8217;s
Lovenox plus warfarin at blocking blood clots in the lungs and
legs, researchers said today in a study of more than 3,400
patients. Some 2.1 percent of those in the Xarelto group
developed clots compared with 3 percent of people taking the
older standard treatments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients who took Xarelto were 33 percent less likely to
develop either clots or major internal bleeding, Bayer said. The
Leverkusen, Germany-based drugmaker is developing Xarelto with
Johnson  Johnson. About 8.1 percent of patients in both
treatment groups developed serious bleeding, the study found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company designed the study, dubbed Einstein-DVT, to see
whether the once-a-day pill could match the existing therapies,
which are &#8220;very, very effective,&#8221; said lead researcher Harry Bueller, of Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bayer&#8217;s Plans &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medicines to prevent clots after knee surgery or in the
lungs and legs are a small part of the blood thinner market,
said Flemming Oernskov, head of the women&#8217;s health and general
medicine unit at Bayer. The much bigger market is in atrial
fibrillation, Oernskov said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bayer has said it plans to present its trial on Xarelto
versus warfarin in atrial fibrillation patients at the American
Heart Association conference in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think that when all indications are there, we have all
the trials and it has worked out well, it could be for us as a
company over 2 billion euros in annual revenue,&#8221; the Bayer
executive said. &#8220;You can imagine this market will be several
factors higher than the 2 billion euros.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. asked a federal
judge to throw out a lawsuit by bankrupt Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc., accusing the bank of helping cause its collapse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based lender, in papers filed with U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge James M. Peck in Manhattan on Aug. 25, said
that when the securities firm teetered on the brink of collapse
in 2008, it was the only major bank that continued to extend
credit to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPMorgan typically extended more than $100 billion in
credit each day to LBI for the settlement and clearance of its
securities transactions,&#8221; the bank&#8217;s attorneys said in the
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is scheduled to be tried in 2012 in U.S.
bankruptcy court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers, with $639 billion in assets, filed the
biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history in September 2008. In May,
the New York-based firm sued the bank, alleging that JPMorgan
took advantage of the stricken firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;On the brink of LBHI&#8217;s bankruptcy, JPMorgan leveraged its
life and death power as the brokerage firm&#8217;s primary clearing
bank to force LBHI into a series of one-sided agreements and to
siphon billions of dollars in critically needed assets,&#8221; Lehman
said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Securities, Real Estate &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peck in March approved the bank&#8217;s return of $9 billion in
illiquid securities and difficult-to-value real estate to
Lehman, and its taking back cash and collateral from the firm.
The combatants reserved the right to later challenge and defend
the legitimacy of their claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman, in its May complaint, alleged JPMorgan -- which was
its main short-term lender before the bankruptcy -- helped cause
its collapse by demanding $8.6 billion in collateral as credit
markets contracted in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan &#8220;could have avoided the vast bulk of its exposure
by declining to extend credit to LBI on any morning,&#8221; the
lender&#8217;s lawyers said in their request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy case is In Re: Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc., 08-13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adversarial proceeding is Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
v. JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 10-03266, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Axcel A/S, the private-equity owner
of jewelry maker Pandora A/S, retained JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and Nordea Bank AB for
a possible initial public offering of the Danish company, three
people familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock sale may happen as early as September, according
to one of the people, who declined to be identified because the
information isn&#8217;t public. Axcel has yet to decide how much it
may seek from selling its stake in the Copenhagen-based jeweler,
according to the person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are a number of possible exit routes for Pandora,
one of which is an IPO but we haven&#8217;t crossed that bridge yet,&#8221;
said Christian Frigast, a Copenhagen-based managing partner at
Axcel. He declined to comment on whether the firm had hired the
four banks for an IPO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axcel owns a 59.3 percent stake in Pandora, which it bought
in 2008, according to the private equity firm&#8217;s website. Frigast
said in March that an IPO would be the &#8220;preferred exit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankfurt-based JPMorgan spokesman Axel Luedeke, Goldman
Sachs spokeswoman Sophie Bullock and Morgan Stanley spokesman
Michael Wang in London declined to comment. Claus Christensen,
Nordea&#8217;s Copenhagen-based spokesman, wasn&#8217;t immediately
available to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pandora said in May that profit surged last year, posting
net income of 1 billion Danish kroner ($171 million) on revenue
of 3.46 billion kroner. Pandora, which sells its gold and silver
charm bracelets through about 10,000 outlets worldwide, this
year is seeking to expand its retail network in eastern Europe
and Brazil, where it opened its first stores in December, Chief
Executive Officer Mikkel Vendelin Olesen said in May. It also
plans to enter Italy, Hong Kong and China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Americas accounted for 45 percent of Pandora&#8217;s revenue
last year, while the company got 35 percent and 20 percent of
sales in Europe and Asia Pacific, respectively. Pandora&#8217;s
jewelry retails from $20 to $1,500. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s Sony Corp. was sued by a
unit of U.S. defense contractor L-3 Communications Holdings Inc.
and accused of infringing two patents for image sensors used in
digital still and video cameras, computers and security systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L-3 asked for a jury trial, unspecified damages and a
permanent injunction against infringing products, in an Aug. 27
lawsuit in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based company&#8217;s &#8220;extensive patent portfolio
protects L-3&#8217;s considerable investment in its research-and-
development efforts,&#8221; and Sony should pay license fees, L-3
said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony is accused of infringing patents 5,541,654 and
5,452,004, which were issued in September 1995 and July 1996,
respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L-3, which reported $15.6 billion in sales last year, said
in a statement yesterday that its Nova Engineering unit won a
$52.8 million contract from the U.S. Defense Department to
support a Marine Corps&#8217; sensor systems program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mack Araki, a Sony spokesman in New York, said the company
doesn&#8217;t comment on pending litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L-3 is represented by Steven J. Balick, Lauren E. Maguire
and Andrew C. Mayo of Wilmington&#8217;s Ashby  Geddes PA, and John
R. Emerson, Theodore G. Baroody and Donald E. Tiller of Haynes 
Boone LLP of Dallas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is L-3 Communications Corp. v. Sony corp., 10-cv-
734, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philips Wins Court Ruling Over Patents on Recordable CD-ROMs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Philips Electronics NV, Europe&#8217;s biggest consumer-
electronics maker, won a U.S. appeals court ruling that it
didn&#8217;t misuse patents in its licensing program for recordable
CD-ROMs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judges rejected arguments by Taiwanese disc maker Princo
Corp. that Philips should be barred from enforcing its patent
rights, according to a filing yesterday by the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington. Princo accused
Philips of using an agreement with Sony Corp. to suppress Sony
technology that would compete with an industry standard on the
CD-ROMs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Princo was using the argument to defend itself against
patent-infringement claims brought by Amsterdam-based Philips
before the U.S. International Trade Commission. The eight-year-
old case was heard before the 10 active judges of the appeals
court, who were asked to consider when patent owners should be
penalized for exceeding their rights. The judges said the
argument should be used sparingly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This court has not applied the doctrine of patent misuse
expansively,&#8221; the judges said in the ruling. &#8220;In this case, we
adhere to that approach.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case centered on an agreement reached between Philips
and Tokyo-based Sony in the late 1980s and 1990s over competing
technology they developed to ensure compact discs could be used
on different machines. The companies settled on the Philips
technology as the standard, while including Sony patents as part
of an overall pool of inventions available in a single license. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Princo, based in Hsinchu, Taiwan, argued that, because of
the agreement to not license the Sony technology separately,
Philips was misusing its power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In this case the assertion of misuse arises not from the
terms of the license itself but rather from an alleged
collateral agreement between Sony and Philips,&#8221; the court
wrote. &#8220;In that setting, the doctrine of patent misuse does not
immunize Princo against the legal effect of its acts of
infringement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philips and Sony were within their rights to chose &#8220;not to
compete with their own joint venture,&#8221; the court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Circuit decision may force defendants in patent
cases to rely more on antitrust law as an argument of unfair
behavior by patent owners, said Lance Reich, a patent lawyer
with Woodcock Washburn in Seattle who was following the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to imagine a case where you have patent misuse
and don&#8217;t have an antitrust violation,&#8221; Reich said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Princo Corp. v. International Trade Commission,
2007-1386, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
(Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salix, Norgine End Patent Infringement Suit Against Novel &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd. and Norgine BV settled a patent-
infringement suit with Novel Laboratories Inc., the companies
said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norgine, a Netherlands-based pharmaceutical company, owns
patent 7,169,381, for a colon-cleansing compound. Salix, based
in Morrisville, North Carolina, is the U.S. licensee for the
patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 2008 they sued Somerset, New Jersey-based Novel,
claiming a product for which Novel was seeking regulatory
approval, infringed the patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the settlement agreement, Novel receives a license
through September 2018 to intellectual property covering a
generic version of the Moviprep colon cleanser. Under a separate
agreement Novel will manufacture and supply Moviprep to Salix,
providing the North Carolina-based company with a domestic
source of the product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial terms of the agreement weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Salix Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Novel
Laboratories Inc., 3:02-cv-02311-FLW-TJMB, U.S. District Court,
District of New Jersey (Trenton). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Corp. Unit Sued Over Broadcast of Brad Pitt Motorcycle Fall &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News Corp.&#8217;s Fox News Network unit was sued for copyright
infringement over its use of footage of actor Brad Pitt falling
off his motorcycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint filed Aug. 25 in federal court
in Los Angeles, Fox has used and rebroadcast video footage
originally licensed only to Fox&#8217;s TMZ unit for a limited period
of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Media2Air Inc. says it sent Fox repeated cease-and-desist
notices, and was told by counsel for Fox that its use of the
footage was permissible under copyright law. The work was
available through a Fox website through July 2010, Meda2Air
claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint quotes Rupert Murdoch, News Corp.&#8217;s chairman,
condemning copyright law&#8217;s &#8220;fair use&#8221; provision. According to
the complaint, Murdoch has said of fair use he thinks courts
&#8220;would bar it altogether.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Media2Air says it&#8217;s damaged by Fox&#8217;s use of the footage,
and asked the court for money damages, profits Fox realized in
connection with its alleged infringement, attorney fees and
litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is represented by M. Cris Armenta of the
Armenta Law Firm APC of Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Media2 Air Inc., v. Fox News Network LLC, 2:10-
cv-06346-CBM-JEM, U.S. District Court, Central District of
California (Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, Sanrio, DC Comics Sue Chicago &#8216;Bounce House&#8217; Owner &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Walt Disney Co., Sanrio Co., and DC Comics sued a
Chicago supplier of &#8220;bounce houses&#8221; for copyright
infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bounce houses, sometimes known as &#8220;moonwalks&#8221; are
inflatable enclosures commonly used at children&#8217;s birthday
parties and other child-centered events. Chicago Moonwalks Inc.
is accused of infringing a wide range of copyrights and
trademarks associated with the three companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the copyrights and trademarks the company is accused
of infringing are Disney&#8217;s Snow White, Cinderella and Ariel,
Sanrio&#8217;s Hello Kitty, and DC Comics Batman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint filed Aug. 26 in federal court
in Chicago, the moonwalks company is selling, renting and
offering children&#8217;s party services that incorporate the
characters belonging to Disney, Sanrio and DC Comics. Chicago
Moonwalks is accused of deliberately infringing the trademarks
and copyrights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moonwalk company&#8217;s actions have confused consumers into
believing an actual connection or sponsorship agreement exists
between itself and the copyright holders, according to court
papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, Sanrio and DC Comics asked the court to bar the
Chicago company from further infringement, and seeks destruction
of all allegedly infringing products and promotional material.
They also seek damages of $200,000 for each trademark infringed,
as much as $150,000 for each copyright infringed, additional
damages as much as $2 million, and three times the profits the
defendant realized from each act of infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also requested awards of attorney fees, litigation
costs, and extra damages intended to punish the defendant for
its actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three content-owning companies are represented by Mark
V. B. Partridge and Colin T.J. O&#8217;Brien of Partridge IP Law PC of
Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Disney Enterprises Inc., v. Chicago Moonwalks
Inc., 1:10-cv-05405, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
Illinois (Chicago) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Suggests Minimum Damages in Righthaven Copyright Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Righthaven LLC, the entity that has sued more than 100
website operators for allegedly infringing copyrights to stories
appearing in the Las Vegas Review-Journal, received a setback in
one of its recent cases, the Las Vegas Sun reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magistrate Judge Robert Johnson told counsel for Righthaven
that an infringement suit against a website belonging to a
Boston-based cat-fancier could be settled for &#8220;a lot less than
four figures&#8221; according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although typical demands in the cases have been for $75,000
and forfeiture of website names, some cases have settled for
$5,000 or less and some defendants have been able to hang on to
their website names, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the newspaper, Las Vegas-based Righthaven is
jointing owned by local attorney Steven Gibson and members of
the family of Arkansas investment banking billionaire Warren
Stephens, whose family also owns Stephens Media Inc. and the Las
Vegas Review-Journal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sav Mor Pharmacy, Savemore Grocery Battle Over Trademarks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Bahamian pharmacy has asked the nation&#8217;s Supreme Court to
bar a Freeport, Bahamas, supermarket from using the name
&#8220;Savemore,&#8221; the Bahamas Tribune reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sav-Mor Pharmacy, also in Freeport, claims the
supermarket name will confuse the public and its suppliers,
according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counsel acting for the supermarket told the Tribune that
the words &#8220;save&#8221; and &#8220;more&#8221; are generic terms not entitled
to protection. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s experimental blood
thinner apixaban beat aspirin in a study that may open the door
to a $10 billion-a-year market to prevent clots that cause
strokes and deadly lung damage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients who took the Pfizer drug were 54 percent less
likely to have a stroke or damaging clot than those who took
aspirin in a study of 5,600 patients who couldn&#8217;t use the
standard therapy warfarin, researchers said today at the
European Society of Cardiology conference in Stockholm. Apixaban
and aspirin showed a similar risk of major bleeding, a feared
side effect of blood thinners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About half of the 2.2 million Americans with atrial
fibrillation, an irregular heartbeat that increases the
likelihood of clots, don&#8217;t take warfarin because of side effects
or the need for constant monitoring, studies show. Today&#8217;s
results leave &#8220;no competition for apixaban in the foreseeable
future&#8221; for that group of patients and signal the drug could
challenge warfarin, said lead investigator Stuart Connolly, of
the Population Health Research Institute at McMaster University
in Ontario, Canada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You can definitely conclude that apixaban is going to
have a markedly improved safety profile compared to warfarin,&#8221;
Connolly said in an interview in Stockholm. &#8220;You can also
anticipate that apixaban is going to be at least as good as
warfarin and probably better than warfarin in efficacy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warfarin typically reduces the rate of stroke 40 percent
more than aspirin, Larry Biegelsen, a New York-based analyst for
Wells Fargo Securities, wrote in a note to investors on Aug. 30.
That&#8217;s a lower rate than apixaban showed in today&#8217;s trial.
Results from a larger 18,000-patient study comparing apixaban
with warfarin in atrial fibrillation patients are expected early
next year, Barbara Ryan, an analyst with Deutsche Bank in New
York, said in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replacing Warfarin &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, partnering with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., is racing
to challenge German drugmaker Boehringer-Ingelheim GmbH in the
market for pills to replace warfarin. Crafted from rat poison 65
years ago, warfarin can cause fatal bleeding at high doses and
leave patients vulnerable to clots if too little is given. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aspirin is the only alternative now for irregular heartbeat
patients for whom warfarin is too risky, Connolly said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a major advance for these patients,&#8221; the
researcher said. &#8220;The effects are really important to
individuals, and they&#8217;re going to be important to society.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atrial fibrillation means the heart doesn&#8217;t properly pump
blood out of its upper chamber, allowing it to pool and clot,
according to the American Heart Association. A stroke can result
if part of that clot breaks off and gets lodged in the artery to
the brain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trial Stopped &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and Bristol-Myers, both based in New York, stopped
their Averroes study comparing apixaban to aspirin ahead of
schedule in June, after an early analysis showed it cut the rate
of strokes and certain clots. Both companies are looking for new
drugs to plug a hole in revenue after their top-selling pills
face generic competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer will start losing the majority of revenue next year
for its cholesterol pill Lipitor, the top-selling drug in the
world with $11.4 billion in sales last year. Meanwhile, Bristol-
Myers is likely to face competition in the U.S. in 2012 for
Plavix, the anti-clotting drug it markets with Sanofi-Aventis
SA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies may ask regulators to approve apixaban for
irregular heartbeat patients on the basis of the Averroes trial
alone, Seamus Fernandez, an analyst with Leerink Swann  Co.,
wrote in a note to investors on Aug. 30. The market for warfarin
replacements may be worth $10 billion to $20 billion a year,
Fernandez wrote in an earlier note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bayer Data &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apixaban may face competition from Xarelto, an anti-clot
pill from Bayer AG and Johnson  Johnson, as well as from
Boehringer Ingelheim&#8217;s Pradaxa. In a separate study released at
the meeting in Stockholm today, Bayer said Xarelto was as safe
and effective as the standard therapy of Sanofi-Aventis SA&#8217;s
Lovenox plus warfarin at preventing blood clots in the lungs and
legs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bayer has said it will issue data on how its blood thinner
Xarelto matched up against warfarin at the American Heart
Association&#8217;s meeting in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is
scheduled to review Pradaxa on Sept. 20. The blood thinner beat
warfarin at preventing strokes in atrial fibrillation patients
last year in a trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These medications are going to change the practice in the
United States," Ralph Brindis, president of the American College
of Cardiology and a cardiologist at Oakland Medical Center, told
journalists before today&#8217;s results were released. Being first to
market in the U.S. "is huge," he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mexican police apprehended a
suspected Texas-born drug trafficker, known as &#8220;La Barbie&#8221; for
his blond hair and fair complexion, who U.S. authorities say has
smuggled thousands of kilograms of cocaine into the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edgar Valdez Villareal, an alleged leader of the Beltran
Leyva Cartel, was captured yesterday in central Mexico after a
yearlong investigation, the Attorney General&#8217;s Office said. U.S.
authorities had offered a $2 million reward for his arrest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valdez Villareal became a top member of the drug gang after
the Mexican Navy killed founder Arturo Beltran Leyva in
December, analysts such as Jorge Chabat said. His organization
has been battling the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas for control of
smuggling routes the traffickers use to send cocaine, marijuana
and heroin to the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He was a very violent kingpin, he was a fearsome
criminal,&#8221; said Chabat, a political science professor and
expert in security issues at the Center for Economic Research
and Teaching in Mexico City. &#8220;The fact that he was arrested
alive makes this a success in all aspects.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La Barbie is suspected of taking a leading role in drug
trafficking in the Pacific resort of Acapulco, according to
information reported by Foro TV. The report said Valdez is
bilingual and enjoys luxury cars and designer clothes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jaime Lopez-Aranda, a researcher at Mexico City&#8217;s Center
for Research for Development, said Valdez directed teams of
hitmen first for the Sinaloa Cartel, and then for the Beltran
Leyva Cartel after he joined that group. He fought against rival
traffickers for narcotics shipping routes in the west-central
states of Guerrero, Morelos and Michoacan, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cocaine Trafficking &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valdez Villareal was indicted by a federal grand jury in
June for allegedly importing thousands of kilograms of cocaine
to the eastern U.S. from 2004 to 2006. The indictment said he
was born in Laredo, Texas, and is 36 years old. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The question now it&#8217;s if he&#8217;s going to be extradited,&#8221;
Chabat said. &#8220;He&#8217;s a hot potato; the most reasonable response
will be to extradite him,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Felipe Calderon referred to Valdez Villareal as
&#8220;one of the most-sought-after criminals in Mexico and abroad&#8221;
in statements published on Twitter yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico&#8217;s drug cartels generate as much as $30 billion a
year selling marijuana, cocaine and heroin to users in the U.S.,
according to data from the U.S. State Department. Related
violence has killed more than 28,000 since Calderon came to
office in December 2006, mostly people involved in the drug
trade or officials fighting against them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, Mexican military personnel killed Ignacio
&#8220;Nacho&#8221; Coronel, a top ally of billionaire Sinaloa Cartel head
Joaquin &#8220;El Chapo&#8221; Guzman in the Mexican state of Jalisco. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. sold $484.6
million of bonds backed by a loan to Centro Properties Group,
the Australian shopping center owner that said in July it
received a loan extension on $2.3 billion in debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest top-rated portion of the bond, containing $272
million in debt maturing in 10 years, yields 165 basis points
more than the benchmark swap rate, according to a person
familiar with the sale who declined to be identified because
terms aren&#8217;t public. Similar securities sold in 2006 and 2007,
when property values peaked in the U.S., yesterday yielded about
2.68 percentage points more than Treasuries maturing in about
the same time, according to Barclays Plc data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street is seeking to revive the market for bonds
backed by commercial property loans after issuance plummeted 95
percent to $11.2 billion in 2008 from a record $234 billion in
2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. JPMorgan&#8217;s Centro
deal is the sixth sale this year. The most recent offering, also
tied to a single loan, was a $660 million deal for Vornado
Realty Trust last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half of this year&#8217;s sales have been linked to properties of
a single borrower. In 2007, offerings of as much as $7.6 billion
contained as many as 300 loans from multiple U.S. borrowers,
Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commercial property values have tumbled 41 percent since
2007, according to the Moody&#8217;s/REAL Commercial Property Price
Index. Landlords are having trouble paying off existing loans
amid tighter underwriting standards and lower occupancy rates
for hotels, skyscrapers, apartments and warehouses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Centro&#8217;s net loss for the year ended June 30 was A$652.7
million ($582.9 million) compared with a net loss of A$3.5
billion a year earlier, the Melbourne-based company said in a
statement to the Australian stock exchange yesterday. The
company wrote down A$487.9 million of properties, compared with
A$2.7 billion last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares slipped 5.7 percent yesterday after it announced
results. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. agreed to buy closely
held FoldRx Pharmaceuticals Inc. as it looks to expand into
medicines for rare disorders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FoldRx, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is focused on
developing treatments for conditions caused by the improper
folding of proteins, Pfizer said today in a statement. Financial
terms of the deal weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal fits with Pfizer&#8217;s strategy of focusing on
medicines for niche diseases, Geno Germano, head of Pfizer&#8217;s
specialty care unit, said in a telephone interview. Pfizer set
up a research division in June focused on developing medicines
for orphan diseases, classified as conditions affecting less
than 200,000 people. More than 30 million Americans have one of
6,000 orphan diseases, according to the National Organization
for Rare Disorders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Within our research organization we established a
specific research unit focused on rare disorders and this fits
nicely into that area of focus,&#8221; Germano said today. &#8220;Rare
diseases are an aspect of our portfolio that we think is very
attractive, and we are eager to see and continue development.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, contacted FoldRx
eight weeks ago after one of its researchers saw a scientific
poster presented by the company, Richard Labaudiniere, FoldRx&#8217;s
chief executive officer, said in a telephone interview. He said
the company was founded in 2004 from a technology project
developed at the Scripps Research Institute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipitor Copies &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is looking to make acquisitions to help offset some
of the revenue it will start losing next year when generic
copies enter the market of its Lipitor cholesterol pill, the
world&#8217;s top-selling medicine with $11.4 billion in 2009 sales.
Pfizer Chief Financial Officer Frank D&#8217;Amelio said in August
that the drugmaker is looking for &#8220;bolt-on transactions&#8221; worth
as much as &#8220;several billion&#8221; dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, based in New York, rose 37 cents, or 2.3 percent,
to $16.28 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FoldRx&#8217;s most advanced drug, tafamidis meglumine, is in the
final stages of testing required to get regulatory approval in
the U.S. to treat transthyretin amyloid polyneuropathy, a fatal
disorder of the nervous system that affects about 8,000 people
worldwide, Labaudiniere said. The condition starts in most
patients around age 40 and kills them within 10 years, he said.
The company had filed for approval of the treatment in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Development &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FoldRx is also working on drugs in earlier stages of
testing for Parkinson&#8217;s disease, Huntington&#8217;s disease, cystic
fibrosis, and a rare heart condition called transthyretin
amyloid cardiomyopathy. All of its research is focused on
developing chemical compounds, rather than injectable biologics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treatments designated by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration as orphan medicines get an additional seven years
of market exclusivity in addition to the standard 20 years of
patent protection, according to the FDA website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s financial adviser on the acquisition was Jefferies
 Co. and its legal adviser was Ropes  Gray LLP. Goldman, Sachs
 Co. served as FoldRx&#8217;s financial adviser, while Mintz, Levin,
Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo P.C., provided legal advice. &lt;/p&gt;

companies including Medco Health Solutions Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sachdev will join New York-based JPMorgan&#8217;s health-care

&lt;p&gt;Sachdev advised Medco on its $730 million agreement to buy
United BioSource Corp., and IMS Health Inc. on its $5.2 billion
leveraged buyout earlier this year. Before joining Frankfurt-

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. was forced to shut
one of two crude-distillation units at its Sarpom refinery in
Trecate, Italy, after a fire broke out yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fire was extinguished after half an hour and there were
no injuries, Antonella Sopranzetti, a Rome-based spokeswoman for
the company, said today by mobile phone. Demand is being met
from the site&#8217;s other crude processor, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An investigation into the cause of the fire is being
carried out and no timeframe for the start of the idled crude
unit is available yet, Sopranzetti said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery near Milan has the capacity to process 230,000
barrels of oil a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Irving, Texas-based Exxon has a 74.1 percent stake in the
refinery and Italy&#8217;s ERG SpA holds the rest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European real commercial estate
shares may rise as much as 20 percent over the next year as
investors buy stocks currently trading more than 25 percent
below the value of company assets, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Land Securities Group Plc, Capital  Counties Properties
Plc and Alstria Office REIT-AG, JPMorgan&#8217;s top picks, may gain
as much as 30 percent over the period, London-based analysts
including Harm Meijer said in their annual property handbook
published today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The glass is half full for the listed property sector,&#8221;
the analysts said. &#8220;Most balance sheets are sorted out, most
stocks own quality assets or have exposure to the &#8216;right&#8217;
sectors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. real estate investment trusts have slumped 67 percent
since their introduction January 2007. That&#8217;s even after they
rebounded by more than 70 percent from lows reached in March
last year. European property stocks tracked by JPMorgan are
trading at an average 28 percent discount to net asset value, it
said. That gap may attract generalist investors as well as
specialists in real estate, Meijer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shops and offices in London&#8217;s West End district have the
best prospects in the next 12 months, according to the report.
Retail property values in central London may rise by almost 5
percent a year until 2014. West End offices could increase more
than 3 percent annually. Rents may surge by 47 percent in the
West End and 45 percent in the City of London financial district
over the period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares Rise &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Land Securities, which has 63 percent of its assets in
central London, rose 3 percent in London trading today, the most
in eight weeks. Capital  Counties, which focuses on shops in
central London&#8217;s Covent Garden district, advanced as much as 0.6
percent to 118.2 pence, its highest since May 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alstria, Germany&#8217;s first REIT focusing on offices, has a
quality portfolio with long leases and managed to refinance
without needing to sell new shares, JPMorgan said. The stock
climbed as much as 3.8 percent, the most in six weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a worst-case scenario, such as deflation, property stock
prices across the market could fall as much as 20 percent,
JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, has appointed Ray Eyles as chief
executive officer of its commodities business in Asia, according
to an e-mail sent to Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eyles, 40, was the global head of commodity proprietary
trading based in London, and he will replace Oral Dawe in
Singapore, who will be retiring, the e-mail said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has told traders who bet on commodities for the
firm&#8217;s account that their unit will be closed as the company,
starts to shut all proprietary trading, according to a person
briefed on the matter. The bank eventually will close all in-
house trading to comply with new U.S. curbs, said the person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Oral and Ray will work closely on a transition plan,&#8221;
Blythe Masters, head of the bank&#8217;s global commodities group,
said in the e-mail. &#8220;Ray has a long-term connection in the
region, having worked in Singapore twice previously.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eyles, who joined JPMorgan in 1988, was formerly chief
executive officer for Europe, Middle East and Africa commodities;
co-head of global commodities; and head of global metals and
agriculture, the e-mail said. He was based in Singapore from
1997 to 2000, and again from 2005 to 2007 to start and then
develop JPMorgan&#8217;s Asian commodity business, the e-mail said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dawe, who is Asia-Pacific chief executive officer of the
bank&#8217;s global commodities group, joined JPMorgan in 2008 from
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., where he was co-head of Asia
commodities. Under him, the bank &#8220;built a first-class franchise
through our sales and trading capabilities across the region and
in establishing and strengthening our operations in both
physical and financial products,&#8221; Masters said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan &#8220;is ripe&#8221; for more mergers
and acquisitions as companies have ample cash and the level of
takeover activity is lower than it should be, according to
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese companies should consolidate in industries where
there is excessive competition, and be more aggressive in making
acquisitions in Asia, where the long-term growth potential is
high, Kathy Matsui, chief strategist for Goldman in Japan said
today. Corporate cash balances are at record highs, the yen is
near its strongest level in 15 years, share valuations are low
and companies are selling cross-held shares, making mergers and
acquisitions more attractive, Goldman said in a report on Aug.
28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Increased MA is likely to be positive for Japan as a
whole since it can lead to higher growth potential and result in
economies of scale to enable Japanese firms to compete more
effectively in global markets,&#8221; said Matsui in e-mailed
comments today. &#8220;Despite being flush with cash, the absolute
level of Japanese MA is nowhere where it should be.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Japanese MA activity has been sluggish since 2005,
deals this quarter have increased 28 percent to $22 billion on a
quarter-on-quarter basis, Matsui and five other analysts and
strategists wrote in the report. The yen is near a 15-year high
against the dollar, giving Japanese companies more buying power
abroad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conducive to MAs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan is &#8220;growing ripe for increased MA,&#8221; as about 70
percent of companies on the Topix stock index&#8217;s first section
trade below book value, the report said. The Topix&#8217;s price-to-
book ratio is at 0.97, its lowest level since April last year,
according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese companies spent $120 million in the first half of
this year to acquire Japanese enterprises, according to the
report. That was a six-fold increase as Chinese firms sought to
gain brands, technology and distribution networks, Matsui said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, a sell-off of crossholdings is increasing the
percentage of free-float shares on the market, which will make
acquisitions easier, Matsui wrote. The ratio of crossheld shares
to free-float shares fell to 32.6 percent in March from 34.8
percent a year earlier, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the amount of cash held by nonfinancial
companies on the Topix&#8217;s first section reached a record high of
$580 billion in March, increasing the &#8220;firepower for
acquisitions,&#8221; the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asian Takeovers Increasing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the environment has become even more conducive
to increased Japanese MA activity,&#8221; Matsui wrote in the report.
&#8220;In terms of cross-border Japanese MA, Asia-linked
transactions are on the rise.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asian transactions are increasing and account for 20
percent of MAs involving Japanese companies, compared with 4
percent in 2000, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shinkin Asset Management Co., which manages the equivalent
of $3.8 billion in Tokyo, said an increase in MA activity will
boost Japan&#8217;s stock market as benefits can be derived from
owning company shares on both the acquiring side and the
companies that are bought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Japanese companies that buy firms abroad may see their
stock prices jump on expectations that their business will grow.
We can hope for a premium for the companies that are being
bought,&#8221; said Hiroshi Fujimoto, a fund manager at Shinkin Asset.
&#8220;While it&#8217;s hard to know which companies will be involved in
MAs beforehand, we are always watching stocks with low price-
to-book valuations as they are easier targets for takeovers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies likely to be involved in MA activity include
those with high internal rates of return, companies that have at
least $2 billion cash and subsidiaries that may be acquired by
their parent, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies that have high internal rates of return include
Elpida Memory Inc., Renesas Electronics Corp. and Kawasaki Kisen
Kaisha Ltd., according to the report. Toyota Motor Corp., Honda
Motor Co., and Denso Corp. have cash for acquisitions, while
Oriental Yeast Co., NS Solutions Corp. and Nissin Electric Co.
are subsidiaries that may be absorbed by their parents, the
report said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. reached a long-term
agreement with Time Warner Cable Inc. that keeps ESPN&#8217;s football
games and ABC&#8217;s comedy &#8220;Modern Family&#8221; on the air for the
cable operator&#8217;s almost 13 million video customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time Warner Cable agreed to add Disney Junior, ESPN 3D,
ESPN3.com and ESPN Goal Line to a lineup that includes ESPN
sports, Disney family fare and ABC shows, the companies said
today in a statement. Time Warner Cable subscribers will also
get expanded video-on-demand services for ABC and other Disney
offerings. Financial terms weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney and Time Warner Cable executives negotiated through
the night to avoid programming blackouts after their contract
expired Sept. 1. Sticking points included terms for the
ESPN3.com website and Disney Junior, the preschool service
Disney is converting from SoapNet, a person familiar with the
negotiations said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time Warner Cable, based in New York, isn&#8217;t paying a
specific monthly fee per subscriber for its video customers to
access ESPN3.com, Alex Dudley, a spokesman, said in an
interview. Last week, Disney was said to have requested 10 cents
a month per Web customer for ESPN3.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESPN3.com will be free to Time Warner Cable customers who
get ESPN, Dudley said. Time Warner Cable agreed to provide
ESPN3.com to subscribers as part of a package of online rights
it acquired for ESPN, ESPN2 and ESPNU, Dudley said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ESPN Web service was negotiated as part of the
company&#8217;s &#8220;TV Everywhere&#8221; initiative, which makes cable
channels available on the Internet to current video subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;College, Pro Sports &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burbank, California-based Disney was probably seeking at
least 50 cents per subscriber a month for ABC, and as much as a
10 percent increase in its cable fees, said Andrew Kim, an
analyst at Macquarie Capital in New York. ESPN, the most
expensive channel on the dial, received $4.08 per customer on
average a month from pay-TV operators last year, while the
Disney Channel brought in 88 cents a month per subscriber,
according to researcher SNL Kagan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESPN Goal Line, an exclusive once-a-week network developed
for Time Warner Cable&#8217;s premium sports subscribers, will
highlight match-ups and scoring drives each Saturday during the
NCAA college football season. A similar service called ESPN
Buzzer Beater will be available for college basketball. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buzzer Beater &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goal Line and Buzzer Beater are two examples of the
creativity that went into reaching this deal,&#8221; said Chris LaPlaca, a spokesman for ESPN in Bristol, Connecticut. &#8220;They
are part of the reason why this is the most expansive content
agreement Disney has ever signed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accord allows the second-largest U.S. cable operator to
keep carrying college and National Football League games on
ESPN, as well as ABC programs such as &#8220;Desperate Housewives&#8221;
and the ABC Family and Disney channels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time Warner Cable gained 72 cents to $54.70 today in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. Disney added 40 cents to
$33.91. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For about two decades, the owners of broadcast networks
traded rights to their signals to gain pickup for their cable
networks or better channel positioning. Disney, like other
broadcast network owners, has been seeking fees for its ABC
network, in addition to asking for higher prices for its cable
networks and introducing new Web fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time Warner Cable has tried to control costs by resisting
increased fee demands. In national campaigns, Chief Executive
Officer Glenn Britt has asked subscribers to pressure
programmers to keep costs low. Britt argued that higher fees
ultimately are billed to the customer and that network
programming is free on the Internet and over the air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cable operator negotiated the Disney deal on behalf of
Bright House Networks&#8217; 2.4 million customers in Florida,
California, Indiana, Michigan and Alabama. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Todd Shields" date="Sep 02, 2010  3:12 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-02/u-s-may-ease-path-to-new-devices-for-microsoft-hewlett-packard.html"><headline>U.S May Ease Path to New Devices for Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators set a vote on
letting companies such as Microsoft Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co.
and Motorola Inc. offer devices that use airwaves between
television channels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rules to prevent the wireless devices from interfering with
TV channels will be taken up at the Sept. 23 meeting of the
Federal Communications Commission, the agency said in an e-
mailed notice today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FCC approved frequencies for use by the devices in
2008, rejecting claims by broadcasters that the transmissions
could disrupt TV signals. Since then, the agency has been
considering the rules against interference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies &#8220;plan to accelerate ongoing investments&#8221; for
devices using the airwaves once rules are made final, Microsoft,
Hewlett-Packard, Motorola, Dell Inc. and Google Inc. said in a
July 19 letter to the FCC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The airwaves to be made available are better able to
penetrate walls than airwaves commonly used for WiFi wireless
communications today, and devices can attain greater range with
the same power, the companies said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FCC should take care to protect &#8220;tens of millions of
TV receivers&#8221; in setting rules, the Washington-based National
Association of Broadcasters said in an Aug. 27 letter. Also
signing the letter was MSTV, the Association for Maximum Service
Television, the broadcast industry&#8217;s Washington-based trade
group for technology issues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mexico will accelerate its
transition to digital-television broadcasts, boosting
competition against Grupo Televisa SA (TLEVICPO) and freeing up airwaves
that can be used for high-speed wireless Internet access. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition will begin next year and will be complete in
2015, six years earlier than planned, President Felipe Calderon
said today in Mexico City. In a presidential order published
today, he told government officials to begin preparing Mexicans
for the transition by assuring that digital tuners will be
imported and sold at fair prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The digital transition will create more openings for new TV
networks, Calderon said. That may invite new challenges to
Televisa, which gets about 70 percent of Mexico&#8217;s broadcast-TV
audience, and TV Azteca SA, which has most of the rest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2012, the transition will have freed up airwaves in the
700-megahertz spectrum band, Calderon said. ATT Inc. and
Verizon Wireless won U.S. spectrum in that same band in a 2008
auction, saying those airwaves were ideal for high-speed mobile
communications because of their ability to penetrate walls and
cover large areas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s fixed-income
research group was voted No. 1 in Institutional Investor
magazine&#8217;s poll of U.S. money managers, who awarded the firm a
record 55 rankings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magazine surveyed more than 1,100 investors and
analysts at about 440 institutions managing almost $9 trillion
in U.S. fixed-income assets. JPMorgan, which took first place in
26 of the categories, supplanted the former Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. research operations bought by Barclays Capital,
which had reigned for a decade, the  annual poll showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve benefited a lot from the global nature of our
franchise and our research team,&#8221; said Terry Belton, Chicago-
based global head of fixed-income strategy at JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belton leads the top-ranked team in interest-rate
derivatives and, along with New York-based JPMorgan analyst
Srini Ramaswamy, is joint head of the first-placed general
strategy team, according to the magazine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joyce Chang, global head of the bank&#8217;s credit research
department in New York, and strategist Luis Oganes both got top
billings in emerging-market categories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Acciavatti, head of U.S. high-yield and leveraged

for the eighth straight year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barclays&#8217;s Michael Pond&#8217;s team took top position for
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities for the third year,
while the U.K. bank&#8217;s Peter DeGroot headed the No. 1 group for
municipals strategy, according to Institutional Investor. Peter Hooper at Deutsche Bank AG in New York was voted first for
economics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research and Goldman

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. kept its ESPN, ABC
and other networks on Time Warner Cable Inc. systems while
negotiations to resolve a fee dispute extended through a
midnight deadline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sides are still talking and programming is still on the
air, Maureen Huff, a spokeswoman for New York-based Time Warner
Cable, said in an e-mail at 6 a.m. local time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 13 million Time Warner Cable subscribers would have
lost ESPN and Disney Channel in a blackout. Customers in New
York, Los Angeles, and Raleigh, North Carolina, would lose ABC
as well. A standoff would threaten Disney&#8217;s advertising revenue,
and potentially trigger defections at Time Warner Cable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sticking points in the negotiations have included whether
Time Warner Cable should pay Disney for its ESPN3.com website
and if it should carry Disney Jr., the preschool service Disney
is converting from SoapNet next year, a person familiar with the
negotiations said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burbank, California-based Disney is probably seeking at
least 50 cents per subscriber per month for ABC, and as much as
a 10 percent increase on its cable fees, said Andrew Kim, an
analyst at Macquarie Capital in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESPN Programming &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, Disney requested 10 cents a month per Web
customer for ESPN3.com, said the person with knowledge of the
negotiations, who declined to be identified because the talks
are private. ESPN, the most expensive channel on the dial,
received $4.08 per customer monthly on average from pay-TV
operators last year, while the Disney Channel brought in 88
cents a month per subscriber, according to researcher SNL Kagan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time Warner Cable fell 49 cents to $54.47 at 9:41 a.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares gained 30
percent this year before today. Disney advanced 29 cents to
$33.80 today and had risen 3.9 percent in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, Time Warner Cable almost lost Fox-owned TV
station programming after a fee battle with parent News Corp.
The dispute was later resolved in overnight talks. In March,
Disney struck a deal with Cablevision Systems Corp. for its ABC
stations after a dispute blacked out the opening minutes of the
Academy Awards for Cablevision&#8217;s 3.1 million New York-area
customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For about two decades, the owners of networks gave away
broadcast rights for their stations, relying on higher
programming fees for their cable networks or better channel
positioning to help drive sales. Disney, like other broadcast
network owners, has been seeking fees for its ABC network, in
addition to asking for higher prices for its cable networks and
introducing new Web fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time Warner Cable has tried to stem costs by resisting
increased fee demands. In national campaigns, Chief Executive
Officer Glenn Britt has asked subscribers to pressure
programmers to keep costs low. Britt said that higher fees

&lt;p&gt;Hungary is eastern Europe&#8217;s &#8220;most
puzzling investment case&#8221; with assets trading at the biggest
discount to fair value in the region because of the government&#8217;s
economic policies, economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Viktor Orban&#8217;s government has refused to
commit to a budget deficit target for 2011, citing the need to
spur economic growth after the worst recession in 18 years.
Talks with the International Monetary Fund and European Union on
a review of Hungary&#8217;s 20 billion-euro ($26 billion) bailout
broke down July 17, and the government said last week it
wouldn&#8217;t seek a new loan when talks resume in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Hungary continues to be the most puzzling investment
case,&#8221; Ahmet Akarli and Magdalena Polan of Goldman Sachs in
London said in a Sept. 1 note. Its &#8220;assets trade exceptionally
wide relative to our fair-value estimates, reflecting the
uncertainty created by the new Fidesz government&#8217;s reluctance to
commit to strong, credible economic policies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forint has lost 1.2 percent against the euro in the
past month, compared with gains of 4.5 percent for the Czech
koruna and 0.35 percent for the Polish zloty. Hungary&#8217;s credit
default-swaps, contracts that protect against default, averaged
329 basis points in the period versus 88 basis points for the
Czech Republic and 135 for Poland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hungary is eastern Europe&#8217;s most-indebted nation, with
government debt equal to 78.3 percent of gross domestic product
last year. While the government has committed to cutting its
budget deficit to 3.8 percent of GDP this year, it balked at a
2011 target of 2.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Hungary&#8217;s fiscal position looks unsustainable without
continued fiscal discipline and structural measures that would
stabilize, and ideally reduce, the sovereign debt stock,&#8221; the
Goldman Sachs economists said. &#8220;After a costly period of trial
and error, the Fidesz government will eventually re-engage with
the IMF and the EU,&#8221; they said, referring to Orban&#8217;s party. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mending relations with the IMF would strengthen the forint,
prompt a decline in bond yields and compress Hungary&#8217;s CDS
spreads, they said. The 2011 budget and a new fiscal plan will
be &#8220;a litmus test,&#8221; according to Akarli and Polan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. and HSBC
Holdings Plc are among six banks that may manage a 10 percent
share sale in Steel Authority of India Ltd., according to three
people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG, Enam Securities Pvt., Kotak Mahindra
Capital Co. and SBI Capital Markets Ltd. may also be hired to
manage the sale by the government and the New Delhi-based
company, the people said, declining to be named before a public
announcement. Steel Authority fell 22 percent this year, valuing
a 10 percent stake at almost 78 billion rupees ($1.6 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lowest bid for fees was 0.00000000001 percent,
according to two of the people, or less than 1 paisa. The
selected banks must match that to win the mandate, according to
government guidelines. As many as 20 banks compete for each
stake sale, betting that league-table credit will help them win
more investment-banking work in Asia&#8217;s third-largest economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selling the stake in Steel Authority would help Prime
Minister Manmohan Singh&#8217;s administration meet its target of
raising 400 billion rupees in the year to March 31. The
government has raised about 20 billion rupees since April 1,
even as Indian companies sold 259 billion rupees in equity,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underwriter Rankings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. is ranked first in managing share sales in
India this fiscal year, followed by IDFC Capital Ltd. and Kotak
Mahindra Capital, the data showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R.K. Singhal, spokesman for Steel Authority, declined to
comment today. Chairman C.S. Verma wasn&#8217;t immediately available.
Spokespeople at the banks didn&#8217;t immediately reply to an e-mail
seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steel Authority, the nation&#8217;s second-largest producer of
the alloy, will issue new shares amounting to 5 percent of its
total equity, according to a notice posted in the Economic Times
on Aug. 2. The government, which holds an 85.8 percent stake in
the New Delhi-based company, will sell 5 percent, according to a
statement on the disinvestment department&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp., Credit Suisse Group AG, Edelweiss
Capital Ltd., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., IDBI Capital Ltd. and
IDFC are among 17 banks that bid to manage this offering,
according to the statement. JM Financial Ltd., Morgan Stanley,
Nomura Holdings Inc., Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and UBS
AG also submitted bids, it said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. kept its ESPN, ABC
and other networks on Time Warner Cable Inc. systems while
negotiations to resolve a fee dispute extended through a
midnight deadline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sides are still talking and won&#8217;t issue any new
statements before morning, Maureen Huff, a spokeswoman for New
York-based Time Warner Cable, said in an e-mail just after
midnight local time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 13 million Time Warner Cable subscribers would have
lost ESPN and Disney Channel in a blackout. Customers in New
York, Los Angeles, and Raleigh, North Carolina, would lose ABC
as well. A standoff would threaten Disney&#8217;s advertising revenue,
and potentially trigger defections at Time Warner Cable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sticking points in the negotiations have included whether
Time Warner Cable should pay Disney for its ESPN3.com website
and if it should carry Disney Jr., the preschool service Disney
is converting from SoapNet next year, a person familiar with the
negotiations said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burbank, California-based Disney is probably seeking at
least 50 cents per subscriber per month for ABC, and as much as
a 10 percent increase on its cable fees, said Andrew Kim, an
analyst at Macquarie Capital in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESPN Programming &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, Disney requested 10 cents a month per Web
customer for ESPN3.com, said the person with knowledge of the
negotiations, who declined to be identified because the talks
are private. ESPN, the most expensive channel on the dial,
received $4.08 per customer monthly on average from pay-TV
operators last year, while the Disney Channel brought in 88
cents a month per subscriber, according to researcher SNL Kagan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time Warner Cable rose $2.41, or 4.7 percent, to $53.98
yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares have gained 30 percent this year. Disney advanced 97
cents, or 3 percent, to $33.51 and has risen 3.9 percent in
2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, Time Warner Cable almost lost Fox-owned TV
station programming after a fee battle with parent News Corp.
The dispute was later resolved in overnight talks. In March,
Disney struck a deal with Cablevision Systems Corp. for its ABC
stations after a dispute blacked out the opening minutes of the
Academy Awards for Cablevision&#8217;s 3.1 million New York-area
customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For about two decades, the owners of networks gave away
broadcast rights for their stations, relying on higher
programming fees for their cable networks or better channel
positioning to help drive sales. Disney, like other broadcast
network owners, has been seeking fees for its ABC network, in
addition to asking for higher prices for its cable networks and
introducing new Web fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time Warner Cable has tried to stem costs by resisting
increased fee demands. In national campaigns, Chief Executive
Officer Glenn Britt has asked subscribers to pressure
programmers to keep costs low. Britt said that higher fees
ultimately are billed to the customer and that network
programming is free on the Internet and over the air. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total Kenya Ltd., the local unit of
Total SA, said first-half net income surged on synergies from
the acquisition of Chevron Kenya Ltd. last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings climbed to 302.28 million shillings compared with
36.96 million shillings a year earlier, Managing Director Felix
Majekodunmi said in an advertisement in the Nairobi-based Daily
Nation newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales more than doubled to 39 billion shillings from 15.32
billion shillings, Majekodunmi said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Management is optimistic that the performance of the
second half will be in line with projections, provided that
there will be improved product flow to upcountry locations,&#8221; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
computer programmer Sergey Aleynikov, accused of stealing
trading software from the bank, won dismissal of a count of
unauthorized computer access, one of three charges he faces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov was arrested in July 2009 and indicted Feb. 11 in
what a prosecutor said was the &#8220;most substantial&#8221; theft that
New York-based Goldman could recall. U.S. District Judge Denise Cote, in Manhattan, ruled today that two charges would remain --
theft of trade secrets and transportation of stolen property in
foreign commerce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cote said that because Aleynikov was authorized to work on
Goldman&#8217;s software when he is alleged to have stolen a copy, he
can&#8217;t be charged with unauthorized access. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Unless an individual lacks authorization to access a
computer system, or exceeds the authorization that has been
granted, there can&#8217;t be a violation&#8221; of the law, Cote said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The programmer stole a code for Goldman&#8217;s high-frequency
trading business on his last day at the bank in June 2009,
prosecutors said in the indictment. Aleynikov had argued that
the judge should throw out all the charges because the acts
described by prosecutors don&#8217;t constitute crimes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re very gratified that the court found no basis that
Mr. Aleynikov violated a theft of computer access,&#8221; Kevin Marino, Aleynikov&#8217;s lawyer, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;We
are nevertheless puzzled by the court&#8217;s conclusion that
Goldman&#8217;s high-frequency trading platform was a product produced
for interstate commerce,&#8221; Marino said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said he&#8217;s considering whether to ask for permission to
appeal that aspect of Cote&#8217;s ruling before the case moves ahead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cote has scheduled a Nov. 29 trial date for Aleynikov, who
has pleaded not guilty, Marino said. Yusill Scribner, a
spokeswoman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, declined
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Aleynikov, 1:10-cr-00096, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Shannon Pettypiece" date="Sep 03, 2010  4:05 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-03/pfizer-ends-celldex-accord-for-brain-tumor-vaccine-celldex-shares-plunge.html"><headline>Celldex Plunges After Pfizer Cancels Partnership for Brain Cancer Vaccine</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. is pulling out of an
agreement with Celldex Therapeutics Inc. to fund the development
of an experimental brain tumor vaccine. Celldex shares fell the
most in almost two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vaccine called rindopepimut, or CDX-110, is &#8220;no longer
a strategic priority of Pfizer,&#8221; which will return the rights
to the therapy to Celldex Nov. 1, Needham, Massachusetts-based
Celldex said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treatment is in the second of three stages of testing
generally required to win U.S. regulatory approval. New York-
based Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, licensed rights to
the product in 2008 from Celldex for as much as $440 million,
plus royalties. If approved, the brain cancer vaccine could have
$450 million in peak annual sales and come on the market in
2013, Joseph Pantginis, an analyst at Roth Capital, said in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see this as a tremendous opportunity for Celldex, our
shareholders and patients,&#8221; said Chief Executive Officer
Anthony Marucci, on a conference call with investors today. &#8220;We
believe rindopepimut is very well-positioned to advance into
pivotal clinical studies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celldex fell $1.25, or 26 percent, to $3.53 at 4 p.m. in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Celldex has no approved products,
and the vaccine is its most advanced treatment in testing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funds Needed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celldex will need to raise additional money to fund late-
stage testing, Marucci said. The company, with 100 employees,
had $65.8 million in cash and short-term assets as of June 30.
Celldex doesn&#8217;t need another partner to move the drug forward in
development, Marucci said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treatment is designed to ramp up the body&#8217;s immune
response to fight off the tumor. The vaccine targets the
molecule called epidermal growth factor receptor variant III,
which plays a role in cell growth. The strategy could be applied
to breast, ovarian and prostate cancer as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer spokesman Curtis Allen declined to comment on the
specifics of why the drugmaker was terminating the agreement
with Celldex. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As part of Pfizer Oncology&#8217;s ongoing prioritization of
assets across its broad research and development portfolio, the
Company will be terminating its license and development
agreement with Celldex Therapeutics for the investigational
compound rindopepimut,&#8221; said Allen in an e-mailed statement.
&#8220;Pfizer is working to transition the compound back to Celldex
Therapeutics. Pfizer remains committed to research and
development of new therapies for patients with cancer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results from a study presented in May showed 70 percent of
patients receiving the vaccine were alive without their cancer
worsening about eight months after diagnosis. Typically, about
half of patients with that type of tumor survive without the
disease progressing during that time period. The finding,
involving 40 patients, were from an interim analysis of a study. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief
executive officer of JPMorgan Chase  Co., sliced about $2.6
million off the asking price of his Chicago mansion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gold Coast neighborhood property is now listed for
$6.95 million, according to the website of broker Sudler
Sotheby&#8217;s International Realty, which earlier this year listed
it for $9.5 million. It was previously listed for $10.5 million
by Koenig  Strey GMAC Real Estate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re trying to make a bold move to get ahead of the
market,&#8221; said Jim Kinney, vice president of luxury sales for
Baird  Warner, a residential brokerage in Chicago. &#8220;This time
next year, that house is not going to be on the market. They&#8217;re
going to find whatever it takes to get it sold.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon and his wife Judith bought the house in 2000 for $4.7
million, according to records on the website of the Cook County
Recorder of Deeds. The mansion, built in the late 1800s, has
eight bedrooms and nine full bathrooms. Dimon first listed it
for sale in April 2007 for $13.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The property, near Lake Michigan and Oak Street Beach, has
a rooftop terrace, wine vault and gym, according to the listing.
Located on the corner of tree-lined Astor and Banks streets, it
lies in one of the city&#8217;s most expensive neighborhoods and is
among the largest homes in the Gold Coast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Kelly, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment. Janet Owen, the listing agent for the
property, didn&#8217;t immediately return a telephone call seeking
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon bought the house, at 25 E. Banks St., when he headed
Chicago-based Bank One Corp. Dimon, 54, helped engineer the sale
of Bank One to JPMorgan Chase in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest price cut was reported earlier today by Business
Insider. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of single-family homes and condominiums in Chicago
fell 20 percent to 1,589 in July from 1,975 a year earlier, the
Illinois Association of Realtors said Aug. 24. The median price
dropped 20 percent to $196,500 from $245,000. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is shutting
its principal-strategies business, a group that makes bets with
the firm&#8217;s own capital, to comply with new U.S. rules aimed at
curbing risk, two people with knowledge of the decision said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street&#8217;s most profitable investment bank plans to hold
off on announcing the wind-down while the 65 to 70 members of
the global unit seek new jobs, the people said, speaking
anonymously because the internal discussions about the process
are confidential. Some traders and support staff may get roles
within the firm, while a team in Asia may raise money for a new
hedge fund, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier plans for most members of the Principal Strategies
group, led by Hong Kong-based Morgan Sze, to leave together and
form a hedge fund were shelved, people with knowledge of the
matter said. Now Sze, 44, may set up a fund with a smaller team
focused on Asia, they said. Employees in London and New York are
considering different options, the people said. The team&#8217;s
members in New York, led by Bob Howard, are in talks to join
another asset-management firm, according to two people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xinjiang Goldwind IPO &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xinjiang Goldwind Science  Technology Co. is seeking to
raise about $800 million by reviving a Hong Kong share offering
that was postponed in June, according to three people familiar
with the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase 
Co. and Beijing-based China International Capital Corp. are
managing the deal, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the information is confidential. The Chinese
wind-turbine maker postponed previous plans to raise as much as
HK$9.09 billion ($1.2 billion), citing market conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Goldwind said it will invest 200 million yuan
($29.4 million) to build a wind-turbine manufacturing plant in
the Xinjiang Autonomous Region in the northwest of China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capesize Bookings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bookings of capesize vessels to haul dry-bulk commodities
to China jumped 29 percent last month, according to Clarkson Plc,
the world&#8217;s biggest shipbroker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Producers and traders hired 67 of the ships in August for
deliveries to the Asian nation, data from Clarkson Research
Services Ltd. in London show. That was up from 52 in August.
Iron ore makes up about 75 percent of capesize cargoes,
according to ICAP Shipping International Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Bank Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong banks need the express consent of customers
before transferring personal data to third-parties for purposes
not directly related to the original reason for collection, the
Hong Kong Monetary Authority said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussing the dismissal of Wing Lung Bank Ltd.&#8217;s
administrative appeal against an enforcement notice by the
Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data on the lender&#8217;s data use,
the HKMA said in a letter that Hong Kong banks should clearly
state the purpose for collecting personal data, and that
&#8220;unconnected&#8221; third parties shouldn&#8217;t claim to be bank
personnel when selling products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, the de facto central bank reminded authorized
institutions that lending in yuan to individuals is forbidden,
and they have to make reasonable efforts to ensure corporate
clients aren&#8217;t borrowing to lend on to others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enterprise Revenue &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combined operating revenue for China&#8217;s 500 largest
enterprises rose 6.3 percent last year, with the three top
contributors coming from the energy industry, the People&#8217;s Daily
said, citing an industrial rankings report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating revenue rose to 27.6 trillion yuan ($4.1
trillion). Combined profits grew 25 percent to 1.5 trillion yuan
last year, while combined assets increased 22 percent to 91.3
trillion yuan, the newspaper said, citing a report by the China
Enterprise Confederation and China Enterprise Directors
Association. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei Handsets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei Technologies Co., China&#8217;s largest phone-equipment
maker, is betting Google Inc. branding and smartphones targeting
the lower end of the market will build its sales in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei&#8217;s unveiling of a 99 pound ($152) Google-branded
smartphone will help the company grab market share in Europe,
Tim Watkins, the company&#8217;s western Europe vice president, said
in an interview in London. Huawei hasn&#8217;t yet named the operators
who will first offer the Ideos phone, which carries a Google
logo and doubles as a portable wireless Internet hotspot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congo Mines &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congo&#8217;s government gave the rights to two mines previously
operated by First Quantum Ltd. to Fortune, a Hong Kong-based
company, Mines Minister Martin Kabwelulu said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortune is in a joint venture with Sodimico, a state-owned
Congolese mining company, Kabwelulu said in a mobile-phone text
message. He didn&#8217;t provide Fortune&#8217;s full company name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARKETS: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks rose on Sept. 3, with the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
Index gaining a fourth day and the Dow Jones Industrial Average
erasing its loss for the year, as better-than-estimated growth
in private payrolls eased concern the economy is sliding back
into a recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-biggest U.S. bank, gained
2.7 percent and Caterpillar Inc. advanced 2.3 percent as private
employers climbed 67,000 last month. Monster Worldwide Inc., the
online-recruiting company, increased 7 percent. HR Block Inc.
surged 5.8 percent after posting a narrower quarterly loss as
the company seeks to win back from online rivals such as Intuit
Inc.&#8217;s TurboTax. Financial stocks posted the biggest gains among
10 industries in the SP 500. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 rose 1.3 percent to 1,104.51 at 4 p.m. in New
York, extending its weekly gain to 3.8 percent and completing
its longest winning streak since July. The Dow increased 127.83
points, or 1.2 percent, to 10,447.93, giving it a 0.2 percent
gain for 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE FOLLOWING STOCKS MAY BE ACTIVE TODAY: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Property Developers: The city&#8217;s government will
on Oct. 12 sell a residential building in the Kowloon section of
the city adjacent to a lot sold at a record price last month.
Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. (16 HK), the city&#8217;s biggest
developer by market value, gained 0.5 percent to HK$111.70.
Billionaire Li Ka-shing&#8217;s Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd. was
unchanged at HK$99.45. Billionaire Lee Shau-kee&#8217;s Henderson Land
