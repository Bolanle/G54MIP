<news><entry author="By Bloomberg News" date="Sep 05, 2010  7:10 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-05/china-day-ahead-goldman-sachs-shutdown-xinjiang-goldwind-s-hong-kong-ipo.html"><headline>China Day Ahead: Goldman Sachs Shutdown; Xinjiang Goldwind's Hong Kong IPO</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is shutting
its principal-strategies business, a group that makes bets with
the firm&#8217;s own capital, to comply with new U.S. rules aimed at
curbing risk, two people with knowledge of the decision said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street&#8217;s most profitable investment bank plans to hold
off on announcing the wind-down while the 65 to 70 members of
the global unit seek new jobs, the people said, speaking
anonymously because the internal discussions about the process
are confidential. Some traders and support staff may get roles
within the firm, while a team in Asia may raise money for a new
hedge fund, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier plans for most members of the Principal Strategies
group, led by Hong Kong-based Morgan Sze, to leave together and
form a hedge fund were shelved, people with knowledge of the
matter said. Now Sze, 44, may set up a fund with a smaller team
focused on Asia, they said. Employees in London and New York are
considering different options, the people said. The team&#8217;s
members in New York, led by Bob Howard, are in talks to join
another asset-management firm, according to two people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xinjiang Goldwind IPO &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xinjiang Goldwind Science  Technology Co. is seeking to
raise about $800 million by reviving a Hong Kong share offering
that was postponed in June, according to three people familiar
with the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase 
Co. and Beijing-based China International Capital Corp. are
managing the deal, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the information is confidential. The Chinese
wind-turbine maker postponed previous plans to raise as much as
HK$9.09 billion ($1.2 billion), citing market conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Goldwind said it will invest 200 million yuan
($29.4 million) to build a wind-turbine manufacturing plant in
the Xinjiang Autonomous Region in the northwest of China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capesize Bookings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bookings of capesize vessels to haul dry-bulk commodities
to China jumped 29 percent last month, according to Clarkson Plc,
the world&#8217;s biggest shipbroker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Producers and traders hired 67 of the ships in August for
deliveries to the Asian nation, data from Clarkson Research
Services Ltd. in London show. That was up from 52 in August.
Iron ore makes up about 75 percent of capesize cargoes,
according to ICAP Shipping International Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Bank Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong banks need the express consent of customers
before transferring personal data to third-parties for purposes
not directly related to the original reason for collection, the
Hong Kong Monetary Authority said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussing the dismissal of Wing Lung Bank Ltd.&#8217;s
administrative appeal against an enforcement notice by the
Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data on the lender&#8217;s data use,
the HKMA said in a letter that Hong Kong banks should clearly
state the purpose for collecting personal data, and that
&#8220;unconnected&#8221; third parties shouldn&#8217;t claim to be bank
personnel when selling products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, the de facto central bank reminded authorized
institutions that lending in yuan to individuals is forbidden,
and they have to make reasonable efforts to ensure corporate
clients aren&#8217;t borrowing to lend on to others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enterprise Revenue &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combined operating revenue for China&#8217;s 500 largest
enterprises rose 6.3 percent last year, with the three top
contributors coming from the energy industry, the People&#8217;s Daily
said, citing an industrial rankings report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating revenue rose to 27.6 trillion yuan ($4.1
trillion). Combined profits grew 25 percent to 1.5 trillion yuan
last year, while combined assets increased 22 percent to 91.3
trillion yuan, the newspaper said, citing a report by the China
Enterprise Confederation and China Enterprise Directors
Association. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei Handsets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei Technologies Co., China&#8217;s largest phone-equipment
maker, is betting Google Inc. branding and smartphones targeting
the lower end of the market will build its sales in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei&#8217;s unveiling of a 99 pound ($152) Google-branded
smartphone will help the company grab market share in Europe,
Tim Watkins, the company&#8217;s western Europe vice president, said
in an interview in London. Huawei hasn&#8217;t yet named the operators
who will first offer the Ideos phone, which carries a Google
logo and doubles as a portable wireless Internet hotspot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congo Mines &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congo&#8217;s government gave the rights to two mines previously
operated by First Quantum Ltd. to Fortune, a Hong Kong-based
company, Mines Minister Martin Kabwelulu said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortune is in a joint venture with Sodimico, a state-owned
Congolese mining company, Kabwelulu said in a mobile-phone text
message. He didn&#8217;t provide Fortune&#8217;s full company name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARKETS: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks rose on Sept. 3, with the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
Index gaining a fourth day and the Dow Jones Industrial Average
erasing its loss for the year, as better-than-estimated growth
in private payrolls eased concern the economy is sliding back
into a recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-biggest U.S. bank, gained
2.7 percent and Caterpillar Inc. advanced 2.3 percent as private
employers climbed 67,000 last month. Monster Worldwide Inc., the
online-recruiting company, increased 7 percent. HR Block Inc.
surged 5.8 percent after posting a narrower quarterly loss as
the company seeks to win back from online rivals such as Intuit
Inc.&#8217;s TurboTax. Financial stocks posted the biggest gains among
10 industries in the SP 500. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 rose 1.3 percent to 1,104.51 at 4 p.m. in New
York, extending its weekly gain to 3.8 percent and completing
its longest winning streak since July. The Dow increased 127.83
points, or 1.2 percent, to 10,447.93, giving it a 0.2 percent
gain for 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE FOLLOWING STOCKS MAY BE ACTIVE TODAY: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Property Developers: The city&#8217;s government will
on Oct. 12 sell a residential building in the Kowloon section of

&lt;p&gt;German Chancellor Angela Merkel said
it&#8217;s &#8220;a long way&#8221; before Russian nationals will be granted
visa-free travel in the European Union. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As regards a visa-free regime between the European Union
and Russia, I discussed it&#8221; with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, Merkel said today at a press conference in Vilnius,
Lithuania. &#8220;But I believe there&#8217;s yet a long way to go.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia wants to strike a visa-free travel accord with the
EU to drop a regime that involves detailed application forms and
the possibility of refusal without explanation. Russians
frequently complain of humiliating EU application procedures,
while Europeans criticize the paperwork required by Russian
authorities as contradictory and unclear. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., BP Plc and
Vitol Group number among dozens of companies that have met with
the top U.S. commodity regulator in the last six weeks as the
agency moves to implement the sweeping overhaul of the $615
trillion over-the-counter derivatives market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is drafting 30
sets of rules after enactment of the Dodd-Frank financial bill.
The commission is charged with, among other things, imposing
limits on the number of contracts a single trader can hold,
setting margin requirements and deciding which trades will be
processed, or cleared, through third-party clearinghouses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This commitment to open government will help promote the
integrity of the rule-writing process,&#8221; said CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama signed the Dodd-Frank bill into law
on July 21, setting off the first round of lobbying and rule-
writing inside U.S. regulatory agencies. Along with a new
regulatory structure for derivative markets, the law also
creates a new agency to monitor consumer financial products and
a council of regulators to oversee systemic risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CFTC has met with banks including Goldman Sachs and JP
Morgan Chase  Co., airlines such as Delta Air Lines Inc. and
JetBlue Airways, power companies including Exelon Corp. and
NextEra Energy Inc., and oil and natural gas producers including
BP and Hess Corp., according to the CFTC Web site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Executive &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blythe Masters, JPMorgan&#8217;s head of commodities, came in for
a meeting on Aug. 11 to discuss, among other issues, how
regulators would define things like &#8220;major swap participant&#8221;
and &#8220;swap dealer.&#8221; Those definitions will dictate which firms
fall under the regulatory umbrella. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Barnum, a managing director in the bank&#8217;s global
fixed-income group and the chairman of the firm&#8217;s market-
structure group, also attended the meeting with Dan Berkovitz,
the CFTC&#8217;s general counsel, according to the Web site. Barnum,
in June, was tasked by JPMorgan with helping the company adapt
to the new derivatives and clearing rules implemented by
Congress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission is an independent agency that regulates the
U.S. commodity future and option markets, including markets in
raw materials like wheat, corn, oil and natural gas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CFTC and other regulatory agencies including the
Securities and Exchange Commission, Federal Reserve and the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. have pledged to post the names
of banks and other lobbyists who come in for meetings on the
implementation of the law. The legislation is named for its
sponsors Senator Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, and
Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derivatives are financial instruments based on the value of
another security or benchmark. Some instruments, including
contracts that insured mortgage-backed bonds, have been blamed
for fueling a financial crisis that led to the worst recession
since the Great Depression. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Westin resigned as president
of ABC News after 13 years, saying he will seek opportunities
outside of the Walt Disney Co. network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Westin, 57, will stay on through year-end while a
replacement is sought, according to an e-mail he sent to
staffers and posted on the ABC News website yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are some other things I want to do
professionally,&#8221; Westin said without elaborating. &#8220;I&#8217;m
announcing my decision now so that I can pursue those
possibilities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decline in viewership has put pressure on network news
operations to curtail spending and find other ways to maintain
profit. In February, Westin announced a restructuring of the ABC
News workforce, increasing the reliance on freelance journalists
and having staffers shoot and edit more of their own material. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There has been, during his tenure at ABC News, a huge
upheaval in how people, particularly young people, get their
news,&#8221; said Brad Adgate, director of research at New York-based
advertising firm Horizon Media Inc. &#8220;To keep the news division
as a viable department at ABC, he did a very credible job. But,
that said, he was never able to quite surpass NBC.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NBC slashed newsroom jobs in 2006 and increased resource-
sharing with NBC Universal cable-channel siblings MSNBC and
CNBC. CBS hired Katie Couric the same year in a bid to boost
ratings for &#8220;CBS Evening News.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;NBC Nightly News&#8221; has the highest-rated evening news
broadcast with 8.58 million viewers on average since September
2009, according to data provided by Nielsen Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBS, CNN &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;ABC World News&#8221; is second, averaging 7.58 million
viewers. &#8220;CBS Evening News&#8221; is last among the networks with an
average of 5.73 million viewers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He couldn&#8217;t really overcome NBC&#8217;s dominance,&#8221; Adgate
said in an interview. &#8220;The gap would close once in a while and
they&#8217;d get close to NBC and the gap would widen.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBS News and Time Warner Inc.&#8217;s CNN have talked about
partnerships and there are reasons for the companies to work
together, CBS Corp. Chief Executive Officer Leslie Moonves said
in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Westin oversees ABC&#8217;s television and radio network news,
including the evening broadcast, &#8220;Good Morning America&#8221; and
&#8220;This Week With Christiane Amanpour.&#8221; In December, Westin
replaced &#8220;World News&#8221; anchor Charles Gibson with Diane Sawyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For the past 13 years, David Westin proved himself a
tireless advocate for ABC News,&#8221; Anne Sweeney, co-chair of
Disney Media Networks, said in an e-mailed statement. He has
&#8220;positioned us for great success going forward.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABC&#8217;s Drop &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABC was the only major network to have a drop in overall
prime-time viewers last season and also was down in the 18-to-
49-year-old group that advertisers seek, according to Nielsen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the nine months ended July 3, Disney&#8217;s broadcast
revenue rose 3 percent to $4.4 billion, the company said on Aug.
10. Operating income increased 2 percent to $512 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s largest media company, fell 83 cents to
$33.84 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. Shares of the Burbank, California-based company have
risen 4.9 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China National Offshore Oil Corp.
signed amended production-sharing agreements with Chevron Corp.
and BP Plc after Devon Energy Corp. withdrew from the South
China Sea deepwater oil projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron has agreed to buy a 59.2 percent interest in block
42/05 and full ownership in blocks 64/18 and 53/30 from Devon in
the exploration phase, Cnooc Ltd., China National&#8217;s Hong Kong-
listed unit, said today in a statement. BP acquired Devon&#8217;s
remaining interest in block 42/05, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron and BP are enlarging deepwater cooperation with
Cnooc as the company is poised to maximize deepwater production
at any cost to meet its output goal,&#8221; Wang Aochao, head of
China Energy Research at UOB-Kay Hian Ltd., said by telephone
from Shanghai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cnooc, China&#8217;s biggest offshore energy producer, aims to
increase production by as much as 28 percent to 290 million
barrels this year. First-half profit more than doubled as output
rose to a record 149 million barrels of oil equivalent during
the period, driven by the start-up of new fields in Bohai Bay
and the South China Sea, the company said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron will be the operator of the three blocks, the
Chinese company said. Cnooc Ltd. has the right to secure as much
as 51 percent &#8220;in the event of any commercial discovery in the
blocks,&#8221; it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese Block 42/05 is located in Baiyun Sag of Pearl River
Mouth Basin in the Eastern South China Sea, Cnooc said. Blocks
64/18 and 53/30 are located in Qiong Dong Nan Basin in the
Western South China Sea. Water depth of the three blocks ranges
from 300 to 2,000 meters (6,600 feet). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP disclosed the bid for Devon&#8217;s stake in Block 42/05 in
the deepwater South China Sea, on July 27. In March, the London-
based company agreed to buy $7 billion of assets from Devon in
the Gulf of Mexico, Brazil and Azerbaijan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s surging 10-year government
bond yields could accelerate gains in the yen by encouraging the
nation&#8217;s investors to bring back overseas earnings, according to
JPMorgan Chase  Co. in Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on 10-year debt has risen to as high as 1.195
percent this week, the most since June 22, on speculation Ichiro
Ozawa will wrest leadership of the ruling party from Prime
Minister Naoto Kan and increase spending. Ozawa, who controls
the Democratic Party of Japan&#8217;s largest faction, will challenge
Kan for leadership in a ballot on Sept. 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If JGB yields start rallying, it could lead to yen
appreciation as it accelerates repatriation of overseas assets
held by Japanese investors,&#8221; JPMorgan analysts led by Tohru Sasaki, head of Japan rates and foreign-exchange research, wrote
in a research note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yen rose to 83.82 per dollar at 8:29 a.m. in London
from 84.21 in New York yesterday, after climbing to 83.60 on Aug.
24, the highest level since June 1995. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s currency may also strengthen as exporters buy the
yen, the JPMorgan analysts said, citing the Bank of Japan&#8217;s
Tankan survey released on July 1. Japanese large manufacturers
expected the yen to average 90.16 per dollar in the six months
ending March 2011, according to the Tankan survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Dollar-yen has never touched that level since late June
and has been on a constant downtrend,&#8221; the analysts wrote.
&#8220;This means that their hedging operation for the latter half of
fiscal 2010 could be significantly behind schedule. Under such a
situation, Japanese exporters may rush to buy yen if yen
appreciation further accelerates from the current level.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.K. regulator found that Goldman Sachs failed to
notify it about the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s
investigation of the New York-based firm&#8217;s Abacus transaction
and of employee Fabrice Tourre&#8217;s role in it, according to the
person, who spoke anonymously because the penalty hasn&#8217;t yet
been made public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fine is less than 20 million pounds ($30.9 million) and
may be announced as soon as today, the person said. FSA
spokeswoman Cerris Tavinor declined to comment, as did Goldman
Sachs spokesman Ed Canaday. The Financial Times reported the
FSA&#8217;s plan yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC sued Goldman Sachs and Tourre in April over claims
the firm misled investors in collateralized debt obligations
linked to subprime mortgages. Tourre, 31, the only Goldman Sachs
executive sued individually, remains a defendant in the case
after the firm settled. He has denied wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs created and sold the CDOs in 2007, as the
U.S. housing market faltered, without disclosing that hedge fund
Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying securities and bet
against the investment vehicles, the SEC said in an April 16
lawsuit. CDOs are pools of assets such as mortgage bonds packed
into new securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement included a $300 million fine and $250
million in restitution for investors. The penalty is the largest
ever levied by the SEC against a Wall Street firm, the agency
said. Goldman Sachs, without admitting or denying wrongdoing,
acknowledged it made a &#8220;mistake&#8221; and that marketing materials
for the CDOs had &#8220;incomplete information,&#8221; the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSA said in April that it would formally investigate
Goldman Sachs related to the SEC&#8217;s claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lorin Reisner an SEC lawyer, said in August that the
regulator held &#8220;very preliminary&#8221; talks with Tourre about
settling the claims against him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc., the world&#8217;s largest
payments network, posted the biggest drop in the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 Index after Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s James Kissane
became the first analyst to recommend avoiding the shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are among the only skeptics on the networks,&#8221; Kissane
said today in a note to clients as he cut the shares to
&#8220;underperform&#8221; from &#8220;neutral.&#8221; That&#8217;s typically interpreted
as a sell recommendation, the only one among 38 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. &#8220;The pricing power of the networks is
likely to be considerably diminished,&#8221; he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa and No. 2 network MasterCard Inc. came under pressure
this year as U.S. lawmakers approved caps on debit-card
interchange, or &#8220;swipe&#8221; fees, charged to merchants on each
transaction. Emerging payment technologies, including those
designed for mobile phones, also may threaten their business
models, Kissane said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kissane predicted Visa shares will trade at $70 in a year.
The stock dropped $2.95, or 4.1 percent, to $68.55 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Shares of the San
Francisco-based company have declined 22 percent this year.
Kissane had an &#8220;underperform&#8221; rating on Purchase, New York-
based MasterCard, which fell $6.12, or 3.1 percent, to $194.40,
the lowest since July 31, 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dodd-Frank Act directs the Federal Reserve to set
interchange rates that are &#8220;reasonable and proportional&#8221; to
the cost of processing debit transactions. Visa and MasterCard,
which set the rates and pass the money to card-issuing banks,
may face pressure from lenders seeking to renegotiate their
contracts. Bank of America has said the debit caps could trim
annual revenue by as much as $2.3 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG hired Marcelo Pizzimbono of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. as a managing director
and head of New York research sales as Germany&#8217;s largest bank
expands its equity analyst coverage of U.S. stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pizzimbono will be based in New York and report to Brett Burns, head of U.S. cash equity sales, according to Renee Calabro, a spokeswoman for the bank. Pizzimbono spent a decade
at Goldman Sachs, where he was most recently a managing director
for U.S. equity sales, she said. Prior to that, he worked as an
analyst at JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank&#8217;s Anshu Jain, who took over as sole head of
the corporate and investment bank in July, plans to spend about
1.6 billion euros ($2 billion) on hiring and technology for the
global markets unit in the next two years to gain market share
in U.S. cash equities and commodities. The Frankfurt-based firm
has expanded analyst coverage to about 850 U.S. stocks from 700
a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re observing a rebound in hiring in the capital
markets industry as well as in the corporate finance industry,&#8221;
said Andreas Jaeger, client partner at the global executive
search firm Korn Ferry International GmbH in Frankfurt.
&#8220;Business has been strengthening.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Accurate Analyst &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank hired four senior analysts this year to boost
its equity research offerings. In March, it got Michael Linenberg, the most accurate analyst on shares of Delta Air
Lines Inc. and American Airlines parent AMR Corp., from Bank of
America Corp., and Myles Walton, an aerospace and defense
analyst at Oppenheimer  Co., to oversee coverage of those
industries in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also this year, the bank hired Frederick Searby from asset
management firm EverKey Global Partners as Latin America equity
strategist and former Bear Stearns Cos. strategist Steve Abrahams as the head of its securitization and mortgage-backed
securities research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank shares slipped 0.6 percent to 49.01 euros at
5:35 p.m. Frankfurt time. They have lost 0.8 percent this year,
compared with a 1.5 percent loss for the Stoxx 600 Banks Index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KKR  Co. and Perella Weinberg
Partners LP are in talks to hire members of Goldman Sachs Group
Inc.&#8217;s U.S. principal-strategies group, according to two people
briefed on the negotiations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Bob Howard, who heads the Goldman group in the U.S., is
leading the discussions, said one of the people. Talks are in
early stages and may fall apart before a deal is reached, said
the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Profitable traders marketing themselves as a group,
rather than individually, is a better strategy,&#8221; said Gustavo Dolfino, senior managing director at Accretive Solutions Inc., a
New York-based executive-recruitment firm. &#8220;There will be more
interest in them collectively as firms will be able to get more
milk out of them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman is disbanding its proprietary-trading business, one
of the groups that makes bets with the firm&#8217;s own money, to
comply with new U.S. rules aimed at curbing risk, two people
with knowledge of the decision said last week. Asset managers 
such as KKR and Perella Weinberg may be interested in hiring the
traders for hedge funds and other pools of money that these 
companies oversee for clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials for the three firms declined to comment. All are
based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, Wall Street&#8217;s most profitable investment
bank, plans to hold off on announcing the wind-down while the 65
to 70 members of the global unit seek new jobs, the people said,
speaking anonymously because the discussions are confidential.
Some of the principal strategies group&#8217;s traders and support
staff may get roles at Goldman, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perella, KKR &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman group is led by Hong Kong-based Morgan Sze, who
may start his own hedge fund focused on Asia, the people said.
Sze in March replaced Pierre-Henri Flamand, the former global
head who left to set up a London-based hedge fund called Edoma
Capital Partners LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perella Weinberg, the investment bank founded by Joseph Perella and Peter Weinberg, oversees about $6 billion for
clients as of Aug. 1, according to its website. The firm, which
invests client money in five hedge funds including a credit fund
called Xerion, earlier this year hired hedge fund Tokum Capital
Management LP&#8217;s investment team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KKR, founded by buyout pioneers Henry Kravis and George
Roberts, has been building its liquid and mezzanine strategies
unit, led by William Sonneborn. KKR Asset Management began in
2004 with a focus on corporate debt and now oversees about $13
billion, which includes trading in bank loans and mezzanine
loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock Held Talks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private-equity firms have been expanding beyond traditional
buyouts, which have been hurt by the financial crisis.
Blackstone Group LP, the biggest private equity firm, now counts
its credit and marketable alternatives business, which includes
a fund of hedge funds operation, as its largest by assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; BlackRock Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest asset manager, has also
held talks to hire one or more people from the Goldman group,
according to a person with knowledge of the talks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Brian Beades, a spokesman for New York-based BlackRock,
said the firm doesn&#8217;t comment on speculation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Laurence D. Fink has said
on conference calls with analysts and investors that the asset
manager&#8217;s model doesn&#8217;t rely on proprietary investments. The
company, which manages $3.15 trillion, has about $100 billion in
alternative investments such as funds of hedge funds and real
estate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dodd-Frank &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We do not run any proprietary investments but rather
invest alongside our clients or seed new products as required
for the base business,&#8221; Fink said in a conference call on July
21. &#8220;Our exposures are aligned with the interests of our
clients.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A provision of the Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul act
prohibits banks from risking capital by betting for their own
accounts. JPMorgan Chase  Co. plans to close its prop-trading
units in response to the law, signed by President Barack Obama
in July. JPMorgan last month told in-house commodities traders
in London that they may lose their jobs, a person briefed on the
matter said this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dodd-Frank Act allows banks at least four years to
bring their proprietary trading into compliance, with a
potential extension of as many as three years, according to a
timeline prepared by Davis Polk  Wardwell LLP, the New York law
firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weaker revenue from principal strategies was one factor in
the 62 percent drop in Goldman Sachs&#8217;s equities revenue in the
second quarter compared with a year earlier, according to the
firm&#8217;s earnings report. The company doesn&#8217;t break out results
for the division separately. Goldman Sachs says about 10 percent
of its revenue comes from proprietary trading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s Quigley unit, a former
asbestos maker, was denied permission to exit bankruptcy by a
judge who found the world&#8217;s largest drug company manipulated the
bankruptcy process to benefit itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart M. Bernstein in New York today
rejected Quigley&#8217;s fourth reorganization plan and said parties
should discuss dismissal of the case. He said the plan was filed
in &#8220;bad faith&#8221; by Pfizer and cited testimony that asbestos
claims directed at Quigley could total $4.45 billion over the
next 42 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In a nutshell, Pfizer bought enough votes to assure that
any plan would be accepted,&#8221; Bernstein wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 90-page ruling that covers Pfizer&#8217;s failed attempts to
deal with its growing asbestos liabilities since June 1985,
Bernstein noted that a lawyer who represented both Quigley and
Pfizer settled claims against Quigley and got releases for
Pfizer at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Settling claimants were then given a financial incentive to
vote in favor of Quigley&#8217;s bankruptcy plan through a series of
legal moves before and after the bankruptcy filing, the judge
wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are disappointed in the court&#8217;s ruling as we continue
to believe that Pfizer has no liability for Quigley&#8217;s conduct,&#8221;
a Pfizer spokesman, Chris Loder, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernstein also denied a motion to seal settlements of
asbestos liabilities among Pfizer, Quigley and law firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right to Know &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The public has the right to know how much they were paid
to vote in favor of the Quigley&#8217;s plans,&#8221; the judge wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the proposed Chapter 11 plan, Pfizer would have paid
about $450 million into a trust to satisfy claims about products
for which it allegedly has derivative liability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy code would direct all future claims to the
trust, covering death and personal injury claims over Insulag,
Panelag and Damit, Quigley products for the steel industry
containing asbestos that were made from the time of World War II
to the 1970s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan barred claimants from taking future actions
against Pfizer. Pfizer was a defendant in 280,343 of the 411,100
claims served against Quigley, Bernstein noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Pfizer settlements were part of a strategy, conceived
and executed in bad faith, to manipulate the vote in this
case,&#8221; Bernstein wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quigley, founded in 1916, made three products containing
asbestos from the 1940s to the 1970s. It was bought by Pfizer in
1968. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Products With Asbestos &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, before it streamlined its business to focus on
pharmaceuticals, also made asbestos-containing products
including Kilnoise, an acoustical plaster, and Firex, an
insulation for armaments in the military. Its liability policies
gave joint coverage to itself and Quigley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First named as a defendant in asbestos claims in 1979 or
1980, Quigley was named in 411,100 personal-injury claims and
131,500 civil actions by the time it filed bankruptcy. In
September 1992, Quigley sold all its operating assets to
Specialty Refractories Inc. and didn&#8217;t operate at all until it
entered Chapter 11 protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quigley&#8217;s only activity has been processing asbestos claims
while in bankruptcy since 2004. Bernstein&#8217;s ruling comes months
after a 15-day trial that pitted the U.S. government and
asbestos victims against Pfizer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Quigley Co., 04-15739, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dollar Index faces an
&#8220;important upside hurdle&#8221; at 83.34 and 83.56 following its
reversal from a 81.90 support level, according technical
analysis by JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar withstood challenges at key support levels,
suggesting an increasing risk that the currency could begin to
strengthen and push the index, a benchmark for the greenback&#8217;s
performance against the currencies of six trading partners,
higher from its August lows, wrote Niall O&#8217;Connor, a currency
strategist with JPMorgan in New York, in a note to clients
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Those levels will suggest whether the dollar is extending
the rally from August or whether we&#8217;re seeing a retest of the
August lows,&#8221; O&#8217;Connor said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The index fell 0.4 percent to 82.487 at 10:53 a.m. in New
York. It has gained 3 percent since touching 80.085 on Aug. 6,
the lowest since March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. dollar yesterday pierced the 1.0470 level on the
Canadian dollar, and with the greenback at a 15-year low against
the yen it may be difficult for the currency to continue its
decline, O&#8217;Connor wrote. The U.S. currency faces downside
pressure from the Australian dollar, which is poised to test
resistance at the 0.9200 to 0.9225 level, and is approaching
medium-term lows against the Brazilian real of 1.70. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In technical analysis, investors and analysts study trading
patterns to forecast changes in a security, commodity, currency
or index. Support and resistance refer to lower and upper
boundaries, respectively, of a trading range where buy or sell
orders may be clustered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bancorp and PNC Financial
Services Group Inc. may lead the biggest boom in bank takeovers
since 2007, and this time, the largest lenders can only sit and
watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank loans outstanding have dropped 10 percent since
October 2008, the deepest contraction in more than 35 years,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. That&#8217;s left banks with
unused lending capacity, idle cash and depressed market values,
making laggards ripe for consolidation, according to KBW Inc.,
Rochdale Securities LLC and CreditSights Inc. Potential targets
include KeyCorp, SunTrust Banks Inc. and Regions Financial Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buyers probably won&#8217;t have to bid against the four biggest
U.S. lenders, keeping a lid on prices. Bank of America Corp.,
JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Wells Fargo  Co. each controls about
10 percent or more of U.S. deposits, the most permitted by
regulators when considering takeovers, and Citigroup Inc. is
trying to sell assets. Their absence leaves the field to the
biggest regional banks such as U.S. Bancorp and PNC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Those companies have the luxury of looking at anything,&#8221;
said KBW analyst Christopher McGratty in New York. Acquirers are
more likely to strike than they were last year now that the
industry has stabilized, he said. &#8220;If you feel you have a fair
assessment of what your own assets are worth, you feel better
about looking at others.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hunting Targets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executives at Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp, Pittsburgh-
based PNC, BBT Corp. and People&#8217;s United Financial Inc. have
all made acquisitions and say they&#8217;re hunting for more. U.S.
Bancorp, ranked fifth by deposits among commercial banks,
acquired at least 10 banks since the credit crunch started,
while PNC is sixth after buying National City Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The catalyst for deals could be announcements in November
of minimums for capital and liquidity from international
regulators meeting in the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision, according to Richard Bove, analyst at Rochdale
Securities in Lutz, Florida. Banks that can&#8217;t meet the
thresholds may become targets, and acquirers will know how much
capital deals will require, Bove said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price-to-book ratio for the 24 companies in the KBW
Bank Index is 0.9, down from an average of 2.1 times from 1993
through 2006, according to Bloomberg data. The ratio, comparing
the stock price to the theoretical amount shareholders would own
if liabilities were subtracted from assets, is one of Wall
Street&#8217;s main gauges for bank shares. A lower figure could make
a bank vulnerable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discounts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks trading at large discounts include SunTrust, Regions
and Marshall  Ilsley Corp., Bove said. Atlanta-based SunTrust
trades at about 0.7 times book value, Regions at 0.6 and
Marshall  Ilsley at 0.7, according to Bloomberg data. Regions,
Alabama&#8217;s biggest bank, is based in Birmingham. Marshall 
Ilsley is based in Milwaukee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KBW, which specializes in banks, named 38 potential buyers,
26 possible sellers and 11 buyers that could become sellers.
Targets include Boston Private Financial Holdings Inc. of
Boston, Susquehanna Bancshares Inc. of Lititz, Pennsylvania, and
Wilmington Trust Corp. of Wilmington, Delaware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takeover valuations will be one-third lower than during the
last merger binge of 2000 to 2007, according to KBW. Prices will
be about 15 times long-term annual earnings and 1.5 times
tangible book value, KBW said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for banks named as targets declined to comment or
didn&#8217;t respond to inquiries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Deals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bancorp will continue to &#8220;opportunistically
acquire,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer Richard K. Davis said in a
July conference call. Recent weakness in the economy could make
other banks more interested in selling, Davis said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PNC finished integrating National City branches and
accounts in June, six months ahead of plan, CEO James E. Rohr
said in a July conference call. PNC&#8217;s confidence that it can
digest another bank &#8220;is higher than it has ever been,&#8221; Rohr
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s focus is on growing without acquisitions, said
Thomas Kelly, a bank spokesman. Bank of America&#8217;s Scott Silvestri referred to repeated comments by CEO Brian T. Moynihan
that the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company won&#8217;t pursue
acquisitions. Mark Costiglio, a spokesman for New York-based
Citigroup, and Mary Eshet, at San Francisco-based Wells Fargo,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign Bidders &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the biggest banks are sidelined, competition may
emerge from Canada and Europe. Banco Santander SA has been
stalking Buffalo-based MT Bank Corp., according to the
Financial Times, while Bank of Montreal and Royal Bank of Canada
said they may expand in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takeovers will start with smaller banks, said Paul J. Miller, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets Corp. in Arlington,
Virginia, and a former examiner for the Philadelphia Federal
Reserve Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples include First Niagara Financial Corp.&#8217;s $1.5
billion offer in August for NewAlliance Bancshares Inc., Miller
said. The biggest takeover of an open U.S. commercial bank since
2008 will lift Buffalo-based First Niagara into the ranks of the
nation&#8217;s 25 biggest lenders, according to the company. Both
First Niagara and NewAlliance, based in New Haven, Connecticut,
were on KBW&#8217;s list of buyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pacing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pace of consolidation will quicken if the economy, loan
demand, and interest rates fail to rebound, analysts said. When
borrowers repay loans, banks have nowhere to put the cash except
lower-yielding securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That pressure is going to continue to mount into 2011,&#8221;
and push banks into deals, said analyst David Hendler of
CreditSights in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank loans in the U.S. fell $869 billion to $8.24 trillion
from October 2008 through early August, according to Goldman
Sachs. The decline is more than twice the 4 percent slide in
2001. At U.S. Bancorp, average loans grew in the second quarter
by 4 percent annually. Without acquisitions, they would have
dropped 2.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that kind of environment, where demand for what banks do
is sinking, &#8220;the only way you are going to grow assets is to
buy another bank,&#8221; Miller said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said
investors should buy Greek 30-year government bonds as backstops
from the European Union and central bank reduce the risk of
owning the debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With the European Central Bank likely to maintain its
longer-term refinancing operations for a while,&#8221; the allure of
this trade will &#8220;remain high,&#8221; Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Vaknin in London wrote today in an e-mailed research note. The
&#8220;process might be bumpy at times,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs made the trade recommendation starting Sept.
3, according to the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greek bond maturing in September 2040 fell, sending the
yield 3 basis points higher to 9.36 percent as of 12:32 p.m. in
London. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market value of emerging-market
stocks may surge more than fivefold to $80 trillion in two
decades, overtaking developed nations, as China becomes the
world&#8217;s largest stock market, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faster economic expansion and growing capital markets may
lift emerging nations&#8217; share of world equity capitalization to
55 percent by 2030 from 31 percent today, Goldman strategists
led by Timothy Moe wrote in a research report. Institutional
investors in developed nations will probably buy a net $4
trillion of emerging-market equities, lifting holdings to 18
percent of their total portfolios from 6 percent now, Moe wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The primary drivers are rapid economic growth and the
maturing of equity markets that are at earlier stages of
development,&#8221; Moe wrote in the report today. &#8220;Developed-market
institutional asset management pools will need to increase their
holdings of emerging-market equities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has more than doubled since
the beginning of 2000 even as the MSCI World Index of advanced-
nation shares dropped about 21 percent. Emerging economies will
expand 6.4 percent as a group next year, compared with 2.4
percent in developed nations, according to forecasts by
International Monetary Fund. Prospects for faster growth spurred
investors to add money to emerging-market equity funds for a
14th straight week even as they pulled $6.87 billion from global
stock funds, research firm EPFR Global said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relative Valuations &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 21-country MSCI emerging gauge has gained 1.2 percent
this year, while the MSCI World index declined 4.2 percent amid
concern that stagnant jobs growth and spending cuts by indebted
governments will hamper economic recoveries in the U.S. and
Europe. The emerging gauge is valued at 14.2 times reported
profits, compared with the MSCI World, which trades for 15.1
times earnings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI China Index of Hong Kong-traded shares has slipped
3.4 percent this year and the Shanghai Composite Index,
comprised of stocks traded mostly by mainland Chinese investors,
has dropped 18 percent. The market value of Chinese shares may
climb to $41 trillion by 2030 from $5 trillion today, topping
the $34 trillion projection for the U.S., Moe wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Emerging equity market capitalization could increase
substantially,&#8221; Moe wrote. &#8220;Investors, financial
intermediaries and developed-market corporates will have
significant opportunities as well as challenges from these
shifts in the equity landscape.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lebanon&#8217;s Finance Minister Raya Haffar el-Hassan sent a draft 2011 budget to the Cabinet
yesterday, calling for a 12.7 percent increase in expenditure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiscal spending will rise to 20.6 trillion Lebanese pounds
($13.7 billion), while revenue is projected to increase 16
percent to 15.1 trillion pounds, according to the proposals. The
subsequent deficit is equivalent to 8.6 percent of expected
gross domestic product, down from a revised 8.9 percent this
year. The initial shortfall forecast for this year was 10.7
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once approved by the Cabinet, the proposals will be sent to
parliament for discussion. The Cabinet on June 19 approved the
draft budget for 2010, which has yet to be ratified by
parliament. If approved, it would become the first ratified
budget since 2005 because of political disagreements, a month-
long war with Israel and internal civil strife. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lebanon&#8217;s economic growth will accelerate to 5 percent next
year from an initial forecast of 4.5 percent in 2010, according
to the draft budget. In May the ministry had forecast 4 percent
growth for next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The budget forecasts that inflation will slow to 2.8
percent in 2011 from the International Monetary Fund&#8217;s 5 percent
estimate for this year. The IMF estimates inflation will be 3.4
percent in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Saad Hariri&#8217;s government, which was formed
in November, has to finance a public debt that is estimated to
reach $55.3 billion next year or about 129 percent of GDP from
about 131 percent in 2010. Lebanon&#8217;s debt to GDP ratio has
declined from a high of 180 percent at the end of 2006. It
accumulated the debt as it rebuilt the country after a 15-year
civil war that ended in 1990 and the conflict with Israel in
2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s Investors Service rates Lebanon&#8217;s local and foreign
currency bond ratings at B1, four levels below investment grade.
Standard  Poor&#8217;s rates Lebanon at B, five levels below
investment grade. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visant Holding Corp., the U.S.
publishing firm owned by KKR  Co., is marketing debt as
corporate bond sales jumped to the third-most this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s Visant Corp. unit plans to sell $750 million of
notes due 2017, the Armonk, New York-based company said
yesterday in a statement distributed by PR Newswire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Company bond sales in the U.S. surged to $16.4 billion
yesterday, surpassing the weekly totals for the past three
periods in a single day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It was the third-busiest day this year, the data
show. Companies are taking advantage of record-low borrowing
costs to sell debt, said Tom Murphy, a portfolio manager at
Columbia Management in Minneapolis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Equity markets are feeling better, there&#8217;s a lot of cash
out there and a lot of companies want to take advantage of low
all-in yields,&#8221; said Murphy, who helps oversee more than $25
billion of investment-grade credit at Columbia Management in
Minneapolis. &#8220;That&#8217;s the recipe for a lot of supply and a lot
of demand.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index climbed the most since the
five days ended July 9 last week, before dropping 1.2 percent
yesterday. Companies sold $18.8 billion of dollar-denominated
debt on Feb. 4 and $19.8 billion of bonds on Jan. 5, Bloomberg
data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lloyds, SocGen &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to own investment-grade
debt instead of Treasuries was unchanged at 190 basis points, or
1.9 percentage points yesterday, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch&#8217;s U.S. Corporate Master index. Yields fell to 3.83
percent, near the record 3.74 percent on Aug. 24, the lowest in
the measure&#8217;s history dating to October 1986. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lloyds TSB Bank Plc, the U.K.&#8217;s largest mortgage lender,
and Societe Generale SA, France&#8217;s second-largest bank after BNP
Paribas SA, each sold $2 billion of dollar-denominated debt to
lead issuance, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MetroPCS Communications Inc., the U.S. pay-as-you-go mobile
phone company, was the only high-yield, high-risk issuer,
selling $1 billion of notes in a boosted offering, the data
show. The company earlier marketed $500 million of the notes,
according to a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spreads on high-yield, high-risk debt widened 6 basis
points to 668 basis points, according to the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield Master II Index. Yields on the
securities fell to 8.471 percent from 8.494 percent. Junk bonds
are rated below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and BBB- by
Standard  Poor&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visant Corp. plans to sell notes to repay existing senior
secured credit facilities, fund tender offers, make dividend and
dividend-equivalent payments to holders of its parent company&#8217;s
common stock and options, and related expenses, according to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is a description of at least $4.65 billion of
pending sales of dollar-denominated bonds in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment Grade &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KOREA HYDRO  NUCLEAR POWER CO., a unit of state-run Korea
Electric Power Corp., may sell bonds denominated in U.S.
dollars, according to a person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOHA BANK QSC, Qatar&#8217;s third-largest bank, may raise as
much as $1 billion from bond sales, its chief executive officer
said. The debt is likely to be for five years and is meant to
&#8220;fix the maturity mismatch&#8221; on the bank&#8217;s balance sheet,
Raghavan Seetharaman said in a June 16 telephone interview from
Doha. The bank will sell the bonds in dollars and the local
riyal currency, the CEO said in a July 25 interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not Rated &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CELANESE CORP., the largest producer of acetyl chemicals
used in paint and plastics, plans to sell $400 million of senior
unsecured notes due in 2018, it said in a statement distributed
by Business Wire. The Dallas-based company plans to use proceeds
to retire existing bank debt, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STERICYCLE INC. plans to issue $175 million of seven-year,
3.89 percent notes and $225 million of 10-year, 4.47 percent
debt after receiving informal commitments from 22 institutional
investors to buy the securities, it said in a statement
distributed by Business Wire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High Yield &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EXCO RESOURCES INC., the Dallas-based oil and gas producer,
plans to sell $750 million of senior notes due in 2018 to repay
debt, it said in a statement distributed by Business Wire.
JPMorgan Chase  Co., Bank of America Corp., BNP Paribas, Royal
Bank of Canada and Wells Fargo  Co. are managing the sale, Exco
said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VISANT HOLDING CORP., the U.S. marketing and publishing
firm owned by KKR  Co., plans to sell $750 million of notes due
in 2017 through its Visant Corp. unit, according to a statement
distributed by PR Newswire. Visant is also seeking a $1.25
billion term loan and a $175 million revolving line of credit,
the Armonk, New York-based company said in the statement.
Proceeds from the borrowings may be used to repay debt and pay a
dividend to investors in Visant&#8217;s stock and options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TITAN INTERNATIONAL INC., the maker of tires and wheels for
off-highway vehicles, plans to sell bonds in September or
October and will use the proceeds to repay debt, Chief Financial
Officer Paul Reitz said in a telephone interview. The Quincy,
Illinois-based company plans to buy back up to $139.9 million of
notes maturing in 2012, it said in a statement distributed by
Business Wire. The company withdrew a proposed $150 million
offering announced in May because of adverse market conditions,
Reitz said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NBTY INC., the maker of Nature&#8217;s Bounty and MET-Rx
nutritional supplements, may issue $900 million of bonds in
addition to seeking a $1.5 billion term loan and a $200 million
revolving line of credit to help pay for its acquisition by
Carlyle Group, according to a person familiar with the
transaction who declined to be identified because terms aren&#8217;t
set. SP assigned the notes, or borrowings under a bridge credit
facility in their place, a rank of B. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UNIVERSAL HEALTH SERVICES INC., the operator of more than
100 U.S. medical facilities that&#8217;s buying Psychiatric Solutions
Inc., cut its offering of senior unsecured notes to $250
million, according to a person familiar with the transaction. It
increased the size of the term loans it&#8217;s seeking by $100
million, said the person, who declined to be identified because
terms aren&#8217;t set. The King of Prussia, Pennsylvania-based
company previously planned to issue $400 million of senior
unsecured debt to help finance the acquisition, according to a
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E-LAND FASHION CHINA HOLDINGS LTD, the Hong Kong-based
apparel products provider, hired Morgan Stanley to help it sell
$200 million of three-year bonds, according to a person familiar
with the matter. Moody&#8217;s Investors Service ranked the proposed
notes at Ba2, citing growing personal consumption in China, E-
Land Fashion&#8217;s moderate scale and significant business
volatility. Proceeds will be used mainly for capital
expenditures and general corporate purposes, Moody&#8217;s said in the
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offerings in Pipeline &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BANCO DE CREDITO DEL PERU, the nation&#8217;s largest bank, may
sell benchmark 10-year dollar-denominated notes in the country&#8217;s
first corporate international bond issue in four months. BCP, a
unit of Credicorp Ltd., hired Bank of America Corp. and Deutsche
Bank AG to arrange meetings with bond investors, according to a
person familiar with the transaction who declined to be
identified because terms aren&#8217;t set. A benchmark sale is
typically at least $500 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TELEMAR NORTE LESTE SA, Brazil&#8217;s biggest fixed-line phone
company, hired Bank of America Corp., BNP Paribas SA, BTG
Pactual SA and Itau Unibanco Holding SA to sell benchmark dollar
bonds, according to a person familiar with the transaction.
Telemar, known as Oi, plans to start meeting with bond investors
Sept. 6, said the person, who declined to be identified because
terms aren&#8217;t set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AEGIS LTD., an outsourcing unit of Essar Group, may sell
the first non-convertible dollar bonds from an Indian
information technology company. The company, which bought
PeopleSupport Inc. in 2008, may sell its bonds as part of a
financing package that would include a loan of as much as $350
million to consolidate debt, Chief Financial Officer C.M. Sharma
said. The money would go to fund expansion &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP INC., the insurer that&#8217;s
majority owned by the U.S., may sell bonds to help repay its
government bailout, it said in an Aug. 9 registration statement
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GATX CORP., a Chicago-based company that leases railroad
cars and other equipment, filed a shelf registration with the
Securities and Exchange Commission to sell debt securities and
pass-through certificates. The debt securities may be senior or
subordinated, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JSW STEEL LTD, India&#8217;s third-largest steelmaker, plans to
sell dollar bonds for the first time in three years and as
rupee-denominated finance costs rise. JSW has applied for credit
ratings before a possible offshore bond sale to help build a 200
billion rupee ($4.3 billion) steel and power plant in West
Bengal, Chief Financial Officer Seshagiri Rao said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARGENTINA may sell $1 billion of bonds due in 2017, El
Cronista newspaper reported, without saying how it obtained the
information. The government is also planning to offer an
exchange for dollar bonds due in 2011 and 2012, the Buenos
Aires-based publication said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RURAL ELECTRIFICATION CORP., India&#8217;s state-owned lender to
power projects, may sell as much as $300 million of bonds in
U.S. dollars, Finance Director Hari Das Khunteta said in a
telephone interview. Rural Electrification plans to raise $500
million from debt sales in the year ending March 31, he had said
on April 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE PHILIPPINES hired eight banks to help arrange the sale
of 10-year bonds, which may also include five- and seven-year
issues, Treasurer Roberto Tan wrote in a mobile-phone message.
The Philippines is also preparing to seek central bank approval
for a planned sale of new dollar-denominated debt to exchange
for older, shorter-dated notes, Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima
said on August 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UKRAINE may sell bonds in the international capital
markets, according to Dragon Capital, the former Soviet
republic&#8217;s biggest brokerage. The government may sell $1.5
billion to $2 billion of 10-year, dollar-denominated debt with a
yield of 7 percent to 7.5 percent after getting approval for a
new International Monetary Fund loan and having its credit
rating raised by Standard  Poor&#8217;s, said Olena Bilan, Dragon&#8217;s
chief economist, at a press briefing in Kiev on July 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CZECH REPUBLIC plans to sell as much as $2 billion of
dollar bonds to diversify from koruna and euro debt, Eduard Janota, former finance minister, said in an interview for Mlada
Fronta Dnes newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POTASH CORPORATION OF SASKATCHEWAN INC., the world&#8217;s
largest fertilizer company by capacity, filed a registration
statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for
$2 billion of debt securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;INDONESIA plans to name three banks to help it sell about
$650 million of Islamic bonds in October, Dahlan Siamat,
director for Islamic financing at the finance ministry, said in
a telephone interview in Jakarta. The government sold its first
international Islamic dollar bonds in April 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CORPORACION FINANCIERA DE DESAROLLO SA, Peru&#8217;s state
development bank known as Cofide, plans to sell as much as $250
million of bonds, according to Chief Financial Officer Carlos Linares. Linares said in an interview in Lima that the lender is
selling long-term debt as it boosts lending to local
infrastructure projects. &#8220;Peru&#8217;s need for infrastructure is
huge,&#8221; Linares said. &#8220;The government is trying to promote
foreign investment in a long list of projects.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SRI LANKA hired HSBC, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and
Royal Bank of Scotland to sell $1 billion of bonds, the Central
Bank of Sri Lanka said on its website on Aug 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JORDAN plans to sell about $500 million of bonds, Finance
Minister Mohammad Abu Hammour said in an interview on June 23.
The sale will be denominated in U.S. dollars &#8220;as it&#8217;s a stable
currency and the Jordanian dinar is pegged to it,&#8221; Abu Hammour
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;URUGUAY may sell as much as $1 billion of bonds in 2011,
including $500 million of dollar-denominated debt, Carlos Steneri, director of public credit at Uruguay&#8217;s Ministry of
Economy and Finance, said June 3 at a Latin Finance conference
in London. The dollar-denominated bonds may have a maturity of
20 years or more, Steneri said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MALAYSIA plans to raise about $1 billion from its first
sale of conventional dollar bonds in eight years after drawing
bids for five times the Islamic debt it offered, a finance
ministry official said. The government may hire banks including
CIMB Group Holdings Bhd. and HSBC Holdings Plc to arrange the
sale by Sept. 30, said the official, who declined to be named as
the discussions are private. Malaysia raised $1.25 billion from
a Shariah-compliant dollar bond on May 27. Malaysia is rated A3
by Moody&#8217;s and A- by SP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GHANA is considering selling its second dollar bond in 2011
to tap investor demand as the start-up of oil production boosts
economic growth and narrows the budget deficit, Deputy Finance
Minister Fifi Kwetey said. The government was considering a
&#8220;no-deal roadshow&#8221; to gauge international investors&#8217; appetite,
Kwetey said in a May 26 interview in Abidjan. Ghana sold its
first global bond in 2007, raising $750 million to help fund the
construction of roads and power plants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANGOLA received credit ratings from Moody&#8217;s, SP, and Fitch
Ratings that put it on par with Nigeria, Lebanon and Belarus,
and paved the way for a planned sale of international bonds. The
southern African nation&#8217;s creditworthiness was rated at B+ by
SP and Fitch, four levels below investment grade. Moody&#8217;s
assigned an equivalent ranking of B1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MONGOLIA plans to raise $500 million selling bonds in 2010
and the remainder of a planned $1.2 billion program will be sold
according to market conditions, Batbayar Balgan, director
general of the financial and economic policy department of
Mongolia, said at a forum in Ulan Bator on June 16. The
government scaled back its plans for global bond sales after
Europe&#8217;s debt crisis drove up borrowing costs. Investment banks
are advising Mongolia to issue debt with maturities of 5 years
to 10 years, Finance Minister Sangajav Bayartsogt said in a Feb.
9 interview. The securities may yield 8 percent to 11 percent,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) has downgraded
five Australian real estate investment trusts, saying their
share prices are too expensive compared with their peers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GPT Group (GPT), CFS Retail Property Trust (CFX) and Bunnings Warehouse
Property Trust (BWP) were cut to &#8220;underweight&#8221; from &#8220;neutral&#8221; and
Stockland (SGP) and ING Office Fund (IOF) to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from
&#8220;overweight.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market is now paying far too much for the passive
rent collectors -- a skew too far towards defense,&#8221; analysts
led by Rob Stanton at JPMorgan wrote in a note dated yesterday.
&#8220;We see less need for very defensive positioning and as a
result see CFX, GPT, and CPA - arguably the most defensive of
the large cap REITs - as expensive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australian property trusts largely returned to profit in
the year to June 30 after they paid off debt and simplified
their structures. REITs&#8217; balance sheets are now &#8220;historically
strong&#8221; after they raised more than A$18 billion ($16 billion)
of capital in 2008 and 2009, Moody&#8217;s Investors Service said on
Aug. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many other REITs are still undervalued, with the industry
as a whole -- excluding Westfield Group (WDC) -- trading at a 2
percent discount to net tangible assets, Stanton wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan now recommends investors buy shares of Westfield,
Dexus Property Group (DXS), Australand Property Group (ALZ), ING Industrial
Fund and Charter Hall Retail Trust (CQR) on a recovery in demand, low
debt levels and improvement in property values. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GPT shares fell 1 percent to close at A$3.05 in Sydney. CFS
Retail lost 1.3 percent to A$1.955, Bunnings Warehouse slipped
0.5 percent to A$1.92, Stockland declined 1 percent to A$4.06
and ING Office ended down 2.4 percent at 61.5 Australian cents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. said today it will
start selling its Kinect motion-sensing device for the Xbox 360
video-game console in Japan on Nov. 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accessory will retail from 14,800 yen ($177) with the
&#8220;Kinect Adventures!&#8221; game included, Takashi Sensui, head of
Microsoft&#8217;s game business in Japan, said at a briefing in Tokyo.
Microsoft also will release 10 games for the Kinect in Japan by
early next year, including titles from Sega Sammy Holdings Inc.,
Namco Bandai Holdings Inc. and Konami Corp., Microsoft said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is counting on the Kinect, a box that sits near
the console and tracks a player&#8217;s movements several feet away,
to narrow the gap with Sony Corp. and Nintendo Co. in game-
console sales in Japan. The device competes with Sony&#8217;s Move
motion controller for the PlayStation 3, while Nintendo plans to
introduce a 3-D model of the DS portable player and a heart-rate
tracking &#8220;Vitality Sensor&#8221; for the Wii console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are offering a completely new experience: Gaming
without a controller,&#8221; Sensui said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outsold by Wii, PS3 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft plans to introduce the
Kinect in the U.S. in November for $149.99, the company said in
July. It plans to include it in a $299.99 package featuring the
new, slimmer Xbox 360 console and the &#8220;Kinect Adventures!&#8221;
game. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing nations&#8217; share of global

&lt;p&gt;The election of a minority
government in Australia carries risks for investors in the
nation&#8217;s share market, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest risk will be pressure on the central bank to
raise interest rates if the government increases spending to
accommodate a disparate group of lawmakers that helped it win
power, JPMorgan said in research note. An inherently unstable
administration might also increase spending to boost its
popularity ahead of a possible fresh election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The administration will essentially be in constant
election mode, which is not a recipe for tight fiscal
discipline,&#8221; strategists led by Paul Brunker said in the note,
dated yesterday. &#8220;Higher government spending adds to the
potential for interest rates to go into more dangerous territory
for consumers and housing demand.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Julia Gillard&#8217;s Labor Party was forced to
negotiate a power-sharing agreement with the Greens Party and
three independents after losing its majority in an Aug. 21

cities agreed yesterday to back Gillard in return for A$9.9
billion ($9.1 billion) of investment in rural areas to improve
health care and education. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TowerBrook Capital Partners LP
appointed Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to review
options for its investment in luxury-shoes and accessories maker
Jimmy Choo Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TowerBrook, the buyout firm spun out of Soros Fund
Management LLC, asked the banks to evaluate options including
&#8220;new partnerships and accessing to alternative financial
markets,&#8221; the London-based firm said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TowerBrook bought a majority stake in Jimmy Choo from
London-based private-equity firm Lion Capital LLC in 2007. The
deal valued the company at 185 million pounds ($286 million) and
marked the third time the fashion brand, founded in 1996, was
acquired by a private-equity investor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Jimmy Choo has continued to evolve as a successful,
innovative and high-value business, delivering record revenue
growth and profitability,&#8221; Ramez Sousou, TowerBrook co-chief
executive officer, said. &#8220;We are proud to be associated with
this brand and team and remain highly committed shareholders.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Options for the London-based designer include a sale and an
initial public offering, people with knowledge of the plans said
previously. Jimmy Choo, whose shoes are worn by celebrities such
as actress Jennifer Lopez, may attract interest from strategic
bidders and other buyout firms, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has more than 110 stores worldwide, having
recently opened locations in Singapore, Dubai, Sydney and Macau,
according to TowerBrook&#8217;s website. Sales have grown 30 percent a
year on average since 2001 as it expanded into bags, leather
goods, scarves and sneakers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks advanced, sending the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index higher for a second day, as a
bigger-than-estimated decrease in jobless claims bolstered
optimism in the economic recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. rallied 2.5 percent after Morgan
Stanley said banks will be able to boost dividends and buy back
shares next year. Adobe Systems Inc. jumped 12 percent as Apple
Inc. said it will relax developer restrictions on mobile
applications. Equities trimmed gains as Bloomberg News reported
Deutsche Bank AG is considering a $11.4 billion stock sale,
renewing concern that European lenders need to raise capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 rose 0.5 percent to 1,104.18 at 4 p.m. in New
York and earlier climbed to its highest intraday level since
Aug. 11. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 28.23 points,
or 0.3 percent, to 10,415.24. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The jobless-claims report is a nice sign that things
aren&#8217;t as dire as people were predicting,&#8221; said Stewart Beach,
who oversees $1.1 billion as chief investment strategist at Old
Second National Bank in Aurora, Illinois. &#8220;It&#8217;s a positive for
stocks and taken together with the narrowing trade deficit
number it&#8217;s further evidence of a slow recovery rather than a
double-dip recession.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 rose for the sixth time in seven days as the
decrease in jobless claims and improving demand at European bond
auctions tempered speculation that the global economy will slip
back into a recession. The index pared a rally of as much as 1
percent today as three people familiar with the matter said
Deutsche Bank has approached investment banks to assess interest
in managing the stock sale. The U.S.-traded shares of Germany&#8217;s
largest lender fell 3.2 percent $59.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Banks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The losses imbedded in European banks may be larger than
the stress tests indicated earlier this year,&#8221; said Jason Brady, a managing director at Thornburg Investment Management in
Santa Fe, New Mexico, which oversees about $60 billion. &#8220;If
Deutsche Bank is selling shares to address that problem, then
other banks have to raise more capital as well, but we don&#8217;t
know how much.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500, the benchmark measure for U.S. equities, has
fallen 9.3 percent from its 2010 high in April amid mounting
evidence of a slowdown in the world&#8217;s largest economy. The drop
pushed the index&#8217;s valuation to 12 times estimated profits in
the next year, near the lowest since March 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial jobless claims dropped by 27,000 to 451,000 last
week, Labor Department figures showed, trailing the median
economist estimate of 470,000 in a Bloomberg survey. The trade
gap shrank 14 percent, the most since February 2009, to $42.8
billion, Commerce Department figures showed. Economists forecast
a deficit of $47 billion, according to the survey median.
Exports rose 1.8 percent to $153.3 billion, a two-year high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financials Gain &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP 500 financial shares advanced 1.2 percent as Morgan
Stanley said banks will be able to boost dividends and buy back
shares next year, while analyst Richard Bove at Rochdale
Securities named 17 banks as potential takeover targets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan rose the most in the Dow, rallying 2.5 percent to
$40.10. SunTrust Banks Inc. and Fifth Third Bancorp, two of 17
companies named by Bove as possible takeover targets, advanced
at least 2.9 percent to lead gains in banks. The 24-company KBW
Bank Index rallied 1.6 percent and the gauge is up 7.3 percent
this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adobe gained the most in the SP 500, rallying 12 percent
to $32.86. The biggest maker of graphic-design programs gained
after Apple said it will publish review guidelines for its App
Store for the first time and relax restrictions on the
development tools that software programmers use to create mobile
applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, McDonald&#8217;s &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc., owner of the most-popular Internet search
engine, rose 1.2 percent to $476.18. UBS AG said Google Instant
service &#8220;should increase Google&#8217;s search market share over
time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McDonald&#8217;s Corp. fell 2.3 percent to $74.37 for the biggest
loss in the Dow. The world&#8217;s largest restaurant chain said same-
store sales rose 4.9 percent in August. Analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg had estimated an increase of 5 percent on average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corinthian Colleges Inc. rallied 11 percent to $5.44 on
speculation the for-profit university will be acquired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The stock&#8217;s responding to headlines about takeover
speculation,&#8221; said William Nichols, co-head of U.S. equities at
Cantor Fitzgerald LP in New York. &#8220;That&#8217;s why the stock
rallied.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stem-cell companies gained after an appeals court in
Washington said government funding of embryonic stem-cell
research may continue while the Obama administration appeals a
decision banning U.S. support for the practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geron Corp. climbed 7.8 percent to $5.27 while Aastrom
Biosciences Inc. added 1.4 percent to $1.50. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. power companies may raise their
2010 earnings forecasts on increasing electricity demand, driven
by hot weather and expanding manufacturing, JPMorgan Chase  Co.
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Power demand continues to experience a healthy rebound as
industrial demand continues to improve,&#8221; Andrew Smith, an
analyst at JPMorgan in Houston, said today in a report to
clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith said top picks to gain from the improving outlook
include Princeton, New Jersey-based NRG Energy Inc., the second-
largest power producer in Texas. CenterPoint Energy Inc., the
Houston area&#8217;s electricity distributor, and CMS Energy Corp.,
Michigan&#8217;s second-largest utility owner, have attractive
dividend yields and trade at low valuations relative to other
regulated utility companies, he said. The analyst has
&#8220;overweight&#8221; ratings on all three stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. power companies will raise 2010 profit forecasts by 3
percent to 5 percent following their third-quarter earnings
reports, Smith said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NRG rose 42 cents, or 2 percent, to $21.79 as of the 4 p.m.
close of New York Stock Exchange composite trading. CenterPoint
gained 15 cents to $15.21, and Jackson, Michigan-based CMS
climbed 13 cents to $17.65. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NextEra Energy Inc., based in Juno Beach, Florida, is
JPMorgan&#8217;s preferred stock among companies owning both regulated
and unregulated power plants, according to the report. NextEra
rose 34 cents to $54.61. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greece may need to extend a 110-
billion-euro ($140 billion) bailout from the European Union and
the International Monetary Fund by an extra three to six years
to avoid a default on its debt, JPMorgan Chase  Co said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think they have a choice, really, given their
deficit is so large,&#8221; said Pavan Wadhwa, head of European
interest-rate strategy at JPMorgan in London. &#8220;Either other
countries roll over the loans, effectively forgiving debt, or
Greece restructures its debt and the market starts to freeze up
again. They will need more help after the package expires if
they were to avoid an outright default.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IMF-EU plan, announced in May, is planned to end in
2012. Investors have dumped Greek bonds after the government
announced last year a budget shortfall of 13.6 percent of gross
domestic product, the second-highest level in the EU. Greece
plans to cut its deficit to 8.1 percent of gross domestic
product this year and 7.6 percent in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greek 10-year bonds rose for the first time in five days
today, pushing the yield down 11 basis points to 11.70 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nation won&#8217;t restructure its debt and will stick to
austerity measures it pledged as part of the bailout, Petros Christodoulou, head of the nation&#8217;s debt management agency, said
earlier today in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Very Supportive&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No one is even contemplating or thinking about&#8221; debt
restructuring, Christodoulou told Andrea Catherwood on Bloomberg
Television&#8217;s &#8220;The Pulse&#8221; program. &#8220;The general public is very
supportive of our measures.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The level of foreign compared with local holders of debt is
an important distinction, according to Wadhwa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Italy also has high debt, but half, or more, of its bonds
are held by local investors,&#8221; said Wadhwa. &#8220;In Greece, around
two-thirds of its bonds are held by foreigners.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors who want to buy Greek bonds should focus on
short-dated securities because the country is fully funded until
2012, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charles O. &#8220;Chuck&#8221; Prince and
Robert Rubin were among Citigroup Inc. officials who knew 2007
losses were mounting on mortgage assets that U.S. regulators
have faulted the bank for not disclosing, a court filing shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prince, the bank&#8217;s chief executive officer at the time, and
Rubin, then-chairman, knew the highest-rated segments of
subprime mortgage-backed securities were the source of about
$200 million in new losses in October 2007, the Securities and
Exchange Commission said yesterday in a filing at federal court
in Washington. In July, the agency accused the bank and two
other executives of failing to disclose $40 billion in subprime
assets before losses surged. It didn&#8217;t target Prince and Rubin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Ellen Huvelle asked the agency last
month to explain what senior executives knew as she considers
approving Citigroup&#8217;s $75 million settlement with the regulator.
The agency&#8217;s identification of Prince and Rubin may trigger
questions from the judge about why the agency didn&#8217;t bring
claims against more people, said Peter Henning, a professor at
Wayne State University Law School in Detroit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;How aware were they is always an open question in these
kinds of cases,&#8221; said Henning, a former SEC lawyer. &#8220;The SEC
should have provided investors a little more assurance that
senior management will be held accountable in these cases.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a filing, the SEC said two executives it targeted --
former Chief Financial Officer Gary Crittenden, 57, and former
investor relations chief Arthur Tildesley -- were &#8220;more
closely&#8221; tied to misleading disclosures than anyone else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC spokesman John Nester and Citigroup spokeswoman Shannon
Bell declined to comment. Adam Miller, a spokesman for Rubin,
72, didn&#8217;t return messages. Prince, 60, didn&#8217;t respond to emails
and a message at his office after business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Chief Risk Officer David Bushnell, 56, and General
Counsel Michael Helfer, 65, were among other executives who knew
the source of the mounting losses, according to the agency&#8217;s
filing. Bushnell couldn&#8217;t be reached by phone at home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Huvelle gave Citigroup until Sept. 13 to submit a
filing, and scheduled a Sept. 24 hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Citigroup
Inc., 10-cv-01277, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia
(Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Fined $27 Million for U.K. Reporting Lapses &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s London unit was fined 17.5
million pounds ($27 million) for failing to notify the U.K.&#8217;s
financial regulator about a U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $550 million in July to settle
the SEC&#8217;s fraud lawsuit over how it marketed a collateralized
debt obligation. The Financial Services Authority fined the New
York-based bank today for failing to report to U.K. regulators
the U.S. investigation that led to the suit, according to an FSA
statement. The firm qualified for the agency&#8217;s standard 30
percent discount for cooperating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;GSI did not set out to hide anything, but its defective
systems and controls meant that the level and quality of its
communications with the FSA fell far below what we expect,&#8221; FSA
enforcement chief Margaret Cole said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC sued Goldman Sachs and employee Fabrice Tourre in
April over claims the firm misled investors in a collateralized
debt obligation linked to subprime mortgages, known as the
Abacus transaction. The FSA said in April it would investigate
Goldman Sachs International in London after the SEC filed its
lawsuit. Gordon Brown, the prime minister at the time who was
facing a May election, called on the FSA to investigate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs created and sold the CDOs in 2007, as the
U.S. housing market faltered, without disclosing that hedge fund
Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying securities and bet
against the investment vehicles, the SEC said in the April 16
lawsuit. CDOs are pools of assets such as mortgage bonds
packaged into new securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re pleased the matter is resolved,&#8221; Goldman Sachs
spokeswoman Fiona Laffan said following the FSA announcement.
Tourre &#8220;remains an employee on paid leave,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Citigroup Broker Is Fined $500 in Squawk-Box Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Citigroup Inc. stockbroker Ralph Casbarro was fined
$500 and received no prison sentence or probation for his
involvement in a scheme to let day traders eavesdrop on internal
conversations over brokers&#8217; &#8220;squawk boxes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casbarro, 48, was fined yesterday by U.S. District Judge I.
Leo Glasser in Brooklyn, New York. Casbarro pleaded guilty in
2005 to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud. He
was fired by Citigroup before being indicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I know what I did was wrong without a shadow of a doubt
and I&#8217;m sorry for it,&#8221; Casbarro told the judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Mahaffy Jr., a former broker at Merrill Lynch  Co.
and Citigroup, and five co-defendants were found guilty in the
case in April 2009. Mahaffy was sentenced to two years in prison
in December. In July, the men lost a bid to have their
convictions tossed, after claiming that prosecutors hid evidence
of their innocence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glasser criticized the government for putting off
Casbarro&#8217;s sentencing for so long. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This has been five years since Mr. Casbarro pleaded
guilty,&#8221; the judge said. &#8220;Is that really part of the sentence
that has already been imposed?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Green said Casbarro agreed
to the delays as part of his cooperation accord with
prosecutors. Casbarro gave important assistance to the
government, prosecutors said, though they didn&#8217;t call him to
testify against his co-defendants. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Enterprises Settles Suits Over Buyout &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Enterprises, the largest distributor for beverage
maker Coca-Cola Co., agreed to settle shareholder lawsuits
challenging a planned $12.3 billion buyout of the bottler. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Atlanta-based companies will release more information
about the transaction, reduce a possible termination fee to $180
million from $200 million and pay as much as $7.5 million in
legal fees, according to papers made public yesterday in
Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defendants &#8220;have denied and continue to deny that they
have committed or aided and abetted in the commission of any
violation of the law&#8221; or any wrongful acts, lawyers said in
settlement papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co., the world&#8217;s biggest soda maker, said Feb. 25
it would buy the North American operations of bottler Coca-Cola
Enterprises for $10 and 1 share of a new bottling company for
each Coca-Cola Enterprises share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Enterprises shareholders filed lawsuits in Fulton
County, Georgia, and the Delaware court challenging the buyout
price. The parties agreed to settle the cases in part because of
the &#8220;time and expense&#8221; of pursuing the claims and &#8220;the
uncertainties inherent in such litigation,&#8221; lawyers said in a
Memorandum of Understanding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laura Brightwell, a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola Enterprises,
wasn&#8217;t available to respond to a phone call seeking comment on
the settlement, which must be approved by a judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased with the settlement,&#8221; Kenth Kaerhoeg, a
director of corporate media relations at Coca-Cola Co. said in
an e-mail. &#8220;We continue to expect a fourth-quarter close, on
track and on plan with our original timeline.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Delaware case is In re Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.
Shareholder Litigation, CA5291, Delaware Chancery Court
(Wilmington). The Georgia case is In re Coca-Cola Co.
Shareholder Litigation, CA 2010CV182035, Superior Court of

&lt;p&gt;Indian Court Dismisses Vodafone&#8217;s Tax Claim Challenge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bombay High Court dismissed Vodafone Group Plc&#8217;s
challenge of a tax claim exceeding $2 billion after the court
ruled Indian authorities have the right to pursue the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian tax authorities have the jurisdiction to seek taxes
from Vodafone International Holdings BV on its 2007 purchase of
Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.&#8217;s wireless operations in the country,
Judges D.Y. Chandrachud and J.P. Devadhar said. India&#8217;s tax
department had argued the world&#8217;s biggest mobile-phone company
failed to withhold taxes on its acquisition of Hutchison&#8217;s stake
in Hutchison Essar Ltd., or HEL. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling is a setback for Vodafone in a case seen by
investors as a test of India&#8217;s tolerance toward the use of tax
havens for acquisitions, according to Akil Hirani, a managing
partner at Mumbai-based law firm Majmudar  Co. Britain&#8217;s Prime
Minister at the time Gordon Brown wrote in December to his
Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh that taxing cross-border deals
such as Vodafone&#8217;s could create uncertainty for foreign
investors and affect the country&#8217;s investment climate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court directed tax authorities to not issue a final
order on its claim for a period of eight weeks and allowed
Vodafone 12 weeks to appeal the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vodafone is reviewing the judgment and is likely to appeal
the ruling, spokesman Ben Padovan said by telephone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;German Gambling Monopoly Is Unjustified, EU&#8217;s Top Court Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany&#8217;s state monopoly on sports-betting and lotteries
risks being struck down after the European Union&#8217;s highest court
said the country&#8217;s current rules are incompatible with EU law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany can&#8217;t block betting companies such as Bwin
Interactive Entertainment AG from providing betting services
while allowing public monopolies to &#8220;carry out intensive
advertising campaigns&#8221; to maximize lottery profits, the
European Court of Justice in Luxembourg said yesterday. Shares
in Bwin rose the most in more than a month after yesterday&#8217;s
rulings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are delighted with today&#8217;s rulings,&#8221; Katharina Riedl,
a spokeswoman for Vienna-based Bwin, said in a telephone
interview, calling the decisions &#8220;trend setting.&#8221; &#8220;This is a
historic opportunity to change German gambling regulation,&#8221;
following the examples of the U.K., France and Italy, she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former GE Unit Executive Sues Company for $10 Million &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Electric Capital Services was sued by a former
executive who claims he was forced out for questioning the
company&#8217;s treatment of an asset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edward Gormbley, who worked for GE Capital from 2000 until
he quit in September 2009, filed his suit yesterday in state
court in Stamford, Connecticut. The complaint also names parent
General Electric Co. and its chief executive officer, Jeffrey
Immelt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gormbley said he was punished for challenging the valuation
of silicon-maker Momentive Performance Materials, an investment
asset. GE Capital overstated Momentive&#8217;s value in December 2008
to improve its own balance sheet, he said. Valuing the asset
correctly would have reduced &#8220;GE Capital&#8217;s earnings 100
percent,&#8221; in the fourth quarter that year, according to the
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Gormbley refused to play GE&#8217;s game and just &#8216;get
along,&#8221; according to the filing. &#8220;GE and GE Capital&#8217;s response
was direct, unmistakable and as subtle as a hangman&#8217;s noose.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gormbley said he was shorn of responsibilities, was
downgraded in employee evaluations and had his annual bonus
slashed, effectively forcing him out of the company. He resigned
in September 2009 and is seeking $10 million in damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The allegations in Mr. Gormbley&#8217;s complaint are
meritless,&#8221; Russell Wilkerson, a spokesman for Fairfield,
Connecticut-based GE, said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;The
company will vigorously defend itself against these baseless
assertions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Gormbley v. General Electric Co., FST-CV10-
6006588-S, Connecticut Superior Court (Stamford). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UnitedHealth Faces as Much as $9.9 Billion in Fines &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UnitedHealth Group Inc., the biggest U.S. health insurer,
faces as much as $9.9 billion in fines in California over
allegations its PacifiCare Life and Health Insurance unit failed
to properly handle claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The California Department of Insurance, which first brought
the enforcement case in 2008, now claims 993,000 violations,
including 443,000 instances in which the insurer failed to
inform providers they could seek review of denied claims,
according to court filings. PacifiCare faces a fine of as much
as $10,000 per violation if it is found to be willful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is pending before an administrative law judge in
Oakland, California, Ioannis Kazanis, a spokesman for the
insurance department, said yesterday in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The California Department of Insurance&#8217;s allegations
concerning claims processing by PacifiCare are simply not
true,&#8221; Cheryl Randolph, a spokesman for Cypress, California-
based PacifiCare, said in a statement. &#8220;By all objective
measures, PacifiCare pays its claims timely and accurately.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 90 percent of the alleged violations are
administrative in nature, Randolph said. The vast majority
pertains to failure to include &#8220;certain language&#8221; in standard
claims correspondence during a four-month period in 2007, she
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California regulators said they had found 130,000
violations when they first brought the action against
PacifiCare, which UnitedHealth acquired in 2005. The state
alleges PacifiCare wrongfully denied claims, made incorrect
payments, was too slow to acknowledge receipt of claims, and
took too long to address appeals and disputes, among other
alleged violations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In the matter of PacifiCare Life and Health
Insurance Co., UPA 2007-00004, Before the Insurance Commissioner
of the State of California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roger Clemens Argues McNamee&#8217;s Suit Should Be Tossed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for Roger Clemens urged a judge to throw out a
lawsuit in which the former Major League Baseball pitcher is
accused of defamation by his onetime trainer, Brian McNamee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McNamee&#8217;s complaint fails to state claims he can sue over,
and Clemens didn&#8217;t defame him, Rusty Hardin argued at a hearing
yesterday before U.S. District Judge Sterling Johnson Jr. in
Brooklyn, New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. McNamee is suing Mr. Clemens because Mr. Clemens has
consistently denied that Mr. McNamee committed a crime&#8221; by
injecting him with illegal drugs, the lawyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clemens, 48, defamed McNamee by alleging that McNamee lied
when he told investigators the former New York Yankees pitcher
used steroids, the trainer said in the suit, filed last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ballplayer was indicted last month by a federal grand
jury in Washington on charges that he lied to the U.S. Congress
in denying he used steroids and human growth hormone to boost
his performance. He pleaded not guilty on Aug. 30 and a trial
was set for April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clemens wasn&#8217;t in the courtroom for yesterday&#8217;s hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson said he&#8217;d rule on the dismissal request at a later
date. Hardin, of Houston, told the judge that if his motion is
denied, he&#8217;ll ask to freeze the suit until the criminal case is
resolved. Richard D. Emery, a lawyer for McNamee, said he
probably wouldn&#8217;t oppose that request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defamation case is McNamee v. Clemens, 09-1647, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). The
criminal case is U.S. v. Clemens, 10-cr-00223, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Unit Denied Permission to Exit Bankruptcy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s Quigley unit, a former asbestos maker, was
denied permission to exit bankruptcy by a judge who found the
world&#8217;s largest drug company manipulated the bankruptcy process
to benefit itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart M. Bernstein in New York
yesterday rejected Quigley&#8217;s fourth reorganization plan and said
parties should discuss dismissal of the case. He said the plan
was filed in &#8220;bad faith&#8221; by Pfizer and cited testimony that
asbestos claims directed at Quigley could total $4.45 billion
over the next 42 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In a nutshell, Pfizer bought enough votes to assure that
any plan would be accepted,&#8221; Bernstein wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 90-page ruling that covers Pfizer&#8217;s failed attempts to
deal with its growing asbestos liabilities since June 1985,
Bernstein noted that a lawyer who represented both Quigley and
Pfizer settled claims against Quigley and got releases for
Pfizer at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Settling claimants were then given a financial incentive to
vote in favor of Quigley&#8217;s bankruptcy plan through a series of
legal moves before and after the bankruptcy filing, the judge
wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are disappointed in the court&#8217;s ruling as we continue
to believe that Pfizer has no liability for Quigley&#8217;s conduct,&#8221;
a Pfizer spokesman, Chris Loder, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Quigley Co., 04-15739, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boeing Unit Wins Dismissal of Torture Flights Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawsuit alleging a Boeing Co. unit disguised the delivery
of suspected terrorists to secret prisons where they were
tortured was dismissed by a U.S. appeals court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An 11-judge panel of a San Francisco-based appeals court
overruled a finding by a three-judge panel that a lower-court
judge was wrong to dismiss the case based on government claims
that the litigation might reveal state secrets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Douglas Letter, a Justice Department lawyer, argued in
December to the 11-judge panel that classified information
confirming or denying the Boeing unit&#8217;s relationship with the
Central Intelligence Agency may be revealed if the case
proceeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Wizner, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union,
which filed the case, claimed the government inappropriately
relied on a classified statement by General Michael Hayden, the
former Central Intelligence Agency director, to get the case
dismissed prematurely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Mohamed v. Jeppesen, 08-15693, U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Lindsay Fortado and Christine Harper" date="Sep 09, 2010  6:06 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-09/goldman-sachs-fined-27-million-by-u-k-for-failing-to-report-tourre-probe.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Fined $27 Million by U.K. for Not Reporting Probe</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s London
unit was fined 17.5 million pounds ($27 million) for failing to
notify the U.K.&#8217;s financial regulator about a U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $550 million in July to settle
the SEC&#8217;s fraud lawsuit over how it marketed a collateralized
debt obligation. The Financial Services Authority fined the New
York-based bank today for failing to report to U.K. regulators
the U.S. investigation that led to the suit, according to an FSA
statement. The firm qualified for the agency&#8217;s standard 30
percent discount for cooperating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;GSI did not set out to hide anything, but its defective
systems and controls meant that the level and quality of its
communications with the FSA fell far below what we expect,&#8221; FSA
enforcement chief Margaret Cole said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC sued Goldman Sachs and employee Fabrice Tourre in
April over claims the firm misled investors in a collateralized
debt obligation linked to subprime mortgages, known as the
Abacus transaction. The FSA said in April it would investigate
Goldman Sachs International in London after the SEC filed its
lawsuit. Gordon Brown, the prime minister at the time who was
facing a May election, called on the FSA to investigate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs created and sold the CDOs in 2007, as the
U.S. housing market faltered, without disclosing that hedge fund
Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying securities and bet
against the investment vehicles, the SEC said in the April 16
lawsuit. CDOs are pools of assets such as mortgage bonds
packaged into new securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still an Employee &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re pleased the matter is resolved,&#8221; Goldman Sachs
spokeswoman Fiona Laffan said following the FSA announcement.
Tourre &#8220;remains an employee on paid leave,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning in August 2008, the SEC spent a year obtaining
documents and witness evidence about Abacus, including
interviewing London-based employees, the FSA said. In September
2009, the SEC told Goldman Sachs and Tourre, who began working
at the bank&#8217;s London office in November 2008, that it was
planning an enforcement action. The bank&#8217;s compliance department
in London only learned of the SEC investigation when it filed
the lawsuit this year, the FSA said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fine is the second-largest levied by the FSA. JPMorgan
Chase  Co. received the largest FSA penalty in June when its
London unit was fined 33.3 million pounds for not properly
segregating client money from the firm&#8217;s accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs U.S. settlement included a $300 million
fine and $250 million in restitution for investors. The penalty
is the largest ever levied by the SEC against a Wall Street
firm, the agency said. Goldman Sachs, without admitting or
denying wrongdoing, acknowledged it made a &#8220;mistake&#8221; and that
marketing materials for the CDOs had &#8220;incomplete information,&#8221;
the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre, 31, remains a defendant in the U.S. case. His FSA
authorization was suspended in April at the bank&#8217;s request. The
SEC allegations related to when he worked in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philippine benchmark stock index
surged to a record and the peso touched a two-year high after an
unexpected pickup in exports, brightening the economic outlook
and spurring inflows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Philippine Stock Exchange Index jumped 2.6 percent to
3,902.56 at the noon close in Manila, the most since May 28. The
gauge rose for the eighth day, the longest streak since March
2009. The peso gained 0.4 percent to 44.09 per dollar, the
strongest level since August 2008, according to prices from
inter-dealer broker Tullett Prebon Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exports soared 35.9 percent in July as the global recovery
sustained demand for electronics goods. President Benigno Aquino
aims to expand the economy by 7 percent to 8 percent annually
from 2011 to cut poverty and boost incomes. The peso has climbed
5.2 percent this quarter, leading Asian emerging-market
currencies, and the stock index has surged 28 percent this year,
the most among the 15 biggest Asia Pacific markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a strong belief that we are entering a
significant bull market backed by fundamentals,&#8221; said Michael Garcia, who manages 22 billion pesos ($499 million) at Union
Bank of the Philippines including the top-performing stocks fund.
&#8220;Breaking the record barrier sets the stage for a new run.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;July exports beat the median 29.3 percent gain forecast in
a Bloomberg survey of economists. Shipments totaled $49 billion
last year and are the nation&#8217;s largest source of foreign
exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SM Prime Holdings Inc., the nation&#8217;s biggest shopping mall
operator, jumped 9.7 percent to 12.26 pesos, the highest since
Oct. 15, 2007. Ayala Land Inc., the largest builder, gained 8
percent to 18.7 pesos, the highest since June 20, 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fund Flows &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philippine benchmark four-year bonds fell, lifting the
yield from a record-low. The yield on the 6.25 percent note due
in January 2014 jumped 9.5 basis points to 4.995 percent, its
biggest increase since July, according to ICAP Plc. The yield
this week fell to the lowest level since the debt started
trading in January 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a bullish run for Asian assets on the view Asia
will be performing better than Europe and America,&#8221; Rafael Algarra, treasurer at Security Banking Corp. in Manila. &#8220;Funds
are flowing into the region.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising exports helped drive Philippine economic growth of
7.9 percent in the last quarter, the fastest pace in three years.
Asia&#8217;s developing economies will expand 9.2 percent this year,
outpacing growth of 1 percent in the 16-nation euro region and
3.3 percent in the U.S., according to International Monetary
Fund estimates published July 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Consensus Underweight&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after this year&#8217;s gains, &#8220;the Philippines equity
market is a consensus underweight,&#8221; JPMorgan analysts led by
Gilbert Lopez said in a report. &#8220;The market, especially foreign
equity investors, has not appreciated the country&#8217;s reduced risk
profile.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan set its end-2011 index target at 4,550. Second-
quarter corporate earnings also suggest the brokerage&#8217;s forecast
for profits to grow 18 percent on average in 2010 and 2011 may
be &#8220;re-rated upwards,&#8221; according to the analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic expansion and earnings growth of 23 percent this
year will push Philippine stocks into a &#8220;massive bull market,&#8221;
Alex Pomento, a strategist at Macquarie Group Ltd., said on Sept.
6 in Manila. The benchmark index will extend gains to 4,500 in
2011, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The consensus is the Philippine economy will continue to
grow and corporate earnings will continue to surprise on the
upside,&#8221; Union Bank&#8217;s Garcia said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Citigroup Inc. stockbroker
Ralph Casbarro was fined $500 and received no prison sentence or
probation for his involvement in a scheme to let day traders
eavesdrop on internal conversations over brokers&#8217; &#8220;squawk
boxes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casbarro, 48, was fined yesterday by U.S. District Judge I.
Leo Glasser in Brooklyn, New York. Casbarro pleaded guilty in
2005 to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud. He
was fired by Citigroup before being indicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I know what I did was wrong without a shadow of a doubt
and I&#8217;m sorry for it,&#8221; Casbarro told the judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Mahaffy Jr., a former broker at Merrill Lynch  Co.
and Citigroup, and five co-defendants were found guilty in the
case in April 2009. Mahaffy was sentenced to two years in prison
in December. In July, the men lost a bid to have their
convictions tossed, after claiming that prosecutors hid evidence
of their innocence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glasser criticized the government for putting off
Casbarro&#8217;s sentencing for so long. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This has been five years since Mr. Casbarro pleaded
guilty,&#8221; the judge said. &#8220;Is that really part of the sentence
that has already been imposed?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Green said Casbarro agreed
to the delays as part of his cooperation accord with
prosecutors. Casbarro gave important assistance to the
government, prosecutors said, though they didn&#8217;t call him to
testify against his co-defendants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Mahaffy, 05-cr-00613, U.S. District

department had argued the world&#8217;s biggest mobile-phone company
failed to withhold taxes on its acquisition of Hutchison&#8217;s stake
in Hutchison Essar Ltd., or HEL. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling is a setback for Vodafone in a case seen by
investors as a test of India&#8217;s tolerance toward the use of tax
havens for acquisitions, according to Akil Hirani, a managing
partner at Mumbai-based law firm Majmudar  Co. Britain&#8217;s Prime
Minister at the time Gordon Brown wrote in December to his
Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh that taxing cross-border deals
such as Vodafone&#8217;s could create uncertainty for foreign
investors and affect the country&#8217;s investment climate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court directed tax authorities to not issue a final
order on its claim for a period of eight weeks and allowed
Vodafone 12 weeks to appeal the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vodafone is reviewing the judgment and is likely to appeal
the ruling, spokesman Ben Padovan said by telephone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;German Gambling Monopoly Is Unjustified, EU&#8217;s Top Court Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany&#8217;s state monopoly on sports-betting and lotteries
risks being struck down after the European Union&#8217;s highest court
said the country&#8217;s current rules are incompatible with EU law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany can&#8217;t block betting companies such as Bwin
Interactive Entertainment AG from providing betting services
while allowing public monopolies to &#8220;carry out intensive
advertising campaigns&#8221; to maximize lottery profits, the
European Court of Justice in Luxembourg said yesterday. Shares
in Bwin rose the most in more than a month after yesterday&#8217;s
rulings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are delighted with today&#8217;s rulings,&#8221; Katharina Riedl,
a spokeswoman for Vienna-based Bwin, said in a telephone
interview, calling the decisions &#8220;trend setting.&#8221; &#8220;This is a
historic opportunity to change German gambling regulation,&#8221;
following the examples of the U.K., France and Italy, she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former GE Unit Executive Sues Company for $10 Million &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Electric Capital Services was sued by a former
executive who claims he was forced out for questioning the
company&#8217;s treatment of an asset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edward Gormbley, who worked for GE Capital from 2000 until
he quit in September 2009, filed his suit today in state court
in Stamford, Connecticut. The complaint also names parent
General Electric Co. and its chief executive officer, Jeffrey
Immelt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gormbley said he was punished for challenging the valuation
of silicon-maker Momentive Performance Materials, an investment
asset. GE Capital overstated Momentive&#8217;s value in December 2008
to improve its own balance sheet, he said. Valuing the asset
correctly would have reduced &#8220;GE Capital&#8217;s earnings 100
percent,&#8221; in the fourth quarter that year, according to the
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Gormbley refused to play GE&#8217;s game and just &#8216;get
along,&#8221; according to the filing. &#8220;GE and GE Capital&#8217;s response
was direct, unmistakable and as subtle as a hangman&#8217;s noose.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gormbley said he was shorn of responsibilities, was
downgraded in employee evaluations and had his annual bonus
slashed, effectively forcing him out of the company. He resigned
in September 2009 and is seeking $10 million in damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The allegations in Mr. Gormbley&#8217;s complaint are
meritless,&#8221; Russell Wilkerson, a spokesman for Fairfield,
Connecticut-based GE, said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;The
company will vigorously defend itself against these baseless
assertions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Gormbley v. General Electric Co., FST-CV10-
6006588-S, Connecticut Superior Court (Stamford). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roger Clemens Argues McNamee&#8217;s Suit Should Be Tossed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for Roger Clemens urged a judge to throw out a
lawsuit in which the former Major League Baseball pitcher is
accused of defamation by his onetime trainer, Brian McNamee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McNamee&#8217;s complaint fails to state claims he can sue over,
and Clemens didn&#8217;t defame him, Rusty Hardin argued at a hearing
yesterday before U.S. District Judge Sterling Johnson Jr. in
Brooklyn, New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. McNamee is suing Mr. Clemens because Mr. Clemens has
consistently denied that Mr. McNamee committed a crime&#8221; by
injecting him with illegal drugs, the lawyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clemens, 48, defamed McNamee by alleging that McNamee lied
when he told investigators the former New York Yankees pitcher
used steroids, the trainer said in the suit, filed last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ballplayer was indicted last month by a federal grand
jury in Washington on charges that he lied to the U.S. Congress
in denying he used steroids and human growth hormone to boost
his performance. He pleaded not guilty on Aug. 30 and a trial
was set for April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clemens wasn&#8217;t in the courtroom for yesterday&#8217;s hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson said he&#8217;d rule on the dismissal request at a later
date. Hardin, of Houston, told the judge that if his motion is
denied, he&#8217;ll ask to freeze the suit until the criminal case is
resolved. Richard D. Emery, a lawyer for McNamee, said he
probably wouldn&#8217;t oppose that request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defamation case is McNamee v. Clemens, 09-1647, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). The
criminal case is U.S. v. Clemens, 10-cr-00223, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Unit Denied Permission to Exit Bankruptcy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s Quigley unit, a former asbestos maker, was
denied permission to exit bankruptcy by a judge who found the
world&#8217;s largest drug company manipulated the bankruptcy process
to benefit itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart M. Bernstein in New York
yesterday rejected Quigley&#8217;s fourth reorganization plan and said
parties should discuss dismissal of the case. He said the plan
was filed in &#8220;bad faith&#8221; by Pfizer and cited testimony that
asbestos claims directed at Quigley could total $4.45 billion
over the next 42 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In a nutshell, Pfizer bought enough votes to assure that
any plan would be accepted,&#8221; Bernstein wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 90-page ruling that covers Pfizer&#8217;s failed attempts to
deal with its growing asbestos liabilities since June 1985,
Bernstein noted that a lawyer who represented both Quigley and
Pfizer settled claims against Quigley and got releases for
Pfizer at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Settling claimants were then given a financial incentive to
vote in favor of Quigley&#8217;s bankruptcy plan through a series of
legal moves before and after the bankruptcy filing, the judge
wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are disappointed in the court&#8217;s ruling as we continue
to believe that Pfizer has no liability for Quigley&#8217;s conduct,&#8221;
a Pfizer spokesman, Chris Loder, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Quigley Co., 04-15739, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boeing Unit Wins Dismissal of Torture Flights Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawsuit alleging a Boeing Co. unit disguised the delivery
of suspected terrorists to secret prisons where they were
tortured was dismissed by a U.S. appeals court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An 11-judge panel of a San Francisco-based appeals court
overruled a finding by a three-judge panel that a lower-court
judge was wrong to dismiss the case based on government claims
that the litigation might reveal state secrets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Douglas Letter, a Justice Department lawyer, argued in
December to the 11-judge panel that classified information
confirming or denying the Boeing unit&#8217;s relationship with the
Central Intelligence Agency may be revealed if the case
proceeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Wizner, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union,
which filed the case, claimed the government inappropriately
relied on a classified statement by General Michael Hayden, the
former Central Intelligence Agency director, to get the case
dismissed prematurely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Mohamed v. Jeppesen, 08-15693, U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Hugo Miller, Elena Logutenkova and Adam Satariano" date="Sep 10, 2010  5:36 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-10/jpmorgan-said-to-test-iphone-for-e-mail-as-more-bankers-bypass-blackberry.html"><headline>JPMorgan Said to Test IPhone, BlackBerry Alternatives</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. may soon let
employees use iPhones for corporate e-mail, making it an
alternative to Research in Motion Ltd.&#8217;s BlackBerry at the bank
for the first time, two people familiar with the situation said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is testing the Apple Inc. device and smartphones
based on Google Inc.&#8217;s Android software, said the people, who
didn&#8217;t want to be named because the plans haven&#8217;t been made
public. The bank is the second-largest in the U.S. by assets and
has about 220,000 employees worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS AG, Switzerland&#8217;s biggest bank, said it is also
considering allowing its staff to use iPhones for company
messaging as more of them opt for the Apple product. UBS has
more than 63,000 employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple and Google are making inroads in RIM&#8217;s traditional
stronghold with corporate customers, after their devices first
caught on with consumers. Standard Chartered Bank Plc said in
May it&#8217;s switching from the BlackBerry to the iPhone for
employees and expects to have 15,000 distributed by year-end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This phenomenon is very new and we expect it to put
increased pressure on RIM&#8217;s performance,&#8221; said Pierre Ferragu,
an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd. &#8220;BlackBerry isn&#8217;t the
only alternative to offer employees mobile e-mail.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIM fell 90 cents, or 2 percent, to $44.12 at 4 p.m. New
York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading as the Nasdaq Composite
Index edged up 0.3 percent. The stock has lost 35 percent of its
value this year, while Apple has climbed by a quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security Tests &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tests aren&#8217;t limited to banks. Vanguard Group Inc., the
largest U.S. provider of stock and bond mutual funds, also is
trying out the iPhone with 300 workers and will let employees
companywide use the device soon, said Joshua Grandy, a
spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is testing for security in batches of a few
hundred devices with a decision expected later this year, one of
the people familiar with the matter said. JPMorgan wouldn&#8217;t buy
iPhones or Android phones for employees, as it now does with
BlackBerrys. Rather, the bank would allow employees to use the
devices to send and receive corporate e-mail if they make the
purchase themselves, the other person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, and
Natalie Harrison, an Apple spokeswoman, declined to comment.
Marisa Conway, a spokeswoman for RIM, also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linking to E-Mail &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS doesn&#8217;t plan to replace the BlackBerrys it issues with
iPhones anytime soon, spokesman Jean-Raphael Fontannaz said by
telephone from Zurich. Rather, UBS is testing the possibility of
allowing employees to use an iPhone or another smartphone to
connect to UBS&#8217;s e-mail system without restricting the private
use of the device, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are certainly quite a few employees that have
private iPhones, and as a bank we have to ask ourselves if that
could be an option for us,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIM&#8217;s share of the global smartphone market slid to 18.2
percent in the second quarter from 19 percent a year earlier as
customers opted for rivals&#8217; phones with larger screens and more
applications, according to research firm IDC. Apple&#8217;s share rose
to 14.2 percent from 13 percent, while Android surged to 17.2
percent from 1.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple said in July that more than 80 percent of the Fortune
100 companies are deploying or testing the iPhone. The
Cupertino, California-based company has taken steps to improve
the iPhone&#8217;s security, such as strengthening encryption tools,
adding the ability to set longer passcodes and integrating with
servers that could wipe out or lock an iPhone if it&#8217;s lost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing Movement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More companies are set to follow suit, according to an
August survey done by Sanford Bernstein. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 200 companies polled in the U.S. and U.K., 74 percent
now let their employees use devices other than BlackBerrys, the
research showed. For the U.S. alone, the figure was 83 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cost savings and employee preference were the two biggest
factors cited by companies for the shift in the Sanford
Bernstein survey. Employees would rather own an iPhone and are
increasingly willing to buy the device themselves, which helps
cuts costs as companies look to rein in spending, said Sanford
Bernstein&#8217;s Ferragu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other research suggests BlackBerry loyalty may be fading
among the bankers, lawyers and government workers who drove
RIM&#8217;s initial success. About 42 percent of BlackBerry users say
they want to stick with the brand when they buy a new phone,
according to an August survey by Nielsen Co. The rate is 89
percent for iPhone owners and 71 percent for Android devices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp.&#8217;s trial victory in a
lawsuit brought by Nigerian protesters blaming the company for
violence at an offshore oil platform was upheld on appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A three-judge panel of the U.S. court of appeals in San
Francisco ruled today that the trial judge made no errors in
admitting challenged evidence or in the jury instructions. The
appellate panel also agreed with the judge that the 1992 U.S.
Torture Victim Protection Act is intended to sue individuals
rather than corporations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For years, the events that transpired on the Parabe
platform have been misrepresented to courts and the public,&#8221;
Chevron spokesman Kent Robertson said in an e-mailed statement.
&#8220;While we are sympathetic to the challenges that people of the
Niger Delta face, hostage taking is never the answer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case stems from a 1998 incident in which protesters,
who boarded a Chevron oil drilling platform, were attacked by
Nigerian soldiers. Two men were killed, others were shot and
beaten and one man was hung by his wrists and tortured after a
protest about jobs and alleged environmental damage to the area,
according to the 1999 lawsuit against Chevron. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nineteen Nigerians sued the company, claiming it was liable
for the actions of the Nigerian soldiers it hired to provide
security for the oil platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After almost 10 years of trial court proceedings, the case
went before a jury in October 2008. The jury cleared Chevron,
the second-largest U.S. oil company, of wrongful death, torture,
assault, battery and negligence claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theresa Traber, a lawyer representing the Nigerians and
their families, didn&#8217;t immediately return a call for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Larry Bowoto v. Chevron, 09-15641, 9th U.S.
Court of Appeals (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Iusacell SA, the mobile-phone
carrier owned by billionaire Ricardo Salinas, is offering fiber-
optic Internet and phone plans to compete with Grupo Televisa SA
and Carlos Slim&#8217;s Telefonos de Mexico SAB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The service is available in the capital, Guadalajara and
Monterrey, the country&#8217;s three largest cities, according to
promotional materials on Mexico City-based Iusacell&#8217;s website.
Customers can get download speeds of up to 20 megabits a second
for 1,799 pesos ($138) a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salinas is getting into the land-line business to outflank
Televisa, which operates three Mexican cable companies that
offer phone and Internet services, and which is starting a
mobile-phone alliance with NII Holdings Inc. Iusacell&#8217;s fiber-
optic technology may also be used to offer TV plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iusacell&#8217;s fastest fiber-optic download speed is more than
three times the highest rate offered by Televisa&#8217;s Empresas
Cablevision SAB in Mexico City and more than four times that of
Slim&#8217;s Telmex, according to those companies&#8217; websites. Slim also
controls America Movil SAB, Mexico&#8217;s largest mobile-phone
company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iusacell is in third place among Mexican wireless carriers,
also trailing Telefonica SA. Dan McCosh, a spokesman for
Salinas&#8217;s group of companies, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa rose 14 centavos to 48.30 pesos at 12:33 p.m. in
Mexico City trading. Mexico City-based Telmex, the biggest phone
and Internet carrier in Mexico, gained 12 centavos to 9.45
pesos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nokia Oyj hired Stephen Elop, the
head of Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s business unit, as chief executive
officer, seeking to reclaim ground lost to Apple Inc. that has
wiped $61 billion off its market value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elop, a 46-year-old Canadian, will take over as president
and CEO of the world&#8217;s largest mobile-phone maker starting Sept.
21, the Espoo, Finland-based company said. He will replace 30-
year Nokia veteran Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, becoming the first non-
Finn to head the company. Kallasvuo will remain on the board of
Nokia Siemens Networks. Nokia rose as much as 6.9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We view the appointment of a leading software executive
to the CEO role as a positive,&#8221; said Jesper Kruger, an investor
at ATP, Denmark&#8217;s biggest pension fund, with 50 billion euros
($64 billion) in assets including Nokia shares. &#8220;Earlier
management grossly underestimated the challenges related to
moving from a hardware-driven business model to software.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elop, who ran Microsoft&#8217;s biggest business, said today that
the two companies may do more work together. Microsoft and Nokia
have both struggled with software for smartphones, sidelined by
the rise of Apple&#8217;s iPhone and handsets based on Google Inc.&#8217;s
Android operating system. Three years after Apple introduced the
iPhone, Nokia is grappling with developing a smartphone with the
same mass appeal. It has been forced to cut prices, sacrificing
profits to defend its market share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My job is to take the organization through a period of
disruption and ensure that we are meeting the needs of customers
while delivering superior financial results,&#8221; Elop said at a
press briefing in Espoo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEO Search &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement posted on Microsoft&#8217;s website and circulated
to employees, CEO Steve Ballmer called Elop a &#8220;good steward of
the brand and business in his time here.&#8221; Ballmer named no
replacement for Elop and said the division&#8217;s team of executives
will report directly to him in the interim. Frank Shaw, a
Microsoft spokesman declined to comment on a replacement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia rose 5 cents, or 0.7 percent, to close at 7.79 euros
in Helsinki. The stock has declined 13 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CEO search started in late May and the board considered
several internal and external candidates before zeroing in on
Elop, Chairman Jorma Ollila said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s particularly Steve&#8217;s strong software background and
proven track record in change management that will be the most
valuable asset,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A computer engineer by training, Elop joined Microsoft in
January 2008. Elop, who has a management degree from McMaster
University in Hamilton, Canada, came to Microsoft from Juniper
Networks Inc., where he was chief operating officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safe Choice &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also brings to Nokia experience as CEO of graphics
software maker Macromedia Inc., before that company was bought
by Adobe Systems Inc. He previously worked as chief information
officer at restaurant chain Boston Chicken Inc. His resume
doesn&#8217;t show any jobs in the mobile-phone business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nokia&#8217;s board has made a safe choice when they should
have made a courageous choice,&#8221; said Nick Jones, a London-based
analyst at Gartner Inc. &#8220;In the current state of the market
when the two main competitors, Google and Apple, are very much
headed by recognizable visionaries, you need someone who is
charismatic and can explain how you&#8217;re driving the industry
forward in new directions. Elop&#8217;s an execution guy and the thing
to watch now is who will he appoint to complement his skills.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement of Elop&#8217;s appointment comes just days
before the Finnish company&#8217;s annual Nokia World event next week
in London to show it can claw back ground lost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia is likely to show off its high-end Symbian smartphone
line, including the touchscreen N8, its latest effort to take on
the competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Clear Challenges&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The clear challenges the company faces are well
understood within the four walls of Nokia worldwide,&#8221; Elop
said. &#8220;The answers to those challenges are also well
understood. My role is to surface those, to make sure we&#8217;re
dealing with them efficiently.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before today, Nokia&#8217;s stock had fallen more than 60 percent
since Apple&#8217;s June 2007 introduction of the iPhone, cutting its
market value by 48 billion euros, or $61 billion. Its current
market value of 30 billion euros compares with Cupertino,
California-based Apple&#8217;s $240 billion, and is a shadow of its
1999 peak of 203 billion euros, the highest in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia was slow to catch the wave created by the emergence
of the iPhone, which with its multitude of applications for
everything from music, restaurants and games, to the weather and
news, took the mobile phone from a calling handset to an all-
purpose consumer device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kallasvuo&#8217;s Watch &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia&#8217;s downward spiral came on Kallasvuo&#8217;s watch. The 57-
year-old executive took the helm in 2006 from Ollila. Kallasvuo
insisted on remaining in all segments from 25-euro basic phones
to gem-studded luxury models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia&#8217;s multiple devices with different configurations made
designing more difficult, time consuming and expensive,
developers said. They said the devices were also clunky and
didn&#8217;t have the iPhone&#8217;s sleek touch and feel that made their
applications and software look good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As CEO, Kallasvuo drove the development of services such as
music downloads and GPS navigation to increase the value of
Nokia handsets and retain customers. The efforts did little to
stop Apple and Android devices from taking market share from
Nokia in smartphones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia share of the smartphones market has been on the
decline. In the second quarter, it fell to 37.4 percent from 45
percent, according to researcher Gartner Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The competition has eaten into its profit margins. In July
Nokia said that the operating margin in devices could fall as
low as 7 percent in the third quarter. The margin was 12.5
percent last year and 18.2 percent in 2008. The company posted a
40 percent drop in second-quarter profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cultural Question &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elop now needs to show he can turn the company around to
meet its goal of rebuilding device margins to 10 to 11 percent
for the year, as the company has pledged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His more immediate challenge may be to shake up the
business culture at Nokia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nokia&#8217;s business culture tends to be very consensus
oriented versus the star system more prevalent within North
American tech companies,&#8221; Rod Hall, a JPMorgan analyst, wrote
in a note. &#8220;We have some reservations about the choice of a
North American.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors want to see if Elop can change Nokia, said Ben Wood, a London-based analyst at CCS Insight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The question is whether Elop is going to deviate from
Nokia&#8217;s current strategy,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. named Jim O&#8217;Neill, its chief economist and creator of the BRICs acronym to
describe large emerging markets, to a new role as chairman of
asset management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Neill, 53, will remain in London and report to Ed Forst
and Tim O&#8217;Neill, global co-heads of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s investment-
management division, which includes the fund business known as
GSAM, the New York-based firm said today in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The promotion gives a public face to the largest part of
the company&#8217;s investment-management division nine years after
O&#8217;Neill first outlined the view that Brazil, Russia, India and
China would wield growing power in the global economy. Those
markets have been responsible for about half of global growth
since the financial crisis began in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For the firm&#8217;s future and success, GSAM&#8217;s growth and
development is pretty important,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;The goal is that I will link thematic ideas, help
grow certain funds and bring along new ones.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move comes as Goldman Sachs reviews its business
practices and structure after paying $550 million to settle a
U.S. regulator&#8217;s fraud charges related to the firm&#8217;s 2007 sale
of a mortgage-linked security. The company is also adapting its
business in the wake of U.S. legislation that limits Wall
Street&#8217;s ability to trade for itself on proprietary desks or by
investing in hedge funds or private-equity funds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Net capital inflows into emerging
market economies are running at record levels, pushing up asset
prices and raising the risk governments may impose capital
controls, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a research report
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital inflows into emerging markets are running at $575
billion a year, more than ever before and 20 percent higher than
before the world financial crisis, according to an e-mailed
report by Robin Brooks, a senior foreign exchange strategist for
Goldman in New York. Low interest rates in the developed world
are leading investors to seek higher returns in faster-growing
emerging economies, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our baseline case remains of moderate growth in the
advanced economies,&#8221; Brooks said. &#8220;This is contributing to
direct &#8216;a wall of money&#8217; to emerging markets in search of higher
yields.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital inflows help emerging economies by providing cheap
financing, lowering bond yields and boosting domestic demand,
Goldman said. They also push currencies to appreciate and create
inflationary pressures which could lead some countries to impose
controls on funds entering from abroad, Brooks said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some emerging markets have already resorted to capital
controls, and the risk of further such measures remains,&#8221; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging-market sovereign bonds have returned 11.8 percent
this year, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s EMBI+ index.
Stocks included in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index have risen
2.3 percent so far in 2010, compared to a 2.8 percent decline in
the MSCI World Index of 24 developed countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital Controls &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, South Korea tightened limits on maximum holdings
of currency derivatives by banks in an attempt to reduce the
volatility of capital inflows. The same month, Indonesia&#8217;s
central bank said it would insist investors in its one-month
bills hold the securities for at least four weeks. Brazil
imposed a 2 percent tax on foreign investors&#8217; purchases of
shares and bonds in October last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Africa&#8217;s ruling African National Congress proposed in
a discussion document July 30 that an inflow tax be considered
to help curb the rand&#8217;s appreciation. The currency has
strengthened more than 30 percent against the dollar since the
beginning of 2009. National Treasury Director-General Lesetja Kganyago said in September the country relies on the foreign
money to finance its current-account deficit, and shouldn&#8217;t
impose a tax on the inflows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman recommends investing in the currencies of Asian
countries benefitting from growth in China, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Neill, 53, will remain in London and report to Ed Forst
and Tim O&#8217;Neill, global co-heads of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s investment

mailed statement. The appointment to Goldman Sachs Asset
Management, or GSAM, is subject to U.K. regulatory approval, the
firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. O&#8217;Neill will help lead all aspects of the GSAM
business and serve as an important voice for GSAM in expressing
his views on global investment themes,&#8221; the statement said.
&#8220;He will also continue to write about his views in this newly
created role designed to leverage Mr. O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s global
perspective on world markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Neill, who joined Goldman Sachs as a partner in 1995,
created the acronym BRICs in writing about the rising economic
power of Brazil, Russia, India and China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management is the fund unit within the
company&#8217;s investment management division run by Forst and Tim
O&#8217;Neill. In the second quarter, assets under management fell 4.5
percent to $802 billion as clients pulled money out of money
market and equity funds and because of stock market declines. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A former Bank of America Corp.
executive pleaded guilty to participating in a criminal
conspiracy to rig the bids on investments sold to municipal bond
issuers and profit at the expense of taxpayers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Douglas Lee Campbell, who is identified as working for
&#8220;Bank A,&#8221; entered guilty pleas to fraud and conspiracy, the
U.S. Justice Department said yesterday. Campbell was employed by
Bank of America until 2002, when he joined Piper Jaffray Cos.,
according to National Association of Securities Dealers records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plea marks the second time an employee of an investment
bank has admitted to participating in an industrywide conspiracy
to pay state and local governments below-market rates on the
investments purchased with bond proceeds. The scheme stretched
from California to Pennsylvania and included more than 200 deals
involving about 160 state agencies, local governments and non-
profits, Bloomberg News has reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entered in U.S. District Court in New York, Campbell&#8217;s plea
is the seventh in the continuing probe and the second in as many
days. On Sept. 8, Adrian Scott-Jones of Morriston, Florida, who
worked for an unidentified company that handled investment-
contract auctions for local issuers, pleaded guilty to
conspiracy and wire fraud, the Justice Department said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Halldin, a spokesman for Charlotte, North Carolina-
based Bank of America, declined to comment on Campbell&#8217;s case.
He said that the company is helping investigators in the probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer A. Olson-Goude, a spokeswoman with Piper Jaffray
in Minneapolis, didn&#8217;t immediately return a message seeking
comment. Campbell, who now lives in New York, left the firm by
March 2007. He couldn&#8217;t be reached immediately to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott-Jones agreed to cooperate in the investigation, which
is continuing, the agency said. Attempts to reach him on Sept. 8
were unsuccessful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adria Perez, of Kilpatrick Stockton LLP in Atlanta,
identified by a Justice Department spokeswoman as a lawyer for
Scott-Jones, didn&#8217;t respond to a call for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halliburton, KBR Ordered to Face Military Lawsuits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halliburton Co. and KBR Inc. must face lawsuits brought by
military personnel and contractors allegedly harmed by
contaminated water and toxic emissions from burning waste in
Iraq and Afghanistan, a judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Roger Titus in Greenbelt, Maryland, who
is overseeing 43 lawsuits on the matter, yesterday rejected the
companies&#8217; claims of immunity for combat-related activities,
saying he was concerned it would limit legal remedies for people
who allege they were injured. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Courts must be prepared to adjudicate cases that
ultimately expose defense contractors to appropriate
liability,&#8221; Titus wrote. The judge said he favored a
&#8220;limited&#8221; pre-trial exchange of information in the case, to
avoid burdening the military and its personnel in wartime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plaintiffs claim the Houston-based companies ignored the
terms of contracts with the U.S. that required safe and
environmentally sound waste disposal for troops. Improper
disposal of waste in &#8220;burn pits&#8221; led to injuries including
cancer and respiratory illness, law firms Motley Rice LLC and
Burke PLLC said yesterday in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;KBR is confident that the evidence will confirm that it
performed waste disposal and water services pursuant to military
direction and guidelines,&#8221; KBR said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teresa Wong, a spokeswoman for Halliburton, didn&#8217;t have an
immediate comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re KBR Inc., Burn Pit Litigation, 09MD2083,
U.S. District Court for Maryland (Greenbelt). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street Banks Benefit From Tougher Suit Standards in U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two U.S. Supreme Court decisions making it tougher to
pursue lawsuits may have begun to bear fruit for corporations
fighting investor claims or employee litigation, Bloomberg
News&#8217;s Thom Weidlich reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where once it was enough to give a defendant &#8220;fair
notice&#8221; of a claim and the grounds on which it rested, the high
court&#8217;s 2007 holding in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly required
an antitrust complaint to contain enough facts to show a claim
that is &#8220;plausible on its face.&#8221; Two years later, in Ashcroft
v. Iqbal, the court applied Twombly to all federal civil suits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court rulings mean that someone who wants to
sue in federal court &#8220;should not subject a defendant to the
costs and burdens of litigation when there is no plausible basis
for their claims,&#8221; Lisa Rickard, president of the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce&#8217;s Institute for Legal Reform, said in an e-mail. The
Washington-based business advocacy group filed a friend-of-the-
court brief in Twombly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule aided financial-services companies after the
February 2008 collapse of the $330 billion auction-rate
securities market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judges cited Twombly alongside the 1995 Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act, which also added hurdles to investor
cases, in dismissing suits against Citigroup Inc. and Bank of
America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit over the sale of the
securities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dollar Thrifty Holders Lose Bid to Stop Hertz Vote &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group Inc. investors lost a bid
to stop a shareholder vote on the car-rental company&#8217;s planned
sale to Hertz Global Holdings Inc. for more than $1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delaware Chancery Court Judge Leo Strine Jr. rejected
Dollar Thrifty investors&#8217; request for an injunction against the
Sept. 16 vote so company officials could reconsider a competing
offer from Avis Budget Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs&#8217; argument &#8220;does not support their claim
that the Dollar Thrifty Board likely breached its fiduciary duty
to take reasonable steps to maximize the value&#8221; stockholders
would receive, Strine said in an 83-page opinion made public
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hertz said April 26 it would buy Tulsa, Oklahoma-based
Dollar Thrifty. Park Ridge, New Jersey-based Hertz is the
second-largest U.S. rental-car company behind closely held
Enterprise Holdings Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Reno, a Dollar Thrifty spokesman, didn&#8217;t immediately
return a phone call and e-mail messages seeking comment. Michael
J. Barry, a plaintiffs&#8217; lawyer in the case, didn&#8217;t immediately
return a call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials of Parsippany, New Jersey-based Avis, the third-
largest U.S. rental-car company, said in July they would pay
$46.50 a share in cash and stock for Dollar Thrifty. Avis
increased its bid on Sept. 2 to $40.75 in cash and 0.6543 of an
Avis share for each Dollar Thrifty share, valuing the offer at
$47.13 a share, based on Sept. 1 closing prices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monsanto Engineered Beets Face New Court Challenge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monsanto Co.&#8217;s genetically engineered sugar beets face a
new court challenge by a food safety group that sued to block
the U.S. Agriculture Department from issuing permits to produce
seeds for the plants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Agriculture Department hasn&#8217;t adequately studied the
environmental effects of &#8220;seed production pursuant to these
numerous permits along with the intended and inevitable
flowering of the seed crop, harvesting, storage of seed, and
planting and harvest of sugar beets,&#8221; the Center for Food
Safety said in a complaint filed yesterday in federal court in
San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group, together with organic seed organizations and the
Sierra Club, claims wind-blown pollen from the genetically
engineered crops will contaminate conventional sugar beets and
other closely related plants. St. Louis-based Monsanto, the
world&#8217;s biggest seed company, engineered sugar beets to be
resistant to the Roundup herbicide, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Agriculture Department said Sept. 1 that it plans to
have interim rules governing genetically modified sugar beets in
place by the end of the year. U.S. District Judge Jeffrey S.
White in San Francisco revoked the government&#8217;s approval of the
plants last month, saying the department hadn&#8217;t properly
considered the potential environmental impacts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suzanne Bond, a spokeswoman for the Agriculture Department,
and Kelli Powers, a Monsanto spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t return calls
seeking comment after regular business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Center for Food Safety v. Vilsack, 10-04038,
U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San
Francisco.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Sued by Alaska Over Improper Ban on Offshore Oil Drilling &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Interior Secretary Kenneth Salazar was sued by the
state of Alaska over claims he improperly banned drilling off
the state&#8217;s coast after BP Plc&#8217;s Gulf of Mexico oil spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. hasn&#8217;t issued drilling permits in the Arctic since
the sinking of the Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf in April
and Salazar announced at a press conference this month that he
wouldn&#8217;t allow exploration plans to resume this year, according
to the complaint filed yesterday by Alaska and its Republican
governor, Sean Parnell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. in May imposed a moratorium on deep-water drilling
in the wake of the Gulf spill. Regulators including Salazar have
improperly stopped drilling as well in the shallower waters off
Alaska&#8217;s coast without issuing a formal ban, the state said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Defendants have not issued a final, appealable decision
on a moratorium for the Alaska region,&#8221; the state said in the
complaint filed in federal court in Anchorage. &#8220;Nor have
defendants issued any findings, analysis, or explanation to
support such a moratorium.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit claims that Salazar and the Interior Department
didn&#8217;t consult the state or give it a chance to participate in
the moratorium decision, as legally required. The state asked
the court to order the U.S. to end any moratorium on drilling in
the Alaska region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is no moratorium in Alaska and therefore nothing to
sue on,&#8221; Kendra Barkoff, an Interior Department spokeswoman,
said in an e-mail yesterday. &#8220;The moratorium is on deep-water
drilling and there is no deep-water drilling in Alaska.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is State of Alaska v. Salazar, 3:10-cv-00205, U.S.
District Court, District of Alaska (Anchorage). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burger King Sued Over $3.3 Billion 3G Buyout Plan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burger King Holdings Inc., the U.S. hamburger chain being
bought by investment firm 3G Capital for $3.3 billion, was sued
by a stockholder contending the deal undervalues the shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burger King, the second-largest U.S. purveyor of burgers
after McDonald&#8217;s Corp., said Sept. 2 it would be bought by 3G,
backed by Brazilian investors, for $24 a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price &#8220;is unfair and grossly inadequate because, among
other things, the intrinsic value of Burger King is materially
in excess of the amount offered,&#8221; stockholder Roberto Queiroz
said in a lawsuit made public yesterday in Delaware Chancery
Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the agreement, Miami-based Burger King, with $2.5
billion in sales for the year ended in June, will be able to
solicit higher bids through Oct. 12. The sale is the biggest
restaurant acquisition in at least a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials of Burger King didn&#8217;t immediately return an e-
mail message seeking comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Roberto Queiroz v. Burger King Holdings Inc.,

&lt;p&gt;Stem-Cell Research Ban Suspended by Appeals Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama&#8217;s administration can fund embryonic
stem-cell research while it appeals a decision banning
government support for any activity using cells taken from human
embryos, an appeals court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington yesterday put on
hold a ruling by District Judge Royce Lamberth during its review
of the ban. The Justice Department argued that the judge&#8217;s
decision would cause irreparable harm to researchers, taxpayers
and scientific progress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lifting the ban allows the government to temporarily
continue funneling tens of millions of dollars to scientists
seeking cures for diseases such as Parkinson&#8217;s, spinal cord
injuries, and genetic conditions. Embryonic stem cells can grow
into any kind of tissue and may have the potential to accelerate
a range of research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The purpose of this administrative stay is to give the
court sufficient opportunity to consider the merits of the
emergency motion for stay and should not be construed in any way
as a ruling on the merits of that motion,&#8221; the appeals court
wrote in its decision &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opponents of federal stem-cell funding have until Sept. 14
to file a response, and the U.S. can submit a response on Sept.
20, the appeals court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lamberth on Aug. 23 issued an order temporarily stopping
the Health and Human Services Department and the National
Institutes of Health from funding or conducting the studies. On
Sept. 7, Lamberth denied a U.S. request to reconsider his
ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge cited the still-in-force 1996 Dickey-Wicker
Amendment in his ruling, saying that Congress prohibited funding
any research in which a human embryo was destroyed. By
implication, that included all stem-cell research, Lamberth
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Sherley v. Sebelius, 10-5287, U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Craigslist Takeover Defenses Invalidated by Judge in EBay Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craigslist Inc.&#8217;s poison-pill plan was invalidated by a
Delaware judge who upheld most of EBay Inc.&#8217;s rights as a
minority investor in the online classified-advertising company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EBay, one of the world&#8217;s most-visited e-commerce sites,
claimed in its lawsuit that Craigslist created its anti-takeover
defenses to weaken its role as an investor. While ruling in
favor of EBay on those claims yesterday, Delaware Chancery Court
Judge William B. Chandler III left in place a provision allowing
for staggered director elections. Craigslist officials used that
provision to help strip EBay of its board seat, according to the
ruling. EBay bought a 28 percent stake in Craigslist in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poison pill was enacted &#8220;to punish EBay for competing
with Craigslist&#8221; and not &#8220;in response to a reasonably
perceived threat or for a proper corporate purpose,&#8221; Chandler
said in his decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chandler&#8217;s ruling will give EBay &#8220;access to information
that was not available to them,&#8221; said Sandeep Aggarwal, an
equity analyst at Caris  Co. who has a &#8216;buy&#8217; rating on EBay
shares. &#8220;They will not have a board seat, so I don&#8217;t know how
much they will be able to influence strategy of the company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Susan MacTavish Best, a spokeswoman for San Francisco-based
Craigslist, didn&#8217;t return a voice-mail yesterday seeking comment
on Chandler&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are very pleased that the court gave EBay what it
sought from the lawsuit,&#8221; Michael Jacobson, the online-auction
site&#8217;s general counsel, said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;EBay
brought this suit to protect its own shareholders and preserve
its valuable investment in Craigslist.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Austria&#8217;s Curbs on Casinos Are Unlawful, Court Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Austria&#8217;s state gambling monopoly breaches European Union
law by blocking foreign casino companies, the EU&#8217;s highest court
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The categorical exclusion of operators whose seat is in
another&#8221; EU nation &#8220;is disproportionate as it goes beyond what
is necessary to combat crime,&#8221; the European Court of Justice in
Luxembourg said yesterday. Austria has the choice of &#8220;various
less restrictive measures&#8221; to monitor casino operators, said
the court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is the latest in a series brought by betting
companies including Bwin Interactive Entertainment AG, Ladbrokes
Plc and Betfair Ltd., disputing whether it is legal for state
monopolies to block them from operating freely across the 27-
nation union. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In yesterday&#8217;s ruling, the court said the Austrian rules
lacked any transparency and were discriminatory because of the
absence of a competitive process allowing operators from other
EU countries to apply for a casino license in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is C-64/08 Ernst Engelmann. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomra Loses Court Appeal Over 24 Million-Euro Antitrust Fine &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomra Systems ASA, a Norwegian maker of machines that
collect cans and bottles for recycling, lost a court challenge
to a 24 million-euro ($30.5 million) antitrust fine for
hindering competition in the European Union. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeal &#8220;must be dismissed in its entirety,&#8221; a three-
judge panel from the EU&#8217;s General Court, the region&#8217;s second-
highest tribunal, ruled yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission, the 27-nation EU&#8217;s antitrust
agency, fined Tomra in 2006 saying its practice of offering
rebates and discounts to retailers restricted the market for
competitors. The decision closed an investigation that started
with raids in Norway, Germany and the Netherlands in September
2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the highest penalty levied as a percentage of
revenue in this type of abuse case, the EU regulator said at the
time. The fine was more than 7 percent of Tomra&#8217;s 2005 sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We regret that the court has had a different opinion than
we have in this case,&#8221; Espen Gundersen, Tomra&#8217;s chief financial
officer said in a telephone interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s an old case
related to contracts entered back mainly in 1998 to 2000. We
have to read the entire document before we can make any further
comments.&#8221; The company said it is considering whether to appeal
yesterday&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is T-155/06, Tomra Systems and Others v
Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Lampoon Ex-Chief Gets 45-Month Term, Remains Wealthy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Lampoon Inc. former Chief Executive Officer Daniel
Laikin remains wealthy after being sentenced to 45 months in
prison for conspiring to manipulate the stock price of the media
company, a U.S. prosecutor said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Laikin was a millionaire and he&#8217;s still a
millionaire,&#8221; Assistant U.S. Attorney Derek Cohen told U.S.
District Judge Joel Slomsky in Philadelphia Sept. 8. He noted
that Laikin&#8217;s Los Angeles mansion has been used to shoot the TV
show &#8220;The Bachelor.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slomsky said Laikin deserved to spend almost four years in
prison because he &#8220;undermined everyone&#8217;s confidence in our
commercial markets&#8221; through the scheme to pump up the stock
price of National Lampoon, which made the 1978 fraternity comedy
&#8220;Animal House.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors alleged Laikin, 48, of Carmel, Indiana, bribed
individuals to make it appear there was interest in the stock.
He sought to fraudulently increase National Lampoon&#8217;s share
price from $2 a share to $5 a share, according to court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laikin conspired with Dennis Barsky, a company consultant,
and two stock promoters to inflate the share price from March
2008 to June 2008, prosecutors alleged in an indictment. Laikin
stepped down after being charged as part of government sting
operation against executives of several companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for what I&#8217;ve done,&#8221; Laikin told Slomsky
before he was sentenced. &#8220;I know what I tried to do was wrong.
I crossed the line.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the plea, Laikin acknowledged he intended to
cause between $2.5 million and $7 million in losses through the
scheme, according to the government. Laikin was a successful
real-estate developer in Indianapolis before taking the helm at
National Lampoon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laikin&#8217;s case is U.S. v. Laikin, 08-cr-00733, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia). &lt;/p&gt;

assets, lured away Bank of America Corp. Deputy General Counsel
Gregory Baer to oversee global regulation and corporate legal
matters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Cutler, general counsel of New York-based JPMorgan,

finance-industry laws and manage corporate legal matters ranging
from mergers and acquisitions to securities filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baer joined Bank of America in 2006. He is a former partner
at the Washington-based law firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale

&lt;p&gt;China Huiyuan Juice Group Ltd.,
the drinks maker Coca-Cola Co. proposed to buy before being
blocked by Chinese regulators, was halted in Hong Kong
trading today after a report it breached loan covenants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Huiyan plunged as much as 11 percent before being
suspended. The company is seeking to amend the covenants for
a $250 million three-year loan after breaching the terms,
Reuters said, citing three unidentified bankers involved in
the deal. The drinks maker is offering a 50 basis point
waiver fee to 18 lenders as it seeks to loosen covenants to
allow higher debt ratios and lower multiples of interest
cover, Reuters said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Coca-Cola&#8217;s bid was blocked in March 2009 by
China&#8217;s Ministry of Commerce, Beijing-based Huiyuan has faced
increasing competition for sales as international soft-drink
makers step up investment to win customers with beverages
that cater to Chinese tastes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;News suggests that Huiyuan is actively seeking a
waiver from lender banks and they will need 66.7 percent
consent,&#8221; Jacqueline Ko, an analyst at Kim Eng Securities
(Hong Kong) Ltd., said in a note to clients today, affirming
a &#8220;sell&#8221; rating on the stock. &#8220;We dislike its slow
earnings visibility, its ongoing aggressive capacity
expansion with its low utilization rate,&#8221; Ko said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huiyuan Chief Financial Officer Francis Ng didn&#8217;t
immediately return phone calls to his office from Bloomberg
News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company had a market value of HK$8.2 billion ($1.1
billion) before being suspended. The stock was trading 5.9
percent lower at HK$5.58 when it was halted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nomura Holdings Inc., Japan&#8217;s
largest brokerage, is likely to post a loss for the second
quarter as its overseas businesses may become unprofitable,
JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nomura may post a loss of 18 billion yen ($213 million) for
the three months ending Sept. 30, compared with profit of 27.7
billion yen a year earlier, JPMorgan said in a research report
dated today. The brokerage lowered its rating on the shares to
&#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;overweight.&#8221; Nomura&#8217;s Tokyo-based
spokeswoman Keiko Sugai declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue at Nomura may slump to the lowest in at least four
quarters because of declining income from trading, according to
the report. The investment bank has posted more losses than
profit since it acquired Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.&#8217;s Asia
and European operations two years ago, inheriting 8,000 staff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tokyo-based Nomura had a record 708.2 billion yen loss in
the year ended March 31, 2009, followed by a profit of 67.8
billion yen a year later. Nomura&#8217;s net income declined 80
percent to 2.3 billion yen for the first quarter ended June 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as its earnings deteriorate, Nomura is improving its
ranking in investment banking business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nomura is the sixth-highest underwriter for global equity
and equity-linked transactions in the current quarter, having
arranged $5.7 billion of transactions, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It was ranked 10th with $4.1 billion
worth of deals in the same period a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The securities firm is the ninth-highest adviser for global
mergers and acquisitions this quarter with $54.3 billion worth
of transactions. It was No. 12 last year with $20.3 billion,
according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nomura&#8217;s shares fell 0.9 percent to 459 yen as of 2:06 p.m.
in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 1.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. shut the larger
of two crude-distillation units at its Sarpom refinery in
Trecate, Italy, after the second fire in almost two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blaze, which occurred as the unit was being restarted
following a fire on Aug. 31, began at about 8:45 a.m. local time
yesterday and was extinguished 45 minutes later, Antonella
Sopranzetti, a Rome-based spokeswoman for the company, said
today by phone. There were no injuries and an investigation into
the cause of the fire is being carried out, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fuel-producing units at the plant are at reduced rates
because of the lower-than-usual feed, Sopranzetti said. The
refinery can meet all its sales contracts &#8220;at this stage&#8221; as a
contingency plan is being arranged for fuel deliveries, she
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plant near Milan has the capacity to process 230,000
barrels of oil a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Irving, Texas-based Exxon is operator of the site with a 74.1
percent stake, while Italy&#8217;s ERG SpA holds the rest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co.&#8217;s ESPN sports
network entered into a programming agreement with a new cable
network geared toward historically black colleges and
universities, according to the executive starting the network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HBCU Network plans to begin carrying live sporting
events from predominantly black colleges in August 2011, said
Curtis Symonds, chief executive of the venture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to sports, the HBCU Network will broadcast
entertainment, culture and lifestyle programming, Symonds said.
The network will be &#8220;somewhat modeled&#8221; after News Corp.&#8217;s Big
Ten Network, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partnership is likely to be announced later this week,
Symonds said. Chris LaPlaca, a spokesman at ESPN, couldn&#8217;t
immediately be reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symonds, the former head of affiliate sales and marketing
at Viacom Inc.&#8217;s BET cable network, said distribution agreements
are being negotiated with at least two cable companies, which he
declined to name. He said he expects the HBCU network to be
available in about 10 million homes when it starts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESPN owns the rights to games from the Mid-Eastern Athletic
Conference, the Southwestern Athletic Conference, the Southern
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference and the Central
Intercollegiate Athletic Association, which include the majority
of the country&#8217;s 105 historically black colleges and
universities. Those programming rights, Symonds said, will be
shared with the HBCU Network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a nice piece of programming for us,&#8221; Symonds said.
&#8220;You want to partner with folks like ESPN.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The universities themselves will own 20 percent of the
equity in the network, Symonds said. It has not been determined
how those ownership stakes will be divided among the colleges,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney rose 12 cents to $34.27 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The stock has climbed 6.3 percent

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s
biggest software maker, will investigate a report that efforts
to combat piracy of its programs in Russia resulted in the
harassment of nongovernmental agencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We unequivocally abhor any attempt to leverage
intellectual property rights to stifle political advocacy or
pursue improper personal gain,&#8221; Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith wrote today in a blog post. The company will hire an
independent international law firm to conduct an investigation
and advise on new measures the company should take, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will take more steps to ensure that NGOs and
other groups that act as public advocates aren&#8217;t mistreated amid
anti-piracy efforts, Smith said. On Sept. 11, the New York Times
reported that Russian security services monitored &#8220;outspoken
advocacy groups&#8221; and seized their computers, claiming the groups
were using pirated Microsoft software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft plans a new license for the organizations to make
sure they have free, legal Microsoft software and will create an
legal aid program in Russia to help them document that they have
legitimate software, Smith said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s clear we have a responsibility to take new steps to
address the situation,&#8221; Smith wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc., the
world&#8217;s biggest payments networks, fell to 52-week lows after an
analyst said federal caps on fees and pending litigation may
limit their ability to raise prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa, the worst performer in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
Index today, dropped $2.73, or 4 percent, to $65.36 at 1:19 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. MasterCard
declined 3 percent to $192.27. Both companies were downgraded to
&#8220;market perform&#8221; from &#8220;outperform&#8221; by Sanford C. Bernstein 
Co. analyst Rod Bourgeois. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors will need to get used to substantially lessened
pricing power,&#8221; Bourgeois said today in a research note. &#8220;We
see a higher probability that Visa&#8217;s and MasterCard&#8217;s stocks
will be &#8216;dead money.&#8217; &#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa and MasterCard have plunged more than 20 percent this
year as U.S. lawmakers approved caps on interchange, or
&#8220;swipe&#8221; fees, charged to merchants on each debit-card
transaction. San Francisco-based Visa and Purchase, New York-
based MasterCard also are defendants in a federal antitrust
lawsuit that may lead to lower interchange for credit-card
transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If credit interchange were to be reduced, this would be
another blow to sentiment for Visa and MasterCard,&#8221; Bourgeois
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dodd-Frank Act directs the Federal Reserve to determine
interchange rates that are &#8220;reasonable and proportional&#8221; to
the cost of processing debit transactions. MasterCard and Visa,
which now set the rates and pass the money to card-issuing
banks, may face pressure from lenders seeking to renegotiate
their contracts. Bank of America Corp. has said the debit caps
could trim annual revenue by as much as $2.3 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relative yields on U.S. investment-
grade corporate debt are poised to narrow after bond dealers
curbed holdings and as the world&#8217;s largest economy avoids
recession, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spreads may tighten 25 basis points, or 0.25 percentage
point, to 140 basis points by the end of this year as investors
increase allocations to investment-grade bond funds, JPMorgan
analysts led by Eric Beinstein wrote in a Sept. 10 note to
clients. Absolute yields on the debt may fall to 4 percent from
4.3 percent in September, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Spreads will grind tighter as supply falls short of
demand and investors continue to see the economic environment as
favorable&#8221; for increased allocation to investment-grade credit,
the JPMorgan analysts said in the report, whose fixed-income
research group was ranked first in Institutional Investor
magazine&#8217;s poll of U.S. money managers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan raised its recommendation on the debt spreads to
&#8220;overweight&#8221; from &#8221;neutral&#8221; as third-quarter data supports a
1.5 percent growth forecast, signaling that while the U.S.
economy is weaker than earlier in the year, a double dip into a
second recession is unlikely, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysts are reversing a June recommendation that was
spurred in part by concerns of a slowdown in Europe and the
U.S., they said. An &#8220;overweight&#8221; recommendation typically
means investors should own a greater percentage than is
contained in their benchmark indexes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors Allocated &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors allocated $12.7 billion into investment-grade
bond funds in August, the second-highest amount this year
following March, when they deposited $12.8 billion, Beinstein
wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors have also been buying &#8220;a significant amount of
bonds from dealers,&#8221; over the past 10 months, the analysts
wrote, citing data from Trace, the bond-price reporting system
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. This leaves
dealers &#8220;lighter on risk, which is supportive of spreads,&#8221;
they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of investment-grade corporate bonds may accelerate,
with companies issuing an additional $220 billion of the debt
this year as &#8220;demand trends show no letup,&#8221; wrote Beinstein,
who&#8217;s based in New York. Offerings may reach $650 million,
compared with $670 million last year, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beinstein didn&#8217;t immediately return a phone call seeking
additional comment on the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan earlier estimated spreads would tighten to 150
basis points and issuance would reach $600 billion by the end of
this year, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. halted jet fuel
production at its Sarpom refinery in Trecate, Italy, following
the second fire in less than two weeks in the larger of the
site&#8217;s two crude distillation units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The facility, which supplies fuel to Milan&#8217;s Malpensa
airport, has a week of aviation fuel stored, Rosario Lentini, a
spokesman for the refinery, said today by phone. Eni SpA also
transports the oil-product via pipeline to the airport, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crude unit, which was being started following an Aug.
31 fire, was forced to shut after a blaze at 8:45 a.m. local
time on Sept. 11. Even as the site&#8217;s smaller unit is operating,
output of fuels such as gasoline has dropped because of the
lower-than-usual feed, the company said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery can process 230,000 barrels of oil a day and
is running at 30 percent to 40 percent of capacity, according to
Lentini. He couldn&#8217;t give a time for the restart of the crude
unit as Italian prosecutors are investigating, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There won&#8217;t be any shortage of jet fuel to Malpensa,
according to an official at Sea SpA, which manages both of
Milan&#8217;s airports. The firm can tap into its own stockpiles and
call on other suppliers to increase flows, said the official,
who declined to be named in line with company policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon is operator of the site and has a 74.1 percent stake
and Italy&#8217;s ERG SpA holds the rest. The U.S. oil company also
has a refinery in Augusta, Italy, with a processing capacity of
190,000 barrels a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon is also running its Rotterdam oil refinery normally
after a &#8220;brief interruption&#8221; caused by a fault in a crude unit
furnace on the evening of Sept. 10, Bart Vermeulen, a company
spokesman, said today by phone from Breda in The Netherlands. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s Eileen Rominger, who serves as chief investment officer for portfolio
management businesses within the firm&#8217;s fund unit, is stepping
down at the end of the year and won&#8217;t be replaced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rominger, who has worked at Goldman Sachs for 11 years,
oversaw fixed income, fundamental equity and quantitative
investment strategies within Goldman Sachs Asset Management,
according to an internal memo dated Sept. 10. Melissa Daly, a
spokeswoman for New York-based Goldman Sachs, confirmed the
contents of the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management, which handled $802 billion
as of June 30, accounts for less than 9 percent of the firm&#8217;s
revenue. Rominger&#8217;s retirement from the firm coincides with the
announcement last week that Jim O&#8217;Neill, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s London-
based chief economist and creator of the BRICs acronym to
describe large emerging markets, would assume a new role as
chairman of asset management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rominger &#8220;reinforced and enhanced our investment culture
and facilitated the sharing of ideas across portfolio management
teams during a time of tremendous market volatility and
change,&#8221; Ed Forst and Tim O&#8217;Neill, global co-heads of Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s investment-management division, said in the Sept. 10
memo. &#8220;We are confident that the structure that Eileen has put
in place will serve us well into the future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vector Commodity Management LLP,
the energy hedge fund started three months ago by former Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. fuel-oil manager Gilbert Saiz, increased assets
under management to about $80 million and hired two traders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vector, based in London, returned 4 percent since its
inception, Erik Serrano Berntsen, a partner at Energy Alpha
Strategies Ltd., which markets the fund, said today by e-mail.
He declined to say how much capital the fund started with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vector trades futures, swaps and options in commodities
including crude, fuel oil and gasoline in markets from the U.S.
to Singapore. Commodity hedge funds returned on average 0.74
percent in August and had a year-to-date loss of 1.5 percent,
according to the Newedge Commodity Trading Index of 78 funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George Hoger, 31, and Ben Dilkes, 28, joined Vector in June
from the oil-trading venture of Credit Suisse and Glencore
International AG, set up in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saiz, 35, the former head of Goldman&#8217;s European fuel-oil
desk, worked at the bank for more than a decade in London and
New York. Vector will cap the size of the fund at $600 million,
the company said before its start. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds are mostly private pools of capital whose
managers participate substantially in the profit from
speculation on whether the price of assets will rise or fall. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Starr, a former Manhattan
money manager who handled a roster of celebrities, pleaded
guilty to defrauding his clients out of as much as $50 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;From 2009 to 2010, instead of using my clients&#8217; money as
I promised, I knowingly used a portion of the money for my own
purposes,&#8221; Starr, 66, told U.S. Magistrate Judge Theodore Katz
Sept. 10 in federal court in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starr, who was arrested in May and charged with 23 criminal
counts, pleaded guilty to one count each of wire fraud,
investment adviser fraud and money laundering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katz said he will recommend that U.S. District Judge Shira
Scheindlin accept Starr&#8217;s plea. Prosecutors and Starr&#8217;s
attorney, Flora Edwards, agreed that sentencing guidelines call
for him to serve from 121 to 151 months in prison. Scheindlin
may ignore those guidelines when she sentences Starr on Dec. 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He has committed a horrible error in judgment, but that&#8217;s
not the sum total of the man&#8217;s life,&#8221; Edwards said outside
court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starr, whose celebrity clients included Sylvester Stallone
and Wesley Snipes, was originally accused of defrauding at least
11 of them, including heiress Rachel &#8220;Bunny&#8221; Mellon, out of
$59 million. Edwards and the government agreed, for sentencing
purposes, that the amount lost in the fraud was between $20
million and $50 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of his agreement with the government, Starr will
forfeit his $7.5 million apartment on Manhattan&#8217;s Upper East
Side. Scheindlin will determine how much Starr must pay in
forfeiture and restitution, up to a total of $50 million,
according to the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Starr, 1:10-cr-520, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Victory in Nigerian Protesters&#8217; Suit Upheld on Appeal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp.&#8217;s trial victory in a lawsuit brought by
Nigerian protesters blaming the company for violence at an
offshore oil platform was upheld on appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A three-judge panel of the U.S. court of appeals in San
Francisco ruled Sept. 10 that the trial judge made no errors in
admitting challenged evidence or in the jury instructions. The
appellate panel also agreed with the judge that the 1992 U.S.
Torture Victim Protection Act is intended to sue individuals
rather than corporations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For years, the events that transpired on the Parabe
platform have been misrepresented to courts and the public,&#8221;
Chevron spokesman Kent Robertson said in an e-mailed statement.
&#8220;While we are sympathetic to the challenges that people of the
Niger Delta face, hostage taking is never the answer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case stems from a 1998 incident in which protesters,
who boarded a Chevron oil drilling platform, were attacked by
Nigerian soldiers. Two men were killed, others were shot and
beaten and one man was hung by his wrists and tortured after a
protest about jobs and alleged environmental damage to the area,
according to the 1999 lawsuit against Chevron. Nineteen
Nigerians sued the company, claiming it was liable for the
actions of the Nigerian soldiers it hired to provide security
for the oil platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After almost 10 years of trial court proceedings, the case
went before a jury in October 2008. The jury cleared Chevron,
the second-largest U.S. oil company, of wrongful death, torture,
assault, battery and negligence claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theresa Traber, a lawyer representing the Nigerians and
their families, didn&#8217;t return a call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Larry Bowoto v. Chevron, 09-15641, 9th U.S.
Court of Appeals (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Sued by Environmental Group Over Atlantis Platform in Gulf &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc&#8217;s Atlantis oil and gas production platform in the
Gulf of Mexico should be shut until the company can prove it
meets U.S. safety and engineering standards, an environmental
watchdog group said in a lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food  Water Watch sued BP in federal court in Houston
Sept. 10. The group revised a lawsuit that it filed against U.S.
regulators in May, accusing them of failing to investigate
Atlantis after a whistleblower warned that the platform lacks
critical safety documentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group withdrew the initial lawsuit in June, after
London-based BP won court permission to intervene in the case.
BP then asked the court to require opponents to post a $15
billion bond to cover the company&#8217;s damages if Atlantis&#8217;s
production was halted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have evidence that Atlantis is unsafe and is in danger
of creating an even worse spill than the one caused by the
Deepwater Horizon explosion,&#8221; Wenonah Hauter, Food  Water
Watch&#8217;s executive director in Washington, said Sept. 10 in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Deepwater Horizon, owned by Transocean Ltd., was under
contract to BP about 100 miles (161 kilometers) north of the
Atlantis platform. The damaged well leaked more than 4 million
barrels of crude oil into the Gulf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP insists the Atlantis, its second-largest Gulf production
platform, is safe and in compliance with federal regulations.
The Atlantis can produce 200,000 barrels of oil and 180 million
cubic feet of gas daily from waters ranging from 4,400 feet to
7,200 feet deep. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daren Beaudo, a BP spokesman, didn&#8217;t respond to a phone
calls and e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is United States of America Ex Rel. Abbott, 4:09-
cv-01193, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Texas
(Houston). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment Adviser Sandra Venetis Charged in $11 Million Fraud &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sandra Venetis, a New Jersey investment adviser, was
criminally charged with defrauding more than 100 investors of
more than $11 million in a Ponzi scheme that authorities said
supported her lavish lifestyle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venetis, 59, who ran Systematic Financial Associates Inc.
in Branchburg, New Jersey, persuaded clients to invest in a
phony investment program in which she said the money would fund
loans to doctors, malpractice premiums and pension plans,
according to a Federal Bureau of Investigation complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She used that money to pay early investors, cover gambling
expenses in Las Vegas, and fund trips to Italy, France, India,
Alaska and the Caribbean, according to the FBI. Venetis
surrendered to the FBI Sept. 10 and appeared later that day in
federal court in Newark, New Jersey. U.S. Magistrate Judge
Claire Cecchi released Venetis on a $500,000 bond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is United States of America v. Venetis, 10-mj-
04141, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey (Newark). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nine Containerboard Makers Named in Price-Fixing Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packaging Corp. of America, International Paper Co. and
seven other containerboard makers were sued and accused of
conspiring to fix the price of materials used to make cardboard
boxes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies created a product shortage leading to higher
prices, according to a complaint filed Sept. 9 in federal court
in Chicago by Kleen Products LLC. The closely held floor-care
company asked for class-action status for the case, to include
containerboard buyers from the companies over the past five
years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norampac Industries Inc., Cascades Inc., Domtar Corp.,
Weyerhaeuser Co., Georgia Pacific LLC., Temple-Inland Inc., and
Smurfit-Stone Container Corp. were also sued. The defendants
supply 83 percent of the containerboard market, according to
Kleen Products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Price increases from August 2005 till now outpaced cost
increases by more than 50 percent, and the companies were
&#8220;nearly simultaneous&#8221; in raising prices, according to the
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Paper, based in Memphis, Tennessee, said the
allegations were &#8220;baseless.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our company holds itself to the highest standards of
ethical conduct and business practices,&#8221; the company said in an
e-mailed statement. &#8220;We take seriously any allegations to the
contrary and will vigorously defend ourselves in this
litigation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives of the other defendant companies didn&#8217;t
return calls for comment on the suit or declined to comment
immediately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Kleen Products LLC v. Packaging Corp. of
America, 1:10-cv-05711, U.S. District Court, Northern District
of Illinois (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London Police Arrest Man in FSA Insider-Trading Investigation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London police arrested a man on suspicion of money
laundering and providing false information as part of a
Financial Services Authority investigation into insider trading
where six have already been arrested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSA didn&#8217;t identify the 64-year-old in a statement
Sept. 10 announcing the arrest. Police also searched a location
in Potters Bar, north of London, the regulator said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arrest is related to an ongoing insider-trading probe
that led to the arrest of five men and a woman, age 27 to 34, in
May 2009 following raids in London and Essex, England. The man,
arrested Sept. 9, was released on bail after being interviewed.
No one has been charged in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSA, which has been increasing enforcement of market
abuse after facing criticism it didn&#8217;t do enough to stop the
crime, is currently prosecuting 11 people for insider trading.
The regulator never prosecuted a criminal insider-trading case
before 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. government plans to abolish the FSA by 2012 and
replace it with a Prudential Regulatory Authority at the Bank of
England and an independent Consumer Protection and Markets
Authority that would be funded by financial firms. Margaret
Cole, the FSA&#8217;s enforcement chief, is pressing for her unit to
become part of the CPMA, rather than joining the government&#8217;s
planned economic crime agency, when the FSA is broken up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crescent Resources Trust Sues Duke Energy Over Loan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trust representing creditors of Crescent Resources LLC, a
real estate developer, sued Duke Energy Corp. to recover $1.19
billion plus other damages tied to a 2006 loan deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duke required Crescent, its subsidiary at the time, to
borrow $1.23 billion and immediately transfer $1.19 billion back
to Duke, the litigation trust said in its complaint filed Sept.
3 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Austin, Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The sole purpose of the transaction was to benefit Duke
at the expense of Crescent Resources and its many innocent
creditors,&#8221; lawyers for the trust said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crescent, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, filed for
bankruptcy in June 2009. At the time of the 2006 loan, the
company was a wholly owned unit of Duke. Under the loan
transaction, Duke sold a 49 percent stake in Crescent&#8217;s holding
company to Morgan Stanley real estate funds, according to court
papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think the case is without merit and will vigorously
defend ourselves,&#8221; Thomas Williams, a spokesman for Charlotte-
based Duke, said in an e-mail. Duke owns utilities in the U.S.
Southeast and Midwest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Crescent Resources Litigation Trust v. Duke
Energy Corp., 10-01111, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Western District
of Texas (Austin). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lilly Wins Reversal of Class Action in Zyprexa Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eli Lilly  Co. won reversal of a ruling that granted
class-action status to a suit by pension funds, unions and
insurers who alleged that improper marketing of Zyprexa, its
schizophrenia treatment, raised their costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A U.S. appeals court in New York threw out a September 2008
ruling by U.S. District Judge Jack Weinstein in Brooklyn on
Sept. 10. He had said the plaintiffs could pursue as a group
claims that Indianapolis-based Lilly&#8217;s Zyprexa marketing caused
them to pay more for the drug than what it was worth. The
plaintiffs were seeking $6.8 billion in damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weinstein had ruled in favor of the unions, pension funds
and insurance companies, known as third-party payors, rejecting
Lilly&#8217;s argument that their claims were too different to be
tried together. The appeals court reversed, finding that the
link between marketing Zyprexa to doctors and the injury claimed
by the payors was &#8220;attenuated.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Crucially, the third-party payors do not allege that they
relied on Lilly&#8217;s misrepresentations -- the misrepresentations
at issue were &#8216;directed through mailings and otherwise at
doctors,&#8217;&#8221; the appeals court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marni Lemons, a spokeswoman for Lilly, didn&#8217;t return voice-
mail messages seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We just got the decision and our legal team is in the
process of evaluating the decision to see what the next step
is,&#8220; said James Dugan, a lawyer at the Murray Law Firm in New
Orleans, who is co-lead counsel for the plaintiffs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is UFCW Local 1776 and Participating Employers
Health and Welfare Fund v. Eli Lilly  Co., 05-CV-4115, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-David Jones CEO Accused of Harassment Earlier, Woman Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Jones Ltd.&#8217;s former Chief Executive Officer Mark
McInnes was counseled against inappropriate behavior as many as
10 times while employed at Black  Decker Corp. from 1989 to
1991, claims a David Jones employee who is suing him and the
company for A$37 million ($34 million). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristy Fraser-Kirk, 27, a publicist at David Jones, who
claims McInnes sexually harassed her at work and work-related
parties, submitted additional information to support her claims
Sept. 10 in Sydney Federal Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McInnes&#8217;s conduct included &#8220;openly commenting on the size
of women&#8217;s breasts and women&#8217;s appearances&#8221; at Black  Decker,
according to Fraser-Kirk&#8217;s amended statement of claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fraser-Kirk sued McInnes, David Jones and its board of
directors Aug. 2, claiming McInnes made repeated, unwelcome
sexual advances and that the company failed to address or
prevent the conduct. Her claim for punitive damages of 5 percent
of the company&#8217;s profit and McInnes&#8217;s earnings from 2003 to 2010
amounts to about A$37 million, which she says will be given to
charity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These intolerable and wholly unsubstantiated accusations
are an abuse of the legal process,&#8221; McInnes said in a statement
Sept. 10. &#8220;I totally reject the 20-year-old Black and Decker
allegations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Jones said the new information refers to old
complaints that have nothing to do with the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is between Kristy Anne Fraser-Kirk and David Jones
Ltd. 964-2010. Federal Court of Australia (Sydney). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dismissals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MetLife Wins Dismissal of Beneficiary&#8217;s Lawsuit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal judge threw out a lawsuit claiming MetLife Inc.
unfairly profited from the account of a policy beneficiary,
while saying the company-described money-market account the life
insurer uses to pay claims has an &#8220;inherently deceptive&#8221; name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plaintiff Jamie Clark didn&#8217;t prove she had a &#8220;special or
confidential relationship&#8221; with the company required to advance
the case, U.S. District Judge Larry Hicks in Reno, Nevada, said
in a ruling Sept. 10. Clark, who sought class-action status on
behalf of other beneficiaries, claimed that MetLife earned a
greater return on the money it owed her than what it paid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Clark argues that a confidential and special relationship
arose between her and MetLife when MetLife undertook to invest
her insurance proceeds and pay her all earnings and gains,&#8221;
Hicks wrote. &#8220;The court finds that there is no evidence that
Clark had any ties with MetLife that could rise to such a
special relationship.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and New York
Attorney General Andrew Cuomo started investigations of life-
insurance industry practices after Bloomberg Markets reported in
July that carriers profit by holding and investing $28 billion
owed to beneficiaries. The insurers earn hundreds of millions of
dollars a year in investment gains on the death benefits,
including those due to families of U.S. military service members
killed in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hicks did determine that MetLife&#8217;s Total Control Money
Market Account Option, used to pay survivors their life
insurance proceeds is &#8220;inherently deceptive&#8221; because it
suggests the account is covered by FDIC insurance. MetLife keeps
billions of dollars of its life insurance beneficiaries&#8217; money
in its general account, and sends them &#8220;checkbooks&#8221; instead of
checks as it earns investment gains on their money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court said it awarded summary judgment to MetLife on
the breach of contract claim because Clark admitted never
reading or relying on the MetLife contract, nor understanding
what a money market account is. Hicks also found that Clark, of
Reno, Nevada, failed to prove damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curtis Coulter, a lawyer representing Clark, didn&#8217;t return
a call seeking comment after regular business hours Sept. 10.
Christopher Breslin, a spokesman for New York-based MetLife,
also didn&#8217;t return a call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Jamie Clark v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.,
3:08-cv-00158, U.S. District Court for Nevada (Reno). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miami Area Father-Son Developers Begin U.S. Tax-Fraud Trial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Miami-area hotel developers accused of hiding more than

trial today in a case that will display their mansions, yachts
and luxury cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mauricio Cohen Assor, 77, and his son, Leon Cohen Levy, 46,
are accused of conspiring to defraud the IRS and filing false
tax returns. Jury selection begins today in federal court in
Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where prosecutors will try to prove
the men used shell companies in tax havens to cheat the IRS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors claim they hid ownership of one home in Miami
Beach worth $26 million and another valued at $20 million. They
never declared $45 million in investments, commercial properties
worth $55 million and cars like a Rolls-Royce Phantom, a Porsche
Carrera GT and a Ferrari Testarossa, prosecutors say. Defense
lawyers will try to show they never meant to break the law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defense lawyer Michael Pasano, who is representing both
men, didn&#8217;t return a call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In this case there will be no proof of any agreement to
violate the law,&#8221; he said in a Sept. 9 court filing. &#8220;Nor will
there be proof of any knowing participation in criminal acts.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohen Assor and his son were arrested April 15 and have
remained in jail in spite of several attempts to get bail.
Prosecutors say they operated all-suite hotels in Europe under
the &#8220;Flatotel&#8221; brand, as well as one in New York that they
owned through nominees and sold in 2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They put proceeds of $33 million in a Swiss account of
London-based HSBC Holdings Plc, Europe&#8217;s largest bank by market
value, and failed to tell the IRS about the sale, according to
prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The men also used shell companies like American Leisure
Resorts Inc. and hid assets in tax havens such as the Bahamas,
Panama, Liechtenstein, Switzerland and the British Virgin
Islands, according to prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In court papers filed after the arrests, Pasano denied that
Cohen Assor or his son owned the hotel. He said the criminal
charges recycle failed claims made in a civil case by CDR
Creances SA, a company set up by the French government to sell
unprofitable businesses of Credit Lyonnais SA. Pasano also has
disputed the government&#8217;s claims about his clients&#8217; U.S.
residency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is USA v. Assor, 10-cr-60159, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of Florida (Fort Lauderdale). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TD Bank Lawsuit by Fired Bond Trader Most Popular Docket &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawsuit settled by a bond trader fired by Toronto-
Dominion Bank after an investigation into incorrectly priced
credit derivatives was the most-read litigation docket on the
Bloomberg Law system last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nabeel Naqui, the former head of the credit products group
for Europe and Asia, and Toronto-Dominion reached a settlement
in July, according to a court filing in London that became
public this month. The terms of the settlement weren&#8217;t
disclosed. The bank sued Naqui last year seeking 3.1 million
pounds ($4.8 million). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trader was suspended in June 2007 and fired six months
later, he said in a court filing last year. Toronto-Dominion
said he overvalued his trading positions by altering quotes from
dealers and forwarding them on to the bank without notification
that they had been changed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mispriced derivatives forced the bank to cut earnings
by about C$96 million ($91 million) in mid-2008. Toronto-
Dominion was fined 7 million pounds in December by the U.K.
financial regulator, its fourth-largest fine levied at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naqui denied the claims in the Toronto-based bank&#8217;s suit
and said the bank was attempting to make him a &#8220;scapegoat&#8221; for
alleged failures in the bank&#8217;s systems and controls. He said he
sometimes used different prices than the dealer quotes he
received because of his own assessment of the correct price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Toronto-Dominion Bank v. Nabeel Naqui,
2009/3363, High Court of Justice, Chancery Division (London). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia
Inc. was sued by an Illinois company that claims the maker of
household goods is infringing a patent for &#8220;Protect-A-Bed&#8221;
mattress covers designed to keep bedbugs from biting sleepers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAB Distributors LLC claims the Martha Stewart Collection
Allergy Wise Mattress Protector is using its invention without
permission. Closely held JAB is seeking a court order to prevent
further use, plus unspecified cash compensation, according to
the complaint filed Sept. 9 in federal court in Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the second suit in less than a week against Stewart
and her company. Last week she was sued for trademark
infringement in Los Angeles for selling novelty stick-on wine
labels a California winery claimed infringed its Vampire
Vineyard trademarks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bedbugs, mostly eliminated in the U.S. 60 years ago with
the now-banned pesticide DDT, are making a comeback, with
companies including Time Warner Inc. and Abercrombie  Fitch Co.
reporting sightings of the insects at some offices or stores.
Exterminators have logged &#8220;a dramatic increase in bedbug calls
in recent years&#8221; and the U.S. is on the threshold of a
pandemic, according to a survey by the National Pest Management
Association and the University of Kentucky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey found that 95 percent of pest control
professionals have treated bedbug infestations in the past year,
compared with less than 25 percent in 2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAB&#8217;s patent 7,552,489, issued in June 2009, is for a
&#8220;bug-impervious fabric&#8221; with a zipper opening for removal of
the mattress and a foam pad at the end of the zipper so the
bedbugs can&#8217;t escape from that opening. According to the patent,
sealing the bedbugs inside the mattress will starve them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is likely that the evidence will show that Martha
Stewart&#8217;s acts of infringement have been made with full
knowledge&#8221; of the patent, Northbrook, Illinois-based JAB said
in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials with New York-based Martha Stewart Living didn&#8217;t
immediately return messages seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vermin can cause allergic reactions in people through
bites, as well as blister-like skin infections, and, in rare
cases, asthma and anaphylactic shock, according to a report last
year in the Journal of the American Medical Association. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAB is represented by David Z. Petty and Stephen F. Sherry
of Chicago&#8217;s McAndrews Held  Malloy PC, the same firm that
assisted the company in the patent-application process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is JAB Distributors LLC v. Martha Stewart Living
Omnimedia Inc., 10cv5716, U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Illinois (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM Gets Patent on Method of Computing Passenger Head Count &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest
computer-services company, received a patent on a technology
that sounds a bit like a grade-school arithmetic problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patent 7,788,063, which was issued Aug. 31, is for a method
of determining how many people are riding in a vehicle.
According to the patent, this information is obtained by
dividing the total weight of the passengers by the estimated
weight of each passenger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent specifies that this computation can be adjusted
with reference to &#8220;current season, a time of day, a day of
week, a location of the vehicle and an average weight of carry-
on baggage.&#8221;  Software is a key element of the technology,
according to the patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armonk, New York-based IBM applied for the patent in
January 2008 with the assistance of Dillon  Yudell LLP of
Austin, Texas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indicted Apple Manager Devine Agrees to Protect Secrets in Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Devine, the Apple Inc. manager accused of taking
kickbacks in exchange for company information, agreed to a court
order protecting Apple&#8217;s trade secrets in any document exchange
during pretrial negotiations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office in San Francisco filed the
protective order Sept. 9, saying discovery in the criminal case
may produce documents, tapes, diskettes, hard drives or other
media containing material &#8220;that is intended to be kept secret
and is trade secret information belonging to Apple.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devine agreed to procedures about how the data will be
handled during pretrial bargaining, without giving up his right
to challenge how such information may be used at trial,
according to court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devine, 37, a global-supply manager, was accused of money
laundering and wire fraud in a 23-count indictment unsealed Aug.
13. He pleaded not guilty to charges that he took at least $1
million in kickbacks from Asian suppliers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devine gave the suppliers of iPhone and iPod accessories
confidential data that helped them win better contracts from
Cupertino, California-based Apple in exchange for payments,
according to the indictment. Each count of wire fraud, wire
fraud conspiracy and money laundering may bring a 20-year prison
sentence, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack Gillund, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s office,
and Devine&#8217;s lawyer, Raphael Goldman, didn&#8217;t immediately return
calls seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Devine, 10-cr-00603, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of California (San Jose). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D Magazine Sues Moving Company for Infringing &#8216;D&#8217; Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The publisher of four magazines focused on Dallas sued a
moving company for trademark infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D Magazine Partners LP of Dallas publishes D Magazine, D
Home, D Weddings and D CEO and operates the dmagazine.com
website. The company has used a logo consisting of a white
upper-case letter D on a red background. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company owns registered U.S. trademarks incorporating
the logo. It objects to the logo used by Edwin Bedford&#8217;s D
Moving of Allen, Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint filed Sept. 9 in federal court
in Dallas, Bedford&#8217;s company uses a logo that is confusingly
similar to the magazine&#8217;s. The logo is found on the mover&#8217;s
website, www.dmovingservices.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website also displays images of moving vans bearing the
logo, and the company has registered a U.S. trademark
incorporating the logo, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magazine publisher claims the moving company is using a
similar logo without permission, and that customers are
persuaded falsely to believe an affiliation exists between the
two entities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this alleged infringement, the publisher said it
suffers &#8220;substantial damage&#8221; to its &#8220;business, reputation and
goodwill.&#8221; The company also claims that the mover&#8217;s website is
intended to divert customers who are seeking the magazines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bedford was previously sued for trademark infringement by
Major League Baseball after he operated a moving service under
the name Major League Moving LLC. Bedford didn&#8217;t respond to the
complaint in that case, and a default judgment was entered in
July 2008, barring the use of the &#8220;Major League&#8221; in its name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That case was Major League Baseball Properties Inc. v.
Major League Moving LLC, 4:07-cv-00565-RAS-DDB, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of Texas (Sherman). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new case, the publisher asked the court for orders
halting the use of the &#8220;D&#8221; logo and the dmovingservices.com
website. It also requested that the court order the cancellation
of the moving services&#8217; trademark, and that it be given the
website to which it objected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the company asked for awards of money
damages, the moving company&#8217;s profits attributable to the
alleged infringement, and for attorney fees and litigation
costs. The publisher asked that the damaged be tripled to punish
the moving company for its actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moving company did not respond immediately to an e-
mailed request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D Magazine Partners is represented by Jason P. Bloom, David
H. Harper and Jeffrey M. Becker of Haynes  Boone LLP of Dallas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new case is D. Magazine Partners LP v. Edwin Bedford,
3:10-cv-01778-D, U.D. District Court, Northern District of Texas
(Dallas). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China to Introduce Anti-Piracy Alcohol Labeling, Xinhua Reports &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China plans to introduce a labeling system for alcoholic
beverages under which each bottle can receive a unique
identification number, Xinhua News Agency said, citing a
Ministry of Commerce official. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program, to be ready in two years to three years, is
meant to combat counterfeiting, and participation will be
voluntary for beverage producers, Xinhua said, citing Wang
Bingnan, director of ministry&#8217;s Market Operation Department. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autodesk Persuades Appeals Court Software Licensed, Not Sold &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autodesk Inc., the largest maker of engineering software,
won a copyright dispute with a Seattle man who tried to sell
used copies of the company&#8217;s AutoCAD software on EBay Inc.&#8217;s
auction website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its Sept 9 ruling, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
reversed a trial court and said that the used copies of the
program that Timothy S. Vernor was trying to sell were
unsalable. The court agreed with San Rafael, California-based
Autodesk that although the users of the program were licensed
the use of the programs, they never actually owned them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vernor, who was sold used copies of the AutoCAD program by
a company that was upgrading its software, became the target of
a take-down notice under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
after he listed them for sale on EBay. In his pleadings, Vernor
said he repeatedly told both Autodesk and EBay that these were
legitimate retail versions of the software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The California software maker&#8217;s AutoCAD design and
drafting software program is in the top 10 list of the most
frequently pirated programs released annually by the Washington-
based Software and Information Industry Association trade group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Vernor filed suit in federal court in Seattle in
August 2007, he claimed AutoCAD committed fraud and was misusing
copyright law to stifle competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the software company asked the court to dismiss
the case, the trial court instead said in October 2009 that
under the &#8220;first sale&#8221; provisions of copyright law, Vernor&#8217;s
actions didn&#8217;t infringe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court disagreed, finding that the user is only
a licensee rather than the owner of a copy if the copyright
owner specified that only a license is granted, imposes use
restrictions, and &#8220;significantly restricts&#8221; the user&#8217;s ability
to transfer the software. Autodesk&#8217;s software license agreement
met those requirements, the appeals court found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company that sold the used software to Varner was only
a licensee, and Autodesk itself retained title to the software,
the court said. And because Vernor wasn&#8217;t an owner, the court
ruled that his customers infringed Autodesk&#8217;s copyright when
they installed the program on their computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court noted that in addition to Autodesk, several trade
groups -- the Motion Picture Association of America and the
Software  Information Industry Association -- &#8220;presented
policy arguments that favor our results.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EBay and the American Library Association, which filed
friend-of-the-court briefs on Vernor&#8217;s behalf, were
unpersuasive, the court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autodesk&#8217;s case was argued by Jerome B. Falk of San
Francisco&#8217;s Howard Rice Nemerovski Canady Falk  Rabkin PC.
Vernor&#8217;s case was argued by Gregory A. Beck of Washington&#8217;s
Public Citizen Litigation Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court case is Vernor v. Autodesk, 09-35969,
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower court case is Vernor v. Autodesk Inc., 2:07-cv-
01189-RAJ, U.S. District Court, Western District of Washington
(Seattle) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writer Seeks Authorship Declaration for WWII History Book &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Colorado-based writer sued a California organization
established to commemorate a World War II military unit for
copyright infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawrence J. Hickey of Boulder, Colorado, sued the 38th Bomb
Group Association in a dispute over authorship of a history of
the unit, which is also known as the Sun Setters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the complaint filed Sept. 8 in federal court in Denver,
Hickey is asking the court to declare he&#8217;s the sole author of
the book, and to bar the association and David J. Gunn from
copying or claiming interest in the work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hickey, president of International Historical Research
Associates of Boulder, said he began writing the book in 1985,
and as &#8220;Saga of the Sun Setters,&#8221; it&#8217;s intended to become the
fourth volume in his &#8220;Eagles Over the Pacific&#8221; series of books
about World War II aviation history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He spent 25 years researching the history of the unit,
visiting battle sites, acquiring translations of Japanese
documents, studying memorabilia related to the unit, and
commissioning paintings for the book, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the book is &#8220;under final production&#8221; and will
have about 650 pages of text, illustrated with 1,000 photos and
detailed maps. After he was recovering from a serious illness in
2009, he said he was contacted repeatedly by Gunn and the
association seeking information about when the book was
published. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You should understand that I cannot make a statement
until I have an opportunity to talk with counsel,&#8221; Gunn said in
an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2010, Hickey said he received a letter from the
association and Gunn in which the Californian claimed to be co-
author of the book, and sought to bar the book&#8217;s publication.
Hickey claims the association is now threatening to publish the
book independently, using an unfinished draft he provided Gunn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When accessed Sept. 10, the 38th Bomb Group Association&#8217;s
website contained a notice that the book was nearing
publication, together with a link to Hickey&#8217;s International
Historical Research Associates website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hickey is represented by Byeongsook Seo of Denver&#8217;s
Isaacson Rosenbaum PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Lawrence Hickey v. David J. Gunn, 1:10-cv-
02203-PAG, U.S. District Court, District of Colorado (Denver). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should sell India&#8217;s rupee
against South Korea&#8217;s won to profit as the U.S. steps up
pressure on Asian countries to let their currencies trade more
freely, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The won faces the &#8220;strongest appreciation pressures&#8221; in
the region because of its robust balance of payments, while a
current-account deficit means the rupee faces virtually none,
Goldman said in a research note received today via e-mail.
&#8220;Korean authorities have heavily stood in the way of currency
strength for many months,&#8221; it added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rupee traded at 25.04 won as of 1:29 p.m. in Mumbai,
3.9 percent weaker than at the start of this quarter, and
Goldman predicts the currency will slide 8.1 percent to 23,
according to the note. It didn&#8217;t give a timeframe for the move.
The trade should be exited if India&#8217;s currency climbs to 26 won,
the U.S. bank advised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea&#8217;s current-account surplus reached a 16-month
high of $5.9 billion in July and the central bank said Aug. 27
the full-year figure may exceed its projection of $21 billion.
India had a current-account deficit of $13 billion in the three
months through March, following a $12.2 billion shortfall in the
previous quarter, and Reserve Bank of India Governor Duvvuri
Subbarao this month forecast a widening of the gap during the
fiscal year that began April 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea&#8217;s won has appreciated 6.1 percent against the
dollar this quarter, the biggest gain among Asia&#8217;s 10 most-
active currencies excluding the yen. India&#8217;s rupee has advanced
0.2 percent, the worst performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Indian rupee has been a notable underperformer in
Asia already and we think the balance of payments fundamentals
point to a continuation of this theme,&#8221; the Goldman report said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
largest U.S. bank by assets, is trying to fix its consumer
website after a failure late yesterday left more than 16.5
million customers without access to online banking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are working on a technical issue,&#8221; Tom Kelly, a
spokesman for the New York-based bank, said in an interview. The
site has been down &#8220;since overnight," said Kelly, who couldn&#8217;t
estimate when service would be restored. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s active online customers have grown by an average
annual rate of 42 percent since 2006, according to a
presentation to investors by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon
today. More than 3.7 million households use JPMorgan&#8217;s online
website to pay their bills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I know our system is down today," Dimon said at the
conference. "I apologize for that." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bert Ely, a Washington, D.C.-based banking consultant, said
the length of the failure &#8216;&#8216;raises questions about backup
capabilities and redundancies within the Chase systems.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Dear, a retired banker in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and
part-time school teacher, said he couldn&#8217;t log in to his Chase
checking account when he tried about 9 p.m. Eastern time 
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;ve got a real problem,&#8221; said Dear, who also has an
account with HSBC Holdings Plc. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been using online banking
with HSBC for a very long time and I&#8217;ve never had any problem
like this.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank, is moving some credit-default and commodities
swaps businesses to a subsidiary to comply with new U.S.
financial rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is moving &#8220;certain investment-grade CDS and some
of the commodities to a separate subsidiary,&#8221; Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon said today in New York at a conference
sponsored by Barclays Capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a real pain. It&#8217;s an operational nightmare,&#8221; Dimon
said. &#8220;In my opinion, it&#8217;s highly ill conceived, doesn&#8217;t reduce
risk at all. As a matter of fact, it probably complicates it for
some people.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon estimated the new rules, which President Barack Obama
signed into law July 21, will cost the bank roughly $1 billion
in lost revenue but won&#8217;t affect profit &#8220;that much.&#8221; The
legislation requires banks to move their derivatives trading
operations into separately capitalized subsidiaries and moves
much of the market to regulated exchanges and clearinghouses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some of these things will create more volume, more
opportunity as long as we build the systems,&#8221; Dimon said.
&#8220;This really is an issue more for clients than for us. The
capital impact for dealers is unclear but largely positive.&#8221; He
said that moving a lot of activity to a clearinghouse reduces
capital requirements for broker-dealers, while requiring clients
to set aside more collateral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derivatives are financial contracts whose value is derived
from stocks, bonds, loans, currencies and physical commodities
like oil and wheat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At midnight, a line formed outside
the GameStop store in New York&#8217;s Herald Square. Shoppers were
eager to get their hands on &#8220;Halo: Reach,&#8221; the first update of
Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s alien-shooting game in three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is predicting the fourth iteration of its
$2 billion franchise will generate more revenue than the series&#8217;
biggest seller, 2007&#8217;s &#8220;Halo 3,&#8221; which rang up $600 million in
sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it&#8217;s planning to back &#8220;Halo: Reach&#8221; with
the largest marketing budget it has spent on a game, though it
won&#8217;t disclose how much. Online ads started Aug. 23, featuring a
dramatization of life on the planet Reach the day before alien
attacks. TV spots started Aug. 29 on ESPN and Fox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This month&#8217;s top title will most certainly be &#8216;Halo:
Reach,&#8217; and we expect record sales for the game, given
Microsoft&#8217;s intention to provide a strong marketing push,&#8221;
Michael Pachter, an analyst at Los Angeles-based Wedbush
Securities Inc., wrote in a note to investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After buying 120 to 200 copies, the crowd at the Herald
Square GameStop subsided, Sean Rappaport, assistant manager at
the location, said in a telephone interview. At 9 a.m. there
were fewer shoppers and more than 600 games still available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Who knows, by rush hour at 5 or 6 o&#8217;clock, we may or may
not run out,&#8221; Mayari Reyes, another employee at the store, said
in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, rose 19 cents to
$25.30 at 12:28 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading. The shares dropped 18 percent this year before today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hardware Sales &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game will boost sales for Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox 360 console
months before the company&#8217;s introduction of a motion-sensing
peripheral for casual gamers called Kinect, said Anita Frazier,
an analyst for product-tracking researcher NPD Group Inc.
Microsoft is selling a limited edition version of its Xbox 360
console with &#8220;Halo: Reach&#8221; for $399. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If hardware sales react in a similar fashion to what was
experienced when Halo 3 was launched in September 2007,
September could be a huge sales month for Xbox 360 hardware,&#8221;
Frazier said in a Sept. 10 statement, before the game&#8217;s release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halo, Kinect and Sony Corp.&#8217;s planned Move motion-control
peripheral for the PlayStation 3 may help the video-game
industry in what has been a sluggish year. U.S. software sales
in the first nine months of the year have dropped almost 10
percent from the same period a year earlier, NPD reported Sept.
9. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG
are missing out on Chinese initial public offerings as local
investment banks lead record numbers of small companies to sell
shares in Shenzhen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China accounts for a third of the $150 billion raised
worldwide in IPOs this year -- yet the average deal size has
shrunk as companies rush to list on Shenzhen&#8217;s ChiNext startup
board introduced in October. Goldman Sachs, ranked first in
overseas IPOs by Chinese companies, has expanded its local
investment-banking unit&#8217;s workforce by about 40 percent in 2010
as it moves to target smaller domestic offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are going to put more focus on ChiNext IPO deals,&#8221;
Thomas Deng, head of China equity capital markets at New York-
based Goldman Sachs, said in a Sept. 8 interview. &#8220;Our pipeline
has traditionally been mostly big deals, or at least that&#8217;s the
perception. This may change.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies have raised 358 billion yuan ($53 billion) in
first-time sales in Shanghai and Shenzhen since Jan. 1, putting
this year on track to overtake 2007 as the biggest for local
IPOs, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Goldman Sachs
hasn&#8217;t worked on any such deals. UBS, in 18th place overall,
ranks first among foreign investment banks in underwriting yuan-
denominated IPOs after advising on one offering in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s Bing overtook
Yahoo! Inc. last month for the first time as the No. 2 search-
engine provider in the U.S., according to Nielsen Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bing had 13.9 percent of searches, while Yahoo had 13.1
percent, Nielsen said in an e-mailed statement. Google remained
in first place with 65 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Yahoo, trying to expand search-based
advertising revenue, have teamed up to take on Google. Under
their 10-year deal, Yahoo plans to use Bing&#8217;s search technology
on its sites. The U.S. search-ad market may grow 16 percent this
year, faster than the broader online advertising market, which
is estimated to expand 11 percent to $25.1 billion, according to
EMarketer Inc. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, rose 2 cents to
$25.13 at 11:09 a.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
Yahoo, based in Sunnyvale, California, dropped 9 cents to
$13.64. Mountain View, California-based Google rose $1.68 to

&lt;p&gt;Emerging markets labeled as the
&#8220;Next 11&#8221; by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are on a roll as the
category&#8217;s creator moves to a new job within the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, a stock index for the so-
called N-11 has risen more than MSCI&#8217;s benchmarks for emerging
markets and for the so-called BRIC countries: Brazil, Russia,
India and China. The 11-country gauge is compiled by Solactive,
part of Structured Solutions AG, and consists of 40 stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s Jim O&#8217;Neill first wrote about the N-11 in
December 2005, four years after introducing the BRICs. The group
is composed of &#8220;countries than might have BRICs-like
potential,&#8221; he said in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Neill headed Goldman&#8217;s global economics research at the
time. He was running that team, along with the firm&#8217;s strategy
and commodity research coverage, when he was named chairman of
its asset-management unit last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The N-11 countries are Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Korea, Turkey
and Vietnam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Share prices are higher this year in every country except
Vietnam, where the VN-Index has dropped 9.2 percent. The best
performers among local benchmarks include Bangladesh&#8217;s Dhaka
Stock Exchange General Index, up 50 percent, and Indonesia&#8217;s
Jakarta Composite Index, up 28 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The odds that Japan will intervene
in the currency market have doubled even after the election loss
of a prime minister candidate calling for such action to weaken
the yen, JPMorgan Chase  Co. says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Naoto Kan yesterday defeated a leadership
challenge from party rival Ichiro Ozawa, who pledged
intervention for the first time in six years to support
exporters. Kan hasn&#8217;t called specifically for yen sales, instead
saying last week that he is ready to act as needed to curb the
currency&#8217;s 11 percent surge against the dollar since mid-May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Politically, it&#8217;s more stable than before the party
election and that may make it easier&#8221; to conduct intervention,
said Tohru Sasaki, head of Japan rates and foreign-exchange
research in Tokyo at JPMorgan. Sasaki, who is a former head
currency trader at Japan&#8217;s central bank, figures the odds of
intervention have doubled to 30 percent after the Democratic
Party of Japan election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Japanese currency appreciated yesterday to a 15-year
high against the dollar, threatening an economic recovery
powered mostly by growing exports. The government yesterday
revised its July industrial output figures to show that output
fell rather than increased from a month earlier, as corporate
leaders express concerns about the outlook for overseas sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yen gained for a second day yesterday in Tokyo on
speculation that Kan&#8217;s election had diminished the odds of
intervention, trading at 83.30 as of 6:44 p.m. in Tokyo. Japan&#8217;s
benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average slipped 0.2 percent to
9,299.31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little Choice &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Kan had refrained from Ozawa&#8217;s specific endorsement
of yen sales, there may be little choice, said Masafumi Yamamoto,
chief currency strategist at Barclays Bank Plc in Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The likelihood for intervention is rising,&#8221; Yamamoto, who
also used to work at the Bank of Japan, wrote in a report two
days ago. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see any other measure to address deflation
and a slowing economy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said last week
that the government has about 32 trillion yen ($384 billion) in
unrealized losses in its foreign-exchange account, used to fund
intervention. Japan last sold yen in March 2004, when it was
around 109 per dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yamamoto calculated that Japan has about 35 trillion
available for intervention during the year through March, about
equivalent to the amount it used between January 2003 and March
2004 to weaken the yen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies Complain &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top business executives have been calling for government
action to stem the yen&#8217;s rise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We want verbal or actual intervention if the yen
appreciates more than the current level,&#8221; Hiromasa Yonekura,
head of Japan&#8217;s Keidanren business lobby, said at a Sept. 13
press conference. &#8220;Rapid change should be managed,&#8221; Hiroaki Nakanishi, president of Hitachi Ltd., said this week in Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some analysts have said that official action by Japan might
not weaken the yen for long unless it&#8217;s conducted together with
overseas authorities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kan said last week in a debate with Ozawa that getting
international cooperation to halt the yen&#8217;s rise is
&#8220;difficult.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I see little chance of Japan conducting intervention,&#8221;
said Hiromichi Shirakawa, chief Japan economist at Credit Suisse
Group AG in Tokyo. &#8220;Intervention will increase Japan&#8217;s debt and
could cause conflicts with the U.S., while having little impact
on the market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geithner Comments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner declined to
comment about the prospects for currency intervention in an
interview last week, instead saying that Japanese officials
should do what they can to help their economy grow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re working through some difficult problems,&#8221;
Geithner said on Bloomberg Television. &#8220;My view is they should
be focusing like we are on how to make sure they&#8217;re reinforcing
recovery in Japan and doing things that are going to help.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Switzerland, which has also seen a rising currency spark
concern about exports, the central bank in June halted a 15-
month policy of countering what it called &#8220;excessive&#8221; gains in
the franc. The franc sales were &#8220;of no use&#8221; and largely served
to accommodate speculators, the bank&#8217;s former chief economist,
Ulrich Kohli, was quoted as saying by the Sonntag newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa told Cabinet
ministers last week that the effect of the yen&#8217;s gains is large
and international discussion on currencies is important. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If there is no intervention in the next two weeks, my odd
will drop to 15 percent again,&#8221; JPMorgan&#8217;s Sasaki said. &#8220;If
you step back, you will realize that it&#8217;s almost impossible to
control massive currency markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new round of monetary easing by
the Federal Reserve would probably provide a mild boost to the
economy, said Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re talking about a moderate impact,&#8221; Hatzius said
today in a conference call, discussing the effect should the Fed
stage a new round of bond purchases, a policy known as
quantitative easing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It would be significant enough from the perspective of
economic forecasters but wouldn&#8217;t really be enough to make the
difference between an economic outlook that is deeply negative
to extremely positive,&#8221; Hatzius said. A total of $1 trillion in
bond purchases would improve stability in financial markets and
increase real GDP by 0.3 percentage point to 0.4 percentage
point, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. economy grew at a 1.6 percent annual rate in the
second quarter, hampered by an unemployment rate that has stayed
above 9 percent all year. Fed presidents Jeffrey Lacker of
Richmond, Richard Fisher of Dallas and Thomas Hoenig of Kansas
City have voiced opposition to more Fed action. Policy makers
plan to meet in Washington on Sept. 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional Fed purchases of bonds would prove less
beneficial because financial markets are under less stress than
during 2008 and 2009, Hatzius said. &#8220;The next round of asset
purchases, if there is such a next round, would have a somewhat
smaller effect on broad financial conditions,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Fed officials engage in further easing, Hatzius said,
they may announce their purchases in increments, rather than
announcing a large &#8220;shock and awe&#8221; sum. &#8220;I now think there is
more thought given to a more gradual option as well,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hatzius said he doesn&#8217;t expect the Federal Open Market
Committee to ease further at their meeting next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think that&#8217;s fairly unlikely,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hatzius forecasts a slowing recovery, saying &#8220;that support
from fiscal policy is going to start turning into a drag.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;House prices in our view are likely to renew their
decline over the next year,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nichia Corp., the closely held
Japanese lighting company that was sued for patent infringement
by the inventor of the blue LED light, has itself sued a maker
of hand tools for patent infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both cases, the suits relate to patents for LED lights.
Nichia was sued in 2001 by Shuji Nakamura, now a professor at
the University of California, Santa Barbara, who claimed the
company owed him for the technology he developed when employed
there. That case was settled in January 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new case, Nichia claims Wilmar Corp. of Renton,
Washington, produces products that infringe four patents. In
dispute are patents 5,998,925, 7,531,960, 5,652,434, and
6,093,065. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nichia claims the Wilmar devices contain infringing LEDs,
and that it will be &#8220;irreparably harmed&#8221; if the court doesn&#8217;t
order the Washington company to quit its infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the Japanese company asked for money damages,
a court determination that the infringement is deliberate, and a
tripling of the damages as a result. Nichia also asked for
awards of attorney fees, and litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nichia is represented by Kenneth E. Krosin and Michael D.
Kaminski of Milwaukee&#8217;s Foley  Lardner, and Otis W. Carroll and
Collin M. Maloney of Tyler, Texas-based Ireland Carroll  Kelley
PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Nichia Corp. v. Wilmar Corp. 2:10-cv-00358,
U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas (Marshall). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Medical&#8217;s Infringement Suit Against Biolitec Revived &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Medical Systems Holdings Inc.&#8217;s patent-
infringement lawsuit against Biolitec AG over a method of laser
treatment for enlarged prostates was revived by a U.S. appeals
court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trial judge erred in his interpretation when he ruled
last year that Biolitec didn&#8217;t infringe the patent, the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington said
yesterday. The court sent the case back for further proceedings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Medical sued Biolitec in 2007, accusing the
company of violating a patent on a method and system of using
lasers to vaporize prostate tissue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The invention is used to treat benign prostatic
hyperplasia, known as enlarged prostate, which affects as many
as 50 percent of males over the age of 50, according to the
journal Urology Today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Medical&#8217;s technology is covered by patent
6,986,764, which was issued in January 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tony Bihl, chief executive officer of Minnetonka,
Minnesota-based American Medical, didn&#8217;t immediately return
voice-mail and e-mail messages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biolitec, based in Jena, Germany, makes surgical and
cosmetic lasers and disposable medical supplies for urology and
skin care. A spokesman for Biolitec had no immediate comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Medical&#8217;s case was argued by Leland G. Hansen of
Chicago&#8217;s McAndrews, Held  Malloy Ltd. Biolitic&#8217;s argument was
presented by Mark Dunn Giarratana of Newark, New Jersey&#8217;s
McCarter  English LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is American Medical Systems Inc. v. Biolitec Inc.,
2009-1323, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal (Washington).
The lower court case is American Medical Systems Inc. v.
Biolitec Inc., 07-30109, U.S. District Court, District of
Massachusetts (Springfield). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;The Patent Office&#8217; in Google Search Results Is Not USPTO &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first ad that comes to the top of the queue in a Google
search for &#8220;patent&#8221; brings up &#8220;The Patent Office.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&#8217;t the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Instead,
it&#8217;s a Burbank, California-based law firm, according to the
website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the WHOIS database of domain-name
registrations, ThePatentOffice.com domain is owned by Italia IP
Inc., which has the same address as The Patent Office. Italia
IP&#8217;s website lists James A. Italia as principal attorney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italia practiced at Los Angeles-based Manatt, Phelps 
Phillips LLP for three years, and is a former research scientist
at the Salk Institute, National Genetics Institute and the
University of Chicago, according to his biography on the Italia
IP website. He has a law degree from Southwestern University and
undergraduate degrees in biochemistry and cell biology from the
University of California at San Diego. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft to Probe Efforts to Combat Software Piracy in Russia &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. said it will investigate a report that
efforts to combat piracy of its software in Russia resulted in
the harassment of non-governmental agencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We unequivocally abhor any attempt to leverage
intellectual property rights to stifle political advocacy or
pursue improper personal gain,&#8221; Microsoft General Counsel Brad
Smith wrote in a blog posting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith said that Microsoft will take other steps to ensure
that NGOs and other groups that act as public advocates aren&#8217;t
mistreated amid anti-piracy efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One possibility he mentioned is expanding the company&#8217;s
existing software donation program for non-governmental
organizations &#8220;to protect human rights groups and journalists
from unwarranted piracy accusations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He mentioned there are those who &#8220;are fraudulently
pretending to act on our behalf in order to extort organizations
with threats of piracy charges.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will create a &#8220;new unilateral software license
for NGOS&#8221; to ensure they have free, legal copies of the
Microsoft products, Smith said. The license will also be made
available to &#8220;appropriate journalists&#8217; organizations&#8221; to
include small newspapers and independent media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By making the new license available Microsoft will
&#8220;effectively change the factual situation at hand&#8221; in Russia,
Smith said. The company will create a list of its authorized
counsel and place it online &#8220;so that anyone can review this and
readily check someone&#8217;s claim that they represent Microsoft.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hershey Faces $12 Million Demand in &#8216;iMilk&#8217; Copyright Dispute &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hershey Co., which asked a federal court to declare it
isn&#8217;t infringing the copyright for an application for Apple
Inc.&#8217;s iPhone, faces a demand by the application&#8217;s developer for
more than $12 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hottrix LLC of Las Vegas made the demand in a Sept. 13
court filing. Hottrix claimed it developed an application in
August 2007 that showed a video of a beverage &#8220;magically rising
inside a glass that constituted the full screen of the video.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app, named &#8220;iMilk,&#8221; was initially made available for
downloading for $2.99 a copy on the www.hottrixdownload.com
website. In July 2008 a new version for use on the iPhone was
published. The app is sold in Apple Inc.&#8217;s App Store, according
to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hershey approached Hottrix about licensing the app in
August 2008, with a modification to show the addition of
Hershey&#8217;s chocolate syrup, Hottrix said in its filing. Hottrix
refused, and Hershey then &#8220;copied, created, and offered for
copying and downloading&#8221; its &#8220;Hershey&#8217;s Chocolate Milk&#8221; app,
according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hottrix claims the chocolate-maker&#8217;s application is both a
copy and a derivative work, with &#8220;functionality and a &#8216;look and
feel&#8221; that is too similar to its own app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Hottrix uses its app as a source of revenue,
Hershey&#8217;s used its app &#8220;as a marketing tool,&#8221; according to
court papers. As the Hershey&#8217;s app gained in popularity, the
iMilk app decreased &#8220;because end-users could get ostensibly the
same application without the direct cost of paying $2.99,&#8221;
Hottrix claimed in its filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case was initially filed in federal court in
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, June 2, with the chocolate-maker
seeking only attorney fees and litigation costs, in addition to
a declaration of non-infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its Sept. 13 filing, Hottrix asked the court to order
Hershey to quit producing and permitting the downloading of its
chocolate milk app. The Nevada company asked for awards of
attorney fees, litigation costs and damages &#8220;in an amount in
excess of $12,360,000.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also seeks additional damages to punish Hershey for what
it says are actions &#8220;carried out willfully, wantonly,
maliciously, and in continuous disregard for the rights of
Hottrix.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hershey is represented by Harvey Freedenberg of
Harrisburg&#8217;s McNees, Wallace  Nurick LLC, and Paul C. Llewellyn
and Thomas A. Smart of New York&#8217;s Kaye Scholer LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hottrix is represented by Jason H. Fisher of the Fisher Law
Group of Los Angeles, and Robert J. Tribeck and Todd J. Schill
of Harrisburg&#8217;s Rhoads  Sinon LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an earlier case, Hottrix sued Molson Coors Brewing Co.
in federal court in Los Angeles in October 2008 claiming the
brewer&#8217;s iPint app infringed its iBeer app. That case settled
for undisclosed terms in March 2009, according to Bloomberg
data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That case was Hottrix LLC v. Molson Coors Brewing Co.,
2:08-cv-06695-PSG-SS, U.S. District Court, Central District of
California (Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chocolate milk app case is Hershey Co., v. Hottrix LLC,
1:10-cv-01178-JEJ, U.S. District Court, Middle District of
Pennsylvania (Harrisburg). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Enercon Loses Court Appeal Against BP in Bid for EU Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enercon GmbH, a German wind-turbine manufacturer, lost a
court challenge against BP Plc to gain European Union-wide
trademark rights to the Enercon name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enercon has since 2003 sought the EU-wide trademark for the
name Enercon, to use on products such as chemicals, paints,
industrial oils and fuels. London-based BP successfully opposed
the application, based on its &#8220;Energol&#8221; trademark used for
similar products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU&#8217;s General court found a &#8220;likelihood of confusion
between the marks,&#8221; and dismissed the challenge yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier, the 27-nation EU&#8217;s trademark agency in 2008 had
decided the two words, and the products they were used for, were
too similar, creating a &#8220;likelihood of confusion.&#8221; The agency
upheld BP&#8217;s challenge to Enercon&#8217;s getting the EU-wide
trademark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s case is T-400/08, Enercon v OHMI - BP
(ENERCON). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trademark Application Hints Where Erotic Services Ads Will Go &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sexually-oriented services Craigslist said it will no
longer carry may be migrating to a site operated by a Nevada
company, if a pending U.S. trademark application is any
indication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADT Search Media Inc. of Las Vegas filed two applications
to register the term &#8220;adult search,&#8221; according to the database
of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the two applications is for the use of the mark with
advertising and directory services, and producing a &#8220;searchable
website featuring the goods and services of other vendors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two applications were filed in February 2006 on ADT&#8217;s
behalf by Ira David of the Morishita Law Firm LLC of Las Vegas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When accessed yesterday, the www.adultsearch.com website
displayed a wide range of erotic services for users in the U.S.,
Canada and three Asian countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a website operated by Advanced Interactive
Media Group LLC of Altamonte Springs, Florida, AdultSearch.com
has been running ads inviting former Craigslist advertisers to
post ads on the new website. San Francisco-based backpage.com,
which has a Web page layout comparable to that of Craigslist,
lists ads for a variety of erotic services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A search yesterday of the Craigslist website for &#8220;erotic
sites&#8221; yielded a &#8220;page not found&#8221; notice. A search for
&#8220;adult services&#8221; yielded only one ad, for a French-language
tutor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EBay Wins Court Ruling Rejecting Tiffany&#8217;s Ad Claim &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EBay Inc., the most-visited U.S. e-commerce site, won a
judge&#8217;s ruling tossing out a false-advertising claim by Tiffany
 Co., the second time in two years that the online auctioneer
has prevailed in its lawsuit against the New York-based luxury
jewelry retailer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiffany sued in 2004 over the sale of counterfeit jewelry
on EBay&#8217;s website. U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan in New
York ruled in EBay&#8217;s favor in 2008, rejecting trademark
infringement and false-advertising claims. An appeals court in
April upheld most of the judge&#8217;s ruling while reinstating a
single false-advertising claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sullivan dismissed the claim yesterday, saying &#8220;there is
no extrinsic evidence indicating that the challenged
advertisements were misleading or confusing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EBay, based in San Jose, California, owner of the PayPal
payment service, on July 21 reported second-quarter profit that
topped analysts&#8217; estimates while predicting that a foreign-
currency slump would eat into overseas sales this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Aaron, a spokesman for New York-based Tiffany, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EBay was represented by Bruce S. Meyer and Robert Bruce
Rich of New York&#8217;s Weil Gotshal  Manges LLP. Tiffany was
represented by James B. Swire and Randall K. Miller of
Washington&#8217;s Arnold  Porter LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Tiffany v. EBay, 04-cv-4607, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Clarissa Batino" date="Sep 14, 2010  4:30 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-14/philippines-to-invite-jpmorgan-goldman-sachs-to-invest-in-infrastructure.html"><headline>Philippines Invites JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs to Invest in Ports, Railways</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The Philippines is inviting foreign
investors including JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. to help the nation build roads, ports and railways, Finance
Secretary Cesar Purisima said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re talking to a lot of big names overseas, those with
large amounts of capital and it&#8217;s a long list,&#8221; Purisima told
reporters today in Manila. None of the companies have made any
commitments yet, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Benigno Aquino&#8217;s government is planning to build
200 billion pesos ($4.5 billion) worth of infrastructure to
achieve the fastest economic growth in three decades by 2011
while narrowing the budget deficit from a record 325 billion
pesos. Ten of the public works projects are set to be outlined
next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the infrastructure program &#8220;will probably take
Aquino&#8217;s entire term to complete,&#8221; the rhetoric around it
benefits Philippine assets, said Radhika Rao, an economist at
Forecast Pte in Singapore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aquino, who took office in June, will make his first
foreign visit as president to the U.S. this month to court
investors. The trip comes after $1 billion of peso bonds sold
overseas for the first time drew bids for more than 13 times the
amount on offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When you look around the country, our infrastructure is
really wanting, from airports to the roads to power,&#8221; Purisima
said. Companies in the U.S. have a trillion dollars of
investable assets, he said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Engine of Investment&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth in the $160 billion economy has been driven by
consumption and it is now important to &#8220;start the engine of
investment,&#8221; Purisima said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 30 percent gain in the Philippine Stock Exchange Index
so far this year may help, Aquino said in a speech at the
exchange today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The impressive performance of the capital market usually
heralds the coming of more foreign direct investments,&#8221; Aquino
said. &#8220;That is what I hope to achieve in my forthcoming trip to
the United States.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock index fell from a record, losing 0.1 percent to
3,968.29 at the close in Manila. Yields on Philippine benchmark
four-year bonds fell last week to the lowest level since the
debt started trading in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peso has gained about 4.5 percent this year and was
trading at 44.23 per dollar at 3:02 p.m. local time. It will
advance 10 percent to 40 per dollar in the next 12 months,
Barclays Plc said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Philippines plans to start offering public works
projects to investors by the third week of October, Purisima
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nation has run budget deficits in 21 of the past 25
years, limiting government infrastructure spending to below the
level of 5 percent of gross domestic product recommended by the
World Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors will focus more closely on the deficit next year
to see how much progress the government is making on curbing it,
Rao said. &#8220;They have to walk the talk,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. is joining five companies, including Citigroup Inc. and ATT
Inc., to create a website that streamlines applications by small
businesses seeking to become suppliers to the group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site will offer one electronic form to be filled out by
potential suppliers to contact all six companies, Armonk, New
York-based IBM and the other five said today in a joint
statement. Participants in the program also include Bank of
America Corp., Pfizer Inc. and United Parcel Service Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small businesses often increase sales and employees when
they begin supplying large corporations, which could boost the
economy, Jonathan Bowles, director of the Center for an Urban
Future, said in the statement. Convoluted application processes
can inhibit small suppliers, which don&#8217;t have a lot of resources
or manpower, said Alison Bates Fisher, an event designer at Main
Events Catering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t have the time,&#8221; said Fisher, who helps her
Arlington, Virginia-based company host marketing events and
executive board meetings for corporations such as PNC Financial
Services Group Inc. &#8220;Having an easier way to get to these large
clients saves me time, which gives me more time to get other
business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The six corporate members of the site award about $150
billion in contracts for supplies annually, IBM said. As the
program grows, more corporations are expected to join. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site, called Supplier Connection, is scheduled to start
in the first quarter of next year. IBM will create and maintain
the site with a grant of more than $10 million from its
foundation. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Bob Van Voris and Christine Harper" date="Sep 15, 2010  4:22 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-15/goldman-sachs-sued-by-three-women-over-alleged-gender-discrimination.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Sued Over Alleged Gender Discrimination</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was sued
by three former female employees who claim they faced
discrimination in pay and fewer opportunities for promotion than
men at the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The violations of its female employees&#8217; rights are
systemic, are based upon companywide policies and practices, and
are the result of unchecked gender bias that pervades Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s corporate culture,&#8221; the women said today in a complaint
in federal court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs, H. Cristina Chen-Oster, 39, a former vice
president; Lisa Parisi, 48, a former managing director; and
Shanna Orlich, 30, a former associate, seek class-action status
to represent all female Goldman Sachs employees with those job
titles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The women seek unspecified damages and a court order
requiring Goldman Sachs to remedy the &#8220;systemic sex
discrimination&#8221; at the firm, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe this suit is without merit,&#8221; said Lucas van Praag, a Goldman spokesman. &#8220;People are critical to our
business, and we make extraordinary efforts to recruit, develop
and retain outstanding women professionals.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chen-Oster is currently a managing director in sales at
Deutsche Bank AG in New York, where she&#8217;s worked since 2006. A
spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fewer Women &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint, the proportion of women among
Goldman Sachs managers decreases as their job level increases.
The women claim that, according to figures published by Goldman
Sachs in 2009, women constituted 29 percent of vice presidents
and 17 percent of managing directors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to 2008 figures, women represented 14 percent of
partners, the plaintiffs claimed. Four members of the 30-person
management committee are women, and just one of nine executive
officers, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Goldman Sachs ceased to be a partnership when the
firm became a public company in 1999, it has retained the term
&#8220;partner&#8221; to denote the prestige of its highest-ranking
managing directors. Partners also receive part of a pool of
compensation that&#8217;s specially designated for them, frequently in
the form of restricted stock awards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs claim that Goldman Sachs gives its managers,
most of whom are men, &#8220;unchecked discretion&#8221; over assigning
responsibilities to their subordinates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biased System &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint also says that Goldman Sachs&#8217;s system for
evaluating employee performance is biased against women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Men at Goldman Sachs are viewed more favorably, receive
more compensation, and are more likely to be promoted,&#8221; the ex-
Goldman Sachs employees claimed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former employees are seeking to represent an
unspecified number of female associates, vice presidents and
managing directors who worked for Goldman Sachs at any time from
Sept. 10, 2004, through the resolution of their federal
discrimination claims and from July 7, 2002, for claims under
New York state law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chen-Oster claimed she told her supervisor in 1999 about an
incident that took place in 1997 at a firm-sponsored dinner for
a male employee who had been promoted to managing director.
After the outing, which included a stop at a Manhattan topless
bar, a male colleague pinned Chen-Oster against a wall outside
her apartment, kissing and groping her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chen-Oster claimed that, after reporting the incident, she
was subjected to increased hostility and found herself
marginalized at the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Golf Outing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While Chen-Oster&#8217;s career growth stagnated, the male
colleague involved in the 1997 incident was promoted to managing
director and finally partner,&#8221; according to the complaint.
&#8220;Over the same period, he saw his compensation increase by more
than 400 percent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orlich claimed she was treated differently from male
employees and denied the opportunity to work as a trader. She
claims she and other women were shut out of work-related social
events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orlich said she learned of a golf outing attended by 80
Goldman Sachs employees, only one of whom was a woman. Orlich,
who said she has played golf since childhood and competed on her
high school varsity golf team, wasn&#8217;t invited while several less
senior male analysts attended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orlich also claimed she was assigned clerical and
administrative work that male associates didn&#8217;t have to do. A
senior male analyst &#8220;often gave her demeaning and menial
assignments, such as setting up his blackberry, making
photocopies, and answering calls from his wife,&#8221; according to
the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chen-Oster filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission and received a notice of right to sue.
The other two plaintiffs have also asked for right-to-sue
notices from the EEOC, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Wall Street firms, including Morgan Stanley and
Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s Smith Barney brokerage unit, have settled sex-
discrimination lawsuits in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2004 Morgan Stanley agreed to pay $54 million to settle
a suit brought by former bond saleswoman, Allison Schieffelin,
and the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
Schieffelin was represented by Outten  Golden LLP, one of the
firms representing the plaintiff in the case against Goldman
Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs in March was sued for bias by a former vice
president who said she was pushed onto the &#8220;mommy-track&#8221; and
eventually fired after she chose to work part-time following her
pregnancy. That lawsuit, which alleged violations of the U.S.
Family Medical Leave Act, gender and pregnancy discrimination,
was filed in Manhattan federal court and is pending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Chen-Oster v. Goldman Sachs  Co., 10-cv-6950,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. released a new
version of its Internet Explorer Web browser today, aiming to
stem market-share losses to Firefox, Google Inc.&#8217;s Chrome and
Apple Inc.&#8217;s Safari. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, marked the public
release of a test version of Internet Explorer 9 at an event in
San Francisco. The software offers support for HTML 5 technology
and loads pages faster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet Explorer&#8217;s share of the browser market has fallen
to 60 percent from 74 percent about two years earlier, as
Firefox, Chrome and Safari gain ground, according to Net
Applications. With Chrome usage up sevenfold, Microsoft needs to
ensure that users keep their focus on the Windows operating
system, rather than run programs through Google&#8217;s browser, said
Matt Rosoff, an analyst at Directions on Microsoft, a research
firm in Kirkland, Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Based on developer buzz, it seems tech enthusiasts are
more excited about IE 9 than any version of IE in recent times,&#8221;
Rosoff said. &#8220;We might start to see IE regain some market share
from Firefox,&#8221; whose growth has slowed, he said. &#8220;Chrome still
seems to be the one people are most interested in, in terms of
the cutting edge.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market share for Firefox, made by Mozilla Corp., rose to 23
percent last month from 19 percent about two years earlier,
according to Net Applications, which tracks Internet usage
statistics. Chrome jumped to 7.5 percent from 1.1 percent, and
Safari climbed to 5.2 percent from 2.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Features &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker, had as much
as 97 percent of the Internet-browser market as recently as
2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet Explorer&#8217;s HTML 5 support delivers high-quality
video playback faster and lets users do things like open a
virtual book and flip through its pages. The set of technologies
may eventually replace Adobe Systems Inc.&#8217;s Flash and
Microsoft&#8217;s competing Silverlight, Rosoff said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the event, the company showed how its Bing search engine
can take advantage of the new browser to put video images on the
home page and let users zoom in to images on the home page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new browser also is faster at loading and running
applications written in JavaScript, an area where IE 8 was far
slower than Chrome, Rosoff said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft rose 9 cents to $25.12 at 4 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have dropped 18 percent
this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s first sale of yen since
2004 to curb gains that threaten an export-led recovery is
likely to succeed, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;big splash&#8221; intervention, which was highly visible
and quickly confirmed by the Finance Ministry, should help the
currency weaken to 90 per dollar in a year, wrote Thomas Stolper, senior global markets economist at Goldman Sachs in
London, in a research note to clients today. The yen may still
appreciate over the next six months to a record 79 against the
dollar, encouraging Japan to sell more of its currency,
according to Stolper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Over the next six months the impact of the U.S.
quantitative easing, persistent trade surpluses and the
attraction of testing the authorities&#8217; resolve to intervene
again could result in marginal new lows below 79,&#8221; wrote
Stolper, referring to the dollar versus the yen. &#8220;During that
period more interventions are likely. The chances of the &#8216;big
splash&#8217; interventions eventually succeeding are quite high.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yen tumbled from a 15-year high versus the dollar,
sliding the most in almost two years, after Japan&#8217;s Finance
Minister Yoshihiko Noda said the nation unilaterally sold the
currency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move came a day after Prime Minister Naoto Kan won re-
election as head of the ruling party, beating a candidate who
had insisted intervention was necessary. Traders speculated that
Japanese banks in New York were buying dollars on behalf of the
central bank to continue intervention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yen slid as much as 3.2 percent to 85.78 per dollar in
the biggest intraday drop since October 2008. It earlier traded
at 82.88, the strongest level since May 1995. The yen rallied to
a record 79.75 in April 1995. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimates for Japan&#8217;s intervention in the currency market
range from $1.2 billion, cited by the Nikkei newspaper, to the
$20 billion forecast of BNP Paribas SA. Hidetoshi Yanagihara, a
senior currency trader at Mizuho Financial Group Inc. in New
York, estimated intervention of $10 billion, or about 856
billion yen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., whose website
failed today for the second time this week, will refund late
fees and help fix other problems for the 16.6 million online
customers unable to access their accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will work with customers on any issues that occurred,
including late fees,&#8221; Tom Kelly, a spokesman for the New York-
based bank, said in an e-mail. The site went down late Sept. 13
and service was restored around 1 a.m. New York time today. The
system failed again several hours later and was back online by
this afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem was a software glitch and customers&#8217; accounts
weren&#8217;t at risk, Christine Holevas, a company spokeswoman, said
in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s primary regulator in Washington was on alert
after the service initially failed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We monitored this situation very closely,&#8221; said Bob Garsson, a spokesman for the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency, declining to elaborate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s active online customers have increased by an
average annual rate of 42 percent since 2006, according to a
presentation to investors by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon
yesterday. More than 3.7 million households use JPMorgan&#8217;s
website to pay their bills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visit a Branch &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Online customers should contact Chase telephone banking
at 800-935-9935 or visit a branch to correct late fees that were
incurred during the outage,&#8221; Holevas said in an e-mail.
JPMorgan will also refund late fees charged by other
institutions, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The length of the outage raises operational risk and
internal control issues for the bank, which was the only major
Wall Street firm to make it through the financial crisis without
posting quarterly losses, said Christopher Whalen, a former
analyst for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and co-founder
of Institutional Risk Analytics in Torrance, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These systems are big and complex, but they should have
redundancy to take the &#8216;A&#8217; system offline if need be for hours
at least,&#8221; Whalen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon apologized for the inconvenience during his
presentation at Barclays Capital yesterday, saying, &#8220;I know our
system is down today. I apologize for that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. plans to shut a

maintenance early next year, two people with knowledge of the
work said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The halt is scheduled to start in the first quarter and
last about four weeks, the people said, declining to be

powerformer, which makes blending components for gasoline, will
also be idled for repairs during the same time, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emma Heywood, a U.K.-based spokeswoman for Exxon, declined
to comment. Fawley has three crude units, a local environmental
officer said yesterday by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery can process about 320,000 barrels of oil a day
and supplies 15 percent of Britain&#8217;s petroleum products,
according to the country&#8217;s Petroleum Industry Association.
Refiners regularly halt equipment for inspections and repairs to

&lt;p&gt;Verizon Wireless, the largest U.S.
mobile-phone carrier, won&#8217;t sell handsets with Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s
Windows Phone 7 operating system when it debuts this year, a
blow to the software maker&#8217;s efforts to reach a broad market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon Wireless won&#8217;t offer a device at the planned fall
introduction or at any point this year, Brenda Raney, a Verizon
spokeswoman, said today in an interview. The carrier plans to
support the new operating system and will probably release a
phone in 2011, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft overhauled its mobile-phone operating system to
stem market-share losses to Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPhone and phones with
Google Inc.&#8217;s Android software. Although support from carriers
early on helps attract consumers, the success of the iPhone
shows that a product can be popular without Verizon, said
Michael Gartenberg, an analyst with San Mateo, California-based
technology research firm Altimeter Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The more carriers and the more devices they can bring
early on, the more chance they have for mainstream success, but
not having Verizon will not make or break it,&#8221; Gartenberg said.
&#8220;Look at the iPhone -- you don&#8217;t need Verizon to be successful
in the U.S. in mobile. On the other hand, it would be good for
Microsoft to count Verizon in as a named partner early on.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Verizon&#8217;s most recent mobile collaboration on
Microsoft&#8217;s Kin phone ended when the software maker pulled the
phone after two months due to disappointing sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relationship &#8216;Solid&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our relationship with Microsoft is solid,&#8221; Raney said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft declined to say which carriers would bring out
the phones and when. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Together with our hardware and mobile operator partners,
we look forward to bringing Window Phone 7 to market this
holiday,&#8221; Greg Sullivan, a senior product manager at Microsoft,
said in a statement. &#8220;Verizon continues to be a key Windows
Phone partner going forward.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft rose 22 cents to $25.33 at 4 p.m. New York time
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Verizon Wireless parent Verizon
Communications Inc., based in New York, gained 23 cents to
$31.42 on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon&#8217;s introduction of several phones running on Android
helped the carrier beat analysts&#8217; estimates last quarter and
forecast rising profit for the rest of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, Microsoft stopped work on the Kin social-
networking phone. The phone had been on sale for less than two
months and a price cut by Verizon failed to produce enough sales
to keep the product on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Carriers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said in February that U.S. carriers such as ATT
Inc., Verizon, T-Mobile USA and Sprint Nextel Corp. would
support the new phones. The company didn&#8217;t specify when. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Siegel, a spokesman for Dallas-based ATT, and Cristi
Allen, a spokeswoman for Overland Park, Kansas-based Sprint,
both said the companies plan to sell phones with the new
operating system and also declined to say when. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s share in the global mobile-phone market fell to
5 percent in the second quarter, from 9.3 percent a year
earlier, according to market research firm Gartner Inc. Android
climbed to 17 percent from 1.8 percent, while the iPhone rose to
14 percent from 13 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With spending on smartphones and other devices replacing
some personal computer purchases, a market Microsoft dominates,
the company needs to do better in phones, according to Al Hilwa,
an analyst at market research firm IDC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s crucial for them to be relevant in this space,&#8221;
Hilwa said. &#8220;If you look at people spending more on devices, 5
to 10 years from now Microsoft could be king of completely the
wrong hill. They get that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alert the antitrust police.
Microsoft Corp. is back to doing what it was accused of years
ago: taking advantage of its dominant position in personal
computers to benefit its Web browser. It&#8217;s blatant. And it&#8217;s
terrific. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet Explorer 9, available in beta, or test, form this
week, is the best browser Microsoft has ever produced. If that
isn&#8217;t saying much, this says more: It may turn out to be the
best browser for Windows computers that anyone has produced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&#8217;s saying quite a lot, given the proliferation of
top-notch browsers that have eaten into Explorer&#8217;s dominance in
recent years: Mozilla Corp.&#8217;s Firefox, Google Inc.&#8217;s Chrome, and
even the Windows version of Apple Inc.&#8217;s Safari. Indeed, it&#8217;s a
mark of how much the digital world has changed that nary a
regulator&#8217;s eyebrow was raised by aspects of the new Internet
Explorer that might have set off alarm bells a decade ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IE9 isn&#8217;t for everyone; in fact, it isn&#8217;t even for every
Windows user. The browser, which is available as a free
download, doesn&#8217;t work with Windows XP, the 9-year-old operating
system that remains the most widely used version; it is
compatible only with the more recent Vista and Windows 7
flavors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particularly with Windows 7, the new browser blurs the
distinction between Web content and applications that run on
your PC. You can now pin website icons to the Windows task bar,
where they look and act just like the programs installed on your
local hard drive, even down to the right-mouse-click that opens
a menu of things you can do on the site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topping Rivals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new software also goes well beyond its competitors in
taking advantage of the hardware inside your computer. By and
large, most browsers tap very little of a machine&#8217;s raw
computing power, such as the potent graphics chips found in
modern PCs. Developers writing software to run on many different
operating systems aren&#8217;t that interested in optimizing it for
just one platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, though, has no such qualms. It junked the Mac
version of Explorer years ago, and with IE9 it takes full
advantage of its Windows-only focus by using the PC&#8217;s hardware
to provide a speed boost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a lot of other factors besides the browser affect how
fast the Web feels to you. First and foremost is the quality of
your Internet connection itself. The design of the site you&#8217;re
visiting has an impact as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noticeably Faster &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the browser is an important piece of the experience,
and IE9 is demonstrably faster than its predecessor. The
difference is most noticeable on websites that are heavy on
graphics or animation. With this browser, Microsoft is also
embracing HTML5, the same online-graphics standard that Apple&#8217;s
Steve Jobs has been touting as a faster, better alternative to
Adobe Systems Inc.&#8217;s Flash software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft even extends its quest for speed to the length of
time it takes to launch Explorer. If you have a third-party
toolbar installed -- say, the one from Microsoft&#8217;s arch-nemesis
Google -- IE9 will tell you just how much it&#8217;s adding to your
start-up time, and encourage you to disable it. If you still
want to conduct searches directly from the browser, don&#8217;t fear:
Explorer now lets you type a search term right into the address
bar, a feature Chrome has had for some time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visually, the new browser is almost minimalist. Microsoft
has cut down considerably on the number of buttons and menus
visible by default. Messages and dialogue boxes that used to
appear in the middle of the browser window, disrupting content,
have moved to a less obtrusive bottom-of-the-screen location. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safety Screen &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IE9 also has a new download manager that shows your
progress in pulling content from the Internet and keeps track of
where on your hard drive the saved files are located, while a
new safety screen warns you of potential hazards and blocks
risky activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The net effect -- no pun intended -- of all Microsoft&#8217;s
changes is a browser that is thoroughly clean, fast and modern,
attributes that haven&#8217;t always been attached to Internet
Explorer. If the new software can also avoid the security lapses
that plagued some previous releases, Microsoft will be able to
claim that its No. 1 market share on PCs isn&#8217;t just because of
who makes it, but of how good it is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., trying to regain
lost share in the mobile-phone market, said its Windows Phone 7
devices will be able to play YouTube clips and Netflix movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phones will feature Google Inc.&#8217;s YouTube even though
they don&#8217;t support Adobe Systems Inc. Flash technology, Brandon Watson, a director for Windows Phone 7, said at an event
yesterday at Microsoft&#8217;s Redmond, Washington, headquarters.
Watson also demonstrated applications from Netflix Inc.,
OpenTable Inc., Travelocity.com Inc. and Flixster Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft revamped its mobile software amid share losses to
Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPhone and handsets with Google&#8217;s Android operating
system. Microsoft said in July it has provided financial
incentives including funds for software development and
marketing to attract app developers to help the company create
more compelling programs for its operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s share in the global mobile-phone market fell
to 5 percent in the second quarter, from 9.3 percent a year
earlier, according to market research firm Gartner Inc. Android
climbed to 17 percent from 1.8 percent while the iPhone rose to
14 percent from 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will release today the final version of a free
toolkit for application developers. The package includes copies
of Microsoft&#8217;s Visual Studio tools for mobile and a design
program called Expression Blend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Portugal may be slipping behind
Spain and Ireland in the dash to cut budget deficits, and credit
conditions in the economy are the tightest since the height of
the global financial crisis in 2008, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Spain and Ireland look to be tracking their fiscal
objectives for the year,&#8221; said David Mackie, chief European
economist at JPMorgan, in an e-mailed note. While Greece has
shown &#8220;some slippage,&#8221; in Portugal &#8220;the situation looks more
worrisome, with the lack of budgetary progress reflecting faster
expenditure growth than would be consistent with the fiscal
objective.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portugal, Spain and Ireland are trying to convince
investors they can avoid the fate of Greece, which was forced to
ask for a European Union-led bailout this year after its budget
deficit spiraled out of control. Michael Meister, a senior
member of German Chancellor Angela Merkel&#8217;s party, said Sept. 14
that Portugal must step up its efforts to overhaul its economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We need to signal to markets: don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;re tackling
our structural problems, and more input from Portugal would be
desirable,&#8221; Meister said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government minister Pedro Silva Pereira today reiterated
Portugal&#8217;s pledge to achieve its budget goals this year. &#8220;We
are able to honor our commitments,&#8221; he told a press conference
in Lisbon after the weekly Cabinet meeting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
proprietary traders who created a hedge fund within the firm in
2007 have generated a return of about 3 percent this year,
beating the industry average, people briefed on the gain said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Investment Partners, composed of former
employees of the principal-strategies team led by Raanan Agus
and Kenneth Eberts, manages more than $7 billion. The fund
gained about 26 percent last year, net of fees, after losing 
more than 18 percent in 2008, the people said. Andrea Raphael, 
a spokeswoman for New York-based Goldman Sachs, declined to 
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GSIP&#8217;s performance may help other members of the
proprietary trading group, Goldman Sachs Principal Strategies,
as they pursue work outside the firm. Pierre Henri Flamand, who
succeeded Agus in running principal-strategies, left in March
and is starting a hedge fund called Edoma Capital Partners LLP.
The team he left behind is being disbanded to comply with U.S.
rules aimed at curbing risk, two people with knowledge of the
decision said earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Sze, the Hong Kong-based partner who took charge of
principal-strategies after Flamand left, is considering raising
money for a new hedge fund focused on Asia, according to people
familiar with the matter. Perella Weinberg Partners LP and KKR 
Co. are among the firms that are in talks to hire members of the
U.S. principal-strategies group led by Bob Howard, two people
briefed on the negotiations said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dodd-Frank Act &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hedge fund industry posted an average return of 1.45
percent this year through August, 20 percent last year and lost
a record 19 percent in 2008, according to Chicago-based research
firm Hedge Fund Research Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Investment Partners started with about $7
billion, the biggest start-up in the hedge fund industry, and
had climbed to $7.5 billion as of October 2009. The company&#8217;s
investment in the fund accounted for about 35 percent of assets
as of October, according to fund marketing documents obtained by
Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund&#8217;s investments include stocks, credit, distressed
securities as well as hard-to-sell assets, the documents show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agus, 42, joined Goldman Sachs in 1993 in the equities
arbitrage group, co-ran the principal-strategies group and
became head of the group until 2007. Eberts, 43, had worked on
the equity derivatives desk from 1992 to 1998, when he moved to
the principal strategies group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which says about 10 percent of its revenue
comes from proprietary trading, is grappling with a provision of
the Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul act that prohibits banks from
risking capital by betting for their own accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Principal Strategies is housed within the
firm&#8217;s equities division and traces its roots to the risk
arbitrage team once led by Robert Rubin, 72, who later became
U.S. Treasury secretary. Alumni of the division who have left to
start their own hedge funds include Frank Brosens at Taconic
Capital Advisors LLC and Thomas Steyer at Farallon Capital
Management. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fair value estimate of Dubai
World&#8217;s loans was raised to 53-55 cents to the dollar from 44-46
cents at JPMorgan Chase  Co. after the state-owned holding
company reached an agreement with creditors on restructuring
$24.9 billion of debt last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estimate was raised because of tighter spreads, higher
estimated loan recoveries and shorter estimated maturity of the
restructured debt, analyst Zafar Nazim wrote in a report e-
mailed today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s plan to impose tougher
capital rules on banks will slow loan growth to a pace that more
closely matches economic expansion, according to Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A draft proposal by the banking regulator calls for banks
to add a capital adequacy ratio buffer of as much as 4 percent
to shield against economic swings, a person with knowledge of
the matter said yesterday. The new rules would boost the overall
minimum capital adequacy ratio for the largest lenders to as
high as 15 percent from 11.5 percent now, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the countercyclical capital buffer, if it is
implemented, will have a profound impact on bank lending growth
ahead,&#8221; Beijing-based Goldman Sachs analysts Ning Ma and
Richard Xu wrote in a note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The capital requirement would cut loan growth to 12 percent
to 16 percent, a rate that more closely tracks nominal gross
domestic product expansion, from 20 percent now as banks try to
avoid triggering the &#8220;countercyclical&#8221; buffer, Ma and Xu said.
China&#8217;s banks extended a record $1.4 trillion of new loans in
2009, fueling asset bubbles and concerns about bad debts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The China Banking Regulatory Commission said in a text
message today it doesn&#8217;t currently have any new requirements for
large banks&#8217; capital. The regulator didn&#8217;t say whether it plans
to change the requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common Equity Ratio &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. fell as much as 4.9 percent
in Hong Kong trading, the biggest intraday drop since its July
16 stock market listing. China Construction Bank Corp. declined
as much as 2.4 percent, the most since Aug. 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the draft proposal, Chinese banks would be required
to have common equity equal to at least 6 percent of risk-
weighted assets, the person said, declining to be identified as
no announcement has been made. The plan is subject to change as
the regulator is seeking feedback from lenders, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed rules also call for a Tier 1 capital ratio of
at least 8 percent, and a 10 percent capital adequacy ratio.
Banks deemed &#8220;systemically important&#8221; will have to comply by
2012, with the deadline set at 2016 for other lenders, the
person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming the &#8220;big banks&#8221; are systemically important and
the full 4 percent capital buffer is implemented, Chinese
lenders face a capital shortage of 484.2 billion yuan ($72
billion) next year and a deficit of about 2.8 trillion yuan in
2016, Guosen Securities Co. analyst Qiu Zhicheng wrote in a note
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GDP Slowdown &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There will be more capital raising as a result,
especially for large banks as their deadline is short,&#8221; said
Dariusz Kowalczyk, Hong Kong-based chief economist at Credit
Agricole CIB. &#8220;Their lending capacity will be constrained,
which will slow GDP growth and limit upside&#8221; for the yuan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The required capital buffer against economic swings could
be increased to 5 percent if needed, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s rules would be stricter than capital requirements
announced Sept. 12 by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
in response to the global financial crisis, and give lenders
less time to comply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Basel rules require banks to have a 4.5 percent
common equity ratio within five years, and to add an additional
2.5 percent buffer by Jan. 1, 2019. The Tier 1 capital
requirement was set at 6 percent. Tier 1 capital, whose
definition has been narrowed by the Basel committee, includes
common equity and perpetual preferred stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are currently required to have common equity equal to
2 percent of total assets and 4 percent Tier 1 capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loan Reserves &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese lenders have announced plans to raise more than a
combined $84 billion from equity sales since the beginning of
2010. The biggest banks are currently subject to a minimum
capital adequacy ratio of 11.5 percent, while the requirement
for other publicly traded lenders is 10 percent or more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domestic lenders had an average capital adequacy ratio of
11 percent as of June 30, with the Tier 1 ratio standing at 9
percent, according to the CBRC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese &#8220;systemically important&#8221; banks also need to
maintain loan-loss reserves equivalent to at least 2.5 percent
of total lending by 2012, while other banks should comply by
2016, according to the person. The regulator will also introduce
a leverage ratio of having banks&#8217; core capital accounting for at
least 4 percent of total assets, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. said it aims to
supply China&#8217;s largest oil company with liquefied natural gas
from its proposed Wheatstone project in Australia, the nation at
the center of the U.S. energy producer&#8217;s growth plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron and China National Petroleum Corp. may collaborate
on the development of gas fields in the Carnarvon Basin off
northwest Australia and on exploration in China as part of a
preliminary accord signed in Beijing, Gareth Johnstone, a
spokesman for Chevron in Singapore, said in an e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wheatstone is among A$200 billion ($187 billion) of
proposed LNG ventures in Australia targeting Asian demand for
cleaner-burning alternatives to coal, according to figures this
month from the Australian Petroleum Production  Exploration
Association. The biggest of the projects is Chevron&#8217;s A$43
billion Gorgon development on Australia&#8217;s Barrow Island. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our Australian investments will transform Chevron into
one of the world&#8217;s leading LNG producers,&#8221; Jim Blackwell,
president of Chevron&#8217;s Asia-Pacific exploration and production,
said at a conference in New York yesterday. Blackwell called
Australia &#8220;the centerpiece of the growth story for Chevron.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wheatstone may have as many as six processing units,
producing as much as 25 million metric tons of the fuel a year,
Chevron said in July. The second-biggest U.S. energy company
aims to approve Wheatstone in the middle of 2011, after gaining
environmental approval, a development timeline shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Considerable Expertise&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron continues to talk with &#8220;third-party&#8221; suppliers
that would provide gas to support an expansion of Wheatstone,
Blackwell said, according to a transcript on Chevron&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apache Corp. and Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Co.
have agreed to feed gas to the first two Wheatstone processing
units. In exchange, Houston-based Apache will receive a stake of
about 16.3 percent in the project and Kuwait&#8217;s state-owned oil
company will take about 8.8 percent, Chevron said last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chevron and CNPC memorandum of understanding &#8220;allows
each company to leverage the other&#8217;s considerable technology,
operational expertise and processes to explore, appraise and
develop strategic upstream projects around the world,&#8221;
Johnstone said. The agreement offers CNPC an &#8220;offtake
opportunity from the expanded project,&#8221; according to his e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liu Weijiang, a Beijing-based spokesman for CNPC, the
state-owned parent of PetroChina Co., didn&#8217;t answer calls made
to his office and mobile phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strengthen Relationship &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asian customers typically seek to acquire stakes in
Australian LNG projects, Benjamin Wilson, an analyst with
JPMorgan Chase  Co. in Sydney, said by phone today. Chevron
didn&#8217;t provide any details about how much fuel it may provide to
CNPC or how big a stake it may sell to the Chinese company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron looks as though it is trying to strengthen its
relationship with PetroChina, presumably with the intention to
have it participate in Wheatstone expansion,&#8221; Wilson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial agreement doesn&#8217;t preclude a supply deal
between PetroChina and Woodside Petroleum Ltd., the Australian
producer advancing plans for the Pluto and Browse LNG
developments, he said. It indicates China is &#8220;not finished with
their willingness to contract Australian LNG,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron in August announced its ninth gas discovery off
Australia in 12 months as it advances with Gorgon and Wheatstone.
The San Ramon, California-based company has found enough gas to
support a Gorgon expansion, Blackwell said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As we continue to discover more gas, expansions at Gorgon
and Wheatstone become more likely,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron initially plans to produce 8.6 million tons of LNG
a year from two Wheatstone units, known as trains, located near
the town of Onslow, 1,400 kilometers (870 miles) north of Perth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tokyo Electric Power Co. plans to take 4.1 million tons of
LNG a year from Wheatstone. Korea Gas Corp. said it would buy
almost 2 million tons of LNG a year under an initial accord that
also gives it a 5 percent stake in the venture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LNG is gas chilled to liquid form for transportation by
ship between points not connected by pipelines. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was sued
by three former female employees who claim they faced
discrimination in pay and fewer opportunities for promotion than
men at the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The violations of its female employees&#8217; rights are
systemic, are based upon companywide policies and practices, and
are the result of unchecked gender bias that pervades Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s corporate culture,&#8221; the women said in a complaint filed
in federal court in Manhattan yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H. Cristina Chen-Oster, a former vice president; Lisa
Parisi,  a former managing director; and Shanna Orlich, a former
associate, seek to represent all female Goldman employees with
those job titles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The women seek unspecified damages and a court order
requiring Goldman Sachs to remedy the &#8220;systemic sex
discrimination&#8221; at the firm, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe this suit is without merit,&#8221; said Lucas van
Praag, a Goldman spokesman. &#8220;People are critical to our
business, and we make extraordinary efforts to recruit, develop
and retain outstanding women professionals.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Chen-Oster v. Goldman, Sachs  Co., 10cv6950,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lehman Sues CIBC, Says Claim Change Cost $3 Billion &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and its creditors were
deprived of more than $3 billion they were due to receive from
collateralized debt obligation deals because its claims lost
priority as a result of its bankruptcy filing two years ago, the
bank said in a lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman sued to recover $1.3 billion it claims it was owed
by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in connection with one
of the biggest of the 43 CDO deals it was involved in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman is &#8220;entitled to a declaration that the purported
termination of the note purchase agreement was null and void and
CIBC&#8217;s obligation to pay amounts due&#8221; remains in force and
effect, the company said in court documents filed Sept. 14 in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former investment bank, whose bankruptcy was the
biggest in U.S. history with assets of $639 billion, has said
creditors may have to wait years to recover about 15 cents to 44
cents on the dollar. Any money from lawsuits would swell those
amounts. Filing several lawsuits yesterday over the change in
claims priorities, the bank beat the two-year deadline for so-
called fraudulent-transfer suits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman, based in New York, said it had contracts giving it
senior payment priority in derivative deals, which were replaced
with junior payment priority after the bank filed for bankruptcy
protection. The flip was improper, Lehman said in suing the U.S.
Bank National Association, Deutsche Bank AG&#8217;s trust unit and
dozens of companies that issued notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the CDO deals, Lehman&#8217;s right to priority payment was
replaced by noteholders, who received proceeds from the swap
agreements, Lehman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canadian Imperial, based in Toronto, said the matter is not
new and has been disclosed in earnings statements since the
fourth quarter of 2009. The Toronto-based bank had a C$895
million ($869 million) gain in the fourth quarter of 2008 from
the reduction of an unfunded commitment on a note issued by a
CDO. Lehman was a guarantor of a related credit default swap
agreement with that CDO, according to Canadian Imperial
statements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to believe that the CDO indenture trustee&#8217;s
actions were fully supported by the terms of the governing
contracts and the relevant legal standards,&#8221; the bank said in a
statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chapter 11 case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,

&lt;p&gt;Two Iowa Egg Farms Are Sued Over Salmonella Outbreak &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People from six U.S. states sued two Iowa egg farms,
accusing them of failing to prevent an outbreak of salmonella
poisoning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has
said that as many as 1,519 diagnosed case reported since May 1
may be linked to eggs from the Wright County Egg farm in Galt
and Hillandale Farms of Iowa in New Hampton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Self-policing doesn&#8217;t work,&#8221; Kenneth Moll, a lawyer for
the consumers, said yesterday at a press conference announcing
the suit was filed in federal court in Chicago. The farms failed
to follow U.S. regulations to prevent contamination, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright, the trade name for Quality Egg LLC, and Hillandale
have recalled 550 million eggs since the outbreak was detected.
It is the largest instance of salmonella poisoning since the
Atlanta-based CDC began tracking cases more than 30 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salmonella can cause fever, abdominal cramps and severe
diarrhea. It can lead to fatal complications in infants, the
elderly and people with weakened immune systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hinda Mitchell, an outside spokeswoman for Wright County
Egg, didn&#8217;t immediately reply to a voice-mail message seeking
comment. Hillandale&#8217;s outside spokeswoman, Julie DeYoung, also
didn&#8217;t immediately return a call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soros Insider Trading Case to Be Reviewed by Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billionaire investor George Soros won a bid to have the
European Court of Human Rights review his French insider-trading
conviction from 2002, one of his lawyers said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court notified Soros it will rule on the complaint
without a hearing, based on submissions by the parties, Ron
Soffer, a Paris-based attorney, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We hope that the court will issue a final ruling in the
same spirit and are certain that the conviction will be
overturned as a result,&#8221; said Soffer, who&#8217;s working with London
lawyer Anthony Lester, on the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soros, 80, was convicted of insider trading and ordered to
repay 2.2 million euros ($2.9 million) he&#8217;d made from a 1988
purchase of Societe Generale SA shares after a Paris court found
he&#8217;d acted with the knowledge that the bank might be a takeover
target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soros turned to the human rights tribunal after he lost his
appeal to Cour de Cassation, France&#8217;s highest appeals court,
which quashed the fine while upholding the conviction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French stock market regulators didn&#8217;t pursue Soros, saying
insider trading laws were too vague to determine whether he&#8217;d
broken them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toyota Urges U.S. Judge to Throw Out Lawsuits Over Acceleration &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toyota Motor Corp. urged a U.S. judge to dismiss lawsuits
over sudden acceleration claims saying they&#8217;re based on
anecdotes and fail to identify any specific defects in the
vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toyota, the world&#8217;s largest automaker, faces more than 300
federal and state lawsuits including proposed class actions over
economic losses and claims of personal injuries or deaths
related to allegations the vehicles suddenly accelerated and
couldn&#8217;t be stopped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Plaintiffs infer negligence and strict liability on the
part of Toyota based on unsubstantiated circumstantial
information,&#8221; the automaker said in papers filed in federal
court in Santa Ana, California, Sept. 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The automaker, based in Toyota City, Japan, has recalled
more than 8 million vehicles worldwide in the past year for
defects including pedals that stuck or snagged on floor mats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hearing on Toyota&#8217;s request to dismiss the lawsuits is

&lt;p&gt;Father-Son Developers Hid Assets in &#8216;Web of Lies,&#8217; U.S. Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A father and son who built hotels used a &#8220;web of lies&#8221; to
hide income and assets including Miami Beach mansions, luxury
cars, a yacht and a helicopter from U.S. tax authorities, a
Florida federal prosecutor told jurors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mauricio Cohen Assor, 77, and his son, Leon Cohen Levy, 46,
concealed their wealth behind nominee owners of companies in tax
havens while reporting annual income of no more than about
$46,000 a year, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Neiman said
yesterday in federal court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a case of greed, deception and manipulation,&#8221;
Neiman said at the start of the trial. The men cheated the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service &#8220;through a web of lies, forged
documents and false statements,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An attorney for Cohen Assor and his son countered that the
evidence will show that the men never thought they broke the
law. He denied charges that they hid ownership of one Miami
Beach home valued at $26 million and another worth $20 million,
and that they failed to declare $45 million in investments,
commercial properties worth $55 million and cars including a
Rolls-Royce Phantom and a Porsche Carrera GT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Pasano, a defense attorney, said foreign companies
employing the men owned the assets, and they paid taxes on their
income. They were &#8220;idea-rich but cash- and asset-poor&#8221; while
helping other people make money, Pasano said in his opening
statement. One owner of their companies was Cohen Assor&#8217;s
brother-in-law in Venezuela, Pasano said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is USA v. Assor, 10-cr-60159, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of Florida (Fort Lauderdale). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shapiro Pleads Guilty in $880 Million Ponzi Scheme &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevin Shapiro, the former owner of Capitol Investments USA
Inc. and a booster of college athletics, pleaded guilty to
running an $880 million Ponzi scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shapiro, 41, of Miami Beach, Florida, admitted yesterday in
Newark, New Jersey, federal court that he defrauded more than 50
investors who lost between $50 million and $100 million in his
bogus wholesale-grocery distribution business. He said he used
new investors&#8217; money to pay earlier ones, as well as to fund a
lavish lifestyle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shapiro admitted to stealing $35 million to pay illegal
gambling debts, make mortgage payments on a $5 million house,
and buy floor seats to Miami Heat basketball games. Shapiro, who
gave $150,000 to the University of Miami for an athletic lounge,
said he gave cash or gifts to dozens of student-athletes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. Shapiro, 10-cr-00471, U.S.
District Court, District of New Jersey (Newark). The SEC case is

&lt;p&gt;Coffey Won&#8217;t Return to Law After Electoral Defeat &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sean Coffey, the lawyer who won more than $6.15 billion in
settlements for WorldCom Inc. investors, has no plans to return
to practicing law after his defeat in a run for New York
Attorney General. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m retired from the practice of law,&#8221; Coffey, 54, said
in a phone interview yesterday. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see returning to
practicing law, certainly in the near term.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffey came in third in the Sept. 14 Democratic primary for
the state&#8217;s top lawyer job with 16 percent of the vote, based on
98 percent of precincts reporting, behind winner Eric T.
Schneiderman and Kathleen Rice, according to the New York Times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffey, a former partner at New York&#8217;s Bernstein Litowitz
Berger  Grossmann LLP, which represents investors in
securities-fraud lawsuits against companies, won the WorldCom
settlements in 2004 and 2005 following a collapse of the company
linked to accounting fraud. A novel settlement with WorldCom&#8217;s
former directors required them to pay a portion, a precedent
that reverberated in boardrooms nationwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffey left Bernstein Litowitz in October to run for public
office for the first time, seeking to succeed Andrew Cuomo, who
is running for governor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffey said he may teach law as an adjunct professor, and
is considering writing an article about his 11 months running
for office, for which he kept a diary. He said he also hopes to
do some traveling with his family. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ATT Inc., the largest U.S. phone
company, will sell Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s Windows Phone 7 handset
operating system when it makes its U.S. debut later this year,
according to two people with knowledge of the arrangement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT will offer the operating system on three devices when
it is introduced, said one of the people, who declined to be
identified because the plans aren&#8217;t yet public. A Verizon
Wireless spokeswoman, Brenda Raney, said the carrier won&#8217;t offer
the software until at least next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft overhauled its mobile-phone operating system to
stem market-share losses to Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPhone and handsets
with Google Inc.&#8217;s Android software. Microsoft said it opted not
to do a CDMA version of the program until next year, meaning
Verizon and Sprint Nextel Corp. phones will have to wait because
their networks use that technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In developing Windows Phone 7, we are placing high-
quality customer experiences above all else,&#8221; Greg Sullivan, a
senior product manager at Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft,
said in a statement. Microsoft chose to deliver a system for the
GSM standard first and a CDMA version in the first half of 2011,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GSM technology is used by ATT and Deutsche Telekom
AG&#8217;s T-Mobile USA unit. Sullivan didn&#8217;t say which GSM carriers
will sell the phones at its debut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GSM Carriers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Siegel, an ATT spokesman, declined to comment
yesterday in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cara Walker, a spokeswoman for T-Mobile USA, and Cristi
Allen, a Sprint spokeswoman, both declined in e-mails to say
when they expected to have devices with Windows Phone 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT offers Apple&#8217;s iPhone and iPad tablet computers
exclusively on its U.S. network, and sells smartphones using
Android software such as the Samsung Electronics Co. Captivate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Verizon Wireless&#8217;s most recent mobile
collaboration on Microsoft&#8217;s Kin ended in June when the software
maker pulled the phone after two months because of disappointing
sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT, based in Dallas, rose 6 cents to $28.17 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading and Microsoft fell 11
cents to $25.22 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon, based in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, is co-owned by
Verizon Communications Inc. and Vodafone Group Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cnet reported Microsoft&#8217;s decision to defer the CDMA, or
code division multiple access, version of the Windows Phone 7
software last night. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp.&#8217;s decision yesterday to set up a research center with the
Lithuanian government may stoke concern that Estonia and Latvia
are falling behind as the Baltic neighbors vie for foreign
investment after Europe&#8217;s deepest recessions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithuania has attracted since the beginning of last year
investments from international companies including London-based
Barclays Plc, which opened an information technology center in
Vilnius, and Englewood, Colorado-based Western Union Co., which
plans to establish a regional service center in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithuania is winning as Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius
acts as &#8220;investment czar,&#8221; said Kitty Kubo, who heads the
foresight division of the Estonian Development Fund in Tallinn,
which advises the country&#8217;s government. Estonian lawmakers
haven&#8217;t acted on the fund&#8217;s suggestion that they name a top
official to head the country&#8217;s investment drive, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The doors of companies such as IBM are open for a prime
minister, even when it is difficult for an investment promotion
agency to get its foot in the door,&#8221; Kubo said. &#8220;If Lithuania
continues successfully, it has a good chance of grabbing the
best investments in the region and the best talents with it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The competition is vital as the Baltic states try to revive
growth after their economies shrank by 20-25 percent from peak
levels during the global recession, according to an
International Monetary Fund report released this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estonia is the Baltic region&#8217;s traditional leader in
foreign direct investment, with $16.2 billion of accumulated
FDI, according to the World Investment Report 2010 by the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Lithuania is second
at $13.8 billion, followed by Latvia&#8217;s $11.7 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gap Closing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithuania narrowed the gap last year as the stock of
foreign investment rose 7 percent, compared with Estonia&#8217;s 3
percent drop and Latvia&#8217;s 2 percent increase, the report shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kubilius&#8217; government plans to boost FDI to 20 billion euros
($26 billion) within five years by focusing on computer services
and energy as the country seeks to establish itself as a service
hub for the Baltic and Nordic regions, Economy Minister Dainius Kreivys said in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While all three countries promote their European Union
membership, central location and cheap, well-educated workers,
Estonia leads its neighbors in the World Bank&#8217;s Ease of Doing
Business rankings. Estonia placed 24th in the most recent
survey, Lithuania 26th and Latvia 27th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estonia&#8217;s &#8220;slight edge&#8221; in business conditions may not be
enough to ensure success, said Christian Ketels, a professor at
Harvard Business School&#8217;s Institute for Strategy and
Competitiveness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right Direction &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Countries that market themselves by focusing on their
capabilities in specific clusters of economic activities find it
easier to communicate their specific advantages,&#8221; said Ketels,
who is also a member of the Baltic Development Forum&#8217;s advisory
board. &#8220;As far as the Lithuanian campaign fits that bill, I
think it is a step in the right direction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armonk, New York-based IBM, the world&#8217;s biggest computer-
services company, said yesterday it will collaborate with the
Lithuanian government on a research and development center in
Vilnius. Each party will invest 42 million litai ($15.9 million)
annually and share in any patents they develop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estonia, the smallest of the three Baltic nations, &#8220;has
not based its attraction of FDI on specially designed support
schemes,&#8221; the Estonian Investment and Trade agency says on its
website, listing Skype Technologies SA, Playtech Ltd. and
Swedbank AB among successful investors. &#8220;It is our favorable
business environment that makes the difference.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Euro Advantage &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country may gain an advantage in the competition next
year when it adopts the euro, making it easier for companies to
do business in the countries sharing Europe&#8217;s common currency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Lithuania&#8217;s marketing efforts have been good, but they
don&#8217;t really offset Estonia&#8217;s euro entry,&#8221; said James Oates,
chief executive officer of Tallinn-based Cicero Capital, and a
former head of east European equities at UBS AG. &#8220;Attracting
investment is one thing, but keeping it in the country is
another as we have seen a number of big investors enter a Baltic
country and leave in a couple of years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hilton Hotels Corp. in 2007 closed its Tallinn call center,
which had more than 300 employees, citing growing costs and a
lack of people who were fluent in other European languages.
Hatfield, England-based International Greetings Plc, Europe&#8217;s
only publicly traded maker of wrapping paper and Christmas
cards, closed its two manufacturing plants in Latvia in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regional Good &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Latvia, sandwiched between Estonia and Lithuania, also
advertises itself as a business-friendly country provides a
gateway to the EU and Russia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economy Minister Artis Kampars traveled to China in July to
meet with business leaders and government officials about
potential investment. Andris Ozols, director of the Latvian
development agency, said after the visit that Chinese companies
were interested in Latvia&#8217;s ports, cargo companies, the national
airline and creating a logistics center in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investments in Lithuania or Latvia are good for Estonia
as we also depend on how their economies perform,&#8221; Estonian
Economy Minister Juhan Parts said in an interview. &#8220;Promotion
of investments needs to be systemic and consistent,&#8221; he said
when asked if Estonia needed more high-level promotion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government needs to do more, Kubo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We cannot be complacent and passive in competition for
capital and talent, and just hope that some general conditions
will make us a winner in this contest,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sugar climbed in New York, heading
for the biggest weekly advance in three months, as Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. predicted higher prices for the sweetener on
speculation of crop damage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adverse weather in recent months points to &#8220;lower-than-
previously-expected production for both Brazil, the largest
producer and exporter, and Australia, the third-largest
exporter,&#8221; Goldman analysts led by London-based Jeffrey Currie
wrote in a report today. The 2010-11 crop year starts Oct. 1 for
most growers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Uncertainty over the 2010-11 crop will likely become the
main driver for sugar prices over the coming months,&#8221; the
analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raw sugar for March delivery climbed 0.03 cent, or 0.1
percent, to 23.27 cents a pound at 8:45 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
in New York, heading for a gain this week of 7.2 percent, the
biggest weekly advance for a most-active contract since June 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White sugar for December delivery was unchanged at $608.20
a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman increased its three-month price forecast for raw
sugar to 20 cents a pound, and its six-and 12-month estimates to
16 cents from 12 cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan yesterday formed a panel to report on sugar
imports to ease a shortage estimated at 1.2 million tons next
year. The panel will make its assessment on overseas purchases
within a week, the Industries Ministry in Islamabad said in a
statement yesterday. Floods destroyed 200,000 acres of sugar
cane, a farm group in the South Asian nation said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robusta coffee for November delivery climbed 0.5 percent to
$1,662 a ton on NYSE Liffe. Arabica beans for December delivery
dropped 0.7 percent to $1.9055 a pound on ICE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cocoa for December delivery gained 1.7 percent to 1,915
pounds ($2,997) a ton on NYSE Liffe. The chocolate ingredient
for December delivery rose 2.5 percent to $2,808 a ton in New
York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief
Economist Jim O&#8217;Neill said Japan&#8217;s intervention to weaken the
yen this week suggests Group of 20 officials coordinated to
support the policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fact they&#8217;ve done it in a week when Washington is so
noisy&#8221; about China&#8217;s renminbi &#8220;is particularly interesting and
suggests to me that behind the scenes that there may be subtle
coordination going on here,&#8221; he said today on Bloomberg Radio&#8217;s
&#8220;Bloomberg Surveillance&#8221; with Tom Keene. &#8220;The renminbi&#8217;s
continued to strengthen. You can build it all into some pretty
well thought out thing going on behind the scenes by the G20
policy makers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan sold yen this week after it touched 82.88 per dollar,
the strongest level since May 1995. The yuan completed its
biggest weekly advance in 28 months after U.S. Treasury
Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said yesterday gains in the
currency were &#8220;too slow.&#8221; He said the U.S. will use every
available tool to urge China to let the yuan rise more quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese authorities have &#8220;only delivered on a small part
of&#8221; yuan loosening, said O&#8217;Neill, who is incoming
chairman of Goldman Sachs&#8217; asset-management unit. &#8220;My
suspicion&#8221; is that &#8220;they&#8217;ve rather cleverly held the timing
back for when they thought it would have its biggest impact in
Washington.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Neill also said Japan&#8217;s intervention was &#8220;the right
thing for them to do.&#8221; The yen was little changed today at
85.72 per dollar, having slid about 2 percent this week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The halt of an Enbridge Energy
Partners LP pipeline that got approval to reopen is expected to
keep U.S. crude oil imports at a reduced level in coming weeks,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enbridge got final approval from federal regulators to
resume shipments through Line 6A today after its largest oil
pipeline linking Canada and U.S. Midwest refiners was closed
Sept. 9 following a leak. The 670,000-barrel-a-day link will run
at about 69 percent of capacity when it returns to service, the
company said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Almost one-third of the total 2.2 million barrels a day
U.S. imports of Canadian crude are shipped via this pipeline,&#8221;
Jeffrey Currie and David Greely, analysts at Goldman, said in
the report. &#8220;By the time the leakage occurred, the pipeline was
only running at roughly two-thirds of capacity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude prices have held in a $70 a barrel to $75 a barrel
range despite high inventory levels and Goldman expects that
&#8220;as the tide turns, we will see lower inventories and shifting
sentiment send WTI crude oil prices into a $85-$95 per barrel
trading range in coming months,&#8221; according to the report. The
bank made the same price estimate in a report earlier this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman maintained its Feb. 5 recommendation to buy
December 2010 New York oil futures, a call that&#8217;s made 65 cents
a barrel so far, according to today&#8217;s report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best returns in commodities
over the next 12 months will probably be in energy and the
biggest losses in agriculture, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank is forecasting a 27 percent advance in energy over
12 months, a 17 percent jump in precious metals and a 15 percent
gain in industrial metals, analysts led by London-based Jeffrey Currie said in a report today. Agriculture will decline 10
percent, the team forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For the more cyclical commodities, oil and copper, while
continued indications of more supportive policy in the U.S. and
China, better macro data in these key countries, and improving
commodity data have pushed prices higher within their respective
trading ranges, we continue to expect them to break out to the
upside in coming months,&#8221; the analysts wrote in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials fell
1.7 percent this year, led by declines in natural gas, cocoa and
sugar, amid mounting concern about the strength of the global
recovery. Crude, gasoline and heating oil inventories reached a
20-year-high last month as the U.S. Commerce Department said the
economy probably expanded at a 1.6 percent annual pace in the
second quarter from an initially reported 2.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While agriculture is forecast by Goldman to be the only
commodity group to drop over 12 months, the bank raised its
three-month forecasts for corn, cotton, arabica and raw sugar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman increased its three-month corn estimate to $4.65 a
bushel from $4.15 and said the market will have a &#8220;further
tightening&#8221; because of demand for ethanol and animal feed.
Wheat prices, which as much as doubled since June, may decline
in the &#8220;medium term,&#8221; Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffee Forecast &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank also raised its arabica-coffee forecast to $1.80 a
pound from $1.55 and raw-sugar to 20 cents a pound from 15
cents. The cotton estimate increased to 90 cents a pound from 85
cents. The cocoa forecast declined to $2,700 a metric ton from
$3,100. Goldman raised its live-cattle forecast to 105 cents a
pound from 93 cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank is forecasting a 19 percent return in the SP GSCI
Enhanced Total Return Index over 12 months. The gauge declined 4
percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. and China
Petrochemical Corp., known as Sinopec Group, are in talks on
developing shale gas, a harder-to-extract form of the fuel that
may exceed conventional reserves in China by as much as 12-fold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are in discussions with Sinopec,&#8221; Gareth Johnstone,
the Singapore-based spokesman for the second-biggest U.S. energy
producer, said by e-mail today. &#8220;We are not disclosing further
details at this stage.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China is seeking to tap its unconventional gas resources,
including gas in shale and coal seams, with the help of global
majors like Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc. Chevron and
Sinopec Group, the country&#8217;s second-largest oil company, may
sign an accord by the year-end to develop shale gas in
southwestern China, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing an
unidentified person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Energy demand in China is very strong, but its technology
is relatively backward when it comes to developing
unconventional resources,&#8221; said Wang Aochao, head of energy
research at UOB-Kay Hian Ltd. in Shanghai. &#8220;In the future,
exploration and production in China will be a long-term area of
cooperation between Chinese and foreign companies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s biggest polluting nation is seeking to triple
the use of gas to about 10 percent of energy consumption by 2020
and cut reliance on coal and oil, which produce more emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China holds 2.46 trillion cubic meters of natural gas
reserves, according to BP&#8217;s Statistical Review of World Energy.
That compares with possibly 30 trillion cubic meters of gas
deposits in shale, a type of sedimentary rock, said China
National Petroleum Corp., the country&#8217;s largest energy company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Southwestern Provinces &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron has found a gas block near Guiyang city in Guizhou
province, close to an area that BP and Sinopec Group are
exploring, the Journal said in the report, citing the
unidentified person. Huang Wensheng, a Beijing-based spokesman
for the state-controlled Chinese company, didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to calls made to his office or mobile phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sinopec Group aims to boost its unconventional gas
production capacity to more than 2.5 billion cubic meters a year
by 2015. Unconventional gas resources will be an &#8220;important&#8221;
contributor to earnings within five to 10 years, the company
said on June 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;China&#8217;s three oil companies, led by PetroChina Co., are
increasing spending on the development of unconventional gas,
including tight gas, coal-bed methane and shale gas,&#8221; Jia
Chengzao, president of the Chinese Petroleum Society and a
former vice president at the China National Petroleum unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Massive Production&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PetroChina signed an agreement with Shell last year to
explore for shale gas in the Sichuan basin in southwest China.
Shell may invest $1 billion annually in China in the next five
to seven years should two wells there show potential for
commercial production, Chief Financial Officer Simon Henry said
on Sept. 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may take China four to five years to achieve commercial
development of shale gas and a &#8220;fairly longer time&#8221; before
&#8220;massive production,&#8221; Jia said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong-listed PetroChina teamed up with Shell in March
this year to acquire Australian coal-bed gas producer Arrow
Energy Ltd., partly to acquire the expertise needed to help the
company develop China&#8217;s reserves of unconventional gas, Chairman
Jiang Jiemin said then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. last year overtook Russia as the world&#8217;s largest
producer of natural gas as shale-gas output rose to 10 percent
of total supplies from 2 percent in 1990 in what BP&#8217;s Chief
Executive Officer Tony Hayward called a &#8216;quiet revolution.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boeing Co. could see the biggest
risk to the development of its 787 Dreamliner jet coming from
engines supplied by Rolls-Royce Group Plc, according to Joseph Nadol, an aerospace analyst at JPMorgan Securities LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the seven weeks since the blowout of a Trent 1000 engine
on a Rolls-Royce test bed, neither Chicago-based Boeing nor
Rolls-Royce has determined whether it was caused by the engine
design or the way it was tested, Nadol wrote in a note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Both companies express confidence that they can work
through this issue -- Rolls more so than BA,&#8221; Nadol said. &#8220;A
defect requiring a major redesign may be unlikely. However, the
impact of such a problem would be severe, and the Trent engine
therefore looks like the biggest risk for the 787.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week&#8217;s disclosure of a power surge on a Rolls-Royce
engine on a test 787 adds to the uncertainty, said Nadol, who
rates Boeing as &#8220;neutral.&#8221; Boeing said it parked one of its
five Dreamliner test jets while crews replace a Trent 1000
engine that experienced the surge before takeoff on Sept. 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boeing declared its first three test 787s weren&#8217;t fit for
sale to customers, and it announced a $2.5 billion charge.
Nadol, who is based in New York, said he was &#8220;increasingly
concerned&#8221; that Boeing also wouldn&#8217;t be able to sell three new
test aircraft, boosting those costs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp., the second-biggest
U.S. energy company, expanded its exploration operations into
Turkey by signing an agreement with the country&#8217;s state oil
company to jointly drill wells in the Black Sea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron will buy a 50 percent stake in a western portion of
License 3921, an exploration block about the size of New Jersey
in waters 220 miles (354 kilometers) northwest of the Turkish
capital of Ankara, according to a statement today by the San
Ramon, California-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State-owned Turkiye Petrolleri AO will be operator of the
initial well currently being drilled and of a well that may be
drilled in 2012, said Chevron, which would take over as operator
thereafter. The U.S. company is expanding into new oil provinces
to keep production rising as access to petroleum reserves around
the world becomes more difficult. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is an opportunity to build on recent positions we&#8217;ve
acquired in other locations in West Africa, Asia and Europe, and
it&#8217;s a highly prospective new basin for Chevron,&#8221; Kurt Glaubitz, a company spokesman, said today in a telephone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkiye Petrolleri plans three wells through the venture
with Chevron that will cost about $750 million, Mehmet Uysal,
chief executive officer for the state oil company, told
reporters at a signing ceremony in Ankara. He said Turkiye
Petrolleri will get a $50 million bonus from Chevron if oil is
found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron rose $1.44, or 1.8 percent, to $79.90 as of 4:10
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp., which also has a Black Sea venture with
Turkiye Petrolleri, is the largest U.S. oil company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     Sept. 20 (Bloomberg) -- International Business Machines
Corp.&#8217;s $27-a-share deal to acquire Netezza Corp. pushed the
stock above that level, suggesting investors may expect a
competing bid for the analytics-technology provider. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider, struck
a cash deal worth about $1.7 billion, according to a statement
from the company today. Marlborough, Massachusetts-based
Netezza&#8217;s stock topped the per-share offer by $1.27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netezza, whose clients include NYSE Euronext and Estee
Lauder Cos., integrates hardware with programs that store and
analyze data. It&#8217;s one of the few data-warehousing companies
that&#8217;s gained customers, making it an attractive buy for large
technology corporations looking to increase sales, said Keith Bachman, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Larger companies are finding it harder to grow so when
they see an interesting technology, they&#8217;re willing to pay up
for it,&#8221; said New York-based Bachman, who rates IBM
&#8220;outperform.&#8221; Possible counter-bidders could include Hewlett-
Packard Co., Dell Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc., he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netezza rose $3.67, or 15 percent, to $28.27 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. IBM, based in Armonk,
New York, gained $1.60 to $131.79. Teradata Corp., which also
provides analytics and storage technology, climbed 7.5 percent
after analysts cited it as a potential target. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s Bovespa stock index will
gain 16 percent to a record 78,000 by yearend as &#8220;obstacles&#8221;
are removed, including presidential elections and Petroleo
Brasileiro SA&#8217;s share sale, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank&#8217;s signal that it will hold borrowing costs
through 2010 also boosts the prospects for Brazilian stocks,
Stephen Graham and Andre Rezende, analysts at Goldman Sachs in
Sao Paulo, wrote in a note to clients today. The benchmark
equity gauge may rally 31 percent to 88,000 by mid-2011, they
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Timing for a rally seems propitious because obstacles
that have blocked markets are being removed, while earnings are
robust and estimates we think will rise further,&#8221; the analysts
wrote. &#8220;The implications of flat rather than rising interest
rates into 2011 are sinking in.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bovespa slumped 2.2 percent this year before today on
concern the $78 billion stock offering by Petrobras, which
accounts for 12 percent of the index weighting, will dilute
earnings. Petrobras plans to price the share sale Sept. 23.
Speculation that swelling budget deficits could cause a debt
default in Europe also damped demand for riskier assets, while
concern that growth is slowing in the U.S. and China dimmed the
outlook for commodities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Robust Chapter&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Brazil is typically seen as a healthy part of the long-
term BRICs story,&#8221; Graham and Rezende wrote, referring to
Brazil, Russia, India and China. &#8220;After 11 months of flattish
trading, late 2010/early 2011 is shaping up to be an especially
robust chapter of the story&#8221; as rising global confidence boosts
the appetite for stocks, they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dilma Rousseff, the chosen successor of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, may bring &#8220;continuity&#8221; and seek to
contain government spending if she wins elections next month,
according to Goldman Sachs. Support for the former cabinet chief
is at 51 percent, compared to 25 percent for her closest
competitor, according to an Ibope poll published Sept. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bovespa rose 1 percent to 67,748.24 at 11:16 a.m. New
York time today. Goldman Sachs previously estimated the Bovespa
would rise to 85,000 by the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not including retail and consumer-goods stocks, Brazilian
stock valuations are &#8220;undemanding&#8221; compared to other emerging
markets, Goldman Sachs said. The Bovespa is trading at 14.9
times reported earnings, compared to a ratio of 14.5 for the
MSCI Emerging Markets Index, weekly data compiled by Bloomberg
show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domestic Growth &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies that benefit most from domestic growth should
continue to outperform other Brazilian stocks through 2010,
despite &#8220;stretched&#8221; valuations, Banco Santander SA said. The
outlook for slower interest-rate increases especially benefits
industries including transportation, banks and real estate,
Marcelo Audi and Leonardo Milane, analysts at Santander, wrote
in a note to clients today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;An expected softer monetary tightening makes a hard
landing in 2011 GDP growth less likely,&#8221; said the analysts,
based in Sao Paulo. &#8220;If anything, a new positive risk is for a
stronger economic momentum for longer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s gross domestic product may expand 7.5 percent this
year and 4.5 percent in 2011, according to the median forecast
in the weekly central bank survey of about 100 economists
published today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. raised its
quarterly dividend by 3 cents, or 23 percent, to 16 cents a
share and got approval from its board to sell as much as $6
billion in additional debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This higher dividend, combined with our ongoing share
repurchase program, reflects our commitment to returning capital
to our shareholders and our confidence in the long-term growth
of the company,&#8221; Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein
said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. is planning to sell debt this year to pay
for dividends and share repurchases because too much of its cash
is held overseas, a person familiar with the matter said last
week. The company will try to raise as much as possible without
jeopardizing its debt rating of AAA, the highest available, said
the person, who declined to be named because the plans are
confidential and not completed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg data had predicted the company would increase its
quarterly dividend by 2 cents a share, while Heather Bellini, an
analyst at ISI Group, predicted an increase of 4 cents in a note
to clients this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft fell 28 cents to $25.15 at 4 p.m. New York time
in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have dropped 17
percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quarterly dividend of 16 cents would yield 2.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department is
seeking to join a whistleblower lawsuit over Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s organ
transplant drug Rapamune alleging the medicine was illegally
marketed, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government&#8217;s lawyers are asking a federal judge in
Philadelphia to allow them to take over litigating claims that
officials of Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth unit pushed the drug for unapproved
uses and specifically targeted black patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This means the government had determined that some or all
of the allegations in our complaint are merit worthy,&#8221; Reuben Guttman, a Washington-based lawyer representing two former Wyeth
employees who filed suit over the practices, said in a telephone
interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapamune is approved to help prevent the rejection of
kidney transplants. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration last
year found the drug may increase the risk of death and organ
rejection if given during a liver transplant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer officials said today Rapamune&#8217;s warning label
included &#8220;appropriate caveats&#8221; about how the drug could be
used safely in connection with transplants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pfizer has previously disclosed that the company is
cooperating with the U.S. government regarding its review of
Wyeth&#8217;s promotional practices involving Rapamune,&#8221; Raymond Kerins, a Pfizer spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. New
York-based Pfizer bought Wyeth last year for $68 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marketing Tactics &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After investigating the whistleblowers&#8217; claims about
Wyeth&#8217;s Rapamune marketing tactics, Justice Department lawyers
concluded they had &#8220;good cause to intervene&#8221; in the case,
according to a court filing. U.S. District Judge John R. Padova
in Philadelphia still must approve the government&#8217;s request to
join the 2005 suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint was filed by Marlene Sandler and Scott Paris,
two former Wyeth sales reps, who claim the drugmaker &#8220;directed
their entire Rapamune sales force&#8221; to promote the drug among
physicians involved in heart, lung, liver and pancreas
transplants. The drug hasn&#8217;t been approved for use in any of
those transplants, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whistleblowers also claim Wyeth officials offered
doctors and hospitals kickbacks, in the form of speaker fees and
grants, in exchange for Rapamune prescriptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyeth sales executives also targeted hospitals that served
black populations in an effort to get doctors to switch
transplant patients to Rapamune, according to the complaint. The
FDA required the drugmaker in 2004 to include a black-box
warning on Rapamune about such patient conversions, the suit
said. That is the FDA&#8217;s highest safety warning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer officials said in February that federal prosecutors
in Oklahoma are investigating whether Wyeth&#8217;s Rapamune marketing
campaign violated any criminal laws. The drugmaker acknowledged
the probe in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc, CA 05-6609,
U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania
(Philadelphia). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies shouldn&#8217;t wait for government to set standards
for data and technologies to create a &#8220;smart grid,&#8221; which lets
consumers monitor their energy use and take conservation steps
that can save energy and money, Palmisano said today at the
Gridwise Global Forum in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is an incredible buy-in for change&#8221; in the U.S.,
and backers of new energy technology should tap into the
sentiment, he said in a speech opening the conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A smart electric grid is part of a push by companies and
regulators to make the nation&#8217;s energy system more efficient,
eliminating a need to build new generation sources that would
raise electricity prices and add to greenhouse-gas emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Morris, CEO of American Electric Power Co. of
Columbus, Ohio, said during a panel discussion with Palmisano
and Anders Eldrup, CEO of Dong Energy A/S, Denmark&#8217;s largest
utility, that consumers don&#8217;t think about how they use energy,
and don&#8217;t particularly want to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We need to get the voters, the taxpayers, interested in
these issues,&#8221; with smart-meter systems that are simple to use,
Morris said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rules for selling municipal bonds
should afford investors protections similar to those in other
U.S. markets, Securities and Exchange Commission member Elisse B. Walter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should be able to get &#8220;information&#160;that is not
materially misleading and does not contain material omissions,&#8221;
Walter said today at a San Francisco hearing. &#8220;That includes
receiving financial and other material information that is not
stale. As I have previously bemoaned, investors in municipal
securities are, in certain respects, afforded second-class
treatment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC is moving to remake regulations covering public
officials and Wall Street underwriters who sell municipal bonds
to investors. SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro in May said regulators
should consider requiring more timely disclosure of financial
information, adopting mandatory accounting standards and
ensuring that borrowers such as real-estate developers who raise
money through municipal entities provide adequate information to
investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $2.8 trillion municipal market is used by cities,
states and towns that back the bonds with taxes, as well as
entities such as nursing homes, hospitals and real-estate
developers that act through government agencies and default when
the projects fail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failed Monorail &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the last three years, more than $17 billion of
municipal bonds have defaulted, including those backed by Las
Vegas&#8217; monorail and a toll road in South Carolina, according to
Distressed Debt Securities Newsletter, a Miami Lakes, Florida
publication that tracks defaults. Individual investors dominate
the municipal bond market, holding more than $1 trillion
directly and more through mutual funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In spite of their well-deserved reputation for safety,
municipal securities can and do default,&#8221; Walter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schapiro appointed Walter to lead the hearings on improving
regulations for the municipal bond market. The San Francisco
session is the first of six planned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, the financial regulatory overhaul that
President Barack Obama signed in July provided for a two-year
study of municipal finance disclosure, including whether to
scrap a 1975 law that prevents the SEC from imposing the same
requirements on local governments that it does on corporations.
The SEC has also established a special unit to bring municipal
securities enforcement cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Single Approach &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California Treasurer Bill Lockyer, who also testified at
today&#8217;s hearings, cautioned regulators against a uniform
approach, saying the rules should reflect the differences among
the many government entities that raise money in the municipal
market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington state Treasurer James McIntire also plans to
speak against uniform issuance rules when he appears before the
panel today, in part because they would impede smaller
municipalities&#8217; access to the market, according to his
spokesman, Chris McGann. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter said new regulations would acknowledge the
difference between the municipal and corporate securities
markets. Municipal officials have opposed efforts to force them
to file bond offering documents with the SEC before sales, as
corporations must do with stock offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some have suggested looking to the corporate-disclosure
scheme as a framework for municipal disclosure,&#8221; she said.&#160;&#8220;I
believe that we can learn from the corporate world, but it is
also essential that we recognize the differences in the
municipal and corporate finance worlds and that we work together
to evaluate what an appropriate framework for municipal-finance
disclosure should be in the future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey is open to new partnerships
for oil and gas exploration in the Black Sea, the head of the
state-run oil company said after announcing a $750 million deal
with Chevron Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;New partnerships for oil and gas exploration in the Black

&lt;p&gt;Turkey has also signed agreements with Exxon Mobil, the
largest oil company in the United States, and Brazil&#8217;s state-
owned Petroleo Brasileiro SA, or Petrobras, for Black Sea
drilling and exploration. Chevron is the second-largest oil
company in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is one
of the best-performing financial shares in the past decade
and it beat the SP 500 Stock Index, helping to explain Lloyd C. Blankfein&#8217;s $125 million in cash bonuses during the period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some investments did even better. One-year certificates of
deposit earned an average rate of 3.17 percent in the last 10
years, beating the 2.78 percent annual total return on Goldman
Sachs. Buying a 10-year Treasury note in mid-September 2000
would have yielded 5.8 percent annually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street firms have defended the pay of chief executive
officers, including Blankfein, by pointing to the value they
generate for shareholders. Yet over the last decade, the SP 500
Financials Index, which includes 80 members, has dropped 49
percent. Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Morgan
Stanley have lost money for shareholders, while JPMorgan Chase 
Co. returned an annual 1.23 percent, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some of the financial stocks were of course total
catastrophes,&#8221; such as Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., Bear
Stearns Cos. and Citigroup, all examples of a &#8220;financial sector
innovating itself into obscurity,&#8221; said John C. Bogle, the 81-
year-old founder of the Vanguard Group of mutual funds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., one of four non-
financial U.S. companies with AAA ratings, sold $4.75 billion of
bonds, including three- and five-year maturities at the lowest
coupons on record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s $1 billion of 0.875 percent notes due in 2013
and $1.75 billion of 1.625 percent debt maturing in 2015 have
the lowest interest rates of more than 3,500 securities in the
Barclays Capital U.S. Corporate Index of investment-grade
company debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s biggest software maker sold the bonds a day
after its board boosted its dividend and approved the issuance
of as much as $6 billion in new debt. The offering came as
yields on investment-grade debt fell to 3.718 percent, the
lowest level since daily records began on Oct. 31, 1986,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A name like Microsoft is always going to garner the
biggest and best investors,&#8221; said Anne Daley, managing director
at Barclays Capital in New York, which helped underwrite the
sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, also sold $1
billion each of 10- and 30-year bonds, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The 4.5 percent, 30-year debt tied for
the lowest coupon with an issue last month from Johnson 
Johnson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cash Held Overseas &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proceeds from Microsoft&#8217;s sale may be used to fund working
capital, capital expenditures, stock buybacks and acquisitions,
the company said today in a regulatory filing. The company also
plans to pay for dividends and share repurchases because much of
its cash is held overseas, a person familiar with the matter
said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Wootton, a Microsoft spokesman, wasn&#8217;t available to
comment today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3-year notes yield 25 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries; the 5-year debt pays a 40 basis-point
spread; the 3 percent securities due in 2020 pay 55 basis
points; and 30-year bonds pay 83 basis points, Bloomberg data
show. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spreads on investment-grade debt rose 1 basis point today
to 184 basis points, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data
show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard  Poor&#8217;s and Moody&#8217;s Investors Service also rank
Exxon Mobil Corp., Johnson  Johnson and Automatic Data
Processing Inc. as AAA, or an equivalent Aaa, the same level
they assign to U.S. government debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher Dividend &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft reported $36.8 billion in cash and short-term
investments at the end of last quarter. Much of that is held
overseas, forcing the company to pay taxes on any of the money
used for dividends or stock repurchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft boosted its quarterly dividend by 3 cents, or 23
percent, to 16 cents a share yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dividend and share repurchase programs reflect
Microsoft&#8217;s commitment to returning capital to shareholders and
confidence in its long-term growth prospects, Chief Financial
Officer Peter Klein said yesterday in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You can take it as a sign of soft expected future stock-
market performance,&#8221; said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income
strategist and economist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in
Philadelphia. &#8220;Microsoft doesn&#8217;t have a lot of acquisition
opportunities, doesn&#8217;t have a lot to do internally, apparently,
with this capital, so they&#8217;re giving it back to shareholders.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debut Sale &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft sold its first bond in May 2009, a $3.75 billion
offering, in a bid to diversify its capital structure and add to
its cash pile for acquisitions, capital expenses and share
buybacks. The sale comprised $2 billion of 2.95 percent, 5-year
notes; $1 billion of 4.2 percent, 10-year debt; and $750 million
of 5.2 percent, 30-year bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, Microsoft raised $1.15 billion of interest-free
financing from its first sale of convertible bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a perfect storm for issuers right now between low
rates, tight spreads and the fact that investors continue to
have cash to put to work,&#8221; Daley said. &#8220;We expect the active
new issue calendar to continue.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Barclays, Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase
 Co. helped underwrite today&#8217;s sale. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in U.S. trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of 4 p.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE US) tumbled 19 percent to $26.67
for the biggest decline in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. The
graphic-design software maker forecast sales that trailed
estimates, citing slower demand from back-to-school shoppers and
Japanese buyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autodesk Inc. (ADSK US), whose software is used in bridge
design and movie special effects, fell 4.3 percent to $31.66. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMR Corp. (AMR US) slid 8.7 percent, the most since April
21, to $6.28. The owner of American Airlines said its mainline
unit revenue will increase 11 percent at most in the third
quarter. That trailed Deutsche Bank AG&#8217;s estimate for a gain of
12 percent. JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Stifel Nicolaus  Co. both
widened their 2010 loss estimates for the airline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analogic Corp. (ALOG US) rose 3.2 percent, the most since
Aug. 25, to $44.31. The medical and airport-security device
maker reported fourth-quarter earnings of 56 cents a share,
beating the average analyst estimate of 39 cents a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biogen Idec Inc. (BIIB US) declined 5.8 percent, the most
since Oct. 23, to $54.86. The world&#8217;s largest maker of multiple-
sclerosis treatments fell after Novartis AG&#8217;s MS drug Gilenya
won U.S. regulatory approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CarMax Inc. (KMX US) rose the most in the SP 500, jumping
8.5 percent to $26.16. The biggest U.S. used-car dealer reported
second-quarter per-share earnings of 48 cents, beating analysts&#8217;
average estimate of 40 cents a share. The company, which had a
13 percent increase in second-quarter revenue, said it plans to
open five superstores in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalyst Health Solutions Inc. (CHSI US) slumped 12
percent, the most since December 2008, to $32.69. The provider
of pharmacy benefit management services said it&#8217;s involved in a
contractual dispute with its client MCS Advantage Inc., which
threatens to terminate the agreement at the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Force Protection Inc. (FRPT US) climbed 13 percent to $4.76
for the biggest gain in Russell 2000 Index. The maker of blast-
resistant trucks for the U.S. military said its European unit
was picked by the U.K. government as the preferred bidder in
Light Protected Patrol Vehicle program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Mills Inc. (GIS US) rose 2.7 percent, the most
since June 2, to $36.63. The maker of Cheerios and Green Giant
frozen vegetables said first-quarter profit gained 12 percent,
helped by rising sales of cereals and snacks. Profit excluding
some items was 64 cents a share, beating analysts&#8217; estimates by
1 cent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IStar Financial Inc. (SFI US) had the second-biggest
retreat in Russell 2000 Index, losing 15 percent to $2.95. The
commercial real estate lender fell for a second day after people
with knowledge of the plan said the company trying to
restructure some of its $8.6 billion of debt may seek bankruptcy
protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF US) slid 5.2 percent, the most
July 16, to $23. The first Wall Street firm to release third-
quarter results reported earnings that missed analysts&#8217;
estimates as trading revenue declined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT US) fell the most in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average, losing 2.2 percent to $24.61. The world&#8217;s
biggest software maker raised quarterly dividend by 23 percent
to 16 cents a share. The magnitude was &#8220;disappointing,&#8221;
according to Cowen  Co. analyst Gregg Moskowitz, who said the
2.5 percent yield fell short of his expectation of as much as 4
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix Inc. (NFLX US) rose 6.6 percent to a record
$156.93. The mail-order and online movie-rental service gained
after the Wall Street Journal reported that a bankruptcy filing
by rival Blockbuster Inc. may come in the next few days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York Times Co. (NYT US) fell 6.5 percent, the most
since July 28, to $7.45. The newspaper publisher predicted
third-quarter sales that trailed analysts&#8217; estimates as
circulation revenue drops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gannett Co. (GCI US), the owner of USA Today and television
stations, dropped 6.2 percent to $12.36. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (OGXI US) rose 6.3 percent,
the most since July 27, to $13.01. The Bothell, Washington-based
drugmaker said its custirsen treatment helped improve survival
rates in patients with advanced prostate cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PMC-Sierra Inc. (PMCS US) sank 6 percent to $7.32 for the
biggest decline since Aug. 11. The chipmaker reduced its third-
quarter sales forecast, saying it expects $163 million at most.
That trails the average analyst estimate of $173.5 million in a
Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power-One Inc. (PWER US) gained 6.1 percent to $9.24, after
dropping to a three-month low last week. The maker of power-
conversion products for communications equipment said it plans
to buy back 10 million shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satyam Computer Services Ltd. (SAY US) surged 20 percent,
the most since August 2009, to $6.61. The Indian software
exporter, which delayed reporting its accounts after disclosing
an overstatement of assets, said it will report annual earnings
this month, its first since the company was embroiled in India&#8217;s
biggest corporate fraud probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theravance Inc. (THRX US) rose 6.1 percent to $18.23, the
highest price since September 2009. GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK LN)
and Theravance said a study showed their experimental Relovair
drug was safe and improved lung function in patients with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vical Inc. (VICL US) plunged 32 percent to $2.62 for the
biggest loss in Russell 2000 Index. Sanofi-Aventis SA (SAN FP)
said a drug developed by Vical that had showed promise in
restoring blood vessel growth in damaged limbs was no better
than a placebo in an advanced test. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netezza Corp., a computer-data
warehousing company, was sued by a shareholder who contends his
stock is undervalued in a $1.7 billion buyout offer from
International Business Machines Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials of Marlborough, Massachusetts-based Netezza and
IBM structured the $27-a-share offer to unfairly scare off other
bidders interested in the company, Netezza investor Anthony
Kolton contends in his Delaware Chancery Court lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Netezza&#8217;s directors have not acted in a manner designed
to obtain the highest price reasonably available to
shareholders,&#8221; lawyers for Kolton said in the complaint, filed
yesterday in Wilmington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netezza, whose clients include NYSE Euronext and Estee
Lauder Cos., integrates hardware with programs that store and
analyze data. It&#8217;s one of the few data-warehousing companies
that has gained customers, making it an attractive buy for large
technology corporations looking to increase sales, Keith Bachman, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said Sept. 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano said in May he&#8217;s
planning to spend about $20 billion on acquisitions in the next
five years. Armonk, New York-based IBM is the world&#8217;s biggest
computer-services company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither Glenn Zimmerman, a Netezza spokesman, nor Emily Horn, an IBM spokeswoman, immediately returned a call and e-mail
seeking comment on Kolton&#8217;s suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Record Revenues&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, Netezza executives said strong demand for data-
warehousing services had analysts predicting 30 percent revenue
growth for the company this year, lawyers for Kolton said in the
suit. The firm is experiencing &#8220;record revenues and operating
income,&#8221; Jim Baum, Netezza&#8217;s CEO, told investors earlier this
year, according to the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That performance warrants a higher price than IBM is paying
for the computer firm, Kolton contends. The $27 offer is only
about a 10 percent premium to Netezza&#8217;s closing price on the
preceding trading day, the suit notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is an exceptionally low price for Netezza,&#8221; the
complaint said. The company&#8217;s board and IBM also have inserted a
so-called no solicitation provision in the deal and set up a $56
million termination fee to dissuade other bidders, the suit
contends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has spent more than $20 billion on 100 purchases since
Palmisano took over in 2002, as he shifts IBM&#8217;s focus to
software and services from hardware. His largest purchase was
business-management software maker Cognos Inc. at $5 billion.
The Netezza deal will be his sixth purchase of more than $1
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netezza rose 27 cents, or almost 1 percent, to $28.19 at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, after
earlier rising as much as 3.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Anthony Kolton v. Netezza Corp., 5836, Delaware
Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s
biggest software maker, plans to sell $4.75 billion of bonds a
day after its board boosted the company&#8217;s dividend and approved
the issuance of as much as $6 billion in new debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proceeds may be used to fund working capital, capital
expenditures, stock buybacks and acquisitions, the Redmond,
Washington-based company said today in a regulatory filing that
didn&#8217;t disclose the size or timing of the sale. The bonds may be
sold as soon as today, said a person familiar with the
transaction said, who declined to be identified as terms aren&#8217;t
set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is marketing the debt after yields on investment-
grade corporate bonds fell to 3.73 percent yesterday, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch, the lowest since daily records
began on Oct. 31, 1986. Demand for the securities, from one of
only four nonfinancial U.S. companies with the top credit grade,
will be &#8220;huge across the globe,&#8221; said Mirko Mikelic, a money
manager at Fifth Third Asset Management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s going to be a name everyone&#8217;s going to
want,&#8221; said Mikelic, who helps oversee $13 billion of fixed-
income assets in Grand Rapids, Michigan. &#8220;It&#8217;s a triple-A
credit, great company, well-run, what&#8217;s there not to like, other
than the pricing?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft plans to sell $1 billion each of 3-, 10- and 30-
year bonds and $1.75 billion of 5-year debt, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projected Yields &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3-year notes may yield 25 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, the 5-year debt may pay a spread of
40 basis points, the 10-year securities may yield 55 basis
points more than benchmarks, and the 30-year bonds may pay a
spread of 83 basis points, the person said. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will use proceeds to pay for dividends and
share repurchases because much of its cash is held overseas, a
person familiar with the matter said last week. Peter Wootton, a
spokesman for the company, wasn&#8217;t immediately available to
comment today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard  Poor&#8217;s and Moody&#8217;s Investors Service also rank
Exxon Mobil Corp., Johnson  Johnson and Automatic Data
Processing Inc. as AAA, or an equivalent Aaa, the same level
they assign to U.S. government debt. JJ sold $1.1 billion of
bonds at the lowest interest rates on record for 10-year and 30-
year securities last month, according to Citigroup Inc. data
going back to 1981. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Treasury markets have lower rates than mid-August and
that creates the likelihood that Microsoft will price at lower
rates than the JJ deal,&#8221; said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income
strategist and economist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in
Philadelphia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overseas Cash &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft reported $36.8 billion in cash and short-term
investments at the end of last quarter. Much of that is held
overseas, forcing the company to pay taxes on any of the money
used for dividends or stock repurchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company boosted its quarterly dividend by 3 cents, or
23 percent, to 16 cents a share yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This higher dividend, combined with our ongoing share
repurchase program, reflects our commitment to returning capital
to our shareholders and our confidence in the long-term growth
of the company,&#8221; Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein
said yesterday in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You can take it as a sign of soft expected future stock-
market performance,&#8221; LeBas said. &#8220;Microsoft doesn&#8217;t have a lot
of acquisition opportunities, doesn&#8217;t have a lot to do
internally, apparently, with this capital, so they&#8217;re giving it
back to shareholders.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft sold its first bond in May 2009, a $3.75 billion
offering, in a bid to diversify its capital structure and add to
its cash pile for acquisitions, capital expenses and share
buybacks. The sale comprised $2 billion of 2.95 percent, 5-year
notes; $1 billion of 4.2 percent, 10-year debt; and $750 million
of 5.2 percent, 30-year bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, Microsoft raised $1.15 billion of interest-free
financing from its first sale of convertible bonds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. hired Cantor
Fitzgerald LP&#8217;s former head of debt capital markets, Irvin Goldman, to help manage the second-largest U.S. bank&#8217;s capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman, who left Cantor in 2007, started this month as a
managing director for JPMorgan&#8217;s chief investment office,
according to a person familiar with the matter who declined to
be identified because the hire wasn&#8217;t announced publicly. The
group manages the interest rate and foreign exchange risks of
JPMorgan&#8217;s day-to-day transactions and invests its corporate
portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tasha Pelio, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined to
comment, as did Goldman, reached at his office at the New York-
based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman left Cantor after helping to rebuild the broker&#8217;s
businesses following the September 2001 terrorist attacks on the
World Trade Center, which killed 658 of its 960 New York-based
employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cantor hired Goldman in June 2003 to expand its bond sales
and trading business and build an asset management unit. Cantor
was named a primary dealer by the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York in 2006, becoming the first addition in more than two years
to the group of firms that trade directly with the central bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before joining Cantor, Goldman worked 13 years at Credit
Suisse First Boston and ran sales and trading for interest-rate
products, according to a 2003 statement on Cantor&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mylan Inc. sued U.K. drugmaker
GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Apotex Inc. to stop them from selling
the antidepressant Paxil CR as a generic drug, claiming the
sales violate an exclusive licensing contract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mylan, the largest U.S.-based generic-drug company, said
Glaxo pledged that it would be the only company selling copies
of Paxil in controlled-release form as part of a 2007 settlement
of a patent suit. Instead, Glaxo is letting Toronto-based Apotex
sell the brand-name drug without the label, under the chemical
name paroxetine hydrochloride, according to Mylan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allowing the sale of the so-called authorized generic would
undercut Mylan sales and cause an &#8220;irretrievable loss of market
share and customers&#8221; for generic Paxil CR, Mylan said in a
complaint filed Sept. 20 in federal court in Trenton, New
Jersey. Mylan asked the court to rule that Glaxo breached the
agreement and that Apotex can&#8217;t sell the authorized generic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apotex, Canada&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, and Glaxo planned to
launch an authorized generic version of Paxil CR in 12.5-, 25-
and 37.5-milligram forms, according to the complaint. Sales were
to begin yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since May 2008, Mylan&#8217;s generic version generated
&#8220;hundreds of millions of dollars in sales&#8221; in the U.S.,
according to the complaint. Mylan reported $5 billion in sales
last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2007 accord followed a lawsuit by London-based Glaxo
against Mylan, claiming a generic version of Paxil CR would
infringe a patent that expires in 2019. The agreement had
provisions to allow other generic versions of Paxil CR to enter
the market before the patent expired. Glaxo hasn&#8217;t followed
those terms, Mylan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mylan, based in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, said then it was
the first generic-drug maker to seek regulatory approval for the
12.5-milligram and 25-milligram forms of Paxil CR. The regular
form of Paxil has multiple copies on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Glaxo, Mary Anne Rhyne, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a call and e-mail seeking comment. A
spokesman for Apotex, Elie Betito, also didn&#8217;t return a call and
e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Mylan Inc. v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 10-cv-
4809, U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey
(Trenton). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GlaxoSmithKline Sues Roche, Unit Over Herceptin Patents &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GlaxoSmithKline Plc, the U.K.-based drugmaker, sued rivals
Roche Holding Ltd. and its unit Genentech Inc. over patents for
a technology used to make the breast-cancer drug Herceptin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GlaxoSmithKline, in a complaint filed Sept. 20 in federal
court in Wilmington, Delaware, alleged that Roche and Genentech,
in manufacturing their cancer therapy, were infringing
&#8220;antibody purification&#8221; inventions covered by patents issued
in 2008 and last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;GSK has been damaged by defendants&#8217; infringement,&#8221; the
London-based company alleged in its complaint. The company seeks
compensatory damages for any infringement up to the date a
judgment is entered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genentech, based in South San Francisco, California, was
acquired by Basel, Switzerland-based Roche last year. The
companies derived almost $5.2 billion from U.S. sales of
Herceptin last year, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genentech filed a reciprocal action at the U.S. court in
San Francisco yesterday, seeking a judge&#8217;s finding that it
hadn&#8217;t infringed the same two patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristina Becker, a spokeswoman for Genentech, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment. There
was no immediate reply to a voice-mail message seeking comment,
left with Glaxo&#8217;s media relations department in Research
Triangle, North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wilmington case is GlaxoSmithKline LLC v. Roche Holding
Ltd., 1:10-cv-00799-UNA, U.S. District Court for Delaware
(Wilmington). The California case is Genentech Inc. v.
GlaxoSmithKline LLC, 5:10-cv-04255, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ivi Seeks Declaration It doesn&#8217;t Infringe Disney, Fox, MLB &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co., Major League Baseball and eight other
television content owners were sued by a Seattle-based start-up
Internet company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For $4.99 per month Ivi Inc. provides subscribers with
technology to view on the Internet programming that the content
owners originally broadcast over the air. Ivi&#8217;s technology works
with any Windows, Macintosh or Linux computer and eventually
will be available for mobile devices, tablets and set-top boxes,
the company says on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company asked a federal court in Seattle to declare
that it isn&#8217;t infringing any copyrights. Each of the defendants
has &#8220;expressly accused&#8221; Ivi of copyright infringement, the
company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ivi claims that copyright law authorized secondly
transmission of copyrighted works embodied in primary
transmissions, such as those from the content owners. It&#8217;s
arguing that because copyright law permits secondary
transmission upon payment of licensing fees, its actions are
permissible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Disney and Major League Baseball, the
defendants are Seattle-based Fisher Communications Inc., NBC
Universal Inc., CBS Broadcasting Inc., the CW Television
Stations Inc., News Corp&#8217;s Fox Television Stations and Twentieth
Century Fox Film units, WGBH Educational Foundation and
WNET.org. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ivi asked the court for awards of attorney fees and
litigation costs. The company is represented by Lawrence D.
Graham and David A. Lowe of Black Lowe  Graham PLLC of Seattle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Ivi Inc. V. Fisher Communications Inc., 2:10-
cv-01512, U.S. District Court, Western District of Washington
(Seattle). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kohl&#8217;s Sued, Accused of Infringing &#8216;I Rock&#8217; T-shirt Design &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kohl&#8217;s Corp., a Menomonee, Wisconsin-based department-store
chain, was sued for copyright infringement by a Minnesota
artist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heidi Panelli and her Panelli Design accused Kohl&#8217;s of
selling T-shirts that infringe her copyright-protected designs.
She objects to a t-shirt she says is similar to her &#8220;I Rock&#8221;
work featuring stick-figure characters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The artist is known for her &#8220;BusyBodies&#8221; designs of stick
figures performing various activities. They are sold through her
www.ibusybodies.com website and in addition to the &#8220;I Rock&#8221;
image, include &#8220;I Camp,&#8221; &#8220;I Defend,&#8221; &#8220;I Farm,&#8221; &#8220;I
Preach&#8221; and &#8220;I Garden.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panelli, who first created her BusyBodies works in 1999,
registered all her designs with the U.S. copyright notice. She
learned of the alleged infringement earlier this year when she
saw the &#8220;I Rock&#8221; shirt for sale at a Kohl&#8217;s store in
Minnesota, she said in the complaint she filed Sept. 17 in
federal court in Minnesota. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shirts sold at Kohl&#8217;s also infringe her trademarks and
trade dress, Panelli said in her pleadings. The public is likely
to be confused about the source of the shirts at Kohl&#8217;s, and
Panelli&#8217;s business reputation will be hurt and she will lose
goodwill and profits as a result, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She asked the court to halt the production and sale of the
allegedly infringing items, and seeks destruction of all
infringing material. She also asked for money damages, including
Kohl&#8217;s profits attributable to the t-shirt sales, and awards of
attorney fees and litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panelli is represented by Edward P. Sheu and Kristin L.
Peterson of Best  Flanagan LLP of Minneapolis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Heidi Panelli v. Kohl&#8217;s Corp., 0:10-cf-03969-
MJD-FLHN, U.S. District Court, District of Minnesota. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Righthaven Loses Round in Las Vegas Newspaper Copyright Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Righthaven LLC, which has sued more than 200 website
operators for allegedly infringing copyrights to stories
appearing in the Las Vegas Review-Journal, received a setback in
one of the cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Gloria M. Navarro rejected Righthaven&#8217;s
request for a default judgment against the operators of the
skyscrapercity.com website. Jan Klerks and Stichting
Wolkenkrabbers were sued in federal court in Las Vegas on May 19
over the posting of an article from the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge said in her Sept. 17 order that the defendants
raised a reasonable defense that their posting the article
didn&#8217;t have any negative effect on the market for the original
work. She acknowledged their argument that the same article was
viewable by the public for free at the newspaper&#8217;s website and
is still available for free through a Google search. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said the issue would need to be resolved in later
litigation, so granted the defendants&#8217; request to set aside a
default judgment. The judge also noted that the defendants
hadn&#8217;t been served with a complaint and that their address was
incorrectly given in the court filings. They also retained
counsel and filed a motion to set aside the default as soon as
they knew of the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defendants are represented by Michael J. McCue and
Nikkya J. Williams of Phoenix-based Lewis  Roca LLP. Righthaven
is represented by in-house counsel John Charles Coons and Steven
A. Gibson of Dickinson Wright PLLC of Las Vegas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Righthaven LLC v. Jan Klerks, 2:10-cv-00741-
GMN-LRL, U.S. District Court, District of Nevada (Las Vegas). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bikinis Bar Sued by Republic of Texas Biker Rally Over Marks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republic of Texas Biker Rally Inc., the sponsor of a
motorcycle rally that draws 45,000 motorcycles and 200,000
spectators each year to Austin, Texas, sued a chain of sports
bars for trademark infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bikinis Bar  Grill LLC of Austin is accused of using the
bike rally&#8217;s trademarks without authorization. According to the
complaint, Bikinis Bar used the marks in posters and handbills
promoting food specials, musical acts and bikini contests. It&#8217;s
also accused of manufacturing men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s T-shirts and
tank tops incorporating the marks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rally sponsors accused Bikinis of trying to piggyback
onto the fame and goodwill of the rally, which gives Austin a
$35 million economic boost every year. The bar creates &#8220;the
false impression&#8221; that its events and goods are legitimate
products endorsed by the rally, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rally seeks court orders for the seizure and
destruction of all allegedly infringing merchandise and
promotional material, and a ban on future infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the company seeks money damages, profits the
bar derived from its alleged infringement, and extra damages to
punish the bar for its actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case was originally filed in Texas state court and
moved Sept. 20 to federal court in Austin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rally is represented by Carl F. Schwenker of the Law
Offices of Carl F. Schwenker in Austin. The bar chain is
represented by David A. Buono II and Mitchell D. Savrick of
Austin&#8217;s Savrick Schumann Johnson McGarr Kaminski  Shirley LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;After learning of the claims, Bikinis Bar and Grill
started an investigation and plans to exchange information with
the ROT Rally on an informal basis,&#8221; Buono said in an e-mail.
&#8220;Bikinis Gar  Grill hopes that any dispute between the parties
can be resolved in a timely manner.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Republic of Texas Biker Rally Inc., v. Bikinis
Bar  Grill LLC, 1:10-cv-00697-SS, U.S. District Court, Western
District of Texas (Austin). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors looking for gains amid
the biggest U.S. stock rally since April 2009 should purchase
bullish options on companies such as Citigroup Inc. and Devon
Energy Corp., according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs recommended calls on stocks that have trailed
their industry-group performance in the past month, have &#8220;buy&#8221;
ratings from the firm&#8217;s analysts and are judged to be able to
exceed analysts&#8217; price estimates by more than 15 percent, and
whose options that are &#8220;inexpensive&#8221; relative to peers.
Purchasing the calls offers the potential for gains even after
stocks rose this month, equity derivatives strategists John Marshall and Maria Grant said in a report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We screen for opportunities to gain asymmetric upside
exposure to laggards where options are inexpensive and our
analysts have a positive fundamental view,&#8221; the strategists
wrote in a note to investors today. &#8220;If the rally continues, we
expect these fundamentally well-positioned companies to benefit
disproportionately.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 has surged 8.6 percent this month
through yesterday as concern eased that U.S. unemployment and
less spending from indebted European nations would stall the
global economic recovery. The index is on track for its best
month since a 9.4 percent rally 17 months ago amid speculation
the U.S. economy was stabilizing from the worst financial crisis
since the 1930s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup, the New York-based third-largest U.S. lender,
has risen 6.2 percent this month through yesterday, while the SP
500 Financials Index is up 8.9 percent. Devon Energy, the
second-biggest independent oil company in the U.S. by market
value, has climbed 4 percent in that time, trailing the SP
500&#8217;s Oil  Gas Exploration  Production Index&#8217;s 6.9 percent
gain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategists also recommended buying calls on Visa Inc.,
the world&#8217;s biggest payments network; Applied Materials Inc.;
Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.; Lam Research Corp.; AK Steel Holding
Corp.; E*Trade Financial Corp.; Ford Motor Co. and Texas
Instruments Inc., the second-largest U.S. chipmaker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. had their third-quarter earnings estimates cut by
Deutsche Bank AG, which cited weak trading revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s earnings-per-share estimate was lowered to
$1.95 from $3 and Morgan Stanley&#8217;s was trimmed to 15 cents from
50 cents, analysts led by Michael Carrier said in a note to
clients yesterday. The bank has a &#8220;buy&#8221; recommendation on both
stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital markets in the third quarter &#8220;were mostly weak
across the board following a challenging second quarter,
including muted equity trading,&#8221; the Deutsche Bank analysts
said. &#8220;The combination of derisking during the European crises,
ongoing regulatory reform uncertainty and negative macro data
points led investors to stay out of the markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank said it&#8217;s expecting another subdued quarter
at New York-based Goldman Sachs because of poor conditions in
trading and &#8220;soft investment banking.&#8221; Morgan Stanley, also
based in New York, may post a &#8220;weak&#8221; quarter because of its
trading results and slowing revenue from investment banking,
asset management and wealth management, the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs fell $1.90, or 1.3 percent, to $149.50 at
12:03 p.m. in New York trading, while Morgan Stanley dropped 59
cents, or 2.3 percent, to $25.47. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. raised its
quarterly dividend by 3 cents, or 23 percent, to 16 cents a
share and got approval from its board to sell as much as $6
billion in additional debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This higher dividend, combined with our ongoing share
repurchase program, reflects our commitment to returning capital
to our shareholders and our confidence in the long-term growth
of the company,&#8221; Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein
said yesterday in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is planning to sell debt this year to pay for
dividends and share repurchases because much of its cash is held
overseas, a person familiar with the matter said last week. The
company will try to raise as much as possible without
jeopardizing its debt rating of AAA, the highest available, said
the person, who declined to be named because the plans are
confidential and not completed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dividend increase was a sign Microsoft is confident in
its ability to generate cash, said Brent Thill, an analyst at
UBS AG in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While not as high as some Street expectations, it was a
larger incremental increase than the 2-cent dividend hike
Microsoft&#8217;s board approved in fiscal year 2009,&#8221; he said in a
note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Meaningful&#8217; Acquisition? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. has sold $6.06
billion of corporate bonds for Texas-based energy companies,
excluding utilities, so far this year, more than the $5.03
billion it sold in all of 2009 and the highest amount in at
least a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank, based in New York, is the top arranger of
corporate bonds for coal, oil and natural-gas companies in the
Lone Star state this year with 20 percent of the market, the
largest share controlled by a single firm since 2003, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy producers and companies that provide them with
equipment and pipeline services are benefiting from borrowing
costs near the lowest on record, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data. They&#8217;re also capitalizing on investor
discontent with equity markets, said Sean Sexton with Fitch
Ratings Ltd. The value of JPMorgan&#8217;s Texas energy-bond sales
rose even as they fell in number to 25 from 37 in all of 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even for companies with no near-term need for cash, now&#8217;s
a smart time to refinance bonds set to mature in the latter half
of 2011 or 2012 because nobody&#8217;s sure if interest rates will
still be this low by then,&#8221; said Sexton, managing director of
energy, chemicals and commodities for New York-based Fitch.
&#8220;They&#8217;ve got to strike while the iron&#8217;s hot.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy company bond yields fell to 4.04 percent on Aug. 24,
the lowest on record going back to December 1996, Bank of
America Merrill Lynch&#8217;s U.S. Corporates Energy index shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The securities yield 4.07 percent as of Sept. 21, compared
with the overall investment-grade U.S. corporate bond market&#8217;s
yield of 3.73 percent, index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motiva, ATP &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s biggest Texas energy deals this year included $1
billion in 10- and 30-year bonds sold for Motiva Enterprises
LLC, a joint venture between Saudi Arabia&#8217;s state-owned oil
company and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, and $750 million in 5-year
debt for ATP Oil  Gas Corp. Both are Houston-based. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost two-thirds of JPMorgan&#8217;s Texas energy debt sales
occurred during the first half of the year, when the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 equity index lost 7.6 percent of its value. The bank
has dominated the Texas energy debt market for seven of the past
11 years, Bloomberg data showed. Justin Perras, a JPMorgan
spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Group AG was the second-biggest underwriter
this year with $3.07 billion in debt sales for Texas energy
companies on 12 issuances. Duncan King, a spokesman for Credit
Suisse, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year&#8217;s second-best performer, Citigroup Inc., fell to
fourth with $2.87 billion in debt sales, down from $4.2 billion
in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denbury Resources &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The size of JPMorgan&#8217;s Texas underwriting this year ranged
from Motiva&#8217;s $1 billion debt sale to a $50 million issuance for
Plains Exploration  Production Co., a Houston-based oil and gas
explorer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denbury Resources Inc. was JPMorgan&#8217;s highest-paying Texas-
based energy client on a percentage basis. The Plano, Texas-
based oil producer was charged a 2 percent fee on $200 million
in 15-year bonds, Bloomberg data showed. That was more than
double the average 0.963 percent fee JPMorgan collected from the
Texas energy sector this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil, gas, coal, oilfield-equipment and pipeline companies
based in Texas sold $30.1 billion in debt during the year
through Sept. 17, compared with $36.6 billion for all of 2009,
Bloomberg data showed. The average size of each deal expanded to
$684 million from $530 million in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before this year, the last time a single firm controlled
more than one-fifth of the Texas energy debt market was in 2003,
when Citigroup underwrote $2.66 billion in sales, or 22 percent
of the market, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. may overtake rivals
such as Exxon Mobil Corp., BG Group Plc and state companies in
Indonesia and Algeria to become the fourth-largest liquefied
natural gas producer as new ventures start, an official said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron may climb to be second behind Royal Dutch Shell Plc
among non-state companies in 2020, Stephen Del Regno, managing
director for Asia, said at the World LNG Series conference in
Singapore today. Projects in Australia, Africa and South-East
Asia will boost supplies will boost Chevron from its current
ranking of 20 among all producers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s Gorgon and Wheatstone ventures in Australia are
among A$200 billion ($192 billion) of proposed LNG ventures in
the Pacific nation targeting Asian demand for cleaner-burning
alternatives to coal, according to figures from the Australian
Petroleum Production  Exploration Association. The biggest of
the projects is Chevron&#8217;s A$43 billion Gorgon development on
Barrow Island off the northwestern coast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The share of Asian LNG purchases in the global mix will
drop to 54 percent by 2020 from 64 percent in 2015 as European
LNG purchases rise, according to the presentation. Asia&#8217;s share
was about 63 percent last year, according to BP Plc&#8217;s annual
energy review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qatar Petroleum Ltd. will retain its position as the
world&#8217;s biggest supplier in 2020, according to a presentation by
Del Regno, based on Wood Mackenzie Research Consultancy data.
Shell will be second and Algeria&#8217;s Sonatrach third. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron said on Sept. 16 that it aims to supply China
National Petroleum Corp., the nation&#8217;s largest oil company, with
LNG from its proposed Wheatstone project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LNG is natural gas that&#8217;s been chilled to liquid form for
transportation by ship to destinations not connected by pipeline. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonds from Microsoft Corp., the
world&#8217;s largest software maker, rose on their first day of
trading amid investor demand for top-rated corporate debt that&#8217;s
outstripping limited supply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s $1 billion of 30-year, 4.5 percent debt rose
0.274 cent to 99.185 cents on the dollar, according to Trace,
the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. The company&#8217;s bonds were the most actively
traded U.S. corporate securities, with 314 transactions of more
than $1 million, Trace data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft is one of only four
non-financial U.S. companies with top credit ratings, making it
attractive to institutional investors that are required to buy
investment-grade debt, said Guy LeBas, a fixed-income strategist
with Janney Montgomery Scott LLC. The others with the same AAA
grade -- Automatic Data Processing, Johnson  Johnson and Exxon
Mobil Corp. -- aren&#8217;t likely to issue bonds soon, LeBas said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s virtually no supply of that debt,&#8221; said LeBas,
whose Philadelphia-based firm provides financial advisory
services. Johnson  Johnson issued 30-year debt last month
that&#8217;s tied with Microsoft for the lowest coupon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft sold $4.75 billion of bonds yesterday in a four-
part offering, including three- and five-year maturities at the
lowest coupons on record. The software maker issued $1 billion
of 0.875 percent notes due in 2013 and $1.75 billion of 1.625
percent debt maturing in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s debt is &#8220;almost Treasury like&#8221; in its lack
of risk, said William Larkin, who helps manage $500 million in
fixed-income assets at Cabot Money Management in Salem,
Massachusetts. The software maker reported $36.8 billion in cash
and short-term investments at the end of last quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s $1 billion of 3 percent bonds due in 2020
climbed 0.872 cent to 100.008 cents on the dollar. Bonds often
rise in first-day trading because initial offerings are priced
with slightly wider spreads to make sure they&#8217;re sold, LeBas
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks fell, sending the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index to its longest drop in a month, as a
deteriorating profit outlook for banks and an increase in
jobless claims overshadowed a rally in technology shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. fell more than
2 percent as Bank of America Corp. cut profit projections and
former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said the U.S.
mortgage market is &#8220;absolutely broken.&#8221; Real estate companies
in the SP 500 slumped 2.7 percent as a group. Apple Inc. rose
for the 17th time in 19 days, briefly passing PetroChina Co. to
become the world&#8217;s second-largest company by market value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 fell 0.8 percent to 1,124.83 at 4 p.m. in New
York, retreating for a third day, the longest losing streak
since Aug. 24. The Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased 76.89
points, or 0.7 percent, to 10,662.42. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It got ugly,&#8221; said Michael Cuggino, who manages about $8
billion at Permanent Portfolio Funds in San Francisco. &#8220;We got
less than thrilling economic news today coupled with comments by
a prominent person. On top of that, the market has had a nice
run. That&#8217;s the recipe for a selloff. We&#8217;re in a period of
anemic economic growth. Investors are reacting accordingly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 has climbed 7.2 percent in September as
technology bellwethers announced buybacks, dividends and
acquisitions. The benchmark for U.S. equities has declined 7.6
percent from this year&#8217;s high in April on concern that American
unemployment and widening budget deficits in Europe would derail
global growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jobless Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks started the day lower after applications for
unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week, a sign
companies remain cautious about hiring as growth slows. Initial
jobless claims increased by 12,000 to 465,000 in the week ended
Sept. 18, Labor Department figures showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 recovered from its lows in the first half hour
and swung between gains and losses for much of the day after the
National Association of Realtors said sales of previously owned
homes rose 7.6 percent in August, more than the median economist
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey that called for a 7.1
percent increase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s just a mixed picture,&#8221; said Peter Sorrentino, who
helps oversee $13.3 billion at Huntington Asset Advisors in
Cincinnati. &#8220;It&#8217;s difficult to say that we&#8217;re seeing material
strengthening of economic activity. The market will be bouncing
between overbought and oversold.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial Slump &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 Financials Index sank 2 percent, the biggest
decline among 10 industries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders retreated after Bank of America cut its third-
quarter earnings estimates for Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and
Morgan Stanley, saying that a &#8220;severe summer slowdown weighs on
trading.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the most profitable firm on Wall Street,
declined 2.1 percent to $144.91. Citigroup slid 2.1 percent to
$3.80, and Morgan Stanley slipped 0.8 percent to $24.74. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyst Dick Bove at Rochdale Securities LLC also slashed
his 2010 and 2011 earnings estimates for Morgan Stanley and cut
this year&#8217;s profit projection for Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon Property Group Inc. led a gauge of real-estate
companies down 2.7 percent, the biggest decline among 24
industries in the SP 500. Creating a new framework for the
private mortgage market &#8220;is a matter of first priority,&#8221;
Volcker, an adviser to President Barack Obama, said at a banking
conference in Chicago. Simon Property fell 2.6 percent to
$92.78. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Tops PetroChina &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple rose 0.4 percent to $288.92, and earlier reached
$292.76. Apple was valued at $267.1 billion as of 2:28 p.m. New
York time, topping PetroChina to become the second-biggest in
the world by market value. At its close, Apple&#8217;s value fell to
$263.9 billion, putting it back in third place. Exxon Mobil
Corp. is the world&#8217;s biggest company, with a value of $311
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piper Jaffray Cos. analyst Gene Munster raised his 2011
earnings estimate for Apple to $17.75 a share from $16.87 a
share, while boosting his 12-month projection on the shares to
$390 from $371. Munster forecast 2011 Apple iPad sales of 21
million, up from 14.5 million units. He also estimated that the
company will sell 10.7 million units in 2010, making up 94
percent of the global computer-tablet market.
      Red Hat Inc. surged 9 percent to $40.07, the highest price
since April 2000. The largest seller of the Linux operating
system reported second-quarter profit of 19 cents a share,
beating the average analyst estimate by 2.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nvidia Corp. gained 2 percent to $11.62. The maker of chips
for computer-graphics cards was raised to &#8220;outperform&#8221; from
&#8220;market perform&#8221; at BMO Capital Markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Stocks Look Cheap&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Stocks look cheap, especially in the technology
industry,&#8221; said David Goerz, who oversees $17 billion at
Highmark Capital Management Inc. in San Francisco. &#8220;If the
economy is not going to experience a double dip, earnings will
continue to grow and the equity market should do very well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bed Bath  Beyond gained 3.2 percent to $43.40. The home
furnishings retailer increased its profit-growth forecast for
2010 to 20 percent from 15 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington Post Co. rallied 4.3 percent to $375.75. The
namesake owner of the fifth-largest U.S. newspaper by
circulation plans to buy back as many as 750,000 Class B shares.
The amount is about 10 percent of the Class B stock outstanding
and includes 16,312 shares that remained under a previous
buyback authorization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Failure by Congress to extend Bush-
era tax cuts even temporarily may erase U.S. economic growth in
the first half of next year, according to Alec Phillips, an
economist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross domestic product would be cut by almost 2 percentage
points if Congress fails to extend the tax cuts, due to expire
Dec. 31, along with temporary tax credits under the 2009
stimulus bill as well as relief from the alternative minimum
tax, Phillips calculates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even a temporary lapse in the tax provisions &#8220;would
essentially wipe out most of the modest growth we expect in the
first half of 2011,&#8221; Phillips wrote in a research note released
yesterday. He said in a phone interview that a higher tax rate
in the first two months of the year would have that effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America-Merrill Lynch&#8217;s global strategy group also
issued an update yesterday predicting that &#8220;Congress will be
gridlocked through year end.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Having consulted BofAML legislative advisers, it is now
the view of U.S. Equity Strategy that Congress is unlikely to
pass any tax package before the Bush tax cuts expire at 2011
start,&#8221; David Bianco, the firm&#8217;s chief U.S. equity strategist,
wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Fear of Tax Hikes&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fear of across-the-board tax hikes in 2011 is likely to
constrain growth&#8221; in both household spending and business
hiring and capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2010,
Bianco said. He said the &#8220;The setback to confidence is likely
to prevent&#8221; the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index from reaching a
forecast target of 1,300 points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama and most Democrats want tax cuts
enacted under former President George W. Bush extended for
individuals who earn less than $200,000 a year and couples
earning less than $250,000. Republican leaders in Congress want
the tax cuts extended for all income groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democratic Senators Dick Durbin of Illinois and Tom Harkin
of Iowa today expressed doubt the Senate will vote on extending
the cuts before leaving to campaign for November elections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I see the value of a vote, but given the short time-
frame, it may be difficult,&#8221; Durbin, the second-ranking
Democrat, said in Washington. He said legislators are &#8220;so
tightly wound up in this campaign&#8221; that a bipartisan agreement
won&#8217;t be reached as the House may adjourn as early as next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Phillips predicts Congress will allow the
tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans to expire while extending
middle-class tax cuts, the &#8220;Making Work Pay&#8221; payroll-tax
credit and relief from the alternative minimum tax. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Prospects Uncertain&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;However, with essentially no congressional action to
date, the prospects for such an extension are uncertain,&#8221;
Phillips wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs this month forecast economic growth at a 1.5
percent annual rate in the first quarter of 2011 and 2 percent
in the second quarter, according to a Bloomberg News survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delaying a vote on the tax cuts also may hurt confidence
among business owners and consumers, said Ethan Harris, head of
North American economics at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch in New
York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s about psychology, and I think it&#8217;s already happening
right now,&#8221; Harris said in an interview. &#8220;Why is the corporate
sector unwilling to engage here? I think the answer is there are
too many uncertainties.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most likely, Congress will wait &#8220;until the last minute&#8221;
this year to reach an agreement, Harris said. If they delay into
February, that would be &#8220;enough to put the economy easily into
a recession in the first quarter,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuts Into GDP &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Letting all of the roughly $270 billion in tax cuts lapse
would subtract almost 10 percentage points from annualized
disposable income growth in the first quarter of 2011,  Phillips
said in his note. That could reduce final demand by about 2
percentage points in the first half of 2011 and cut gross
domestic product by almost the same amount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Income tax rates now are at 10 percent, 15 percent, 25
percent, 28 percent, 33 percent and 35 percent. If Congress
doesn&#8217;t act, they&#8217;ll revert to 15 percent, 28 percent, 31
percent, 36 percent and 39.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. is developing a process that may pack more music on Apple
Inc.&#8217;s iPod Nanos or make solar panels more efficient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM scientists are unveiling today a technique for
observing atomic reactions in real-time. It may help
manufacturers make smaller devices with greater memory, Spike
Narayan, an IBM researcher, said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s easy to make things on a small scale, but to
understand how things behave going down to the smaller scale,
that&#8217;s really what&#8217;s needed,&#8221; said Narayan, who manages science
and technology at IBM&#8217;s Almaden Research Center in San Jose,
California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider,
invested about $6 billion, or about 6 percent of its sales, in
research projects last year. The company is aiming to design
more efficient methods to process and store information as
customers demand more computing power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technique may enable manufacturers to make hard-drives
that hold 1,000 times more data than now, said Rob Enderle, a
principal analyst at Enderle Group. One version of the iPhone 4,
Apple&#8217;s newest model with features including video calls, Web
surfing and a music player, has a capacity of 32 gigabytes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Think of iPhones that, instead of having gigabytes, have
terabytes -- that&#8217;s what this could mean,&#8221; Enderle said. One
terabyte is equivalent to about 1,000 gigabytes. &#8220;It allows
them to put vastly more data in a vastly smaller space,&#8221; the
San Jose-based analyst said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atom Magnetism &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a special microscope that images atoms, scientists
moved an atom with voltage and measured its magnetism at various
points, observing how it acted at a speed 1 million times faster
than has been possible. The study enabled them to time how long
an atom can hold 1 byte of data. For an iron atom on a copper
surface, it was 200 nanoseconds, comparable to typical dynamic
random access memory, which is used in personal computers,
Narayan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now scientists may use the technique to see how certain
combinations hold data, and how few atoms are needed for various
functions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observing atom&#8217;s reactions in real-time also has
implications outside the storage industry, Narayan said.
Scientists could manipulate how atoms react to light, helping
make solar panels more efficient, he said. The technique could
help study how atoms in bodies consume energy, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, based in Armonk, New York, makes about $1 billion a
year in licensing revenue, according to regulatory filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month, IBM Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano
criticized rival Hewlett Packard Co. for cutting investments in
research and development, saying it forces them to pay more for
acquisitions. HP agreed to pay $2.35 billion this month for
data-storage maker 3Par, after a bidding contest with Dell Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM fell 90 cents to $131.67 at 4:01 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares are little changed this
year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. is urging an
overhaul of U.S. laws for electronic privacy to help new
services such as cloud computing, a technology that may double
sales in five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As more data are stored on remote servers and away from
personal computers, a 1986 digital law needs to be updated to
give consumers confidence their information is protected, Brad Smith, Microsoft&#8217;s general counsel, said yesterday at a Senate
Judiciary Committee hearing in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The law needs to catch up,&#8221; Smith said after the
hearing. Cloud computing is &#8220;a critical part of the future and
quite central to all that we&#8217;re doing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collecting and storing data using remote computer servers,
called cloud computing, may generate global sales of $148.8
billion by the end of 2014, up from $58.6 billion last year,
according to researcher Gartner Inc. in Stamford, Connecticut.
If consumers worry about online security, it could limit the
industry&#8217;s growth, Smith said in prepared testimony. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft sells cloud-computing software such as
HealthVault, which helps patients manage chronic health
conditions by storing data online, and Windows Azure, which lets
a company such as Domino&#8217;s Pizza Inc. manage its orders when
demand is high, Smith said. While the U.S. Constitution shields
letters and telephone calls from government seizure, data
transferred to a third party may lack such protection. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley says investors
should buy the lowest-rated corporate debt, while Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. says stay away, underscoring the dilemma faced by
investors as junk-bond prices rise to the highest since 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds graded CCC in the U.S. are the &#8220;cheapest&#8221; high-
yield securities with &#8220;economic data once again beginning to
surprise to the upside,&#8221; Morgan Stanley told clients yesterday
in a report. Goldman Sachs says higher-rated speculative-grade
debt is the way to go as the economy decelerates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bondholders faced with near-zero interest rates and record-
low yields are turning to higher-risk notes to boost returns,
betting growth will be strong enough to keep defaults in check.
Investors poured $480.2 billion into mutual funds that focus on
debt in the two years ended June 30, more than went into stock
funds during the Internet bubble, according to the Washington-
based Investment Company Institute. That has helped companies
sell a record amount of junk bonds in 2010 with three months
still left in the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A lot of very mediocre to marginal deals have been able
to get out of the gate over the last few months because there&#8217;s
still tremendous risk appetite,&#8221; said Margaret Patel, who
oversees about $1 billion of assets at Wells Fargo  Co.&#8217;s
Advantage Diversified Capital Builder Fund and Advantage
Diversified Income Builder Fund in Boston. &#8220;The economy is at
least growing slowly, but it&#8217;s growing positively, so that&#8217;s a
very, very favorable backdrop for high yield.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices Climb &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices of U.S. corporate bonds rated below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service and less than BBB- by Standard  Poor&#8217;s closed
at an average of 100.4 cents on the dollar yesterday, up from 55
cents in December 2008, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lowest-ranked debt, rated CCC and lower, has done even
better, rising to 89.2 cents from 31.6 cents. The securities
have returned 3 percent this month, with relative yields
averaging 10.9 percentage points more than Treasuries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the securities are beating BB debt by 0.94 percentage
point this month, they&#8217;re trailing for the year. The highest
tier of junk debt has gained 12.4 percent this year compared
with 10.4 percent for bonds rated CCC and lower, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in credit markets, the extra yield investors
demand to own company bonds instead of similar-maturity
government debt rose 1 basis point to 172 basis points, or 1.72
percentage points, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch&#8217;s
Global Broad Market Corporate Index. Yields averaged 3.476
percent, the lowest since reaching the same level Aug. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of insuring Irish debt against default surged to a
record as the government auctioned bills, while Microsoft Corp.
sold bonds yesterday at the lowest interest rates on record as
September issuance continued to surge. Private equity firm KKR 
Co. issued notes for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Offering &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, one of only four non-financial companies rated
AAA by SP and Moody&#8217;s, issued $4.75 billion of debentures one
day after boosting its dividend and getting board approval to
sell debt. The world&#8217;s biggest software maker, based in Redmond,
Washington, raised $1 billion from 0.875 percent three-year
debt, $1.75 billion from 1.625 percent five-year debentures, $1
billion from 3 percent notes due 2020 and $1 billion from 4.5
percent bonds maturing in 2040, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coupon on the three-year security is less than the 1
percent on a similar-maturity note issued last month by
International Business Machines Corp., which was previously the
lowest of the more than 3,500 securities in the Barclays Capital
U.S. Corporate Index of investment-grade company debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KKR Bonds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KKR, which began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in
July, boosted its offering of 10-year senior unsecured notes to
$500 million from $350 million. The notes yield 387.5 basis
points more than Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based firm, founded by Henry Kravis and George Roberts in 1976, raised the cash as it expands beyond
traditional buyouts, in which it pools money from investors to
take over companies, and into capital markets, underwriting
equity and bond offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps insuring Ireland&#8217;s sovereign debt
surged 31 basis points to an all-time high 495.5, according to
data provider CMA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ireland sold 300 million euros of securities due February
2011 today at an average yield of 1.907 percent, compared with
1.925 percent at a Sept. 9 sale, according to the nation&#8217;s debt
agency. It also issued 100 million euros of April 2011
securities at an average yield of 2.231 percent, up from 2.19
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate Risk &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A benchmark indicator of corporate credit risk in the U.S.
climbed for a third day. Credit-default swaps on the Markit CDX
North America Investment Grade Index, which investors use to
hedge against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, increased 1.6 basis points to a mid-price of
112.95 basis points as of 10:07 a.m. in New York, according to
index administrator Markit Group Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower
fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted
debt. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a swap protecting
$10 million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concern the U.S. economy will falter led the Federal
Reserve to say Sept. 21 it&#8217;s willing to ease monetary policy
further to spur growth. Fed policy makers said the pace of
recovery and job growth have &#8220;slowed in recent months.&#8221; The
central bank has kept its target rate for overnight loans
between banks in a range of zero to 0.25 percent since December
2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross Domestic Product &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley forecasts annualized growth in gross
domestic product of 2 percent to 2.5 percent in the second-half
of this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That typically has been an ideal environment for
credit,&#8221; Adam Richmond, a credit strategist at Morgan Stanley
in New York, said yesterday. &#8220;Unless you really think that
we&#8217;re going to double dip, even in zero to 2 percent growth, we
find that high yield holds up OK, even the lower quality
bucket.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s said this week the number of U.S. companies at
greatest risk of default dropped to the lowest level in two
years. Companies rated at or below B3 with a negative outlook
declined to 195 as of Sept. 1 from a high of 288 in June 2009.
Clear Channel Communications Inc. and Energy Future Holdings
Corp., formerly named TXU Corp., were among the biggest
companies on the list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs economists estimate growth at 1.5 percent on
an annualized basis this quarter, next quarter and in the first
period of 2011, said Alberto Gallo, a credit strategist for the
firm in New York. Goldman Sachs has favored BB corporate bonds
over CCC debt since the end of 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Deceleration&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We do like high yield much more in the BB and B space,&#8221;
Gallo said. &#8220;Because of the potential for deceleration in the
economy in the second half of the year, as well as relatively
compressed valuations, we prefer to be in the upper end of high
yield.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average yield on CCC bonds is 12.3 percent, compared
with BB debt that pays 6.5 percent, or a spread over Treasuries
of 465 basis points, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Lower-quality high yield to us is cheaper on a risk-
adjusted valuation than higher-quality high yield,&#8221; Richmond
said. &#8220;Over the next year or so, the right trade is to be long
credit risk and short or neutral on rate risk. The best way to
get the most credit exposure with the least rate exposure is in
lower-quality high yield.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley estimates the 10-year Treasury note yield
will rise to 3 percent this year and to 4.25 percent by the end
of 2011, while Goldman Sachs forecasts 2.5 percent in December
2010 and 3.3 percent a year later. The yield closed at 2.56
percent yesterday in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales Booming &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junk bond sales are booming. Speculative-grade debt
issuance in the U.S. jumped to $187.3 billion this year compared
with $100.1 billion in the same period of 2009, Bloomberg data
show. Companies rated Caa1 or lower by Moody&#8217;s have issued at
least $2.63 billion of bonds this month, compared with $2.56
billion in August and the most since April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has underwritten 84 issues totaling $12.95
billion of high-yield U.S. offerings this year, 6.9 percent of
the market and the sixth-highest amount, Bloomberg data show.
Morgan Stanley is seventh, having helped manage 81 offerings for
$12.7 billion of sales, or 6.8 percent of the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firms helped underwrite Valeant Pharmaceuticals
International&#8217;s two-part, $1.2 billion sale of senior notes on
Sept. 21, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand for the lowest debt is evident with Freescale
Semiconductor Inc., bought in a 2006 leveraged buyout led by
Blackstone Group LP, selling $750 million of notes yesterday
after increasing the size of the offering from $500 million. The
10-year, 10.75 percent debentures are rated Caa2 by Moody&#8217;s and
the equivalent CCC by SP. The Austin, Texas-based chipmaker&#8217;s
$1.265 billion of 8.875 percent notes due 2014 rose 2.94 cents
to 100 cents on the dollar, Trace data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Repsol YPF SA&#8217;s planned sale of
shares in its Brazilian unit is a &#8220;positive trigger&#8221; for the
valuation of Spain&#8217;s biggest oil company, JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It will help to realize a fuller valuation for its pre-
salt discoveries,&#8221; London-based analysts Fred Lucas and Nitin Sharma wrote today in a note. &#8220;Concerns on potential demand
weakness in the local market are overdone. We believe that the
company&#8217;s good exploration track record, pure upstream bias and
well appraised resource base ought to be an attractive
preposition for investors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repsol, which plans to sell about 40 percent of its
Brazilian business through an initial public offering, filed to
sell voting shares in the unit on Aug. 9. The Madrid-based
company is seeking to raise about $4 billion from the stock
sale, valuing the unit at about $10 billion, two people familiar
with the plan said in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan analysts have an &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on
Repsol and increased the share-price estimate to 23 euros from
21 euros. The shares have advanced 0.4 percent in Madrid so far
this year, giving Repsol a market value of 23 billion euros ($31
billion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repsol has stakes in blocks in Brazil&#8217;s Santos, Campos and
Espirito Santo basins, and will invest as much as $5 billion
there from 2010 through 2014, and as much as $9 billion from
2015 through 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2007, Repsol and partners BG Group Plc and Brazil&#8217;s
state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA have found hydrocarbons
in the offshore Carioca, Guara and Iguacu fields in the Santos
Basin&#8217;s BM-S-9 block. These are ultra-deep deposits beneath a
salt layer under the seabed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petrobras, as Brazil&#8217;s state-controlled oil company is
known, estimated in November 2007 that the Santos Basin&#8217;s pre-
salt Tupi field may contain as many as 8 billion barrels of oil,
the largest find in the Americas since Mexico&#8217;s Cantarell field
in 1976. Repsol doesn&#8217;t own a stake in Tupi. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.
sued BHP Billiton Ltd., the world&#8217;s largest mining company, in
Chicago federal court to prevent it from acquiring the
fertilizer maker with a $40 billion hostile offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BHP sought to improve its chances of acquiring Saskatoon-
based Potash Corp. &#8220;on the cheap&#8221; by seeking to &#8220;drive down&#8221;
its share price prior to the Aug. 17 offer, Potash Corp. said
yesterday in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potash Corp., the world&#8217;s largest producer of its namesake
crop nutrient, rejected Melbourne-based BHP&#8217;s $130-a-share offer
as too low. Potash Corp. shares have advanced 31 percent since
Aug. 16, the last trading day before BHP made its proposal, and
are trading above the bid price, indicating investors expect a
higher offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The suit is a defensive mechanism, but also an offensive
tool because it attempts to point out why the stock is
relatively inexpensive on a stand-alone, no-transaction basis,&#8221;
Louis Meyer, an analyst at Oscar Gruss  Son Inc. in New York,
said in a telephone interview. &#8220;The rationale is that the best
defense is a good offense.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BHP said the lawsuit is &#8220;without merit&#8221; and will be
contested &#8220;vigorously,&#8221; in an e-mailed statement.  &#8220;We do not
believe this lawsuit will interfere with or delay our offer&#8221;
for Potash Corp.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potash Corp. alleges BHP made &#8220;false and misleading&#8221;
statements about its offer. BHP allegedly sought to depress the
value of Potash shares to make an acquisition possible by
pledging to develop its Jansen project in Saskatchewan and to
&#8220;run its new mine flat out, flooding the market with potash,&#8221;
Potash Corp. said in the court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan v. BHP Billiton,
10-06024, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
Illinois (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM, Netezza Sued by Shareholder Over Buyout Offer &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netezza Corp., a computer-data warehousing company, was
sued by a shareholder who contends his stock is undervalued in a
$1.7 billion buyout offer from International Business Machines
Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials of Marlborough, Massachusetts-based Netezza and
IBM structured the $27-a-share offer to unfairly scare off other
bidders interested in the company, Netezza investor Anthony
Kolton contends in his Delaware Chancery Court lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Netezza&#8217;s directors have not acted in a manner designed
to obtain the highest price reasonably available to
shareholders,&#8221; lawyers for Kolton said in the complaint, filed
yesterday in Wilmington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netezza, whose clients include NYSE Euronext and Estee
Lauder Cos., integrates hardware with programs that store and
analyze data. It&#8217;s one of the few data-warehousing companies
that has gained customers, making it an attractive buy for large
technology corporations looking to increase sales, Keith
Bachman, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said Sept. 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano said in May he&#8217;s
planning to spend about $20 billion on acquisitions in the next
five years. Armonk, New York-based IBM is the world&#8217;s biggest
computer-services company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baxter International Faces Lawsuit Over Disclosures &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baxter International Inc., a maker of intravenous drugs,
was sued by a pension fund over allegedly misleading public
statements made about the company&#8217;s business prospects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deerfield, Illinois-based Baxter falsely said its plasma-
derivative business would grow, the city of Lakeland, Florida&#8217;s
employee pension plan claims in a complaint filed Sept. 21 in
federal court in Chicago. The plaintiffs seek class-action, or
group, status to represent people who bought the shares from
September 2009 to May 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baxter also failed to disclose to investors that it wasn&#8217;t
complying with a 2006 agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration covering changes made to its Colleague infusion
pump, according to a statement by lawyers for the pension plan
that was distributed by Business Wire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of the misleading statements and omission,
Baxter stock was artificially inflated, according to the
statement. After Baxter disclosed on April 22 the pressures it
faced in its plasma-derivative products business, its shares
fell more than 13 percent to $51.13, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deborah Spak, a Baxter spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t return a call
seeking comment after regular business hours Sept. 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is City of Lakeland Employees Pension Plan v.
Baxter International Inc., 10-06016, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of Illinois (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Cuban Wins Access to Documents in Feud With SEC &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Cuban, who lost a bid to get tossed insider-trading
allegations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, won
access to documents in his ongoing feud with the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Reggie B. Walton in Washington
yesterday ruled that the SEC improperly withheld documents the
billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks requested through the
Freedom of Information Act, that its reasons for withholding
other documents weren&#8217;t detailed enough and that it can&#8217;t take
three years to complete his request for still more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To the extent that the court has found that the defendant
cannot rely on an exemption to withhold a record in its
entirety, the defendant is obligated by the FOIA to produce a
complete or redacted version of the record to the plaintiff, and
must do so forthwith,&#8221; Walton wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal appeals court in New Orleans reinstated Sept.
21 the SEC&#8217;s insider-trading case against Cuban, filed in
federal court in Dallas. The lower-court judge tossed the case
last year. The SEC accuses Cuban of trading on confidential
information when he sold his stake in Mamma.com Inc., a Canadian
Internet search company, just before it announced a private
placement of shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are reviewing the decision,&#8221; John Nester, an SEC
spokesman, said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walton found the agency&#8217;s document search into certain
areas to be inadequate, including Cuban&#8217;s request for &#8220;any
trading history by SEC personnel in Mamma.com Inc. securities.&#8221;
He also asked for documents on several SEC lawyers and on any
investigation into his companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency asked for three years to sift through 107 boxes
on the Momma.com probe, which Walton denied. He said he&#8217;d hold a
hearing on how long the agency should be given. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The most significant thing out of this decision is the
quite-correct skepticism about the three years,&#8221; said Lyle
Roberts, a lawyer for Cuban at Dewey  LeBoeuf LLP in
Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mamma.com is now known as Copernic Inc., based in Montreal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Cuban v. SEC, 09-cv-996, U.S. District Court,
District of Columbia (Washington). The insider-trading case is
SEC v. Cuban, 09-10996, 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals (New
Orleans) and SEC v. Cuban, 08-cv-2050, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of Texas (Dallas). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Manager Devine Wins Bail Using Mother&#8217;s Home &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Devine, the Apple Inc. manager accused of taking
kickbacks in exchange for company secrets, won a judge&#8217;s
permission to be released from prison once a $440,000 lien
against his mother&#8217;s home is posted with the court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a hearing yesterday before U.S. Magistrate Judge
Howard Lloyd in San Jose, California, Devine&#8217;s lawyer, Raphael
Goldman, told Devine&#8217;s mother that it could take a few days for
the lien against her Maryland home to be processed as collateral
supporting a bail bond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devine also posted a bond of $612,407 from his and his
wife&#8217;s foreign bank accounts plus the equity in his home near
San Francisco, while his brother also posted $50,000. Lloyd told
Devine he must &#8220;continue to cooperate with the government to
identify all accounts&#8221; and transfer to the U.S. and pledge as
bail another $313,000 remaining in Korean bank accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you feel he is not doing that, then you come back and
we will talk about it,&#8221; Lloyd told Assistant U.S. Attorney
Michelle Kane, who objected to Devine&#8217;s release until he
accounted for all potential accounts abroad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kane declined to comment after yesterday&#8217;s hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devine, 37, a global-supply manager, was accused of money
laundering and wire fraud in a 23-count indictment unsealed Aug.
13. He has pleaded not guilty to charges that he took at least
$1 million in kickbacks from Asian suppliers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Devine, 10-cr-00603, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of California (San Jose). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC Moves Will Prevent Repeat of Stanford Missteps, Khuzami Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, responding to
a watchdog&#8217;s criticism that it bungled fraud claims against R.
Allen Stanford, has strengthened its investigations and is
pursuing several people linked to the Texas-based executive,
agency officials told lawmakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC has added investigators and improved handling of
tips after Inspector General H. David Kotz faulted the agency&#8217;s
probe of Stanford, who is facing trial for an alleged $7 billion
fraud, Enforcement Director Robert Khuzami said yesterday in
remarks prepared for a Senate Banking Committee hearing. The
agency is &#8220;also vigorously pursuing its case against Stanford
and the others charged in this massive Ponzi scheme,&#8221; Khuzami
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The scope and egregiousness of Stanford&#8217;s conduct and the
resulting injury to investors underscores that it is essential
for us to push forward with our efforts to hold the wrongdoers
accountable and seek maximum investor recovery,&#8221; Khuzami said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khuzami, Carlo di Florio, head of the SEC&#8217;s Office of
Compliance Inspections and Examinations, and Rose Romero,
director of the agency&#8217;s regional office in Fort Worth, Texas,
were called to testify on progress in implementing changes Kotz
proposed in an April report on the Stanford case. Kotz said the
SEC failed to conduct a meaningful probe of Houston-based
Stanford Financial Group Co. until 2005 even though examiners
suspected he was running a Ponzi scheme eight years earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC sued Stanford, 60, in February 2009, claiming his
Antigua-based firm, Stanford International Bank Ltd, defrauded
investors by selling billions of dollars in bogus certificates
of deposit. He is jailed in Houston while awaiting trial on
related criminal charges, and at least three of his top
executives are facing related claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. Prosecutors Charge Five Men in Engineering-Contract Fraud &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. prosecutors charged five men for their alleged
involvement in a ring that used inside information to bid on 66
million pounds ($103 million) worth of contracts in engineering
projects in the energy industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five men, who ranged in age from 54 to 70, were charged
at a London court yesterday with conspiracy to corrupt following
a two-year investigation, the Serious Fraud Office said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some of the defendants were employed by the companies
responsible for the procurement of these projects and are
alleged to have passed confidential information to others who
then offered to provide it to companies bidding for the
contracts in return for a percentage of the contract value,&#8221;
according to the SFO, which investigated the case with the City
of London Police. The names of the companies were not made
public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defendants were released on bail and are scheduled to
appear in court in November. The suspected crimes were committed
between January 2001 and August 2009. The SFO prosecutes complex
fraud, bribery and white collar crime in the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;William Foster Gets Three Years for Real Estate Fraud &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Foster, convicted for his part in a $22 million
real estate investment fraud, was sentenced to three years in
prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foster, 70, was one of three men convicted of cheating
investors in a network of companies named Cobalt, which claimed
to have interests in residential real estate developments
throughout the U.S. The sentence came less than three months
after one of Foster&#8217;s codefendants was sentenced to 85 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood in New York, who sentenced
both men, said she rejected guidelines that called for a life
sentence for Foster because of his poor health and his lower
level of criminal responsibility compared with the other
defendants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Foster, everyone agrees, had a much lesser role than
his two co-conspirators,&#8221; Wood said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foster, Irving Stitsky and Mark Shapiro were convicted by a
jury after a three-week trial that ended in November. Each was
found guilty of two counts of securities fraud, one of mail
fraud, one of wire fraud and one of conspiracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the government, the men defrauded more than
250 investors by inventing a false history for Cobalt; failing
to disclose that the company was owned and controlled by Stitsky
and Shapiro, who were convicted felons; and misstating Cobalt&#8217;s
property interests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Shapiro, 06-cr-357, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney Earnings Leaker Hoxie Admits to Scheme With Boyfriend &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonnie Hoxie, a former assistant to Walt Disney Co.
corporate communications chief Zenia Mucha, admitted in court
that she tried to sell confidential earnings information in a
scheme with her boyfriend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoxie pleaded guilty Sept. 21 to one count of conspiracy to
commit securities fraud and wire fraud, and one count of wire
fraud before U.S. Magistrate Judge Michael Dolinger, according
to Yusill Scribner, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s office
in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of a plea agreement, Hoxie and prosecutors agreed
that federal sentencing guidelines, which are advisory, call for
her to get four to 10 months when she is sentenced by U.S.
District Judge Alvin Hellerstein on Dec. 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Baum, Hoxie&#8217;s lawyer, said in an interview that she
remains free on a $50,000 bond and has returned to her home in
Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoxie, who was employed as Mucha&#8217;s secretary from March
through May 25, admitted to passing information about Disney&#8217;s
quarterly earnings to her boyfriend, Yonni Sebbag, who planned
to sell the information to investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, Sebbag pleaded guilty to wire fraud and
conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud. Sentencing
guidelines call for Sebbag to get 27 to 33 months in prison,
U.S. Magistrate Judge James Cott said in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Hoxie, 10-mag-01113, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Litigation Departments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferies Group Hires Michael Sharp to Be General Counsel &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferies Group Inc., the New York-based securities firm
that added 20 percent more staff in one year, hired Michael J.
Sharp as general counsel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharp, 55, a former Citigroup Inc. lawyer who is leaving
the law firm of WilmerHale, was also named executive vice
president and secretary. He replaces Lloyd H. Feller, who will
retire at the end of the year, Jefferies said Sept. 21 in a
statement. Feller, 68, had been general counsel for eight years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferies has increased its staff in a drive to pick up
capacity from failed investment banks including Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. and Bear Stearns Cos. and profit from a recovery
in the financial-services industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharp had been a partner at WilmerHale since March 2009 and
focused on litigation and enforcement issues for Wall Street
clients. Before that he spent 12 years at Citigroup, where he
was general counsel for global wealth management, consumer
banking and global cards, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FSA Fines U.K. Law Firm Over Lehman-Backed Products &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K.&#8217;s financial regulator fined a law firm and two men
for giving misleading advice to clients when marketing
structured products backed by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Services Authority fined Dundee, Scotland-
based Thorntons Law LLP 35,000 pounds ($55,000) and Michael
Royden, a partner at the firm, 10,500 pounds, the regulator said
in a statement yesterday on its website. The FSA also fined
Robert Peter Yarr, a financial adviser at McClelland Yarr
Financial Services Ltd. in Belfast, 28,000 pounds for not
warning customers about the risks of the products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSA said in October that three firms were facing fines
after it probed sales literature in the 107 million-pound
structured-products market. Lehman&#8217;s September 2008 collapse and
bankruptcy prompted lawsuits by former clients whose assets were
frozen in insolvency proceedings around the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Firms and individuals giving investment advice must
properly assess their clients&#8217; needs and make suitable
recommendations,&#8221; FSA head of enforcement Margaret Cole said in
the statement. &#8220;They must also have the necessary systems and
controls in place to ensure that this happens.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royden was in charge of compliance at Thorntons&#8217; Investment
Services at the time the firm was offering the products from
November 2007 and August 2008. Structured products were
typically marketed as guaranteeing the principal amount of money
invested, even if no returns were possible. After Lehman&#8217;s
collapse, the investors&#8217; original contributions weren&#8217;t repaid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thorntons &#8220;commissioned an independent review of systems,
following which, a number of improvements have been
implemented,&#8221; the firm said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We are
in the process of reviewing each case to ensure that our
obligations regarding redress are met and a number of clients
affected by the FSA findings have already received payment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royden and Yarr didn&#8217;t immediately respond to requests for
comment. All three received the FSA&#8217;s standard 30 percent
discount for cooperating with the probe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pound may be the worst-

of next year as the government cuts spending and the central
bank expands asset purchases, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Aggressive fiscal tightening, along with household and
bank deleveraging evident in a softening housing market and
consumer demand, likely will compel the Bank of England to

dated yesterday. &#8220;With Bank of England policy relegating the
pound to funding-currency status,&#8221; sterling may depreciate to
88 pence per euro by June and drop to $1.47 by the end of 2011,
the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pound rose 0.2 percent to $1.5690 and strengthened 0.6

&lt;p&gt;The Chicago mansion owned by Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase 
Co., went under contract for an undisclosed amount after the
price was cut by about $2.6 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sales agreement for the Gold Coast neighborhood home is
pending, Janet Owen, the listing agent at Sudler Sotheby&#8217;s
International Realty, said in an e-mail yesterday. She declined
to comment further. The property was taken off the market and
put under contract on Sept. 21, according to a local multiple
listing service report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eight-bedroom property was listed at $6.95 million by
Sudler Sotheby&#8217;s, after having an asking price of $9.5 million
earlier this year. It was previously advertised at $10.5 million
by Koenig  Strey GMAC Real Estate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon and his wife, Judith, bought the house in 2000 for
$4.7 million, according to records on the website of the Cook
County Recorder of Deeds. The mansion, which has nine full
bathrooms, was built in the late 1800s and is near Lake Michigan
and Oak Street Beach. Dimon first listed it for sale in April
2007 for $13.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Kelly, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contract was reported yesterday by Crain&#8217;s Chicago
Business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. said Steve Wadsworth will step down as president of the company&#8217;s
Interactive Media Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A replacement will be named shortly, the Burbank,
California-based company said in a statement. In an e-mail to
employees last night, Wadsworth said he&#8217;ll remain through a
transition after Disney Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger
picks his successor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wadsworth, a 17-year veteran, becomes the sixth Disney
division head to leave his job this year. That includes Chief
Financial Officer Tom Staggs and Parks chief Jay Rasulo swapping
roles. John Pleasants, CEO of Playdom, the social games company
Disney bought in July, is the leading candidate for Wadsworth&#8217;s
job, the New York Times reported yesterday, citing unidentified
people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are a number of career adventures and new endeavors
that I have been interested in exploring, but my commitment and
focus have been here at Disney,&#8221; Wadsworth wrote in the e-mail.
&#8220;While there is never a good time to leave a great role at a
great company, for many reasons now is the right time for me to
move on.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courtney Simmons, a spokeswoman for Disney&#8217;s Interactive
division, said Wadsworth was unavailable to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big media companies typically lose money online. Disney&#8217;s
interactive group lost $65 million last quarter, while News
Corp.&#8217;s digital media unit lost $174 million in the quarter
ended in June. CBS Corp. stopped reporting interactive results
after it lost $41.3 million in the first nine months of 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acquisitions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wadsworth has run Disney&#8217;s Interactive group since 1999 and
assumed oversight of video-game operations in 2008. Since paying
$350 million for the kids&#8217; social network Club Penguin three
years ago, Disney has purchased Wideload Games, whose founder
helped create Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s hit &#8220;Halo&#8221; franchise. And in
July, Disney acquired Tapulous, a publisher of music-related
games for Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I am confident that the business is well positioned for
continued significant growth,&#8221; Wadsworth wrote. &#8220;Our recent
re-organization and acquisitions have put in place all of the
elements needed to build a large, high growth, profitable
business across multiple interactive media categories.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s biggest media company, rose 45 cents to
$33.57 at 2:08 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. Before today, it had gained 2.7 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. listed Ford
Motor Co. and Southwest Airlines Co. as among 24 low-priced
cyclical stocks that may lure investors by year-end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improved 2011 earnings estimates and attractive valuations
may help cyclical companies, which are more sensitive to
economic growth, outperform versus so-called defensive stocks,
according to Thomas Lee, the firm&#8217;s chief U.S. equity
strategist. Stocks priced below $22 a share have trailed gains
by the broader equity markets and may begin to rally in the next
three months, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a strong and intuitive relationship between
economic momentum and cyclical outperformance,&#8221; Lee wrote in a
research note today. &#8220;The improved tone of equity markets in
recent weeks is notable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index has climbed 7.2 percent in
September through yesterday as improved economic data has
bolstered optimism in the economic recovery. The benchmark for
U.S. equities was still 7.6 percent below this year&#8217;s high in
April, after falling on concern that American unemployment and
widening budget deficits in Europe would derail global growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US Airways Group Inc., CBS Corp. and Macy&#8217;s Inc. are among
the companies with the highest market capitalizations listed in
the group. Lee selected the 24 cyclical, high-beta companies
with 2011 earnings forecasts that have been raised by analysts
since April, shares priced less than $22 and market
capitalization greater than $1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-beta stocks move the most relative to benchmark
indexes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500&#8217;s rally may continue based on the index&#8217;s
performance in midterm election years, according to Lee.
Equities have risen from mid-September to year-end in 21 of the
past 28 midterm election years. Lee&#8217;s forecast for where the SP
500 will be at the end of the year is 1,300, the highest of the
11 strategists who gave an estimate in a survey by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;History strongly favors equities to outperform in the
fourth quarter,&#8221; Lee said. &#8220;Given the mixed performance of
many asset managers year-to-date, this suggests we should see
performance chasing this year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ireland is &#8220;very unlikely&#8221; to
experience a financial crisis as severe as the one that forced
Greece to seek an international bailout earlier this year, said
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A repeat of the Greek debt turmoil in Ireland is very
unlikely,&#8221; Michael Vaknin, a senior fixed-income strategist at
Goldman in London, said in an e-mailed note. &#8220;With Irish
spreads already at all-time highs, we would argue that
refinancing risks in the Irish debt market is aggressively
priced-in already.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield that investors demand to hold Irish bonds
over German bunds has surged to a record as investors fret about
the country&#8217;s ability to cap the cost of its bank bailout and
cut the budget deficit. The spread today widened 12 basis points
to 430 basis points and has swelled 112 basis points in the past
month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ireland&#8217;s economy contracted 1.2 percent in the second
quarter from the previous three-month period and Goodbody
Stockbrokers said today that the government may need to step up
its austerity drive in December&#8217;s budget. Finance Minister Brian Lenihan said it&#8217;s &#8220;too early&#8221; to signal a tougher budget for
next year. He has pledged to cut the deficit to 3 percent of
gross domestic product by 2013 from 14 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquidity Shortages &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman said that Irish banks can avert liquidity shortages
by turning to the European Central Bank&#8217;s emergency lending
operations. Another positive for Ireland is that the ECB is now
prepared to buy European sovereign debt, unlike at the depths of
the Greek crisis in April and May, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ireland&#8217;s government can also turn to the European Union&#8217;s
rescue fund if needed, Goldman said. The investment bank also
noted that the country has a &#8220;fairly significant&#8221; cash buffer
worth 10 percent of gross domestic product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors have dumped Irish bonds partly on concern that
the cost of nationalizing Anglo Irish Bank Corp. last year will
widen. While the state has already poured 22 billion euros ($29
billion) into the bank, Standard  Poor&#8217;s estimates the final
bill may be 35 billion euros, equivalent to 20 percent of GDP. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enel SpA is in talks with Goldman
Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s infrastructure fund about possibly selling
Endesa SA&#8217;s gas distribution network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negotiations are taking place, said a spokeswoman for Enel,
Italy&#8217;s biggest utility. She declined to be named or provide
additional details. Spanish newspaper Expansion reported today
that Endesa is finalizing a deal to sell its gas network to the
Goldman fund for 800 million euros ($1.07 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The sale of assets is being finalized,&#8221; Guillermo Errea,
a spokesman for Endesa in Madrid, said, declining to confirm or
deny the Expansion report. &#8220;It could be done in the next few
hours but it could also collapse.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in London declined to
comment on the Expansion report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enel owns 92 percent of Endesa after gaining control of the
Spanish power company in 2007. As part of that deal, Endesa
transferred some renewable-energy units to builder Acciona SA
and sold assets to Germany&#8217;s E.ON AG. The company is selling
more units to increase savings after the takeover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, a person with knowledge of the matter
said funds associated with Macquarie Bank Ltd., Goldman Sachs
and Axa Private Equity had made offers for the Endesa natural-
gas distribution and transmission assets, which may be valued at
as much as 750 million euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Binding Offers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endesa Chief Executive Officer Andrea Brentan on July 28
said the Spanish company was expecting binding offers for 80
percent of its natural-gas distribution and transmission assets
in Spain in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rome-based Enel will meet a target to cut debt 6 billion
euros to 45 billion euros after completing the initial public
offering of renewable-energy unit Enel Green Power, and selling
the Spanish gas distribution assets and a stake in a Bulgarian
coal-fired plant, Enel Chief Executive Officer Fulvio Conti said
in a Sept. 21 interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endesa shares have dropped 17 percent in Madrid this year,
cutting the company&#8217;s market value to 21 billion euros. Enel has
declined 5.3 percent in Milan trading this year, giving the
utility a market value of 36 billion euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red Electrica Corp. SA, the manager of Spain&#8217;s power grid,
on July 1 said it agreed to pay Endesa 1.27 billion euros for
electricity transportation assets in regions including the
Balearic and Canary Islands. Earlier this year, Endesa sold its
stake in the Sagunto regasification plant to Osaka Gas Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endesa had power generation capacity of 39,108 megawatts at
the end of June, including 34 percent in hydropower plants, 24
percent in fuel oil units, 16 percent each in coal- and gas-
fired plants and 9 percent in nuclear reactors. Iberdrola SA is
Spain&#8217;s biggest electricity company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobel laureate Robert Merton and
Columbia University professor Jeffrey Sachs will advise Chile&#8217;s
government on meeting the country&#8217;s economic development goals,
Finance Minister Felipe Larrain said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economists, who also include Harvard University
professor Edward Glaeser and Boston University professor
Laurence Kotlikoff, are scheduled to meet with Larrain and
President Sebastian Pinera today and tomorrow and will be
invited back on an annual basis, the minister told reporters at
the presidential palace in Santiago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pinera, who started his four-year term in March, has
promised to eradicate extreme poverty during his administration
and position the economy to increase average income per capita
to as much as $22,000 from the existing $14,000 by 2020. Chile&#8217;s
goals can be reached as the economy withstood the 2008 financial
crisis and the February earthquake, said Merton, winner of the
1997 Nobel Prize in economics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a challenge, it truly is, but it can be
achievable,&#8221; Merton told reporters at the palace. Merton said
the government may consider using resources to protect the
economy against future &#8220;shocks to the system, whether they be
in the commodities areas or things outside the control of the
government.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chile&#8217;s economy may expand by as much as 5.5 percent this
year, the most in five years, the central bank said in its
latest monetary policy report. Chile&#8217;s government, which next
week plans to publish its 2011 budget proposal, wants public
spending to grow at a slower pace than the economy, Larrain said
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government may increase spending by about 5 percent
next year, Santiago-based newspaper El Mercurio reported today
without saying where it got the information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sony Pictures, Warner Bros. and
Walt Disney Co. are in talks with the largest cable TV systems
to offer films for as much as $30 per showing soon after they
run in theaters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The studios are talking with In Demand, a partnership of
Cox Communications Inc., Comcast Corp. and Time Warner Cable
Inc., Bob Benya, chief executive officer of In Demand, said in
an interview. Disney is also discussing streaming films on Web-
linked devices such as Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s Xbox console and Sony&#8217;s
Corp.&#8217;s PlayStation 3, people with knowledge of the talks said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hollywood studios have been looking for ways to generate
additional sales from movies as DVD purchases continue to
decline. A so-called &#8220;premium&#8221; service would let consumers see
movies on TV without waiting the typical three or four months
for DVDs or cable companies&#8217; $4 or so on-demand showings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think there are a number of other products that we will
be able to create through Internet-connected television,
particularly when you consider our brand focus,&#8221; Robert Iger,
CEO of Burbank, California-based Disney said at a Goldman Sachs
Groups Inc. conference on Sept. 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony Corp. tested the market with users of its Bravia TV by
offering the Will Smith movie &#8220;Hancock&#8221; in 2008 and the
animated film &#8220;Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs&#8221; in 2009 for
$24.95. The Tokyo-based owner of Sony Pictures hasn&#8217;t announced
plans for another movie through its TV sets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time Warner Inc. Chief Financial Officer John Martin told
the Goldman Sachs conference in New York last week that the
company&#8217;s Warner Bros. studio expects to begin tests on the
service later this year. He said he expected the offering to be
priced at $20 to $30 per viewing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney Test &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney is likely to test consumer interest in the first
quarter using a single film, said one of the people, who
requested anonymity because the decisions are pending. The
company hasn&#8217;t decided on pricing or how long to wait after
theatrical release, the person said. Jonathan Friedland, a
Disney spokesman, wouldn&#8217;t comment on the plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick Seybold, a spokesman for Sony&#8217;s PlayStation
network, declined to comment, as did Jim Kennedy, a spokesman
for Sony&#8217;s film division. An outside public relations
representative for Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft didn&#8217;t
respond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s largest media company, rose 46 cents to
$33.58 on Sept. 24 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
New York-based Time Warner added 61 cents to $31.37. Sony&#8217;s U.S.
traded shares gained 94 cents to $31. Time Warner Cable, also
based in New York, advanced $1.46 to $53.11, and Philadelphia-
based Comcast, the largest U.S. cable system, was up 65 cents to
$18.57 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Bowie&#8217;s diet in late 1975
consisted of peppers, milk and cocaine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The singer was rake thin, obsessed with European electro-
pop and philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, and seeing visions as
he stumbled into a Los Angeles studio. Staying up for days on
amphetamines, Bowie knocked out a 10th studio LP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title track &#8220;Station to Station&#8221; meanders for more
than 10 minutes. The lines &#8220;it&#8217;s not the side effects of the
cocaine, I&#8217;m thinking that it must be love&#8221; are followed by the
&#8220;it&#8217;s too late&#8221; chorus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;TVC15&#8221; takes five minutes to absurdly lament a fictional
girlfriend who is surreally eaten by a television. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may sound like a train crash, but it&#8217;s one of Bowie&#8217;s
best. The case is reinforced with the 1976 album&#8217;s reissue today
in remastered form, with extra tracks from a concert at the
Nassau Coliseum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bowie, now 63, has said he can&#8217;t remember much of the
recording session. The LP starts with him announcing &#8220;the
return of the thin white duke&#8221; -- the title of the first
chapter of a planned autobiography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Golden Years,&#8221; a song that was offered to Elvis Presley,
reprises the sound of Bowie&#8217;s 1975 &#8220;Young Americans&#8221; while
&#8220;Stay&#8221; limbers up the pulsating rhythms of his Berlin phase
that followed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highlight is the crooning &#8220;Wild Is the Wind,&#8221; a
Sinatra-style reading of a ballad originally done by Johnny
Mathis as the title tune for a 1957 movie. Rating: ****. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elvis, Miles &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elvis fans marking the 75th anniversary of his birth
already have had &#8220;On Stage,&#8221; which expands the original with
material from &#8220;Elvis in Person&#8221; and rehearsal shows from 1969.
There&#8217;s a fine run-through of &#8220;The Wonder of You.&#8221; The Vegas
gigs had the energy of the TV-special comeback that Presley did
just before and none of the bloated excess that later marked his
dinner performances before swooning matrons. Rating: ***. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orders are being taken for &#8220;The Complete Elvis Presley
Masters&#8221;: more than 814 recordings, including 103 rarities on
30 CDs over 35 hours with a 240-page book and a price tag of
about $749 for shipping on or before Oct. 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miles Davis devotees have the Legacy 40th anniversary
edition of his 1970 fusion of rock and jazz, &#8220;Bitches Brew,&#8221;
including a DVD of a Copenhagen show from the same period. For
those with fatter wallets, &#8220;The Genius of Miles Davis&#8221; 43-CD
set comes in a trumpet case on Oct. 26, with a T-shirt, Davis
lithograph and trumpet mouthpiece. It also costs $749. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Davis and Presley box sets contain the cornerstones of
contemporary rock and jazz, though there are tighter greatest-
hits collections that are better introductions to both artists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R.E.M., Cure &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those with less time and cash to spare, reissues
include beautifully done remasters of two indie-rock pearls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R.E.M.&#8217;s third album, in 1985, broke with the band&#8217;s habit
of recording at its base in Athens, Georgia. &#8220;Fables of the
Reconstruction&#8221; now comes with the simple U.S. demos of the
songs it later polished in Britain. Rating: ***. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cure&#8217;s &#8220;Disintegration,&#8221; the eighth studio album by
Robert Smith&#8217;s band, appeared too gloomy for airplay in 1989.
Now it&#8217;s lovingly augmented by unreleased tracks from Smith&#8217;s
home studio and a longer version of &#8220;Entreat,&#8221; a live disc
recorded at Wembley Arena. Rating: ***. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The David Bowie album is on EMI and released in the U.S. 
today, priced at $34.98 for the three-disc version or $165 for a 
deluxe box with 5 CDs, a DVD and three LPs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Complete Elvis Presley Masters&#8221; is on RCA/Legacy and
available from http://www.completeelvis.com. Also available in
limited edition is &#8220;The Genius of Miles Davis&#8221; from
Columbia/Legacy at http://www.geniusofmilesdavis.com, $749 each. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The special editions of &#8220;On Stage&#8221; and &#8220;Bitches Brew&#8221;
are from Sony Legacy, &#8220;Fables of the Reconstruction&#8221; from EMI
and &#8220;Disintegration&#8221; from Rhino Records at prices starting at
$16. Download fees vary across services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avenue Capital Group, the hedge
fund-firm run by Marc Lasry, is in talks to hire members of
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s proprietary-trading business in the
U.S., according to two people briefed on the discussions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lasry is pursuing the Goldman Sachs team run by Bob Howard
to expand New York-based Avenue Capital beyond its focus on
distressed and credit investing, said the people, who asked not
to be named because the talks are private. KKR  Co., the New
York-based buyout firm, and investment bank Perella Weinberg
Partners LP also are negotiating with the group, people with
knowledge of the matter said Sept. 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is disbanding the principal-strategies
business to comply with new U.S. rules aimed at curbing risk.
The unit uses multiple strategies to make bets with the New
York-based firm&#8217;s own money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lasry declined to comment, as did Ed Canaday, a spokesman
for Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avenue Capital was started in 1995 and managed $18.8
billion at the end of July, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs group is led globally by Hong Kong-based
Morgan Sze, who may start his own hedge fund focused on Asia,
two people with knowledge of the matter said earlier this month.
Sze in March replaced Pierre-Henri Flamand, the former global
head who left to set up a London-based hedge fund called Edoma
Capital Partners LLP. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypermarcas SA, a Brazilian
consumer-goods maker, rose to a record in Sao Paulo trading
after JPMorgan Chase  Co. initiated coverage with an
&#8220;overweight&#8221; rating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypermarcas gained 2.8 percent, the most since Aug. 27, to
25.40 reais as of the 4 p.m. New York time close. That&#8217;s the
highest price since its initial public offering in April 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypermarcas will benefit from &#8220;strong growth&#8221; in
pharmaceuticals and personal-care items, Andrea Teixeira, an
analyst at JPMorgan, wrote in a note to clients today. The
company, based in Sao Paulo, also will boost earnings by making
acquisitions in a &#8220;fragmented&#8221; industry, she wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Since its foundation, Hypermarcas has been recognized for
its capacity to consolidate other companies at accretive
valuations,&#8221; Teixeira wrote. &#8220;Its portfolio is mainly composed
of staple goods, which makes it a defensive investment. Also, as
it has multiclass products, it is well positioned to capture
social mobility.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares will likely rise to 30 reais by the end of next
year, according to JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;

an interview. Disney is also discussing streaming films on Web-
linked devices such as Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s Xbox console and Sony
Corp.&#8217;s PlayStation 3, people with knowledge of the talks said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hollywood studios have been looking for ways to generate
additional sales from movies as DVD purchases decline. A so-
called &#8220;premium&#8221; service would let consumers see movies on TV
without waiting as long as the typical three to four months for
DVDs or cable companies&#8217; $4 or so on-demand showings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are a number of other products that we will be able
to create through Internet-connected television, particularly
when you consider our brand focus,&#8221; Robert Iger, CEO of
Burbank, California-based Disney said at a Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. conference on Sept. 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony Corp. tested the market with users of its Bravia TV by
offering the Will Smith movie &#8220;Hancock&#8221; in 2008 and the
animated film &#8220;Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs&#8221; in 2009 for
$24.95. The Tokyo-based owner of Sony Pictures hasn&#8217;t announced
plans for another movie through its TV sets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time Warner Inc. Chief Financial Officer John Martin told
the Goldman Sachs conference in New York last week that the
company&#8217;s Warner Bros. studio expects to begin tests on the
service later this year. He said he expected the offering to be
priced at $20 to $30 per viewing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney Test &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The studios&#8217; plans may meet resistance from theater chains,
which have raised concerns about cannibalizing ticket sales by
shortening the exclusive 120-day theatrical &#8220;window&#8221;
exhibitors have for a typical release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Any promotion, advertising, marketing or testing of
premium VOD needs to be done within the existing in-home window
time frame,&#8221; the National Association of Theatre Owners, a
Washington-based industry group, said in a June statement on its
website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney is likely to test consumer interest in the first
quarter using a single film, said one of the people, who
requested anonymity because the decisions are pending. The
company hasn&#8217;t decided on pricing or how long to wait after
theatrical release, the person said. Jonathan Friedland, a
Disney spokesman, declined to comment on the plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PlayStation, Xbox &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick Seybold, a spokesman for Sony&#8217;s PlayStation
network, declined to comment, as did Jim Kennedy, a spokesman
for Sony&#8217;s film division. An outside public relations
representative for Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft didn&#8217;t
respond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s largest media company, fell 29 cents to
$33.29 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
New York-based Time Warner fell 45 cents to $30.92 and Sony&#8217;s
U.S. traded shares slumped 14 cents to $30.86. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time Warner Cable, also based in New York, rose 6 cents to
$53.17, and Philadelphia-based Comcast, the largest U.S. cable
system, declined 26 cents to $18.31 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     Sept. 27 (Bloomberg) -- International Business Machines
Corp., the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider, agreed to
buy closely held Blade Network Technologies Inc. to gain
products that connect server computers in company data centers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM didn&#8217;t give a value for the purchase in its statement
today. Santa Clara, California-based Blade Network&#8217;s investors
include Garnett  Helfrich Capital and Juniper Networks Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is bolstering data-center offerings as rivals expand in
corporate computing. Blade Network makes switches that connect
servers, storage and networks in data centers, large rooms of
computers that handle corporate tasks. It&#8217;s the third
acquisition IBM has announced this month, after a $1.7 billion
deal for storage-analytics maker Netezza Corp. and a purchase of
software maker OpenPages Inc. for an undisclosed sum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move may help IBM compete as rivals increasingly tie
networking gear with data centers. Cisco Systems Inc., the
world&#8217;s largest maker of networking equipment, last year
released its first blade servers, pushing into the data-center
market and pitting it against Hewlett-Packard Co. and IBM. In
April, HP bought 3Com Corp. for $2.7 billion to bolster its
data-center networking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sam Palmisano, IBM&#8217;s chief executive officer, said in May
he is planning to spend about $20 billion on acquisitions in the
next five years. He&#8217;s made more than 100 purchases since taking
over the company eight years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, based in Armonk, New York, gained 54 cents to $134.65
at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares have added 2.9 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle Corp., the world&#8217;s second-largest software maker,
bought server-maker Sun Microsystems Inc. for more than $7
billion in January. This month, HP agreed to pay $2.35 billion
for data-storage maker 3Par Inc., after a bidding contest with
Dell Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, sued Danish competitor Novo Nordisk A/S in a U.K.
court to invalidate its patent for an injection mechanism that
prevents overdoses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk&#8217;s European patent for the dose-setting device
is based on claims that weren&#8217;t new when the patent application
was filed, New York-based Pfizer said in a complaint in the High
Court in London. The suit, filed July 5 and made public this
week, didn&#8217;t say if Pfizer is using the technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We disagree with Pfizer&#8217;s claim and we will defend the
patent in court,&#8221; Mike Rulis, a spokesman for Bagsvaerd,
Denmark-based Novo Nordisk, said today in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and Novo Nordisk, the world&#8217;s biggest maker of the
diabetes treatment insulin, have sparred over delivery methods
for the drug since at least 2005. The disputed patent concerns a
device that lets doctors set maximum dose limits to prevent the
visually impaired and other groups from using too much during
self injections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer also sued Novo Nordisk in Switzerland over the same
patent, which expires in 2026, Pfizer spokeswoman Charlotte
Binstead said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk in December started the first human tests on
an experimental insulin pill, joining companies seeking to
develop an alternative to daily injections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies&#8217; earlier dispute concerned Pfizer&#8217;s inhaled-
insulin product Exubera, seen as a possible replacement to
injections. Pfizer stopped selling the product in 2007 when it
failed to catch on with doctors and patients, while Novo Nordisk
abandoned its inhaled version the following year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies in 2007 settled a U.S. patent-infringement
suit over Exubera. In that case, Novo Nordisk sued Pfizer in
federal court in New York, claiming Exubera infringed two
patents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. said there&#8217;s a
75 percent chance that the Federal Reserve will start another
round of asset purchases before the end of this year to boost
the economy, supporting Treasury bond prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. central bank may spend &#8220;a few hundred billion
dollars&#8221; on a so-called quantitative easing program, and it&#8217;s
likely to keep the official rate on hold until 2012, said Pavan Wadhwa, head of European interest-rate strategy in London at
JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Fed is likely to do more quantitative easing, and
that will pull Treasury yields lower,&#8221; Wadhwa said in an
interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to argue that these bonds are overvalued
when inflation and resource utilisation rates remain very low,
and the unemployment rate is high.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Open Market Committee&#8217;s Sept. 21 statement said
it &#8220;will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial
developments and is prepared to provide additional accommodation
if needed to support the economic recovery.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed&#8217;s statement indicates it&#8217;s focused on an inflation
level below the preferred long-term range as the main reason to
provide additional stimulus. Consumer prices excluding food and
fuel costs rose 0.9 percent in August from a year earlier,
matching the smallest increase since the 1960s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed retained its policy, begun last month, of
reinvesting proceeds from mortgage debt repayments into long-
term Treasuries. It has bought $34 billion since it began the
program on Aug. 17. Policy makers also kept the benchmark
federal funds rate in a range of zero to 0.25 percent, where
it&#8217;s been since December 2008, and reiterated the rate will stay
&#8220;exceptionally low&#8221; for an &#8220;extended period.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese Intervention &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other factors that may also push Treasury yields lower
include the consequences of intervention in the currency market
by the Bank of Japan, said Wadhwa. Earlier this month, Japan
intervened in the foreign-exchange market for the first time
since 2004 after the yen&#8217;s advance to a 15-year high against the
dollar threatened to stunt the nation&#8217;s economic recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Bank of Japan bought a significant amount of dollars
during the forex intervention, and may do another round,&#8221; said
Wadhwa. &#8220;They will need to invest these dollars somewhere. I
suspect they will end up investing in Treasuries.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury declined 4 basis
points to 2.56 percent as of 11:45 a.m. in London. The two-year
note yield was down 2 basis points to 0.43 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Endesa SA, a Spanish utility
controlled by Enel SpA of Italy, agreed to sell 80 percent of
its natural gas distribution assets to two infrastructure funds
managed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to reduce debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale will have a &#8220;positive impact&#8221; of about 450
million euros ($606 million) on pretax profit and of 800 million
euros on net debt, the Madrid-based company said today. The deal
values the assets at about 1 billion euros, Endesa said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enel, Italy&#8217;s biggest utility, owns 92 percent of Endesa
after gaining control in 2007. As part of that deal, Endesa
transferred some renewable-energy units to builder Acciona SA
and sold assets to Germany&#8217;s E.ON AG. The company is selling
more units to lower debt after the takeover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endesa expects to close the sale of the gas assets this
year and has an option to repurchase the stake in five to seven
years, according to today&#8217;s statement. The assets include a
3,800 kilometers (2,362 miles) gas-distribution network, 600
kilometers of transportation and 355,000 supply points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s infrastructure funds, which manage about 9
billion euros in assets, were advised by Goldman Sachs
International in Madrid, Andrew Hazell, an external spokesman
for the investment bank, said by telephone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, the Endesa distribution unit also bought a 35
percent stake in Gas Aragon SA for at least 70 million euros,
according to a statement today from the seller, Gas Natural SDG
SA, Spain&#8217;s biggest gas distributor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduce Debt &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rome-based Enel will meet a target to cut debt by 6 billion
euros to 45 billion euros after completing an initial public
offering of renewable-energy unit Enel Green Power, selling the
gas distribution assets and a stake in a Bulgarian coal-fired
plant, Chief Executive Officer Fulvio Conti said in a Sept. 21
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endesa shares have dropped 17 percent in Madrid this year,
cutting its market value to 21 billion euros. Enel is down 3.2
percent in Milan this year, giving it a value of 37 billion
euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red Electrica Corp. SA, the manager of Spain&#8217;s power grid,
on July 1 said it agreed to pay Endesa 1.27 billion euros for
electricity transportation assets in regions including the
Balearic and Canary Islands. Endesa also sold its stake in the
Sagunto regasification plant to Osaka Gas Co. this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endesa had power generation capacity of 39,108 megawatts at
the end of June, including 34 percent in hydropower plants, 24
percent in fuel oil units, 16 percent each in coal- and gas-
fired plants and 9 percent in nuclear reactors. Iberdrola SA is
Spain&#8217;s biggest electricity company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. faces a legal
challenge next month that could cast doubt on thousands of
foreclosures after a mortgage executive at the bank said she
didn&#8217;t verify documents used to justify home seizures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for a Palm Beach County, Florida, homeowner asked a
judge to throw out a foreclosure as a penalty for misleading the
court, according to attorney Tom Ice of Ice Legal PA. They&#8217;re
citing a May 17 deposition in which the JPMorgan executive said
she signed thousands of affidavits and documents supporting the
New York-based bank&#8217;s claims without personally checking loan
records. The court is scheduled to hear arguments Oct. 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chase Home Finance operation supervisor, Beth Ann
Cottrell, said in May she was among eight managers who together
sign about 18,000 documents a month, according to a transcript
of her sworn deposition provided by Ice. Asked how they were
prepared, she said she relied on other people at the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My review is more or less signing the document unless
it&#8217;s questionable,&#8221; she said. That means, &#8220;somebody has a
question and brings it to me and says, &#8216;Beth, can you take a
look at this?&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inaccurate statements by banks in foreclosure documents may
give borrowers who have lost their homes a legal basis to
challenge the seizures, derailing resales and casting doubts on
property titles. A Florida court sanctioned Ally Financial
Inc.&#8217;s GMAC Mortgage unit for faulty affidavits in 2006, and the
firm suspended evictions in 23 states this month after finding
employees still signing affidavits without checking the data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Titles in Doubt &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokesman Tom Kelly declined requests for comment.
Cottrell didn&#8217;t return phone calls to her office requesting
comment. A lawyer representing her at the deposition, Joseph
Mancilla of the Florida Default Law Group PL, didn&#8217;t return
calls. Cottrell isn&#8217;t named as a defendant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cottrell signed the affidavit at issue in the case, dated
June 2009, while at her previous employer, an outside servicing
firm working for JPMorgan, according to court documents. When
signing documents there for the JPMorgan unit, she used the
title &#8220;assistant secretary and vice president&#8221; of Chase Home
Finance, according to the transcript. She became a JPMorgan
employee about three months after signing the affidavit.
Document signers sometimes endorse affidavits on behalf of other
firms as a way to streamline the foreclosure process, said
Dustin Zacks, an attorney at Ice&#8217;s firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was the third-largest U.S. servicer of home
mortgages as of June 30, with $1.35 trillion or almost 13
percent of the market, according to industry newsletter Inside
Mortgage Finance. Ally is the fifth-biggest mortgage servicer,
with $349.1 billion. The other three in the top five are Bank of
America Corp., Wells Fargo  Co., and Citigroup Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreclosures Averted &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Servicers perform billing and collections on home loans.
When borrowers default, the firms handle the foreclosure
process. Affidavits lay the legal foundation for a foreclosure
by attesting that the borrower is delinquent and that the lender
is entitled to seize the home. Details of the JPMorgan case were
reported earlier last week by the Financial Times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers in Florida and New York, among other states, have
halted foreclosures and evictions by showing affidavits were
faulty. Attorneys general in Texas, Iowa and Illinois have
started investigations into mortgage practices at GMAC Mortgage
following last week&#8217;s revelations. California has ordered the
company to prove its foreclosures are legal or halt them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the documents are shown to be false after a home has
already been resold by a bank, that casts doubt on who is the
rightful owner, said O. Max Gardner III, an attorney at law firm
Gardner  Gardner PLLC in Shelby, North Carolina, who has
represented homeowners in fighting foreclosures and has cases
pending against JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Title Insurers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m sure a lot of title insurance companies are concerned
about the potential liability right now,&#8221; as borrowers
challenge how banks made statements, he said. &#8220;The judges could
absolutely hold the bank and attorneys in contempt.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. home seizures reached a record for the third time in
five months in August as lenders completed the foreclosure
process for thousands of delinquent owners, according to
RealtyTrac Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ice, the founding partner of his foreclosure-defense law
firm in Royal Palm Beach, Florida, said some lenders are
accepting voluntary dismissal of their cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the deposition, Cottrell said a staff of in-house
specialists scrutinize loan documents and prepare affidavits,
the transcript shows. If they have difficulties or questions,
they come to her. She signs in a notary&#8217;s presence, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;No Knowledge&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During questioning by Ice lawyer Zacks, Cottrell said she
had worked at Chase Home Finance for about eight months,
according to the transcript. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As to everything in the affidavit, did you have personal
knowledge?&#8221; Zacks asked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My own personal knowledge, no,&#8221; Cottrell answered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You stated &#8216;That plaintiff is entitled to enforce the
note and mortgage,&#8217;&#8221; Zacks said. &#8220;Again, did you have personal
knowledge of that?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No knowledge,&#8221; she answered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florida Attorney General William McCollum is investigating
three law firms that represent loan servicers in foreclosures,
and are alleged to have submitted fraudulent documents to the
courts, according to an Aug. 10 statement. The firms handled
about 80 percent of foreclosure cases in the state, according to
a letter from U.S. Representative Alan Grayson, a Florida
Democrat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judges overseeing foreclosures in the wake of the housing
crisis are growing skeptical of banks, said Christopher L. Peterson, a professor at the University of Utah&#8217;s S.J. Quinney
College of Law. A surge in proceedings has helped expose a
variety of paperwork lapses, he said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Early in the process the judges were very cavalier and
they just took the financiers&#8217; word,&#8221; Peterson said. &#8220;Now
there are enough disputes out there about ownership of loans
that the judges are starting to feel like they need to hold the
financial institutions to the basic rules of evidence.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. plans to
triple private banking assets in Asia, its fastest-growing
market, over the next five years after moving one of its top
executives to the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit, which manages money for wealthy clients and
employs 400 people in Asia, intends to increase its number of
client advisors in the region by 40 percent this year and next,
after growing at a similar pace in 2009, Douglas Wurth, chief
executive officer for international private banking at New York-
based JPMorgan, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan aims to generate about half of its non-U.S.
business from Asia, up from the current 20 percent, according to
Wurth, who moved to Hong Kong in February from New York. Rivals
including UBS AG are also expanding in the region, where assets
of millionaires grew 31 percent in 2009, according to a June
report by Capgemini SA and Bank of America Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;However excited one can be about the opportunities when
you&#8217;re in New York, that only magnifies ten-fold once you&#8217;re
here in Hong Kong, Singapore, Beijing, Jakarta,&#8221; Wurth said in
Singapore yesterday. &#8220;You just see up close and personal the
dynamic changes taking place.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s expansion comes after the number of millionaires
in the Asia-Pacific region reached 3 million in 2009, matching
those in Europe for the first time, according to the report by
Bank of America&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit and Capgemini. The
millionaires&#8217; assets rose 31 percent to $9.7 trillion, it said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co.&#8217;s ABC, CBS Corp.
and other broadcasters sued Ivi, an online subscription service,
for streaming television programs over the Web without
authorization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies, also including News Corp.&#8217;s Fox, General
Electric Co.&#8217;s NBC and the Public Broadcasting Service, today
accused Ivi and its founder Todd Weaver of copyright
infringement in a federal court complaint in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Defendants have launched their infringing Internet TV
service to coincide with the start of the new fall television
season,&#8221; the broadcasters said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ivi, based in Seattle, began streaming TV stations there
and in New York 24 hours a day to Web subscribers worldwide on
Sept. 13, according to the lawsuit. Viewers would pay $4.99 a
month after a 30-day free trial, the complaint said.
Broadcasters have deals with companies including Hulu LLC,
Netflix Inc. and Apple Inc. to stream TV shows. Hulu&#8217;s owners
include NBC, Fox and ABC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sept. 20, Ivi and Weaver filed suit in federal court in
Seattle seeking a ruling that Ivi isn&#8217;t infringing copyrights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Big media is choosing to fight Internet delivery the same
way they fought against cable delivery and satellite delivery,
when in reality it is legal to retransmit,&#8221; Weaver said in an
e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Big Media&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Broadcasters charge more in advertising due to the
increase in viewers,&#8221; Weaver said. &#8220;It is too bad big media
must fight innovation that is legal, pays them and increases
their revenue.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broadcasters said that after they demanded that Ivi
stop streaming their stations, the company initially responded
that it was &#8220;open to engaging in discussions to explore more
direct contractual agreements with certain plaintiffs.&#8221; Ivi
sued several days later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major League Baseball, Univision, Telemundo, Cox Media,
Tribune Television, Fisher Broadcasting, WPIX, WGBH and WNET.org
are also plaintiffs in the New York suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s case is WPIX Inc. v. Ivi Inc., 10-7415, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The
earlier case is Ivi Inc. v. Fisher Communications Inc., 10-1512,
U.S. District Court, Western District of Washington (Seattle). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects to say deal is sold in headline, first
paragraph.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sold $14.5
million of so-called range accrual notes linked to interbank
lending rates and the yen, which reached a 15-year high versus
the dollar this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale includes a $9.5 million portion with a 15-year
maturity, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In the first
five years, the notes pay an annualized return of 8.5 percent
each day the six-month London interbank offered rate is below
6.5 percent and the dollar is worth more than 80 yen. After five
years, the Libor limit increases to 7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs also sold $5 million of 12-year notes that
pay a coupon of 7.2 percent if three-month Libor stays below 6.5
percent and the dollar is above 78 yen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both notes don&#8217;t pay any interest if Libor or the dollar
moves outside the notes&#8217; ranges. The securities were issued at
100 percent of face value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yen rose 0.25 percent to 84.08 per dollar at 12:26 p.m.
in London. The Japanese currency strengthened to 82.88 on Sept.
15, its highest level against the dollar since May 1995. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six-month Libor, an average of rates set daily by banks and
used as a borrowing benchmark, is 0.463 percent, the lowest
since April 19. The rate was last above 6.5 percent in December
2000. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co., the world&#8217;s
largest media company, introduced a new publication, DYOU, as it
taps the magazine market for pre-teen girls worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monthly is scheduled to go on sale in Italy tomorrow at
1.90 euros ($2.58) and to roll out in 30 countries including the
U.S. in 2011, Carlotta Saltini, chief marketing officer of Walt
Disney Co. Italia, said at a presentation in Milan today. DYOU,
whose D stands for Disney, features pop singer Avril Lavigne on
its first cover, as it expands beyond Disney&#8217;s stable of
celebrities such as Miley Cyrus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;DYOU will have an international reach, but it comes from
Disney&#8217;s creative forge in Italy,&#8221; Saltini said. &#8220;It&#8217;s our
first international magazine aimed at girls aged 10 to 13. It&#8217;s
an ambitious project.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney Publishing Worldwide is the largest publisher of
children&#8217;s books and magazines globally, reaching more than 100
million readers a month in 75 countries, according to the
company&#8217;s website. &#8220;Hannah Montana&#8221; and &#8220;High School
Musical&#8221; are among its magazines for teens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DYOU was created in Milan, one of the company&#8217;s centers for
magazine development, Jeanne M. Mosure, Disney Publishing senior
vice president, said in an interview after the presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Italy is an important market for us and was key to the
initial launch of DYOU,&#8221; Mosure said. &#8220;Internationally, we
look forward strategically to our 30-country rollout --
including the U.S. -- in 2011.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, slipped 10 cents to
$33.19 at 11:41 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares advanced 3.2 percent this year before today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp.,
Royal Dutch Shell Plc and OAO Gazprom are among 13 companies
interested in bidding next month to develop natural-gas fields
in Iraq, said a senior member of the country&#8217;s parliament. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the other companies registered to bid are Eni Spa,
Mitsubishi Corp. and Japan Petroleum Exploration Co., Abdul Hadi
al-Hassani, vice chairman of the parliament&#8217;s oil and gas
committee, said in an interview in Istanbul today. The bidding
round for gas rights is planned for Oct. 20 in Baghdad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is strong interest from the big majors, and this is
excellent,&#8221; Hassani said. &#8220;We care more about the fact that
big majors are interested, rather than in the number of
bidders.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preparations for bidding are proceeding well and according
to schedule, he said on the sidelines of a conference about
Iraq&#8217;s energy industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq, reliant on oil for most of its income, seeks foreign
investors in all parts of its economy after years of conflict
and sanctions. The country held two licensing rounds last year
for oil and gas investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third round will focus specifically on the Akkas,
Mansouriya and Siba gas fields, which Iraq is eager to develop
for domestic power generation as well as export revenue. The
three undeveloped fields hold combined gas reserves of more than
11 trillion cubic feet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq has the world&#8217;s fourth-largest oil reserves and wants
to more than double its current crude production of 2.4 million
barrels a day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oracle Corp. sued Micron Technology
Inc., alleging it overcharged Sun Microsystems Inc., which
Oracle acquired, by conspiring to fix prices for computer memory
chips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Micron and other makers of dynamic random access memory, or
DRAM, artificially inflated the price of chips they sold to Sun,
Oracle claimed in an antitrust complaint filed Sept. 24 in
federal court in San Jose, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is partly based on a 2002 U.S. Justice Department
investigation of price fixing in the memory-chip industry that
led to claims against four companies and 16 people who have been
fined as much as $731 million. Micron cooperated with U.S.
officials in exchange for not being charged with a crime,
according to Oracle&#8217;s complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The memory manufacturers &#8220;conspired to control production
capacity, raise prices or slow their decline, allocate
customers, and otherwise unlawfully overcharge their DRAM
customers,&#8221; Oracle said in its complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan Francisco, a spokesman for Boise, Idaho-based Micron,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ichon, South Korea-based Hynix Semiconductor Inc., Suwon,
South Korea-based Samsung Electronics Co., Tokyo-based Elpida
Memory Inc. and Neubiberg, Germany-based Infineon Technologies
AG are indentified by Oracle as co-conspirators in the case.
Those companies aren&#8217;t named as defendants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Oracle America Inc. v. Micron Technology Inc.,

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Based Home Foreclosures on Faulty Court Documents &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. faces a legal challenge next month
that could cast doubt on thousands of foreclosures after a
mortgage executive at the bank said she didn&#8217;t verify documents
used to justify home seizures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for a Palm Beach County, Florida, homeowner asked a
judge to throw out a foreclosure as a penalty for misleading the
court, according to attorney Tom Ice of Ice Legal PA. They&#8217;re
citing a May 17 deposition in which the JPMorgan executive said
she signed thousands of affidavits and documents supporting the
New York-based bank&#8217;s claims without personally checking loan
records. The court is scheduled to hear arguments Oct. 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chase Home Finance operation supervisor, Beth Ann
Cottrell, said in May she was among eight managers who together
sign about 18,000 documents a month, according to a transcript
of her sworn deposition provided by Ice. Asked how they were
prepared, she said she relied on other people at the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My review is more or less signing the document unless
it&#8217;s questionable,&#8221; she said. That means, &#8220;somebody has a
question and brings it to me and says, &#8216;Beth, can you take a
look at this?&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inaccurate statements by banks in foreclosure documents may
give borrowers who have lost their homes a legal basis to
challenge the seizures, derailing resales and casting doubts on
property titles. A Florida court sanctioned Ally Financial
Inc.&#8217;s GMAC Mortgage unit for faulty affidavits in 2006, and the
firm suspended evictions in 23 states this month after finding
employees still signing affidavits without checking the data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokesman Tom Kelly declined to comment. Cottrell
didn&#8217;t return phone calls to her office requesting comment. A
lawyer representing her at the deposition, Joseph Mancilla of
the Florida Default Law Group PL, didn&#8217;t return calls. Cottrell
isn&#8217;t named as a defendant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potash Corp. Can Examine BHP Evidence U.S. Judge Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. is entitled to
documentary evidence requested from BHP Billiton Ltd. in a
lawsuit in which the Canadian fertilizer company seeks to block
a $40 billion hostile takeover offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Unless BHP is prepared to extend the tender date, I&#8217;m not
going to stay discovery,&#8221; U.S. District Judge David H. Coar in
Chicago told lawyers for both sides yesterday. BHP set a Nov. 18
deadline for Potash stockholders to accept its $130-a-share
offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest fertilizer maker, Saskatoon-based
Potash sued BHP on Sept. 22, alleging that the company&#8217;s
executives made misleading public statements to drive down its
share value, increasing the likelihood of a successful bid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potash asked Coar for an order barring Melbourne-based BHP
from taking further steps to acquire its shares. It also asked
the judge to direct BHP to issue a &#8220;corrective disclosure&#8221;
statement, and to give Potash shareholders 60 days to consider
it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coar yesterday scheduled a hearing on the injunction
request for Nov. 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BHP, in a Sept. 24 court filing, called Potash&#8217;s demand
that it hand over large quantities of documents burdensome and a
&#8220;fishing expedition&#8221; and said the company waited too long to
make the request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said Coar should deny the discovery demand
until he rules on a dismissal request the Australian company has
not yet submitted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coar yesterday told BHP attorney Michele Odorizzi that he
won&#8217;t set any dates concerning a dismissal motion until one is
actually filed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the Potash evidence demand was overly broad and
that BHP would not be required to produce documentation until
the scope of that demand had been narrowed either by mutual
agreement or the direction of a federal magistrate judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased that the court has scheduled a hearing on
Nov. 4, well in advance of the Nov. 18 scheduled expiration of
our offer,&#8221; BHP said in an e-mailed press statement after
yesterday&#8217;s court appearance. &#8220;We believe the case is without
merit and we intend to contest it vigorously, including by
filing a motion to dismiss later this week.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potash declined to comment on the court&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan v. BHP Billiton,
10-06024, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois
(Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP&#8217;s Probation Over Fatal Texas Blast Won&#8217;t Be Revoked by U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc&#8217;s probation for violating a plea deal that resolved
the company&#8217;s criminal liability for a fatal 2005 explosion at
its Texas City, Texas, refinery won&#8217;t be revoked by the U.S.
Justice Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After consulting with BP, regulators and blast victims,
prosecutors said they would give the company 18 more months to
complete required safety reviews and upgrades at the Texas
refinery, according to documents filed in federal court in
Houston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Department of Justice is not seeking a revocation or
extension of probation at this time,&#8221; Daniel Dooher, a senior
trial attorney in the U.S. environmental crimes division, said
in a Sept. 8 letter to U.S. District Judge Lee Rosenthal. Dooher
said safety regulators and &#8220;BP have executed a stipulation and
agreement resolving the allegations of non-compliance,&#8221; which
includes an extension of BP&#8217;s deadline to complete the work
until March 12, 2012, the date its probation will expire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Products North America, a unit of the London-based
company, agreed in March 2009 to pay a $50 million fine and
complete three years probation for violating U.S. air pollution
laws linked to the March 2005 explosion that killed 15 and
injured thousands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP&#8217;s plea deal required it to complete a review of
pressure-relief valves throughout its largest U.S. refinery and
complete installation of automated safety instrumentation, as
required by the company&#8217;s settlement with the U.S. Occupational
Safety and Health Administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent Coon, the lead lawyer for victims of the explosion,
called the government&#8217;s decision &#8220;disappointing but not
surprising.&#8221; He said yesterday in an e-mail that prosecutors
had told him they &#8220;don&#8217;t want to reopen the case unless
negotiations with OSHA collapse.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daren Beaudo, a BP spokesman, didn&#8217;t return a call and e-
mail seeking comment yesterday after regular business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2005 explosion occurred when an octane-boosting unit
overflowed as it was being restarted, igniting a blast that
shattered windows five miles away. The U.S. Chemical Safety
Board found numerous safety lapses that rendered the plant &#8220;a
catastrophe waiting to happen,&#8221; according to John Bresland, the
board&#8217;s chairman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. BP Products North America, 4:07-cr-
00434, U.S. District Courts, Southern District of Texas
(Houston). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerimov&#8217;s Assets Are Frozen in Second Court Order &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Cyprus court extended a freeze on Russian billionaire
Suleiman Kerimov&#8217;s assets, including stakes in mining company
OAO Polyus Gold and fertilizer maker OAO Uralkali. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case, reviewed yesterday, will be heard again on Nov.
17, Nicosia District Court President Michalis Christodoulou said
at the court. A Sept. 17 order already banned Cyprus-registered
entities controlled by Kerimov from any transactions using
shares in Uralkali and Polyus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move follows a complaint against Kerimov by Ashot
Egiazaryan, a member of Russia&#8217;s lower house of parliament, who
claims Kerimov forced him to relinquish 25.5 percent of the
Moskva hotel near Moscow&#8217;s Red Square. Egiazaryan filed a
request for $2 billion in damages at the London Court of
International Arbitration on Sept. 13, according to court
documents in Cyprus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for Kerimov, Michael Stepek at Akin Gump Strauss
Hauer  Feld LLP in Geneva, would only say he was aware of the
Cypriot injunction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soteris Flourentzos and George Triantafyllides, lawyers who
represent five of Kerimov&#8217;s companies affected by the
injunction, had appealed against the Sept. 17 order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those five companies have been officially notified of the
court&#8217;s latest ruling, Andreas Chaviaras, Egiazaryan&#8217;s lawyer,
said yesterday. &#8220;We have indications that also the remaining
companies have been notified,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerimov, ranked by Finans magazine as Russia&#8217;s fourth-
richest man with a fortune of $14.5 billion, owns 37 percent of
Polyus, according to a July 2009 company filing, and 25 percent
of Uralkali. The stakes, of which part are pledged for bank
loans, are worth $3.4 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively,
Bloomberg calculations show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legal Reviews &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bar to GMAC/Ally Foreclosures Sought by Connecticut &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said his
office is investigating defective foreclosure documents filed by
GMAC/Ally Finance Inc. and demanding that the company freeze
foreclosures in the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The GMAC/Ally foreclosure steamroller should be stopped
so the company can be held accountable,&#8221; Blumenthal said
yesterday in a statement. &#8220;My office has already confirmed that
some defective documents were filed in Connecticut.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blumenthal&#8217;s action follows news of investigations by
Texas, Iowa and Illinois into mortgage practices at Ally.
California ordered the company to stop foreclosures until it can
prove it is complying with state law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ally, the Detroit-based auto and home lender, faces claims
that its GMAC unit evicted people from their homes without first
ensuring that the borrowers were in default or the firm had
legal standing to take possession of the homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GMAC Mortgage on Sept. 17 notified agents and brokers that
it was suspending evictions in 23 states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Sues Novo Nordisk Over Insulin-Device Patent &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, sued Danish
competitor Novo Nordisk A/S in a U.K. court to invalidate its
patent for an injection mechanism that prevents overdoses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk&#8217;s European patent for the dose-setting device
is based on claims that weren&#8217;t new when the patent application
was filed, New York-based Pfizer said in a complaint in the High
Court in London. The suit, filed July 5 and made public this
week, didn&#8217;t say if Pfizer is using the technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We disagree with Pfizer&#8217;s claim and we will defend the
patent in court,&#8221; Mike Rulis, a spokesman for Bagsvaerd,
Denmark-based Novo Nordisk, said yesterday in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and Novo Nordisk, the world&#8217;s biggest maker of the
diabetes treatment insulin, have sparred over delivery methods
for the drug since at least 2005. The disputed patent concerns a
device that lets doctors set maximum dose limits to prevent the
visually impaired and other groups from using too much during
self injections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer also sued Novo Nordisk in Switzerland over the same
patent, which expires in 2026, Pfizer spokeswoman Charlotte
Binstead said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India Court Tells Authorities to Fix Vodafone Taxes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s Supreme Court gave the tax department four weeks to
fix the amount it&#8217;s claiming from Vodafone Group Plc on the
company&#8217;s purchase of Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.&#8217;s wireless assets
in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A three-judge bench of India&#8217;s highest court headed by
Chief Justice S.H. Kapadia yesterday set Oct. 25 as the date for
its next hearing on an appeal by Vodafone of a lower court
ruling that upheld authorities&#8217; right to claim the taxes. The
company may need to pay a part of the liability, estimated at
more than 120 billion rupees ($2.6 billion) including interest,
pending disposal of the case, the court indicated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Newbury, England-based company is appealing against the
Sept. 8 verdict of the Bombay High Court, which ruled
authorities have the jurisdiction to seek taxes from Vodafone
International Holdings BV on its 2007 purchase of Hutchison&#8217;s
Indian wireless operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Supreme Court will now give a final take on the
Vodafone matter,&#8221; Hitesh Jain, a partner at Mumbai-based law
firm ALMT Legal, said by telephone. &#8220;It&#8217;s also one more forum
for Vodafone to debate the issue, to explain their position, so
it&#8217;s a positive development for the company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The carrier &#8220;firmly&#8221; believes its acquisition isn&#8217;t
liable for tax in India, Vodafone said in an e-mail. The
transaction was between Netherlands-based Vodafone International
and Hong Kong-based Hutchison and the stake Vodafone acquired
was owned by a Cayman Islands-based holding company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Urges Stem-Cell Funding Stay by Appeals Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department urged a federal appeals court
to maintain its stay on a lower-court order cutting off funds
for embryonic stem cell research while it seeks to overturn the
trial judge&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia, after an hour-long hearing, didn&#8217;t say
when it would decide whether to make the emergency hold extend
through the appeal. The Obama administration attorneys argued
that even a temporary cutoff would cause irreparable harm to
researchers, taxpayers and scientific progress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court ruled on Sept. 9 that the government can
keep funds flowing for the research at least during the initial
stages of the administration&#8217;s challenge to the order banning
taxpayer support for any activity using cells taken from human
embryos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Judge Royce Lamberth last month cited the still-in-
force 1996 Dickey-Wicker Amendment in his ruling, saying
Congress prohibited funding any research in which a human embryo
was destroyed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision will be made by Judith Rogers, appointed by
former President Bill Clinton, and Thomas Griffith and Brett
Kavanaugh, both appointed by former President George W. Bush. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beth Brinkmann, an attorney for the Justice Department,
told the panel that cutting off funding would waste millions of
dollars in already earmarked grants and force scientists to
start research over should Lamberth&#8217;s ruling ultimately be
overturned,. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re not here to&#8221; decide &#8220;upon the wisdom of the
government policy,&#8221; said Griffith. Rather, the court is
deciding whether the funding violates the statute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Hungar, an attorney for stem-cell research
opponents, said government attorneys are only speculating on the
potential harm, and no injury is imminent or irreversible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Sherley v. Sebelius, 10-5287, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;United Technologies Corp.&#8217;s Pratt 
Whitney unit accused jet-engine maker Rolls-Royce Group Plc of
unfairly using patent litigation to keep it from re-entering the
biggest segment of the commercial-airline market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pratt  Whitney, in a lawsuit it said it filed yesterday in
federal court in Connecticut, accused London-based Rolls-Royce
of trying to interfere with its potential business arrangement
and engaging in unfair business practices. Rolls-Royce sued in
May, claiming the Pratt-made fan stage of the GP7200 jet engine
infringed a way to make blades quieter and more efficient. Pratt
denies the allegation and says the patent is invalid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rolls-Royce added Pratt&#8217;s Geared TurboFan engines to its
complaint in August, as Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. ponder putting
more efficient powerplants on the bestselling A320 and 737
planes. Pratt spent more than $1 billion and a decade to develop
the more-efficient design, branded as PurePower, as a way to get
back into the market for narrowbody aircraft after three decades
as a solo engine maker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Rolls-Royce&#8217;s actions will not impede our ability to
market and sell our engines,&#8221; Katy Padgett, a Pratt  Whitney
spokeswoman, said in an interview. &#8220;Our engines use many
different technologies and we can meet our performance
commitment to customers with a variety of fan-blade designs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airbus, the world&#8217;s biggest planemaker, said last week it&#8217;s
in final negotiations with suppliers to upgrade its bestselling
A320 fleet with new engines and may make a decision as soon as
next month. Josh Rosenstock, a Rolls-Royce spokesman, declined
to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engine choices for the A320 would include the PurePower
model and an engine made by CFM International, General Electric
Co.&#8217;s partnership with Safran SA. Pratt  Whitney is the world&#8217;s
third-biggest engine maker behind Rolls-Royce and GE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pratt  Whitney and Rolls-Royce are partners on current
engines for the A320 and compete against CFM International via a
group called International Aero Engines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rolls-Royce, which is developing its own more efficient
engine for new narrowbody aircraft, hasn&#8217;t agreed to market
PurePower through the partnership, saying it doesn&#8217;t see a
business case for putting new jet engines on existing aircraft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each company is suing in its home turf and it&#8217;s likely to
set up a battle as to where the dispute will be heard. Under
federal law, the judges will have to decide which court is more
convenient for both parties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first case is Rolls-Royce Plc v. United Technologies
Corp., 10cv457, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
Virginia (Alexandria). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Sues Novo Nordisk Over Insulin Injection Technology &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, sued Danish
competitor Novo Nordisk A/S in a U.K. court to invalidate its
patent for an injection mechanism that prevents overdoses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk&#8217;s European patent for the dose-setting device
is based on claims that weren&#8217;t new when the patent application
was filed, New York-based Pfizer said in a complaint in the High
Court in London. The suit, filed July 5 and made public this
week, didn&#8217;t say if Pfizer is using the technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We disagree with Pfizer&#8217;s claim and we will defend the
patent in court,&#8221; Mike Rulis, a spokesman for Bagsvaerd,
Denmark-based Novo Nordisk, said yesterday in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and Novo Nordisk, the world&#8217;s biggest maker of the
diabetes treatment insulin, have sparred over delivery methods
for the drug since at least 2005. The disputed patent concerns a
device that lets doctors set maximum dose limits to prevent the
visually impaired and other groups from using too much during
self injections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer also sued Novo Nordisk in Switzerland over the same
patent, which expires in 2026, Pfizer spokeswoman Charlotte
Binstead said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk in December started the first human tests on
an experimental insulin pill, joining companies seeking to
develop an alternative to daily injections. The challenge is to
develop an oral form of insulin -- a large and complex molecule
-- that can survive its trip through the digestive system,
according to Technology Review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies&#8217; earlier dispute concerned Pfizer&#8217;s inhaled-
insulin product Exubera, seen as a possible replacement to
injections. Pfizer stopped selling the product in 2007 when it
failed to catch on with doctors and patients, while Novo Nordisk
abandoned its inhaled version the following year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies in 2007 settled a U.S. patent-infringement
suit over Exubera. In that case, Novo Nordisk sued Pfizer in
federal court in New York, claiming Exubera infringed two
patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K.&#8217;s IPO Website Focuses on Golfers&#8217; IP Competition &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K.&#8217;s Intellectual Property Office is focusing on this
week&#8217;s Ryder Cup golf competition at the Celtic Manor Resort in
Newport, Wales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several Ryder Cup-related articles are posted on the
office&#8217;s website, including one that compares and contrasts the
IP estates of the two teams&#8217; individual players. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The selection of Tiger Woods to the U.S. team virtually
wipes out the U.K.&#8217;s golfer-related IP competition as Woods and
his related companies &#8220;have more trademark registrations than
the combined total of all trademark applications, trademark
registrations, patent applications, and patents of the entire
remaining field,&#8221; according to one of the articles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second article notes that the European patent office has
54,699 patents mentioning the word &#8220;golf,&#8221; and that the U.K.&#8217;s
Acushnet Europe Ltd. holds more than 600 patents on golf balls
alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanofi&#8217;s Patents on Cancer Drug Taxotere Invalidated &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanofi-Aventis SA&#8217;s patents on its cancer drug Taxotere
were ruled invalid by a U.S. judge, potentially clearing the way
for Hospira Inc. and Apotex Inc. to start selling generic
versions of the medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the Sanofi patents are obvious variations of an
earlier patent on docetaxel, the active ingredient in Taxotere,
U.S. District Judge Gregory Sleet in Wilmington, Delaware, said
in an opinion filed yesterday. The judge also ruled that Sanofi
misled the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to obtain the
patents, so it shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to enforce them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taxotere, used to treat prostate cancer, generated 2.18
billion euros ($2.9 billion) in global sales in 2009 for Paris-
based Sanofi. Like Tamixofen, which is used to treat breast
cancer, Taxotere is derived from the Pacific Yew tree, Taxus
brevifolia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lake Forest, Illinois-based Hospira, is seeking to sell an
injectable product with the same active ingredient in Taxotere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court&#8217;s ruling is &#8220;clearly a positive step forward&#8221;
for Hospira, said Frederick Wise, a New York-based analyst with
Leerink Swann  Co. &#8220;There was some anticipation that we might
see this sometime before the end of the year but this came
faster, clearer and a little more positive than those
expectations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wise said every $100 million Hospira gets in sales will
translate into 5 cents to 10 cents in earnings per share.
Hospira has kept plans about the generic under wraps, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taxotere has been on the market since 1996, according to
information on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#8217;s website.
Sanofi sought to block the generic-drug rivals until the patent
terms end in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanofi won U.S. regulatory approval in June for a new type
of chemotherapy to treat patients with advanced prostate cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Taxotere patents cover a formulation containing
docetaxel, a compound that&#8217;s already covered by another patent.
It would have been obvious for scientists to come up with the
specific formula for Taxotere, the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disputed patents -- 5,714,512 and 5,750,561 -- were
issued in February 1998 and May 1998 respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Hospira, Dan Rosenberg, said the ruling
&#8220;paves the way for launch&#8221; of their product when the compound
patent expires in November. &#8220;We recognize that this is ongoing
litigation&#8221; subject to appeal, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elie Betito, a spokesman for closely held Apotex, had no
immediate comment on the ruling. Megan Humphrey, a Sanofi
spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t return voice and e-mail messages seeking
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consolidated case is Aventis Pharma SA v. Hospira Inc.
and Apotex Inc., 07CV721, U.S. District Court, District of
Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Anti-Piracy Report Endorsed by Children, Dead Artists &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the European artists who petitioned the European
Parliament to adopt a report supporting stronger copyright laws
are either dead or barely old enough to write, the TorrentFreak
website reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gallo Report, &#8220;Enforcement of Intellectual Property
Rights in the Internal Market,&#8221; was adopted by the European
Parliament last week, TorrentFreak reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parliament was sent a petition supporting the report by the
entertainment industry purportedly signed by Hungarian filmmaker
Lazlo Kovacs, who died in July 2007, according to TorrentFreak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other names on the petition included Cleopatra Stratan, a
7-year-old singer from Moldovia, and Michel Sardou, a French
singer, who, according to TorrentFreak, has previously
acknowledged being a pirate himself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue Bunny Maker Claims Dippin&#8217; Dots&#8217; Chillz Infringes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Dairy Inc., maker of Blue Bunny ice cream, sued a
Kentucky-based maker of cryogenically frozen ice cream for
trademark infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dippin&#8217; Dots Chillz non-fat ice cream made by Dippin&#8217;
Dots Inc., of Paducah, Kentucky is accused of infringing the
&#8220;Lemon Chill&#8221; trademark Wells used for a lemon-flavored
Italian ice, according to the complaint filed Sept. 24 in
federal court in Iowa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells registered &#8220;Chill&#8221; with the U.S. Trademark office
in November 1997 and &#8220;Lemon Chill&#8221; in January 1996, the La
Mars, Iowa-based company said in its court papers. Wells claims
these marks are infringed and the public is confused by Dippin&#8217;
Dots &#8220;Chillz&#8221; mark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers are likely to assume falsely that a nexus exists
between the two companies and their products, the Iowa ice
cream-maker claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It asked the court to bar Dippin&#8217; Dots&#8217; use of &#8220;Chillz&#8221;
and to remove all promotional material bearing the word. It also
seeks an award of all &#8220;earnings, profits, receipts and
advantages&#8221; relative to the alleged infringement, and asked
that the company be forced to pay for advertising &#8220;to dispel,
cure or counteract any public confusion&#8221; caused by the alleged
infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells also asked the court to order Dippin&#8217; Dots to abandon
an application to register Chillz as a trademark, and seeks
awards of money damages, tripled, and litigation costs and
attorney fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is represented by Bruce W. McKee, Christine
Lebron-Dykeman, and Kurt Van Thomme of McKee, Voorhees  Sease
PLC, of Des Moines, Iowa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Wells Dairy Inc. v. Dippin Dots Inc., 5:10-cv-
04090-MWB, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Iowa. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Green&#8217; Technology New Target for Intellectual Property Theft &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Green&#8221; technology is an &#8220;increasingly active target&#8221;
of those who would steal trade secrets, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement noted that in July a Michigan couple was
indicted for allegedly stealing $40 million worth of General
Motors Co. trade secrets related to hybrid engines. The couple,
Yu Qin and ShanShan Du, had hoped to sell the secrets to one of
the automaker&#8217;s Chinese competitors, according to the FBI
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two were indicted in federal court in Detroit July 21.
According to court documents, Du was hired as an engineer with
GM&#8217;s advanced technology vehicles group in 2000, where she had
access to hybrid vehicle technology trade secrets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qin, her husband, started a company related to power
electronics and it was through this company that they planned to
develop and sell hybrid-vehicle motor control technology to a
Chinese company, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Du is accused of copying &#8220;thousands of GM documents,
including documents containing GM trade secrets&#8221; to an external
drive, and falsely telling GM she&#8217;d returned all of the
company&#8217;s proprietary information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The couple planned to provide the trade secrets as part of
a proposed collaboration with China&#8217;s Chery Automobile Co. Ltd.,
the government claimed in the indictment. They are also accused
of shredding and discarding documents related to their company
and hybrid vehicles that were subject of federal grand jury
subpoenas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to an FBI statement, Du and Quin face potential
fines of as much as $750,000 and prison terms that could total
50 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Du is represented by Robert M. Morgan of Detroit, and Qin&#8217;s
defense counsel is Frank D. Eaman, also of Detroit. Neither
responded immediately to e-mailed requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case against the couple is U.S. v. Qin, 2:10-CR-20454-
MOB-RSW, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Michigan
(Detroit). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other recent trade secret-misappropriation cases involved a
chemist at a paint manufacturer and a research scientist for an
agricultural company, according to the FBI statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the &#8220;greening&#8221; of the American economy, the FBI says
it&#8217;s &#8220;not surprising&#8221; that the new technologies are sought out
by &#8220;information thieves looking to make a fast buck.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A group of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
traders in the U.S. is being pursued by at least three competing
firms including Avenue Capital Group as the investment bank
prepares to break up the unit, according to two people briefed
on the discussions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc Lasry, founder of Avenue Capital, is courting the
Goldman Sachs team run by Bob Howard to expand his New York-
based firm beyond its focus on distressed and credit investing,
the people, who asked not to be named because the talks are
private, said yesterday. He&#8217;s vying with buyout firm KKR  Co.
and investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners LP, which also are
negotiating with Howard, people with knowledge of the matter
said Sept. 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is disbanding the principal-strategies
business to comply with new U.S. rules aimed at curbing risk.
Members of the unit, which uses multiple strategies to make bets
with the New York-based firm&#8217;s own money, could go their own way
if an agreement isn&#8217;t reached soon, said Robert Olman, president
of Alpha Search Advisory Partners, a recruitment firm based in
Roslyn, New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The longer it takes to work out a deal, the more likely
that members of the team will work something out for themselves
elsewhere,&#8221; Olman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lasry, 51, declined to comment, as did Ed Canaday, a
spokesman for Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avenue Capital was founded by Lasry and Sonia Gardner in
1995 and managed $18.8 billion at the end of July, according to
its website. The firm says it has more than 300 employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post-Goldman Options &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs group is led globally by Hong Kong-based
Morgan Sze, who may start his own hedge fund focused on Asia,
two people with knowledge of the matter said earlier this month.
Sze in March replaced Pierre-Henri Flamand, the former global
head who left to set up a London-based hedge fund called Edoma
Capital Partners LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the principal strategies group&#8217;s traders and
support staff may get roles at Goldman Sachs or seek jobs
independently, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest asset manager, also
held talks to hire one or more people from the Goldman Sachs
group, a person with knowledge of the talks said earlier this
month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post-Goldman Options &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs group is led globally by Hong Kong-based
Morgan Sze, who may start his own hedge fund focused on Asia,
two people with knowledge of the matter said earlier this month.
Sze in March replaced Pierre-Henri Flamand, the former global
head who left to set up a London-based hedge fund called Edoma
Capital Partners LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the principal strategies group&#8217;s traders and
support staff may get roles at Goldman Sachs or seek jobs
independently, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest asset manager, also
held talks to hire one or more people from the Goldman Sachs
group, a person with knowledge of the talks said earlier this
month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. House of Representatives
passed legislation prodding China to raise the value of the yuan,
as Democratic lawmakers pressed election-season proposals they
said would increase factory employment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measure on China&#8217;s currency passed 348-79, with 99
Republicans voting with Democrats. It&#8217;s the first time the House
passed such legislation after years of vows to do so by
lawmakers in industrial states such as Ohio, Michigan and
Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For many, many years we have watched the China trade
deficit grow and grow and grow, and today we are doing something
about it,&#8221; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a San Francisco Democrat,
said before the vote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Property Curbs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China will speed up the introduction of a trial property
tax in some cities and then expand the levy to the whole country
to curb rising real estate prices, the government said, without
giving a timetable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state also asked commercial banks to stop offering
loans to buyers of third homes and extended a 30 percent down
payment requirement to all first-home buyers, according to a
statement posted on the government website. The down payment
level previously applied only to homes larger than 90 square
meters (969 square feet). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Property prices in 70 major cities rose 9.3 percent in
August from a year earlier, prompting the government to extend a
crackdown on speculators and multiple home purchases. The state
may implement the property tax soon in cities including
Shanghai, Shenzhen and Chongqing, according to Credit Suisse
Group AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sells ICBC &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is seeking to reap HK$15.9 billion
($2.05 billion) from selling shares in Industrial  Commercial
Bank of China Ltd. in a transaction that would give it a
fourfold return on its 2006 investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is offering 2.75 billion shares at HK$5.70 to
HK$5.79 apiece, according to a term sheet for the proposed sale.
The offer represents a discount of as much as 4.5 percent from
yesterday&#8217;s closing price in Hong Kong for the world&#8217;s largest
lender by market value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saskatchewan Potash Concerns &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Canadian province of Saskatchewan has concerns about a
possible purchase of Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. by China,
Premier Brad Wall said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They are a major purchasing country and we have concerns
about that type of arrangement,&#8221; Wall said at a news conference
in Saskatoon. &#8220;China has done a good job of balancing its
interests.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett in Beijing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett said the meeting he and Bill Gates had in
Beijing with 50 Chinese leaders in business and philanthropy
&#8220;was a complete success,&#8221; according to a release from the Bill
 Melinda Gates Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We had a terrific exchange of views, and learned a great
deal about the good work that is already underway,&#8221; Buffett
said, according to the e-mailed release. &#8220;Today&#8217;s generation of
successful entrepreneurs has the chance to lead and inspire
giving for generations to come.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chicken Quotas Invalid &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. restrictions on imports of Chinese chicken, turkey and
duck that are no longer in place broke global commerce rules,
the World Trade Organization said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WTO judges in Geneva agreed with China that a congressional
spending bill preventing authorities from processing shipments
of cooked Chinese poultry unfairly closed the American market.
China, the third-biggest market for U.S. farm goods, called the
measure discriminatory and protectionist because its poultry met
international health standards and it was shipping chicken to
Europe and Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Saudi Oil &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s imports of oil from Saudi Arabia, the world&#8217;s
largest crude exporter, will increase 19 percent in 2010 from
last year, the official Saudi Press Agency reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese imports will increase to 50 million metric tons
compared with 41.95 million tons last year, the Riyadh-based
news service said, citing Yang Honglin, China&#8217;s ambassador to
Saudi Arabia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satcon GCL Poly &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satcon Technology Corp. rose the most in seven weeks in
Nasdaq trading after the maker of solar-power inverters reached
an agreement for GCL Solar Systems Ltd. to produce the devices
in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GCL, a developer of solar plants, will commission a factory
in Nanjing with capacity to build more than 500 megawatts of
Satcon inverters next year, the Boston-based company said in a
statement. Financial terms weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARKETS: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks fell, trimming the best September rally for the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index since 1939, amid concern that
Europe&#8217;s debt crisis will worsen and the profit outlook for
banks and retailers is deteriorating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Wells Fargo  Co. paced losses in
financial companies. Urban Outfitters Inc. slumped 7.3 percent
as Hennes  Mauritz AB, Europe&#8217;s second-largest clothing
retailer, said third-quarter profitability missed analysts&#8217;
estimates. Benchmark indexes fluctuated earlier as energy
companies rallied on higher oil prices and Hewlett-Packard Co.
surged after its earnings forecast topped estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 fell 0.3 percent to 1,144.72 at 4 p.m. in New
York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 22.86 points, or
0.2 percent, to 10,835.28 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE FOLLOWING STOCKS MAY BE ACTIVE TODAY: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers: China will speed up the introduction of a trial
property tax in some cities and then expand the levy to the
whole country to curb rising real estate prices, the government

National Radio reported, citing a government report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baoshan Iron  Steel Co. (600019 CH): The listed unit of
China&#8217;s second-biggest steelmaker rose 1.2 percent to 6.54 yuan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of Ningbo Co. (002142 CH): The bank has won approval
from the China Banking Regulatory Commission to establish a
branch in the eastern city of Wuxi, it said in a statement to

</body></entry><entry author="By Michelle Fay Cortez" date="Sep 29, 2010  5:00 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-29/pfizer-arthritis-drug-cut-pain-too-well-leading-to-joint-damage-in-study.html"><headline>Pfizer Arthritis Drug Quenched Pain Too Well, Leading to Damage</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;An experimental arthritis drug from
Pfizer Inc. reduced pain more than researchers anticipated,
doctors said. It also allowed previously hobbled patients to
overuse and permanently damage their joints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bone destruction developed in 16 of 6,800 patients taking
the medicine, tanezumab, as part of Pfizer&#8217;s development
program, and they all needed a complete joint replacement for
the affected knee, hip or shoulder, according to a report in the
New England Journal of Medicine. Pain-free patients may have put
excessive pressure on their fragile joints because they weren&#8217;t
getting natural pain signals to take it easy, said the lead
researcher, Nancy Lane. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is more potent than any pain medication I have ever
had in arthritis,&#8221; said Lane, director of the Center for Aging
at the University of California at Davis School of Medicine in
Sacramento, in a telephone interview. &#8220;Because this is a new
chapter in controlling pain, we didn&#8217;t realize we needed to
counsel our patients in using their joints that were still
diseased. Now we need to figure out how to use it so the risks
don&#8217;t outweigh the benefits.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Pfizer halted studies of the drug for
osteoarthritis, chronic back pain and diabetes-related nerve
disorders at the request of U.S. regulators in June and July.
The market potential for tanezumab and similar medicines was
estimated at $11 billion, Catherine Arnold, a New York-based
managing director at Credit Suisse, wrote in a May 3 note to
investors before the drug problems emerged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking with FDA &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is discussing tanezumab&#8217;s development program with
officials at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, said MacKay
Jimeson, a company spokesman. The definitive cause of the
complication hasn&#8217;t been determined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies of the drug in patients with cancer pain and
chronic pancreatitis are under way. Publication of the paper
underscores the scientific interest in finding new methods to
treat pain, Jimeson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lane&#8217;s group studied 450 patients with moderate to severe
osteoarthritis, a disease of the cartilage that protects the
ends of bones in a joint. The tissue absorbs the impact from
movement and allows the bones to slide along each other with
less friction. For 27 million Americans with osteoarthritis, the
cartilage wears away, causing pain and swelling and limiting
motion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients in the study received an injection of tanezumab or
placebo on the first day and during the eighth week of
treatment. Almost half of the patients were already candidates
for joint replacement because of damage. Reduction in knee pain
ranged from 45 percent to 62 percent in those given the Pfizer
drug, depending on the dose, compared with 22 percent for those
given placebo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side Effects &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common side effects were headaches, colds and
numbness or tingling of the skin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings, from the second of three stages needed for
regulatory approval, prompted Pfizer to move the medicine into
final studies. It was in those 13 trials involving 9,100
patients that the rapid progression of arthritis occurred in 16
people, triggering regulators to put the research on hold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pain has an important role in the avoidance of self-harm,
but chronic inflammatory pain has generally been considered to
be wholly undesirable,&#8221; said John Wood, professor of
neurobiology at University College London, in an editorial that
accompanied the research. &#8220;The study by Lane et al. suggests
that a complete quenching of pain in patients with
osteoarthritis may not necessarily be a good thing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different Joint &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more than half of the 16 patients, worsening arthritis
and the need for surgery occurred in a joint other than the one
originally targeted in the study, the researchers said. One
patient developed a problem in the shoulder, an uncommon
location for damage from osteoarthritis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tanezumab, a nerve growth factor inhibitor, was considered
one of Pfizer&#8217;s most promising compounds in development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar treatments are in early stages of development at
Johnson  Johnson of New Brunswick, New Jersey; Regeneron
Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Tarrytown, New York; Sanofi-Aventis SA
of Paris; Abbott Laboratories of Abbott Park, Illinois; and
AstraZeneca Plc of London, Lane said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;ve never worked with anything that&#8217;s been this good for
pain,&#8221; Lane said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s perfect, but it is a
game changer, provided we learn how to use it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Brazilians stocks fell amid
concern that Europe&#8217;s debt crisis will worsen, overshadowing a
recommendation by JPMorgan Chase  Co. advising clients to buy
the nation&#8217;s stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gerdau SA and Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA,
Brazil&#8217;s biggest steelmakers, sank more than 2 percent. Net
Servicos de Comunicacao SA, Brazil&#8217;s biggest cable-TV provider,
dropped after Embratel Participacoes SA postponed an auction to
buy Net shares until Oct. 7 from today. Declines were limited as
Itau Unibanco Holding SA led a rally for banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bovespa stock index was little changed at 69,228.24 at
4:38 a.m. New York time. More than two stocks fell on the index
for every one that rose. The real strengthened 0.2 percent to
1.7031 per dollar. The measure is up 14 percent since June 30,
heading to the biggest quarterly gain in a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market is now attractively valued, not well owned,
and performance has been held back by a number of overhangs,&#8221;
wrote JPMorgan strategists led by Ben Laidler in New York in a
research report dated yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian stocks fluctuated between gains and losses today
as U.S. stocks retreated on concern the Europe&#8217;s most-indebted
nations will struggle to finance budget deficits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spain&#8217;s top credit rating at Moody&#8217;s Investors Service is
at risk as the nation struggles to emerge from recession and
reduce its budget deficit, according to a Bloomberg News survey.
Ireland will announce the cost of bailing out Anglo Irish Bank
Corp. tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil Stocks Upgrade &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gerdau fell 2.3 percent to 22.84 reais. Usiminas dropped
2.4 percent to 22.55 reais. Net slipped 2.1 percent to 21.83
reais. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Itau rose 1.8 percent to 39.76 reais. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian stocks were upgraded to &#8220;overweight&#8221; by
JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Latin America strategists, who cited
attractive valuations, &#8220;moderate&#8221; interest-rate increases and
declining political risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s Bovespa Index has advanced 0.9 percent this year,
trailing the 5.6 percent gain in the MSCI EM Latin America
Index, as central bank rate increases, a slowdown in Chinese
demand, upcoming presidential elections and Petroleo Brasileiro
SA&#8217;s $70 billion share sale deterred investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petrobras gained for a third day, rising 3 percent to 27.50
reais. Petrobras wants to develop the Franco field &#8220;as fast as
possible,&#8221; Francisco Nepomuceno, head of the Rio de Janeiro-
based company&#8217;s exploration and production Europe office, said
in an interview in Lisbon today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bovespa index trades for 12.9 times analysts&#8217; earnings
estimates, compared with 12.7 times for the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index of 21 developing nations&#8217; stocks and 15.6 times
for Mexico&#8217;s IPC index, according to weekly data compiled by
Bloomberg. The Bovespa trades at 15.1 times the reported profits
of its companies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monsanto Co.&#8217;s SmartStax corn, a
new seed with eight genetic changes, probably won&#8217;t yield more
than a less-expensive technology that has three added genes,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monsanto still will increase its corn-seed sales because
the new technology provides a yield benefit by allowing farmers
to reduce plantings of conventional corn, Goldman Sachs analysts
led by Robert Koort said today in a report. Regulators require
conventional corn to be sown near insect-killing corn to prevent
bugs from developing insecticide resistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We no longer expect SmartStax to outyield its robust
triple stacks,&#8221; Houston-based Koort said in the report. &#8220;Yield
parity is the new target.&#8221; Koort reduced the share-price target
for the world&#8217;s largest seed producer to $64 from $71. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monsanto Chief Executive Officer Hugh Grant is counting on
SmartStax, billed in December as &#8220;the highest yielding corn
product available,&#8221; to halt DuPont Co.&#8217;s recent market-share
gains and help boost annual profit 13 percent to 17 percent
after earnings from Roundup herbicide collapsed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monsanto fell 75 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $48 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
tumbled 15 percent since the St. Louis-based company said on
Sept. 20 that early harvest data showed some SmartStax corn
hybrids were missing yield projections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferies Report &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SmartStax corn yields in Iowa are so far trailing so-called
triple stacks, which have three genetic modifications, by 3
percent to 5 percent, Laurence Alexander, an analyst at
Jefferies  Co., said yesterday. Koort said the gap may narrow
as the harvest extends north into regions with more insect
infestation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While the early harvest data is disappointing, we believe
developments are not as poor as implied&#8221; by the stock&#8217;s
performance, Koort said in the report. Goldman maintained its
2011 earnings estimate of $2.87 a share and its &#8220;neutral&#8221;
rating on the shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG analysts led by David Begleiter said in a
report today that the share-price decline is &#8220;overdone.&#8221; They
said the yield under-performance is correctable because it was
caused by one specific variety of seed, known as DeKalb 61-21,
not the SmartStax technology that was applied to that seed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Deutsche Bank analysts cut their 2011 earnings estimate
by 10 cents a share to $2.80 to reflect costs that Monsanto may
incur under its SmartStax satisfaction guarantee. They lowered
their share-price target by $5 to $65 and maintained their
&#8220;buy&#8221; rating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monsanto Policy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monsanto will provide credits for future seed purchases to
farmers who are dissatisfied with SmartStax corn seed, Kelli Powers, a company spokeswoman, said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SmartStax, developed with Dow Chemical Co., is still
expected to yield 5 percent to 10 percent more than triple
stacks when all the data is collected, Powers said. Better
genetics, insect resistance and the requirement for a smaller
refuge of conventional corn will improve yields, she said. &lt;/p&gt;

year convertible notes to help repay short-term debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Including an oversubscription option, the issue may raise
as much as $500 million, the Dubai-government-controlled company
said in a statement posted on its website today. JPMorgan Chase
 Co., Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Standard Chartered
Plc are managing the sale and the securities will be listed on
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s very obvious that they are replacing short-term debt
with long-term debt, which is the smart thing to do,&#8221; Ahmed Badr, a Dubai-based analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, said by
telephone. Demand for the issue will be greater than the number
of notes offered, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emaar, along with another state-controlled developer
Nakheel PJSC, spearheaded a building boom in Dubai after the
emirate allowed foreigners to buy homes in some areas in 2002.
The building boom was halted in 2008 after the global credit
crisis dried up mortgage lending and demand evaporated, sparking
a more than 50 percent plunge in home prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crisis Impact &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emaar, which has developed the world&#8217;s tallest tower in
Dubai, had 9.5 billion dirhams ($2.6 billion) of outstanding
debt at the end of June, according to its quarterly results
filing. Of that, 5.2 billion dirhams is due within 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developer may have to make provisions related to its 48
percent stake in Amlak Finance PJSC, the U.A.E.&#8217;s second-biggest
mortgage lender, which has been unable to raise funds since the
seizer of global credit markets. The writedown will be necessary
should &#8220;Amlak&#8217;s financial condition worsen or fail to
improve,&#8221; Emaar said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of Dubai&#8217;s state-owned companies are struggling to
repay debt after the economic crisis froze debt markets and
prevented them from raising new loans. Dubai World, one of the
emirate&#8217;s three main state-owned holding companies, said on
Sept. 10 it reached an agreement with more than 99 percent of
its creditors to alter the terms on $24.9 billion of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dubai&#8217;s government today raised $1.25 billion from the sale
of five- and 10-year notes, tapping international capital
markets for the first time since the Dubai World debt crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emaar&#8217;s convertible notes may pay a coupon of 7.25 percent
to 8.25 percent and will convert at a premium of 20 percent to
30 percent to the reference share price, according to the offer
document. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which
agreed in July to pay $550 million to settle a U.S. regulator&#8217;s
fraud suit, rolled out an advertising campaign today with ads
that emphasize the firm&#8217;s role in alternative energy and job
creation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ads began in the New York Times and the Wall Street
Journal and will extend to other national, regional and local
newspapers during the next few months, said David Wells, a
spokesman for the New York firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the most profitable U.S. securities firm in
Wall Street history, is trying to repair a reputation tarnished
by the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s suit and an April
U.S. Senate hearing at which it was accused of betting against
the investments sold to clients. The ads will feature different
descriptions of the firm&#8217;s business and also appear on the
Internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re expanding our communication to a broader audience
in an effort to promote a better understanding of who we are and
what we do,&#8221; Wells said. &#8220;The ads show how we support our
clients, including corporations, municipalities, institutions
and individuals.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today&#8217;s full-page ads, a photo of a field of wind
turbines under a cloudy sky is juxtaposed with a picture of a
smiling man in a hard hat and work clothes. The ad, carrying the
tag line &#8220;Progress is Everyone&#8217;s Business,&#8221; describes how the
firm helped an unidentified renewable energy company find
investors, enabling it to expand and create jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Mealy-Mouthed&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s like they&#8217;re apologizing for being bad boys,&#8221;
said Jerry Della Femina, chairman and chief executive officer of
Della Femina/Jeary and Partners in New York, who has worked in
the ad industry since the 1960s. The ad is &#8220;too weak, too
wimpy, too mealy-mouthed,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The people who don&#8217;t like them and the people who don&#8217;t
respect them are not going to have their opinion changed by
looking at this,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The people who do like them and
respect them may see them as a bit diminished.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells declined to disclose the budget for the campaign,
which is being handled by Young  Rubicam Inc., a division of
Dublin-based WPP Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs shares fell $2.30, or 1.6 percent, to $142.71
at 10 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. They
have declined 15.5 percent this year compared with a 2.6 percent
gain in the SP 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is seeking
to reap HK$15.9 billion ($2.05 billion) from selling shares in
Industrial  Commercial Bank of China Ltd. in a transaction that
would give it a fourfold return on its 2006 investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is offering 2.75 billion shares at HK$5.70 to
HK$5.79 apiece, according to a term sheet for the proposed sale.
The offer represents a discount of as much as 4.5 percent from
the closing price in Hong Kong today for the world&#8217;s largest
lender by market value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale follows Goldman Sachs&#8217;s disposal of an almost
$2 billion stake in ICBC in June 2009, when it offloaded the
shares it was free to divest as it repaid bailout funds to the
U.S. government. The New York-based lender will hold a stake
worth about $8 billion in Beijing-based ICBC following the
latest transaction, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of ICBC have slumped 7.3 percent in Hong Kong
trading this year, compared with a 2.3 percent gain in the
benchmark Hang Seng Index. Edward Naylor, a Hong Kong-based
spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs bought 4.9 percent of ICBC for about $2.59
billion in 2006, when the U.S. bank invested $940 million and
funds managed by the company paid about $1.65 billion for stakes
in ICBC, according to a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government rested its case
yesterday in a prosecution that may provide a preview of next
year&#8217;s trial of Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam,
accused of helping direct the largest-ever hedge fund insider
trading scam, Bloomberg News&#8217; David Glovin reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The week-long trial of Joseph Contorinis, 46, a former
general partner of the Jefferies Paragon Fund, has yielded
testimony by an ex-UBS AG investment banker that he was fed
secret tips by a former managing director at Blackstone Group
LP, and that he leaked information on mergers to an analyst at
SAC Capital Advisors LP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial, though unrelated to the Galleon case, may show
how Rajaratnam&#8217;s defense, that he traded based on public
information and press reports, will resonate with a federal jury
in Manhattan. Contorinis has made a similar argument in pleading
not guilty in his case, which is being prosecuted by Assistant
U.S. Attorneys Andrew Fish and Reed Brodsky -- both also
involved in Galleon case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s an opportunity for the defendants in Rajaratnam to
see how the defense plays before a jury,&#8221; Jacob Frenkel, a
former Securities and Exchange Commission attorney, said in an
interview. Frenkel, a partner at Shulman Rogers Gandal Pordy 
Ecker PA in Potomac, Maryland, isn&#8217;t involved in either case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contorinis, who lives in Brooklyn, is accused of earning
more than $7 million and avoiding losses of millions more by
trading on tips from the government&#8217;s chief witness, Nicos
Stephanou. An associate director of mergers and acquisitions at
Zurich-based UBS, Stephanou told him about transactions from
2004 to 2006, prosecutors said. The trial began Sept. 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim McCarthy, a spokesman for Rajaratnam, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Contorinis, 09-cr-1083, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep-Water Drilling Ban May End &#8216;Soon,&#8217; U.S. Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Interior Secretary Kenneth Salazar may lift the
federal ban on deep-water oil drilling &#8220;soon,&#8221; now that the
measure has met some of its goals, the government said in court
papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salazar imposed new rules on offshore drilling in waters
deeper than 500 feet on July 12, after a New Orleans judge found
an earlier moratorium too broad. The rules set multiple
milestones to be reached before drilling may resume, said
attorney Ignacia S. Moreno, in a court filing last night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Several of these milestones have been met or are likely
to be reached in the coming days,&#8221; Moreno said in a request to
delay a hearing in a lawsuit challenging the ban. &#8220;The
secretary is likely to take action soon on whether and how he
will lift the current deepwater drilling suspension.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama imposed the first six-month
moratorium on deep-water drilling on May 28 in reaction to the
BP Plc Gulf of Mexico oil spill, the worst in U.S. history. U.S.
District Judge Martin Feldman overturned that ban and is
considering a lawsuit challenging a second imposed in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. asked Feldman to postpone a hearing scheduled for
today over this second challenge, while allowing the government
to file a status report on regulators&#8217; activities. The
milestones that have been met include containment and killing of
the BP well and completion of public hearings on the spill,
Moreno said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sean O&#8217;Neill, a spokesman for drilling contractor Ensco
Offshore Co., which sued to stop the second ban, didn&#8217;t return a
call yesterday seeking comment on the government&#8217;s request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a U.S. Justice Department official said that
no talks are under way with BP on settling criminal or civil
charges stemming from the oil spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because
of the department&#8217;s continuing inquiry into the spill, commented
after an Associated Press report cited Representative Steve
Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, as saying a possible settlement
was under discussion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott Dean, a spokesman for London-based BP, declined to
comment. Stephen Bell, a spokesman for Scalise, said the
congressman was referring to the likely process of trying to
reach a settlement to avoid litigation, not actual talks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Any assumption that Congressman Scalise, or his staff,
has specific or detailed knowledge of negotiations between BP
and the Department of Justice is inaccurate,&#8221; Bell said in an
e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drilling ban case is Ensco Offshore Co. v. Salazar,
2:10-cv-01941, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Louisiana (New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;United, Continental Defeat Effort to Block Merger &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UAL Corp.&#8217;s merger with Continental Airlines Inc. won&#8217;t
create a monopoly and shouldn&#8217;t be blocked on antitrust grounds,
a federal judge ruled, helping to clear the way for the deal&#8217;s
completion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg in San Francisco said
Sept. 27 that the plaintiffs failed to argue adequately the
acquisition will substantially reduce competition in the airline
industry, and declined to enjoin the pact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs&#8217; &#8220;failure to establish a viable relevant
market dooms any effort to show this merger will substantially
lessen competition, thereby negating their ability to raise even
serious questions, let alone a likelihood of success on the
merits,&#8221; which is required for granting a preliminary
injunction, Seeborg wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholders of Houston-based Continental and Chicago-based
UAL on Sept. 17 approved the $3.22 billion all-stock merger that
was announced in May. The airlines received regulatory approval
from the Justice Department in July to merge, creating an
airline company surpassing Delta Air Lines Inc. as the world&#8217;s
biggest. The merger is expected to be completed by Oct. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Unfortunately and disappointingly, the court did not take
into account the Supreme Court decisions that would have
prevented and stopped the merger,&#8221; Joseph Alioto, an attorney
who filed the suit in June on behalf of consumers, said in a
phone interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consumers claim the merger will increase fares, reduce
flights and eliminate jobs. The challenge &#8220;at least deserves a
trial on the merits,&#8221; Alioto, of San Francisco, said in a Sept.
17 court argument. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alioto said yesterday he will appeal Seeborg&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are gratified by the court&#8217;s decision to deny the
plaintiff&#8217;s motion,&#8221; Julie King, a spokeswoman for Continental,
said yesterday in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased with the court&#8217;s decision, which is in
keeping with the review by the Department of Justice,&#8221; Jean
Medina, a spokeswoman for United, said yesterday by e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They said they expect the merger to close Oct. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Malaney v. UAL Corp., 10-02858, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Racketeering Suit Against Blavatnik Fails on Appeal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norex Petroleum Ltd. can&#8217;t use U.S. racketeering law to sue
billionaire Leonard Blavatnik and his Access Industries Holdings
LLC over the acquisition of an interest in a Russian oil
venture, a U.S. appeals court ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norex, a Cypriot company with an office in Calgary, claimed
that New York-based Access and other defendants deprived it of a
majority interest in Yugraneft Corp., a unit of BP Plc&#8217;s Russian
venture, through illegal means including the bribery of Russian
officials and corrupt Russian bankruptcy proceedings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lower court dismissed the case. A U.S. appeals court in
Manhattan yesterday upheld the dismissal, citing a June ruling
by the Supreme Court that limits the reach of civil claims for
acts occurring outside the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;slim contacts&#8221; of the racketeering activity alleged
by Norex were &#8220;insufficient to support extraterritorial
application&#8221; of the law, the appeals panel wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norex, controlled by businessman Alex Rotzang, said in its
2002 suit that Access and other defendants sought to seize
control of the Russian oil producer. Other defendants included
London-based BP, Europe&#8217;s second-largest oil company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Norex Petroleum v. Access Industries, 02-cv-
1499, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UBS Client Wins Court Appeal Against Transfer of Data to U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switzerland&#8217;s administrative court ruled that a client of
UBS AG, the country&#8217;s biggest bank, has the right to fight a
decision to hand over his account details to U.S. tax
authorities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unidentified UBS client must be allowed to make his
case to Swiss tax authorities, the Bern, Switzerland-based court
said in a Sept. 21 ruling, which was published yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling affects only a &#8220;single case&#8221; where the client
should have been allowed to see the evidence and be heard before
the authorities decided whether to share his data with the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service, court spokesman Andrea Arcidiacono
said by telephone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switzerland 13 months ago agreed to examine and make
decisions on the handover to the IRS of data on as many as 4,450
UBS clients suspected of tax evasion. &#8220;Around half&#8221; the data
was transferred by the end of last month, according to Swiss tax
authorities, which expect to deliver most of the accounts by the
autumn. That prompted the IRS to say it will drop a lawsuit
against the bank within months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amaranth Suit Certified as Class Action by U.S. Judge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amaranth Advisors LLC, the hedge fund that collapsed in
2006 after losing $6.6 billion on energy trades, must face a
class-action lawsuit in which it&#8217;s accused of market
manipulation, a judge in New York ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Shira A. Scheindlin said in a decision
made public yesterday that futures traders who bought, sold or
held gas futures or options on futures contracts from Feb. 16 to
Sept. 28 in 2006 can sue as a group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This case is best suited to proceed as a class action,&#8221;
Scheindlin said in the opinion. &#8220;It involves more than 1,000
potential claimants who are asserting claims based on common
issues.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amaranth failed after losing two-thirds of its assets on
natural-gas bets. According to the traders, Amaranth used its
market power to manipulate the prices of natural gas futures
contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hedge fund controlled more than half of the U.S.
natural gas market before it collapsed, according to a 2007 U.S.
Senate report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Judge Scheindlin made no decision on the merits of the
claims against Amaranth and we are confident that if, and when,
those merits are heard, the claims against Amaranth will be
rejected,&#8221; Steven M. Schwartz, a lawyer for Amaranth, said in
an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwartz said the chief economist of the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission determined that Amaranth didn&#8217;t cause the
changes in natural gas futures pricing in 2006. Amaranth is
considering an appeal of Scheindlin&#8217;s ruling, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re Amaranth Natural Gas Commodities
Litigation, 07-cv-06377, U.S. District Court, Southern District
of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qwest, KPN Sued Over 2002 Bankruptcy of KPNQwest, Unpaid Debts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qwest Communications International Inc., Royal KPN NV and
12 executives were sued by KPNQwest NV&#8217;s administrators over the
company&#8217;s 2002 bankruptcy and 4.2 billion euros ($5.7 billion)
of unpaid debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defendants must appear Jan. 19 in a district court in
the Dutch city of Haarlem, KPNQwest&#8217;s court appointed
administrators at law firm Houthoff Buruma said today in an e-
mailed statement. The administrators hold the companies and
executives responsible for the bankruptcy, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;An investigation by the administrators shows that the
bankruptcy was caused by mismanagement and inadequate
supervision,&#8221; the administrators said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KPNQwest, a joint venture of KPN and Qwest, was declared
bankrupt in 2002 after building a 60-city phone and Internet
network just before prices for telecommunications services
collapsed. The company, which served customers including AOL
Inc., Deutsche Telekom AG and Dell Inc. through Europe&#8217;s largest
fiber-optic network, had to sell the 25,000-kilometer system off
in pieces after failing to find a buyer for the whole business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company didn&#8217;t change strategy and tripled its
investments in the network, even though market prices had fallen
by as much as 80 percent by 1999, the year KPNQwest was founded,
the administrators said. Hoofddorp, Netherlands-based KPNQwest
sold shares to the public that year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hague-based KPN, the largest Dutch phone company, is
reviewing the subpoena, said Stefan Simons, a spokesman for the
company, who declined to comment further. Calls before business
hours to Denver-based Qwest, the phone company being acquired by
Louisiana-based CenturyTel Inc., and to the court&#8217;s press office
weren&#8217;t immediately answered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists Can Get Stem-Cell Funding During Appeal, Court Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists who use embryonic stem cells for research can
continue to receive U.S. taxpayer funding while the government
challenges a lower-court order that barred federal support, an
appeals court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington
yesterday puts on hold an order cutting off funding by U.S.
District Judge Royce Lamberth. The government argued the ban
would cause irreparable harm to researchers, taxpayers, and
scientific progress while the case is appealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government&#8217;s lawyers &#8220;have satisfied the standards
required for a stay pending appeal,&#8221; the judges wrote in a one-
page order that said the appeal will be expedited and that the
schedule for briefing and oral arguments will come out later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lifting the ban allows the government to temporarily
continue funding tens of millions of dollars to scientists
seeking cures for diseases such as Parkinson&#8217;s, spinal cord
injuries, and genetic conditions. Embryonic stem cells can grow
into any kind of tissue and may have the potential to accelerate
a range of research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision, coming after oral arguments two days ago, was
made by Judith Rogers, appointed by former President Bill
Clinton, and Thomas Griffith and Brett Kavanaugh, both appointed
by former President George W. Bush. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lamberth on Aug. 23 issued an order temporarily stopping
the Health and Human Services Department and the National
Institutes of Health from funding or conducting the studies. On
Sept. 7, Lamberth denied a U.S. request to reconsider his
ruling. The court of appeals then allowed funding to resume
pending yesterday&#8217;s decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Sherley v. Sebelius, 10-5287, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boeing, General Dynamics Get Hearing in A-12 Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court, accepting a case that will affect
government secrecy claims, agreed to review a ruling that could
force Boeing Co. and General Dynamics Corp to pay $3 billion in
a dispute over a canceled Navy aircraft contract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices yesterday said they will intervene in a 19-
year-old legal dispute over the Pentagon&#8217;s 1991 termination of
the A-12 Avenger stealth fighter aircraft program. A federal
appeals court said the government was justified in canceling the
contract because the companies weren&#8217;t living up to their
obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A victory for the companies could wipe out the government&#8217;s
demand for the return of $1.35 billion in payments, plus the
interest that has accrued over two decades. More broadly, the
case could affect the government&#8217;s use of the so-called state
secrets privilege, which Boeing and General Dynamics say
unfairly prevented them from mounting a defense in their case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;By invoking the state-secrets privilege, the government
has not simply taken some evidence out of this case,&#8221; General
Dynamics argued in its appeal. &#8220;Rather, it has entirely
prevented the contractors from raising a critical defense.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are General Dynamics v. United States, 09-1298,
and Boeing v. United States, 09-1302. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drugmakers Win U.S. High Court Hearing in Bid to Stop Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal by
drugmakers seeking to block thousands of public hospitals and
community health clinics from suing for violations of a federal
program that lets them buy medicines at a discount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices yesterday granted review to an appeal by
companies including units of Pfizer Inc., Merck  Co. and
Sanofi-Aventis SA. The companies are challenging a lower court
ruling permitting a suit against the drugmakers filed by the
California county of Santa Clara. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute centers on the rights of 14,500 health
providers that collectively spend about $4 billion a year on
outpatient drugs. A 2006 government report found that those
providers overpaid by $3.9 million during one month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A San Francisco-based federal appeals court said the
providers can sue to enforce a contract between the drugmakers
and the federal government. The companies said the federal law
governing the discount program doesn&#8217;t authorize private suits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Astra USA v. County of Santa Clara, 09-1273,
U.S. Supreme Court (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suits Against Foreign Companies Draw U.S. Supreme Court Review &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to use a case involving three
overseas units of Goodyear Tire  Rubber Co. to consider giving
foreign companies a stronger shield against legal claims filed
in American courts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices yesterday said they will review a ruling that
required the Goodyear units to face a lawsuit filed by the
families of two North Carolina boys killed in a 2004 bus wreck
in France. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A North Carolina state appeals court said the units had
enough of a connection to the state to put them within the
jurisdiction of the courts there, even though the accident took
place elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Goodyear Luxembourg Tires v. Brown, 10-76, U.S.
Supreme Court (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-TFS Broker Fined, Banned in U.K. for AKO Kickbacks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former TFS Derivatives Ltd. broker was banned from
working in the U.K. finance industry for paying kickbacks to a
former trader at hedge fund AKO Capital LLP who pleaded guilty
in June to insider-trading charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the ban, Fabio Massimo De Biase, the broker,
was also fined 252,239 pounds ($400,750) by the U.K. Financial
Services Authority for paying 131,000 pounds to Anjam Ahmad at
AKO in exchange for brokerage business between January 2008 and
September 2009, the regulator said yesterday in a statement. The
men overcharged the hedge fund by $739,000 on commissions to
increase the amount of money they split, the FSA said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;De Biase exploited the trust of his employer and his
client,&#8221; FSA head of enforcement Margaret Cole said. &#8220;This
substantial fine and the ban from working in the financial
services industry are significant penalties and should serve as
a reminder that such behavior is woefully short of that expected
of approved persons and will not be tolerated.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Duffell, a spokesman for De Biase&#8217;s lawyers at Irwin
Mitchell, wasn&#8217;t available to comment. De Biase received a
reduction to his fine for agreeing to settle the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahmad was fined 287,000 pounds in June, 131,000 pounds of
which was for pushing trades to De Biase. In the insider dealing
case, Ahmad admitted to passing information on AKO&#8217;s block
trades to a co-conspirator who placed spread bets before the
hedge fund&#8217;s trades. AKO, where Ahmad worked until September
2009, hasn&#8217;t been accused of wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bar Council of India decided not to permit foreign
lawyers to practice in the country, the Ministry of Law 
Justice said in a statement on the Press Information Bureau
website yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The decision is being subject to a more detailed and

&lt;p&gt;Brazilian stocks were upgraded to
&#8220;overweight&#8221; by JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Latin America
strategists, who cited attractive valuations, &#8220;moderate&#8221;
interest-rate increases and declining political risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should hold more Brazilian shares in their Latin
America portfolios than are represented in benchmark indexes,
JPMorgan strategists led by Ben Laidler in New York wrote in a
research report dated yesterday. The strategists didn&#8217;t include
their previous recommendation in the report and said investors
should keep &#8220;underweight&#8221; Brazil holdings within their global
emerging-market funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s Bovespa Index has advanced 0.9 percent this year,
trailing the 5 percent gain in the MSCI EM Latin America Index,
as central bank rate increases, a slowdown in Chinese demand,
upcoming Presidential elections and Petroleo Brasileiro SA&#8217;s $70
billion share sale deterred investors. Those &#8220;overhangs&#8221; are
receding and may spur inflows into Brazil funds, the strategists
wrote. Dilma Rousseff, the chosen successor of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, is leading voter opinion polls ahead of
the Oct. 3 election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market is now attractively valued, not well owned,
and performance has been held back by a number of overhangs that
are all going,&#8221; the JPMorgan strategists wrote. &#8220;The rate
cycle has been benign, capitalization process over, and
Presidential election is this weekend.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategists downgraded Mexican stocks to &#8220;neutral,&#8221;
saying in the report that the country&#8217;s &#8220;cyclical&#8221; economic
recovery has peaked. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Novozymes A/S lost a U.S. court bid
to prevent Danisco A/S from selling an enzyme used in biofuel
production until a trial can be held on patent-infringement
claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb in Madison, Wisconsin,
rejected arguments by Novozymes that Danisco would cause
irreparable damages to Novozymes&#8217; market share unless it was
halted. Danisco has the ability to pay financial compensation if
it ultimately loses the case, the judge said in the Sept. 24
ruling. She found there&#8217;s still a &#8220;substantial question&#8221; about
the validity of the Novozymes patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novozymes contends its smaller rival infringes a patent on
an alpha amylase enzyme that remains active in high
temperatures. The two Danish companies are the world&#8217;s biggest
makers of enzymes that break down organic material, such as
grain and corn, to form bioethanol, used as an alternative to
fossil fuels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novozymes has &#8220;not shown that they are likely to lose a
significant amount of additional market share between now and
trial,&#8221; Crabb wrote. &#8220;The accused products had been on the
market for more than two years&#8221; when the patent was issued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disputed patent -- 7,713,723 -- was issued May 11, the
same day the case was filed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danisco dominated the market until 1999, when Novozymes
began selling its Liquozyme enzyme, according to Crabb&#8217;s ruling.
At one point, Liquozyme accounted for 80 percent of the market,
before Danisco introduced a new product called GC358. Liquozyme
now has about 60 percent of the market, the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge also said it wasn&#8217;t in the public&#8217;s best interest
for Danisco to be ordered off the market, since Novozymes said
Liquozyme doesn&#8217;t use the invention covered by the patent. She
said it was &#8220;inconsistent&#8221; for Novozymes to argue that the
patent &#8220;represents an important new invention&#8221; and then say it
would make no difference if no one is allowed to use it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The legal standard for obtaining a preliminary injunction
is higher than the legal standard Novozymes must meet at trial,
and as such preliminary injunctions are rarely given,&#8221;
Annegrethe Jakobsen, a spokeswoman for Novozymes, said by e-
mail. &#8220;We believe we will ultimately prevail at the trial,
which is scheduled for the fall of 2011.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danisco, based in Copenhagen, paid Novozymes $15.3 million
to settle a 2007 patent dispute over another enzyme used in
ethanol production. In that case, Novozymes won after first
being denied a preliminary injunction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate case, Danisco filed a U.K. patent-
infringement lawsuit July 19 against Novozymes of Bagsvaerd,
Denmark, in connection with an unspecified enzyme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Novozymes A/S v. Danisco A/S, et al, 10-cv-251,
U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin
(Madison). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Sues Nokia in U.K. in Continuing Patent Fight &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. said it filed a patent-infringement lawsuit
against Nokia Oyj in the U.K., part of a broader fight between
the companies over smartphone technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A copy of the complaint, filed Sept. 28 in the U.K. High
Court of Justice Chancery Division, wasn&#8217;t immediately
available. Kristin Huguet, an Apple spokeswoman, said the case
is related to patent-infringement claims that Apple filed
against Nokia in December in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is an unsurprising development, which seems designed
to put pressure on the ongoing dialogue between both
companies,&#8221; said Mark Durrant, a Nokia spokesman. &#8220;It changes
nothing in the fundamentals of the matter, which are rooted in
Apple&#8217;s refusal to respect Nokia&#8217;s intellectual property and
attempt to free-ride on the back of Nokia&#8217;s innovation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute began in October, when Espoo, Finland-based
Nokia filed a lawsuit accusing Apple of infringing 10 patents.
It demanded royalties on all iPhones sold since Apple Chief
Executive Officer Steve Jobs, 55, introduced the device in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charges and countercharges followed, including complaints
at the U.S. International Trade Commission in Washington that
may result in a ban on imports of either the Nokia or Apple
phones. Some Apple claims against Nokia are scheduled for a
trial beginning Nov. 1 at the agency, and Nokia&#8217;s case against
Apple is scheduled for Nov. 29, according to information on the
ITC&#8217;s website.                     &#8216; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. case is based on &#8220;nine implementation patents
already in suit between the two companies in the U.S.,&#8221; Durrant
said. &#8220;Though litigation is always a last resort for Nokia, the
company will continue to defend itself to the utmost.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In court filings in December and February, Apple claimed
Nokia was seeking to force Apple into surrendering access to
proprietary technology that differentiates the iPhone. Apple
said it doesn&#8217;t want to license its iPhone-related patents to
competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new case is Apple Inc. v. Nokia Corp., HC10CO3053, High
Court of Justice, Chancery Division (London). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia&#8217;s ITC case against Apple is In the Matter of
Electronic Devices, including Mobile Phones, Portable Music
Players and Computers, 337-701, and Apple&#8217;s case is In the
Matter of Certain Mobile Communications and Computer Devices,
337-703, both in the U.S. International Trade Commission
(Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, CBS, Fox Sue Ivi for Streaming Shows on Web &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co.&#8217;s ABC, CBS Corp. and other broadcasters
sued Ivi Inc., an online subscription service, for streaming
television programs over the Web without authorization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies, which also include News Corp.&#8217;s Fox, General
Electric Co.&#8217;s NBC and the Public Broadcasting Service, today
accused Ivi and its founder, Todd Weaver, of copyright
infringement in a federal court complaint in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Defendants have launched their infringing Internet TV
service to coincide with the start of the new fall television
season,&#8221; the broadcasters said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ivi, based in Seattle, began streaming TV stations there
and in New York 24 hours a day to Web subscribers worldwide on
Sept. 13, according to the lawsuit. Viewers would pay $4.99 a
month after a 30-day free trial, the complaint said.
Broadcasters have deals with companies including Hulu LLC,
Netflix Inc. and Apple Inc. to stream TV shows. Hulu&#8217;s owners
include NBC, Fox and ABC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sept. 20, Ivi and Weaver filed suit in federal court in
Seattle seeking a ruling that Ivi isn&#8217;t infringing copyrights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Seattle company claimed that copyright law authorized
secondary transmission of copyrighted works embodied in primary
transmissions, such as those from the content owners. It argued
that because copyright law permits secondary transmission upon
payment of licensing fees, its actions are permissible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an e-mail yesterday, Weaver said of the new suit that
&#8220;big media is choosing to fight Internet delivery the same way
they fought against cable delivery and satellite delivery, when
in reality it is legal to retransmit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that &#8220;broadcasters charge more in advertising due
to the increase in viewers. It is too bad big media must fight
innovation that is legal, pays them and increases their
revenue.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broadcasters said that after they demanded that Ivi
stop streaming their stations, the company initially responded
that it was &#8220;open to engaging in discussions to explore more
direct contractual agreements with certain plaintiffs.&#8221; Ivi
sued several days later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major League Baseball, Univision, Telemundo, Cox Media,
Tribune Television, Fisher Broadcasting, WPIX, WGBH and WNET.org
are also plaintiffs in the New York suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s case is WPIX Inc. v. Ivi Inc., 10-7415, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The
earlier case is Ivi Inc. v. Fisher Communications Inc., 10-1512,
U.S. District Court, Western District of Washington (Seattle). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attack Against Copyright Enforcement Firm Leaks Private Data &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACS:Law, the London firm that sent out demand letters to
alleged illegal file sharers in the U.K., became the target of
an Internet attack that exposed on the Internet private
information including physical addresses and credit card numbers
of &#8220;tens of thousands of broadband users,&#8221; the U.K.&#8217;s Guardian
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s website -- www.acs-law.org.uk -- has gone
offline following a sustained attack that left thousands of the
firm&#8217;s e-mails published on its front page and distributed
widely on the Internet, according to the Guardian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The confidential information was also uploaded to the
Pirate Bay file-sharing site, which prompted the U.K.&#8217;s Pirate
Party to tell protesters to &#8220;find less drastic ways to make
their displeasure felt&#8221; and that it opposed such leaks of
confidential matters, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Crosley of the firm told the Guardian he was unable
to comment on the attack &#8220;for legal reasons.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. Band Member Predicts Eternal Perdition for Music Pirates &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guy Harvey, a member of the British alternative rock band
Elbow, says those who pirate music instead of paying for it are
&#8220;going to hell,&#8221; according to the BBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He told the BBC that while he could understand poor
people&#8217;s illegally copying music, there&#8217;s &#8220;no excuse&#8221; for
those who can afford it. He said they&#8217;ll have their own rooms in
hell as a consequence of their actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His band, which won the 2008 Barclaycard Mercury Prize for
its album &#8220;The Seldom Seen Kid,&#8221; has sold more than 600,000
copies in the U.K., according to the BBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piracy losses are behind Elbow&#8217;s 2011 arena tour because
&#8220;without the live side, nobody&#8217;s making any money,&#8221; Garvey
said and the BBC reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneur Media Sued Over &#8216;Entrepreneur.Ology&#8217; Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneur Media Inc., the Irvine, California-based
publisher of Entrepreneur Magazine, was sued  by a Texas lawyer
in a dispute over his attempt to register &#8220;Entrepreneur.Ology&#8221;
as a trademark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel R. Castro, of Austin, Texas-based Castro  Baker
LIP, said the publisher is opposing his trademark registration
and sent him a cease-and-desist letter Sept. 7, threatening to
sue him if he didn&#8217;t give up rights to the
&#8220;Entrepreneur.Ology&#8221; mark, and his www.entrepreneurOlogy.com
domain name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Bloomberg data, Entrepreneur Media has filed
five trademark-infringement suits since 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Castro said the publisher claimed his domain name and
trademark registration violated its &#8220;Entrepreneur&#8221; trademark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Castro is author of &#8220;Critical Choices that Change Lives,&#8221;
and a book in progress tentatively titled &#8220;Anatomy of the
Entrepreneur&#8217;s Brain.&#8221; He says he&#8217;s about to start a &#8220;Boot
Camp for Entrepreneurs,&#8221; in which he will teach corporate
executives to think and act like entrepreneurs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says he&#8217;s given presentations on the subject of
entrepreneurship for the American Red Cross, the City of Austin,
International Business Machines Corp., Dell Inc. and
Northwestern Mutual Insurance, according to the complaint filed
Sept. 15 in federal court in Austin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word &#8220;Entrepreneur.Ology&#8221; is one he claims he coined
and that it&#8217;s &#8220;fanciful,&#8221; &#8220;inherently distinct&#8221; and, as
such, entitled to trademark protection.  The word, Castro says,
is as distinctive a word as &#8220;Kodak&#8221; or &#8220;Exxon.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the patent office database, Entrepreneur Media
has two trademark registrations for the world &#8220;Entrepreneur,&#8221;
one of use with trade shows, and the other for pre-recorded
audio and visual media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Irvine-California-based publisher has other trademark
registrations, many of which incorporate the word
&#8220;entrepreneur.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mailed
request for comment on the suit. Lawyer Deborah A. Gubernick of
Latham  Watkins, who represented the company at the U.S. Patent
and Trademark Office in an attempt to block Castro&#8217;s trademark
from being issued, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mail and a
phone call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Castro claims the publisher is attempting to &#8220;kidnap&#8221; the
word, which he said has been used by authors &#8220;in their books
and articles for hundreds of years.&#8221; They &#8220;should be allowed
the freedom to continue doing so for eternity,&#8221; he said in his
pleadings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He asked the court to declare that &#8220;entrepreneur&#8221; as a
stand-alone word can&#8217;t be registered as a trademark, and that
his &#8220;EntrepreNeurology,&#8221; &#8216;Entrepreneur.Ology.&#8221; and
&#8220;www.entrepreneurOlogy.com&#8221; don&#8217;t infringe.  He claims the
publisher is violating antitrust laws by trying to keep him from
using his coined words, and seeks damages, court costs and
attorney fees under trademark and antitrust laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He represents himself in this action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Castro v. Entrepreneur Media Inc., 1:10-cv-
00695-JRN, U.S. District Court, Western District of Texas
(Austin). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astro Unit Leaked Confidential Data, AV Asia Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measat Broadcast Network Systems Sdn., a unit of Malaysian
billionaire T. Ananda Krishnan&#8217;s Astro All Asia Networks Plc.,
illegally used confidential information in a tender for new
satellite dishes with reduced signal loss during rainstorms, AV
Asia Sdn claimed in a lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AV Asia, a Malaysian television equipment provider, sought
1.3 billion ringgit ($420 million) for damages in the suit,
filed yesterday in the Kuala Lumpur High Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closely held AV Asia sought help in 2008 from Maspro Denkoh
Corp., a Japanese television-receiving equipment manufacturer,
to help it develop a satellite dish less susceptible to existing
rain fade problems, a characteristic which lends to transmission
interruptions during bad tropical weather, according to the
suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AV Asia and Maspro&#8217;s engineers met with Measat in August
that year to discuss their ideas and exchanged data after
signing non-disclosure agreements, AV Asia said in the court
documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The rights of the rain fade solution were given by Maspro
solely and exclusively to my client,&#8221; Ravi Sodhi, AV Asia&#8217;s
lawyer, told reporters at court yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measat used the information in a bid on a contract with
satellite dish suppliers and to help it start the Astro B.yond,
the first high-definition television service in Malaysia, AV
Asia said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astro said it had not been served with any legal
proceedings and therefore couldn&#8217;t comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tele System Electronic (M) Sdn, which is providing Measat
with satellite dishes, was also named as a defendant, AV Asia&#8217;s
lawyer said. &lt;/p&gt;

quarter earnings estimates cut by Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
analysts, who cited &#8220;soft&#8221; revenue from the firm&#8217;s fixed-
income, currency and commodities and equities divisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley&#8217;s earnings-per-share estimate was reduced to
15 cents from 60 cents, analysts led by Richard Ramsden said in
a note to clients dated yesterday. The analysts kept their
&#8220;neutral&#8221; recommendation on the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investment bank earnings are likely to be soft in the
third quarter 2010, as evidenced by Jefferies&#8217; shortfall last
week,&#8221; the analysts said. The largest adjustments are due to
&#8220;muted activity&#8221; in fixed income and equities, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferies Group Inc., the first Wall Street firm to release
third-quarter results, said Sept. 22 that revenue from trading
stocks and bonds dropped 51 percent in the three months though
August. Industry-wide bond-trading volume declined 12 percent in
the period, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system
of the Financial Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysts also said it&#8217;s hard to gauge the impact of
implementing the Basel capital accords, in particular how the
rules will affect risk-weighted assets and capital ratios. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp.&#8217;s Kazakh oil venture,
the country&#8217;s biggest exporter of the fuel, more than doubled
crude extraction tax payments as the government seeks a larger
share of resource revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TengizChevroil paid 245.2 billion tenge ($1.7 billion) in
the first seven months, compared with 122 billion tenge in all
of 2009, according to data published on the Finance Ministry&#8217;s
Tax Committee website, without elaboration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kazakhstan, which holds 3 percent of the world&#8217;s oil
reserves according to BP Plc, introduced the extraction tax,
replacing royalty payments, to boost revenue and narrow a budget
deficit. The government started levying export taxes on crude
oil from the venture led by Chevron, in the government&#8217;s latest
effort to gain more from the country&#8217;s energy wealth. The
Central Asian nation raised the oil export tax to $20 a metric
ton ($2.73 a barrel) in August and plans to double that to $40
starting next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TengizChevroil increased oil production to 12.5 million
tons in the first half, more than a half of the 22.5 million
tons it produced in 2009, the company said on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The venture&#8217;s total tax burden rose to 514 billion tenge
through July from 452 billion tenge in all of 2009, the tax
committee said. The venture paid 248 billion tenge in corporate
income tax, compared with 294 billion tenge for all of 2009,
according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linsi Crain, an Atyrau-based spokeswoman for TengizChevroil
wasn&#8217;t immediately available for comment. Raikhan Sharipova, a
spokeswoman for tax committee, declined to comment immediately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, holds 50 percent
of TengizChevroil. Exxon Mobil Corp. has 25 percent, state-run
KazMunaiGaz National Co. owns 20 percent and Lukarco, owned by
Russia&#8217;s OAO Lukoil, 5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan, questioning whether JPMorgan Chase  Co. is violating
state consumer protection laws as it pursues residential
foreclosures, demanded a meeting with the lender. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase, the third-largest U.S. mortgage servicer,
said yesterday it was asking courts to delay judgments in
pending cases while it examines supporting papers. The New York-
based bank said its internal review covers 56,000 loans from 23
states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With JPMorgan now acknowledging possible abuses in
preparing loan documents, the impact on homeowners in our state
and across the country could be great,&#8221; Madigan said today in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorneys general in at least five states are investigating
borrowers&#8217; claims that some of the nation&#8217;s largest home lenders
and loan servicers are making misstatements in foreclosures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ally Financial Inc. said last week that it found a
&#8220;technical&#8221; deficiency at its GMAC Mortgage unit that allowed
employees to sign foreclosure documents without a notary present
or with information they didn&#8217;t personally know was true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have requested that the courts not enter judgments in
pending matters until we complete our review,&#8221; Thomas Kelly, a
JPMorgan spokesman, said yesterday in an interview. The review
is expected to be finished in &#8220;a few weeks,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madigan said she wanted information on the effect that the
potential inaccuracies could have on Illinois homeowners and how
many are affected by the bank&#8217;s stay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kelly declined to comment today on Madigan&#8217;s demand for a
meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attorney general said she demanded a similar meeting
with Detroit-based Ally Financial. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apollo Global Management LLC is
raising a collateralized loan obligation with a target size of
$400 million, according to a person familiar with the talks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment portfolio, to be called ALM Loan Funding
2010-3 Ltd. will be managed by Apollo Credit Management LLC,
said the person, who declined to be identified because the talks
are private. JPMorgan Chase  Co. is marketing the CLO, the
person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market for CLOs has opened back up this year after
sales fell 98.7 percent during the credit crisis between 2007
and 2009. These funds buy loans used to back acquisitions and
leveraged buyouts, including the purchase of Burger King
Holdings Inc. by 3G Capital and will help address the $325
billion of loans coming due in the next four years, according to
data from Barclays Capital and Standard  Poor&#8217;s LCD unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been $1.3 billion of U.S. CLOs backed by widely
syndicated loans issued this year through August, compared with
$1.215 billion for all of last year, Morgan Stanley data show.
In 2007 about $91.1 billion of that type of CLO was issued in
the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apollo, WCAS Fraser Sullivan Investment Management LLC, an
investment firm backed by Welsh Carson Anderson  Stowe, and
Doral Money Inc., along with Babson Capital Management LLC as
the collateral adviser, have completed CLOs this year. Apollo&#8217;s
initial CLO, ALM Loan Funding 2010-1 Ltd., closed in June 2010,
the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apollo CLO Structure &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is selling four pieces of debt, including an
expected $262 million of Class A-1 notes likely to be rated AAA
by SP and an expected $20.5 million of Class A-2 notes
anticipated to be graded AA by SP, the person said. The bank is
also selling Class B notes to be rated A and Class C notes with
a BBB ranking, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fund managed by an affiliate of Apollo Credit Management
will purchase all of the subordinated notes, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AAA rated piece is expected to pay 1.75 percentage
points more than the London interbank offered rate, the person
said. The AA piece is expected to pay 3 percentage points to
3.25 percentage points more than Libor, the person said. Libor
is the rate banks charge to lend to each other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CLO is expected to price at the end of October or the
beginning of November and close at the end of that month or in
early December, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a JPMorgan spokesman, and Kelly Nugent, a
spokeswoman for Apollo, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy options on
U.S. energy stocks before the Institute for Supply Management&#8217;s
manufacturing report tomorrow because the shares may have
larger-than-average swings, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity derivatives strategists John Marshall and Maria Grant recommended buying options on 25 stocks, including
Chesapeake Energy Corp. and Noble Energy Inc., that historically
have had above-average price moves on days when ISM data are
released and whose options are &#8220;inexpensive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Energy companies tend to dominate the list of those that
make unusually large moves on ISM day,&#8221; the New York-based
strategists wrote. &#8220;A decline in the ISM could be a negative
headline that causes volatility.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing probably cooled in September with ISM&#8217;s
factory index falling to 54.5 from 56.3 in August, according to
the median of 82 forecasts in a Bloomberg survey before the
report. Goldman Sachs&#8217; economists estimate 54. A reading above
50 signals growth for Tempe, Arizona-based ISM&#8217;s gauge. The
index averaged 53.2 during the expansion that ended in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund is the most sensitive to
ISM reports among nine exchange-traded funds tracking the
broadest industries in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index,
according to Goldman Sachs. The ETF rose 2 cents to $56.06 as of
4 p.m. in New York as energy stocks rose 0.1 percent for the
only gain among 10 industries in the U.S. stock benchmark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The energy ETF has moved an average of 2.7 percent up or
down on the past 20 ISM release days, 1.76 times its move on an
average trading day over the same period. That compares with a
1.7 percent average ISM move for the SP 500. The 25 stocks
recommended by the New York-based firm average a change of 4.7
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISM Sensitivity &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We do not believe this ISM sensitivity is priced into
October energy options,&#8221; Marshall and Grant wrote. &#8220;Both puts
and calls appear attractive for investors hedging long and short
positions, respectively.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs screened for stocks that have one-month
implied volatility below median levels over the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implied volatility is the key gauge of options prices and
expected price swings. Options are derivatives that give the
right to buy or sell assets at a set price by a specific date.
Investors use options to guard against fluctuations in the price
of securities they own, speculate on share-price moves or bet
that volatility, or stock swings, will rise or fall. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. leapfrogged
six competitors including Bank of America Corp. to become this
year&#8217;s top underwriter for California technology companies, amid
a jump in borrowing for acquisitions and stock buybacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has underwritten $3.08 billion in bonds for the
state&#8217;s computer and software makers, winning a 31 percent
share, the largest controlled by a firm since 2007, when it and
Citigroup Inc. split about 80 percent of the market, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. JPMorgan was in a sixth-place tie in
2008 and tied for seventh in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borrowing by companies including Hewlett-Packard Co. and
Adobe Systems Inc. has climbed this year as they seek growth and
look to shore up stock prices after the economic slump. The New
York-based bank, traditionally the national leader in corporate
debt underwriting, is winning business in the state after
navigating the global credit crisis without a quarterly loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPMorgan came out of the financial crisis with a much
stronger franchise in investment banking, partly because of its
acquisition of Bear Stearns, but also because of the strength of
its balance sheet and management,&#8221; Darrell Duffie, a Stanford
University professor of finance, said in an e-mail. &#8220;These
days, no corporate CFO would ever be criticized by the board or
CEO for choosing JPMorgan as its underwriter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup, based in New York, ranks second in California
this year through Sept. 15 after underwriting $1.55 billion,
Bloomberg data show. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of
America is third with $1.38 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marketing Advantage &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Bove, an analyst at Rochdale Securities in Lutz,
Florida, said underwriters rely on high rankings to win more
business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Being No. 1 is very important in a given sector,&#8221; Bove
said in a phone interview. &#8220;They go out and say, &#8216;We&#8217;re on top,
and therefore you should do business with us.&#8217; It&#8217;s a major part
of the marketing approach that they use.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment.
Citigroup spokeswoman Danielle Romero-Apsilos and Bank of
America spokesman Kerrie McHugh also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borrowing by California technology companies slumped last
year as they shored up their balance sheets and reduced debt
levels in the wake of the credit crisis. Yields on investment-
grade corporate bonds are now the lowest since daily records
began on Oct. 31, 1986, and companies are borrowing again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Acquisitions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 159 acquisitions announced by those companies this year
total $16.7 billion, according to Bloomberg data. That compares
with 152 deals worth $14.6 billion in the same period last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At today&#8217;s interest rates, financing debt can make more
sense than spending cash, said Mark MacLennan, head of corporate
finance for Santa Clara, California-based Silicon Valley Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A lot of companies are sitting on huge cash reserves, but
one thing you need to analyze is, where are those cash
reserves?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Are they domestic cash or foreign cash
that might have tax ramifications if you repatriate it?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s largest software maker, sold
$4.75 billion of bonds earlier this month and may use the
proceeds to fund stock buybacks and acquisitions, the company
said Sept. 22 in a regulatory filing. The company plans to pay
for dividends and stock repurchases because much of its cash is
held overseas, a person familiar with the matter said earlier
this month. Microsoft would have to pay taxes if it brought cash
held abroad to the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HP&#8217;s Debt &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HP, the largest personal computer maker, issued debt
through JPMorgan this month totaling about $3 billion. Gina Tyler, a spokeswoman for HP, declined to comment on why it chose
the bank, saying the company doesn&#8217;t talk about outside vendors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palo Alto-based HP announced plans to acquire Palm Inc. for
$1.2 billion in April, followed by 3Par Inc. for $2.35 billion
and ArcSight Inc. for $1.5 billion this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other companies are plowing money raised into their own
stock, MacLennan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Companies&#8217; perceptions are that their shares are probably
on the cheap side, debt interest rates are definitely on the
cheap side, and why not use that to buy back shares or potential
acquisitions?&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. companies have announced $258 billion in buybacks
through Sept. 20, compared with $52 billion in the first three
quarters of 2009, according to data compiled by Birinyi
Associates Inc. The almost fivefold increase is the largest for
any January-to-September period since at least 2000, when the
Westport, Connecticut-based research firm started tracking the
data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the largest underwriter of U.S. bonds, with 699
issues this year totaling $171 billion. The bank also held the
top spot in 2009 and 2008, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank has underwritten 11 debt issues this year for
California-based technology companies, including Adobe, Advanced
Micro Devices Inc., Brocade Communications Systems Inc., Maxim
Integrated Products Inc. and Oracle Corp. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most
profitable U.S. securities firm in history, granted stock awards
to its most senior bankers in London after the U.K. government
imposed a one-time tax on bonuses last year, a person briefed on
the discussions said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The payments were made in about August and were approved by
the U.K.&#8217;s Financial Services Authority, said the person, who
declined to be identified as the details are private. The bank
has fewer than 100 partners in London, the person said. A
spokeswoman for the financial watchdog and officials at Goldman
Sachs in London declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ministers from both the coalition&#8217;s Conservative and
Liberal Democrat parties have urged banks to curb bonuses
following the credit crisis. Business Secretary Vince Cable told
party activists this month banks face &#8220;an enormous kickback&#8221;
from lawmakers if they pay out large bonuses this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Banks will take whatever steps they deem as being
commercially necessary to make sure they keep the people they
need to make money,&#8221; said Chris Roebuck, a visiting professor
at the Cass Business School in London. &#8220;These are the tricks of
the trade.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares can&#8217;t be sold for five years and may be clawed
back depending on the bank&#8217;s performance, according to Sky News,
which first reported the payments. The awards may be worth in
the high tens of millions of pounds, Sky News reported, citing
unidentified people close to Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ad Campaign &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank, which agreed in July to pay $550 million to
settle a U.S. regulator&#8217;s fraud suit, this week rolled out an
advertising campaign that sought to emphasize the firm&#8217;s role in
alternative energy and job creation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 50 percent levy on discretionary bonus payments of more
than 25,000 pounds ($40,000) raised 3.5 billion pounds for the
Treasury, according to government figures published this month.
That&#8217;s 1 billion pounds more than Chancellor of the Exchequer
George Osborne estimated in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said in July the U.K. bonus tax cost it about
$600 million. The firm set aside $9.3 billion to pay its 34,100
employees worldwide in the first half of the year, or an average
of $272,580 per person. That compares with $11.4 billion in the
first half of 2009, which equated to $364,134 for each of the
firm&#8217;s 31,200 employees at the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Midwest refiners replenishing
inventories after the Sept. 27 restart of Enbridge Energy
Partners LP&#8217;s Line 6B may extend an eight-week decline in
Cushing, Oklahoma, stockpiles, according to JPMorgan analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pipeline was shut after it ruptured July 26, curtailing
heavy crude shipments to refineries in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and
Ontario. As repairs continue, the link is transporting about
245,000 barrels a day, compared with its capacity of 283,000
barrels, Terri Larson, an Enbridge spokeswoman, said in an e-
mail yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the very short term, the restart of Enbridge Line 6B
could accentuate the drawdown trend in Cushing as flows are
directed to the refineries affected by the line outage,&#8221;
Lawrence Eagles, head of commodities research at JPMorgan Chase
 Co., said in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inventories at Cushing, Oklahoma, where the New York
Mercantile Exchange crude futures contract is delivered, have
declined for eight consecutive weeks to 34.3 million barrels
last week, from 37.8 million July 30, according to the Energy
Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Despite refinery maintenance picking up, it is going to
be harder for inventories to reach capacity before restarts
begin in earnest in November,&#8221; the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refiners conduct overhauls and work on equipment following
the summer driving season when demand traditionally peaks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil for November delivery rose 90 cents, or 1.1 percent, to
$80.87 a barrel at 10:07 a.m. on the Nymex. The discount of
November futures versus the December contract narrowed 8 cents
to 90 cents a barrel. The gap has narrowed from $1.75 on Sept.
17. The discount, known as contango, encourages traders to buy
oil for nearby delivery and store it to sell at a later date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Spreads already reflect a much higher level of inventory
than is currently in place, but reaching 37 million barrels by
the end of October will be a tough ask,&#8221; analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Line 6B is a 30-inch pipeline that carries heavy crude oil
from Griffith, Indiana, to Sarnia, Ontario. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s benchmark stock index rose,
extending its longest stretch of weekly gains in five months,
after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised the economic growth
estimate, citing the benefits of a better-than-forecast monsoon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mahindra  Mahindra Ltd. climbed to the highest in at least
19 years after saying monthly sales increased. Maruti Suzuki
India Ltd., the biggest carmaker, advanced the most in more than
a week after reporting monthly sales increased by a record. The
nation&#8217;s economy will expand 8.5 percent this year, Goldman
Sachs predicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Consumer demand will remain strong,&#8221; said P. Phani Sekhar, a fund manager at Angel Broking Ltd. in Mumbai.
&#8220;Foreign investors are finding India&#8217;s growth compelling.&#8221;
Sekhar, who declined to say how much he manages, said he&#8217;s
buying shares of Maruti Suzuki and Reliance Industries Ltd.
among others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bombay Stock Exchange&#8217;s Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
gained 375.92, or 1.9 percent, to 20,445.04. The gauge, at its
highest level since its January 2008 peak, completed a fifth
straight week of gains. The SP CNX Nifty Index on the National
Stock Exchange rose 1.9 percent to 6,143.40. The BSE 200 Index
increased 1.9 percent to 2,579.38. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maruti &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mahindra increased 3.5 percent to 715.75 rupees, its
highest close since at least January 1991. Vehicle sales climbed
24 percent last month, according to its e-mailed statement.
Maruti gained 2.7 percent to 1,479.95 rupees, its steepest gain
since Sept. 22. September sales climbed 30 percent to 108,008
vehicles, according to its e-mailed statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect Sensex company earnings to grow 20 percent to
22 percent in the September quarter,&#8221; Angel&#8217;s Sekhar said.
Angel Broking has been ranked by Dun  Bradstreet as the
brokerage with the biggest distribution network in the nation.
The nation&#8217;s largest companies begin reporting earnings for the
period from mid month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s monsoon is set to be the best in three years,
according to data from the India Meteorological Department.
Goldman&#8217;s prediction for economic growth, increased from 8.2
percent, would be the fastest pace since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reliance Industries, the most valuable company, increased
2.1 percent to 1,007.9 rupees. ICICI Bank Ltd., the country&#8217;s
second-biggest lender, rose 2 percent to 1,135.2 rupees &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd., the biggest copper and
zinc producer, jumped 5.1 percent to 175.35 rupees. India&#8217;s
highest court today said Sterlite can continue to operate its
only smelter until Oct. 18, when it will hear an appeal against
a Madras High Court order that the unit be closed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fund Flows &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sterlite, the best performer today on the 30-member Sensex,
also gained with commodity prices after manufacturing increased
in China, the world&#8217;s largest user of copper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hindalco Industries Ltd., the biggest aluminum producer,
rose 3.7 percent to 204.35 rupees. Tata Steel Ltd., the biggest
producer of the alloy, added 2.5 percent to 667.8 rupees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign fund inflows to India&#8217;s equities have increased 50
percent this year, making the benchmark index the most expensive
in Asia and among the BRIC markets that also include Brazil,
Russia and China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overseas funds bought a net 8.95 billion rupees ($198.3
million) of Indian equities on Sept. 28, extending this year&#8217;s
record inflows to 843.6 billion rupees, according to the
nation&#8217;s market regulator. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Liz Capo McCormick" date="Oct 01, 2010  7:14 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-01/corporations-boost-currency-hedging-to-record-jpmorgan-client-survey-says.html"><headline>Corporations Boost Currency Hedging to Record, JPMorgan Client Survey Says</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Corporations from the U.S., Japan and
Europe increased the percentage of projected income hedged
against swings in foreign-exchange rates to a record, a
quarterly survey of clients by JPMorgan Chase  Co. showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies lifted the amount of estimated 12-month forward
earnings hedged to 34.3 percent on average in September from
24.7 percent in June, according to the survey conducted Sept. 14
to Sept. 24 of 105 clients with a total market capitalization of
about $2 trillion. That surpassed the previous peak of 31.4
percent in September 2008, the bank said in a report today. The
bank&#8217;s survey uses a weighted average, by firm size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s index of implied volatility on options for Group
of Seven currencies dropped 13 percent in the third quarter,
after jumping 22 percent in the prior three months. Japan
intervened in the currency markets last month for the first time
since 2004 after the yen strengthened to a 15-year high against
the dollar. U.S. lawmakers are considering punitive measures
against China amid charges the yuan is kept artificially low
versus the dollar to provide an unfair trade advantage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This aggressiveness could reflect corporations&#8217; greater
sensitivity to foreign exchange risk given the frequency of
market shocks this year,&#8221; JPMorgan strategists Yoonyi Kim and
John Normand wrote in the note. &#8220;The rise in year-ahead
coverage was mainly boosted by a 22 percentage point rise in the
U.S. corporations&#8217; hedge ratio to 55.7 percent, the highest on
record.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar fell 7 percent to $1.3634 per euro in September,
the biggest monthly loss since December 2008 as signs the U.S.
economy is slowing reduced demand for the nation&#8217;s assets. The
greenback fell versus all of its major counterparts in the third
quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Euro Forecasts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average forecast for euro&#8217;s year-end level by global
corporations increased to $1.31 from $1.22 in June, according to
the survey. The average forecast for December 2011 was also
$1.31 in September, compared from $1.25 in June. European
corporations were the most bullish on the euro, anticipating a
rise to $1.40 by the end of 2011, which was 10 percent higher
than the average of U.S. corporations&#8217; forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporations from the U.S., Europe and Japan changed their
average year-end forecasts for the dollar versus the yen to 86
in the survey, down from 93 in June. As much as 25 percent of
clients surveyed forecast the exchange rate will end 2010 below
83 even as the Bank of Japan sold $25 billion yen last month to
weaken its currency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yen strengthened 0.8 percent to 83.53 per dollar in
September, the fifth consecutive monthly increase. It has
appreciated 12 percent so far this year versus the greenback. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost 30 percent of the Japanese corporations forecast the
currency would move below 83 by the end of the year, the survey
showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This view could signal that they either do not expect
additional intervention, or that they do not believe
intervention to be effective in stopping Japanese yen
appreciation,&#8221; the Kim and Normand wrote in the report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NII Holdings Inc. (NIHD) and Grupo Televisa
SA (TV) received the licenses for mobile-phone airwaves they won in a
government auction, Mexico&#8217;s Communications and Transportation
Ministry said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The handover was completed yesterday, said Juan Molinar Horcasitas, head of the government agency. The process was
delayed by a legal battle in which Grupo Iusacell SA, Mexico&#8217;s
third-biggest wireless carrier, sought to block the licenses,
arguing that NII and Televisa were paying too little. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa and NII, which operates the Nextel brand in Latin
America, agreed to pay 180.3 million pesos ($14.2 million) for
30 megahertz of nationwide spectrum in the 1.7-gigahertz band
during an auction that ended in July. With the airwaves, the
partners can offer third-generation services for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For NII, there is indeed a future in Mexico,&#8221; Peter Foyo, president of the company&#8217;s Mexico division, told reporters
in Mexico City. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies can begin using the airwaves immediately,
Molinar said at the news conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The airwaves give the companies capacity to offer services
such as video downloads to attract customers from America Movil
SAB, Mexico&#8217;s largest wireless provider which is controlled by
billionaire Carlos Slim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More Licenses &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America Movil and Telefonica SA, the second-largest mobile-telephone company in Mexico, will probably get their licenses
for spectrum won in the same auction by Oct. 4, Molinar said
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America Movil spent 3.79 billion pesos to acquire 30
megahertz of airwaves in three regions of the country and 20
megahertz in six other regions, including the area that includes
Mexico City. Telefonica was the winner of 10 megahertz of
spectrum in six regions, including the Mexico City area,
spending 1.27 billion pesos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NII and Televisa paid a lower price than their rivals
because they were the only ones qualified for the national swath
of airwaves under rules the government designed to encourage
competition in the mobile-phone industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America Movil and Iusacell, which both already offer 3G
service across Mexico, have said the differences in prices was
unfair. Telefonica has begun an expansion of its 3G service
across Mexico after winning another portion of airwaves in a
separate auction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa, based in Mexico City, agreed in February to pay
$1.44 billion for a 30 percent stake in NII&#8217;s Mexican division,
assuming the companies won airwaves in the auction. Gustavo Cantu, vice president of NII&#8217;s Mexico unit, said today that the
transaction with Televisa will be completed in a few days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. named Playdom Chief
Executive Officer John Pleasants and James Pitaro, head of
Yahoo! Inc.&#8217;s media unit, co-presidents of the interactive media
group, revamping digital operations to reverse losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pair replace Steve Wadsworth, a 17-year Disney division
head who left in September, the company said today in a
statement. Pleasants and Pitaro, who start Oct. 18, will oversee
the unit focused on the digital-games market and selling online
sites based on Disney&#8217;s TV shows, movies and characters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appointments will allow Disney, world&#8217;s largest media
company, to build upon the digital assets acquired in the past
three years, Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger said. The
interactive business lost $130 million through the first nine
months of the year, making it the only unprofitable division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see this as a growth area and we need people
experienced in how to best operate them,&#8221; Iger, 59, said in an
interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, rose 24 cents to
$33.34 on Oct. 1. The shares have gained 22 percent during the
past year, compared with an 11 percent increase for the Standard
 Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, Disney bought children&#8217;s social network Club
Penguin for $350 million, following that this July with social-
gaming site Playdom, paying $563 million. The company also has
bought Wideload Games and mobile-content site Tapulous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger said he intends to allow the two men &#8220;freedom&#8221; to
run the units, and Pleasants will keep working from Playdom&#8217;s
office in Palo Alto, California. Iger described the arrangement
as similar to Disney&#8217;s acquisition of Pixar, which operates
mostly independently of Disney&#8217;s film studio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pleasants, a former CEO at Ticketmaster, will oversee
Playdom, Disney&#8217;s Club Penguin, the World of Cars virtual unit
and Tapulous. Pitaro will run Disney.com, Family.com, and its
social-media marketing agency DigiSynd. At Yahoo, Pitaro
expanded Yahoo! Sports and upgraded its news, finance,
entertainment and lifestyle coverage, Disney said. &lt;/p&gt;
