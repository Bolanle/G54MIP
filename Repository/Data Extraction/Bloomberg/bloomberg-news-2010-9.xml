<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., BP Plc and
Vitol Group number among dozens of companies that have met with
the top U.S. commodity regulator in the last six weeks as the
agency moves to implement the sweeping overhaul of the $615
trillion over-the-counter derivatives market. </p>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is drafting 30
sets of rules after enactment of the Dodd-Frank financial bill.
The commission is charged with, among other things, imposing
limits on the number of contracts a single trader can hold,
setting margin requirements and deciding which trades will be
processed, or cleared, through third-party clearinghouses. </p>
<p>This commitment to open government will help promote the
integrity of the rule-writing process, said CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler in a statement. </p>
<p>President Barack Obama signed the Dodd-Frank bill into law
on July 21, setting off the first round of lobbying and rule-
writing inside U.S. regulatory agencies. Along with a new
regulatory structure for derivative markets, the law also
creates a new agency to monitor consumer financial products and
a council of regulators to oversee systemic risks. </p>
<p>The CFTC has met with banks including Goldman Sachs and JP
Morgan Chase  Co., airlines such as Delta Air Lines Inc. and
JetBlue Airways, power companies including Exelon Corp. and
NextEra Energy Inc., and oil and natural gas producers including
BP and Hess Corp., according to the CFTC Web site. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Executive </p>
<p>Blythe Masters, JPMorgan''s head of commodities, came in for
a meeting on Aug. 11 to discuss, among other issues, how
regulators would define things like major swap participant
and swap dealer. Those definitions will dictate which firms
fall under the regulatory umbrella. </p>
<p>Jeremy Barnum, a managing director in the bank''s global
fixed-income group and the chairman of the firm''s market-
structure group, also attended the meeting with Dan Berkovitz,
the CFTC''s general counsel, according to the Web site. Barnum,
in June, was tasked by JPMorgan with helping the company adapt
to the new derivatives and clearing rules implemented by
Congress. </p>
<p>The commission is an independent agency that regulates the
U.S. commodity future and option markets, including markets in
raw materials like wheat, corn, oil and natural gas. </p>
<p>The CFTC and other regulatory agencies including the
Securities and Exchange Commission, Federal Reserve and the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. have pledged to post the names
of banks and other lobbyists who come in for meetings on the
implementation of the law. The legislation is named for its
sponsors Senator Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, and
Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat. </p>
<p>Derivatives are financial instruments based on the value of
another security or benchmark. Some instruments, including
contracts that insured mortgage-backed bonds, have been blamed
for fueling a financial crisis that led to the worst recession
since the Great Depression. </p>

<p>Sophia Drossos, co-head of global

firm''s fund management division as a senior investor with a
focus on currencies, rates and monetary policy. </p>
<p>Drossos, who joined Morgan Stanley in July 2003, now
reports to Henry McVey, head of global macro and asset
allocation at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. The Aug. 16
move was announced in an internal memo sent today by McVey and
confirmed by Erica Platt, a spokeswoman for New York-based
Morgan Stanley. The memo also said Edward Riguardi, who joined
the bank in August 2008, has become a member of the research
team under McVey. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, the sixth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, has
been trying to improve the performance of its fund unit, the
worst performing of the company''s three main divisions. Gregory Fleming, the former president and chief operating officer at
Merrill Lynch  Co., joined Morgan Stanley in February as
president of investment management. </p>
<p>Drossos worked as a senior analyst at the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York''s markets group before joining Morgan Stanley
and previously worked for the U.S. Department of State and the
Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the memo said. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley cut forecasts for the

<p>The euro will end the year at $1.36 before weakening to
$1.32 in the first quarter of 2011, $1.28 in the second quarter,
$1.26 in the third quarter and $1.24 in the fourth quarter,
Morgan Stanley currency strategists led byStephen Hull in

forecast a decline to $1.16, then $1.12, $1.12, $1.14 and $1.17
in the following quarters, according to Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>We expect that any further easing in U.S. monetary policy
is likely to benefit the euro primarily, as many of the obvious
currencies to own - commodity currencies and those with strong
domestic balance sheets - are already very expensive, Hull
wrote. </p>

<p>China National Offshore Oil Corp.
signed amended production-sharing agreements with Chevron Corp.
and BP Plc after Devon Energy Corp. withdrew from the South
China Sea deepwater oil projects. </p>
<p>Chevron has agreed to buy a 59.2 percent interest in block
42/05 and full ownership in blocks 64/18 and 53/30 from Devon in
the exploration phase, Cnooc Ltd., China National''s Hong Kong-
listed unit, said today in a statement. BP acquired Devon''s
remaining interest in block 42/05, it said. </p>
<p>Chevron and BP are enlarging deepwater cooperation with
Cnooc as the company is poised to maximize deepwater production
at any cost to meet its output goal, Wang Aochao, head of
China Energy Research at UOB-Kay Hian Ltd., said by telephone
from Shanghai. </p>
<p>Cnooc, China''s biggest offshore energy producer, aims to
increase production by as much as 28 percent to 290 million
barrels this year. First-half profit more than doubled as output
rose to a record 149 million barrels of oil equivalent during
the period, driven by the start-up of new fields in Bohai Bay
and the South China Sea, the company said last month. </p>
<p>Chevron will be the operator of the three blocks, the
Chinese company said. Cnooc Ltd. has the right to secure as much
as 51 percent in the event of any commercial discovery in the
blocks, it said. </p>
<p>Chinese Block 42/05 is located in Baiyun Sag of Pearl River
Mouth Basin in the Eastern South China Sea, Cnooc said. Blocks
64/18 and 53/30 are located in Qiong Dong Nan Basin in the
Western South China Sea. Water depth of the three blocks ranges
from 300 to 2,000 meters (6,600 feet). </p>
<p>BP disclosed the bid for Devon''s stake in Block 42/05 in
the deepwater South China Sea, on July 27. In March, the London-
based company agreed to buy $7 billion of assets from Devon in
the Gulf of Mexico, Brazil and Azerbaijan. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which
agreed to pay $550 million in July to settle a U.S. regulator''s
fraud lawsuit, will pay a separate fine to the U.K.''s Financial
Services Authority, said a person briefed on the FSA''s decision. </p>
<p>The U.K. regulator found that Goldman Sachs failed to
notify it about the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission''s
investigation of the New York-based firm''s Abacus transaction
and of employee Fabrice Tourre''s role in it, according to the
person, who spoke anonymously because the penalty hasn''t yet
been made public. </p>
<p>The fine is less than 20 million pounds ($30.9 million) and
may be announced as soon as today, the person said. FSA
spokeswoman Cerris Tavinor declined to comment, as did Goldman
Sachs spokesman Ed Canaday. The Financial Times reported the
FSA''s plan yesterday. </p>
<p>The SEC sued Goldman Sachs and Tourre in April over claims
the firm misled investors in collateralized debt obligations
linked to subprime mortgages. Tourre, 31, the only Goldman Sachs
executive sued individually, remains a defendant in the case
after the firm settled. He has denied wrongdoing. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs created and sold the CDOs in 2007, as the
U.S. housing market faltered, without disclosing that hedge fund
Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying securities and bet
against the investment vehicles, the SEC said in an April 16
lawsuit. CDOs are pools of assets such as mortgage bonds packed
into new securities. </p>
<p>The settlement included a $300 million fine and $250
million in restitution for investors. The penalty is the largest
ever levied by the SEC against a Wall Street firm, the agency
said. Goldman Sachs, without admitting or denying wrongdoing,
acknowledged it made a mistake and that marketing materials
for the CDOs had incomplete information, the SEC said. </p>
<p>The FSA said in April that it would formally investigate
Goldman Sachs related to the SEC''s claims. </p>
<p>Lorin Reisner an SEC lawyer, said in August that the
regulator held very preliminary talks with Tourre about
settling the claims against him. </p>

<p>Visa Inc., the world''s largest
payments network, posted the biggest drop in the Standard 
Poor''s 500 Index after Bank of America Corp.''s James Kissane
became the first analyst to recommend avoiding the shares. </p>
<p>We are among the only skeptics on the networks, Kissane
said today in a note to clients as he cut the shares to
underperform from neutral. That''s typically interpreted
as a sell recommendation, the only one among 38 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. The pricing power of the networks is
likely to be considerably diminished, he wrote. </p>
<p>Visa and No. 2 network MasterCard Inc. came under pressure
this year as U.S. lawmakers approved caps on debit-card
interchange, or swipe fees, charged to merchants on each
transaction. Emerging payment technologies, including those
designed for mobile phones, also may threaten their business
models, Kissane said. </p>
<p>Kissane predicted Visa shares will trade at $70 in a year.
The stock dropped $2.95, or 4.1 percent, to $68.55 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Shares of the San
Francisco-based company have declined 22 percent this year.
Kissane had an underperform rating on Purchase, New York-
based MasterCard, which fell $6.12, or 3.1 percent, to $194.40,
the lowest since July 31, 2009. </p>
<p>The Dodd-Frank Act directs the Federal Reserve to set
interchange rates that are reasonable and proportional to
the cost of processing debit transactions. Visa and MasterCard,
which set the rates and pass the money to card-issuing banks,
may face pressure from lenders seeking to renegotiate their
contracts. Bank of America has said the debit caps could trim
annual revenue by as much as $2.3 billion. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc.''s Quigley unit, a former
asbestos maker, was denied permission to exit bankruptcy by a
judge who found the world''s largest drug company manipulated the
bankruptcy process to benefit itself. </p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart M. Bernstein in New York today
rejected Quigley''s fourth reorganization plan and said parties
should discuss dismissal of the case. He said the plan was filed
in bad faith by Pfizer and cited testimony that asbestos
claims directed at Quigley could total $4.45 billion over the
next 42 years. </p>
<p>In a nutshell, Pfizer bought enough votes to assure that
any plan would be accepted, Bernstein wrote. </p>
<p>In a 90-page ruling that covers Pfizer''s failed attempts to
deal with its growing asbestos liabilities since June 1985,
Bernstein noted that a lawyer who represented both Quigley and
Pfizer settled claims against Quigley and got releases for
Pfizer at no additional cost. </p>
<p>Settling claimants were then given a financial incentive to
vote in favor of Quigley''s bankruptcy plan through a series of
legal moves before and after the bankruptcy filing, the judge
wrote. </p>
<p>We are disappointed in the court''s ruling as we continue
to believe that Pfizer has no liability for Quigley''s conduct,
a Pfizer spokesman, Chris Loder, said in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>Bernstein also denied a motion to seal settlements of
asbestos liabilities among Pfizer, Quigley and law firms. </p>
<p>Right to Know </p>
<p>The public has the right to know how much they were paid
to vote in favor of the Quigley''s plans, the judge wrote. </p>
<p>Under the proposed Chapter 11 plan, Pfizer would have paid
about $450 million into a trust to satisfy claims about products
for which it allegedly has derivative liability. </p>
<p>The bankruptcy code would direct all future claims to the
trust, covering death and personal injury claims over Insulag,
Panelag and Damit, Quigley products for the steel industry
containing asbestos that were made from the time of World War II
to the 1970s. </p>
<p>The plan barred claimants from taking future actions
against Pfizer. Pfizer was a defendant in 280,343 of the 411,100
claims served against Quigley, Bernstein noted. </p>
<p>The Pfizer settlements were part of a strategy, conceived
and executed in bad faith, to manipulate the vote in this
case, Bernstein wrote. </p>
<p>Quigley, founded in 1916, made three products containing
asbestos from the 1940s to the 1970s. It was bought by Pfizer in
1968. </p>
<p>Products With Asbestos </p>
<p>Pfizer, before it streamlined its business to focus on
pharmaceuticals, also made asbestos-containing products
including Kilnoise, an acoustical plaster, and Firex, an
insulation for armaments in the military. Its liability policies
gave joint coverage to itself and Quigley. </p>
<p>First named as a defendant in asbestos claims in 1979 or
1980, Quigley was named in 411,100 personal-injury claims and
131,500 civil actions by the time it filed bankruptcy. In
September 1992, Quigley sold all its operating assets to
Specialty Refractories Inc. and didn''t operate at all until it
entered Chapter 11 protection. </p>
<p>Quigley''s only activity has been processing asbestos claims
while in bankruptcy since 2004. Bernstein''s ruling comes months
after a 15-day trial that pitted the U.S. government and
asbestos victims against Pfizer. </p>
<p>The case is In re Quigley Co., 04-15739, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

according to a regulatory filing. </p>
<p>Spreads on high-yield, high-risk debt widened 6 basis
points to 668 basis points, according to the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield Master II Index. Yields on the
securities fell to 8.471 percent from 8.494 percent. Junk bonds
are rated below Baa3 by Moody''s Investors Service and BBB- by

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s London
unit was fined 17.5 million pounds ($27 million) for failing to
notify the U.K.''s financial regulator about a U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission investigation. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $550 million in July to settle
the SEC''s fraud lawsuit over how it marketed a collateralized
debt obligation. The Financial Services Authority fined the New
York-based bank today for failing to report to U.K. regulators
the U.S. investigation that led to the suit, according to an FSA
statement. The firm qualified for the agency''s standard 30
percent discount for cooperating. </p>
<p>GSI did not set out to hide anything, but its defective
systems and controls meant that the level and quality of its
communications with the FSA fell far below what we expect, FSA
enforcement chief Margaret Cole said in the statement. </p>
<p>The SEC sued Goldman Sachs and employee Fabrice Tourre in
April over claims the firm misled investors in a collateralized
debt obligation linked to subprime mortgages, known as the
Abacus transaction. The FSA said in April it would investigate
Goldman Sachs International in London after the SEC filed its
lawsuit. Gordon Brown, the prime minister at the time who was
facing a May election, called on the FSA to investigate. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs created and sold the CDOs in 2007, as the
U.S. housing market faltered, without disclosing that hedge fund
Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying securities and bet
against the investment vehicles, the SEC said in the April 16
lawsuit. CDOs are pools of assets such as mortgage bonds
packaged into new securities. </p>
<p>Still an Employee </p>
<p>We''re pleased the matter is resolved, Goldman Sachs
spokeswoman Fiona Laffan said following the FSA announcement.
Tourre remains an employee on paid leave, she said. </p>
<p>Beginning in August 2008, the SEC spent a year obtaining
documents and witness evidence about Abacus, including
interviewing London-based employees, the FSA said. In September
2009, the SEC told Goldman Sachs and Tourre, who began working
at the bank''s London office in November 2008, that it was
planning an enforcement action. The bank''s compliance department
in London only learned of the SEC investigation when it filed
the lawsuit this year, the FSA said. </p>
<p>The fine is the second-largest levied by the FSA. JPMorgan
Chase  Co. received the largest FSA penalty in June when its
London unit was fined 33.3 million pounds for not properly
segregating client money from the firm''s accounts. </p>
<p>The Goldman Sachs U.S. settlement included a $300 million
fine and $250 million in restitution for investors. The penalty
is the largest ever levied by the SEC against a Wall Street
firm, the agency said. Goldman Sachs, without admitting or
denying wrongdoing, acknowledged it made a mistake and that
marketing materials for the CDOs had incomplete information,
the SEC said. </p>
<p>Tourre, 31, remains a defendant in the U.S. case. His FSA
authorization was suspended in April at the bank''s request. The
SEC allegations related to when he worked in New York. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. may soon let
employees use iPhones for corporate e-mail, making it an
alternative to Research in Motion Ltd.''s BlackBerry at the bank
for the first time, two people familiar with the situation said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is testing the Apple Inc. device and smartphones
based on Google Inc.''s Android software, said the people, who
didn''t want to be named because the plans haven''t been made
public. The bank is the second-largest in the U.S. by assets and
has about 220,000 employees worldwide. </p>
<p>UBS AG, Switzerland''s biggest bank, said it is also
considering allowing its staff to use iPhones for company
messaging as more of them opt for the Apple product. UBS has
more than 63,000 employees. </p>
<p>Apple and Google are making inroads in RIM''s traditional
stronghold with corporate customers, after their devices first
caught on with consumers. Standard Chartered Bank Plc said in
May it''s switching from the BlackBerry to the iPhone for
employees and expects to have 15,000 distributed by year-end. </p>
<p>This phenomenon is very new and we expect it to put
increased pressure on RIM''s performance, said Pierre Ferragu,
an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd. BlackBerry isn''t the
only alternative to offer employees mobile e-mail. </p>
<p>RIM fell 90 cents, or 2 percent, to $44.12 at 4 p.m. New
York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading as the Nasdaq Composite
Index edged up 0.3 percent. The stock has lost 35 percent of its
value this year, while Apple has climbed by a quarter. </p>
<p>Security Tests </p>
<p>The tests aren''t limited to banks. Vanguard Group Inc., the
largest U.S. provider of stock and bond mutual funds, also is
trying out the iPhone with 300 workers and will let employees
companywide use the device soon, said Joshua Grandy, a
spokesman. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is testing for security in batches of a few
hundred devices with a decision expected later this year, one of
the people familiar with the matter said. JPMorgan wouldn''t buy
iPhones or Android phones for employees, as it now does with
BlackBerrys. Rather, the bank would allow employees to use the
devices to send and receive corporate e-mail if they make the
purchase themselves, the other person said. </p>
<p>Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, and
Natalie Harrison, an Apple spokeswoman, declined to comment.
Marisa Conway, a spokeswoman for RIM, also declined to comment. </p>
<p>Linking to E-Mail </p>
<p>UBS doesn''t plan to replace the BlackBerrys it issues with
iPhones anytime soon, spokesman Jean-Raphael Fontannaz said by
telephone from Zurich. Rather, UBS is testing the possibility of
allowing employees to use an iPhone or another smartphone to
connect to UBS''s e-mail system without restricting the private
use of the device, he said. </p>
<p>There are certainly quite a few employees that have
private iPhones, and as a bank we have to ask ourselves if that
could be an option for us, he said. </p>
<p>RIM''s share of the global smartphone market slid to 18.2
percent in the second quarter from 19 percent a year earlier as
customers opted for rivals'' phones with larger screens and more
applications, according to research firm IDC. Apple''s share rose
to 14.2 percent from 13 percent, while Android surged to 17.2
percent from 1.8 percent. </p>
<p>Apple said in July that more than 80 percent of the Fortune
100 companies are deploying or testing the iPhone. The
Cupertino, California-based company has taken steps to improve
the iPhone''s security, such as strengthening encryption tools,
adding the ability to set longer passcodes and integrating with
servers that could wipe out or lock an iPhone if it''s lost. </p>
<p>Growing Movement </p>
<p>More companies are set to follow suit, according to an
August survey done by Sanford Bernstein. </p>
<p>Of 200 companies polled in the U.S. and U.K., 74 percent
now let their employees use devices other than BlackBerrys, the
research showed. For the U.S. alone, the figure was 83 percent. </p>
<p>Cost savings and employee preference were the two biggest
factors cited by companies for the shift in the Sanford
Bernstein survey. Employees would rather own an iPhone and are
increasingly willing to buy the device themselves, which helps
cuts costs as companies look to rein in spending, said Sanford
Bernstein''s Ferragu. </p>
<p>Other research suggests BlackBerry loyalty may be fading
among the bankers, lawyers and government workers who drove
RIM''s initial success. About 42 percent of BlackBerry users say
they want to stick with the brand when they buy a new phone,
according to an August survey by Nielsen Co. The rate is 89
percent for iPhone owners and 71 percent for Android devices. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp.''s trial victory in a
lawsuit brought by Nigerian protesters blaming the company for
violence at an offshore oil platform was upheld on appeal. </p>
<p>A three-judge panel of the U.S. court of appeals in San
Francisco ruled today that the trial judge made no errors in
admitting challenged evidence or in the jury instructions. The
appellate panel also agreed with the judge that the 1992 U.S.
Torture Victim Protection Act is intended to sue individuals
rather than corporations. </p>
<p>For years, the events that transpired on the Parabe
platform have been misrepresented to courts and the public,
Chevron spokesman Kent Robertson said in an e-mailed statement.
While we are sympathetic to the challenges that people of the
Niger Delta face, hostage taking is never the answer. </p>
<p>The case stems from a 1998 incident in which protesters,
who boarded a Chevron oil drilling platform, were attacked by
Nigerian soldiers. Two men were killed, others were shot and
beaten and one man was hung by his wrists and tortured after a
protest about jobs and alleged environmental damage to the area,
according to the 1999 lawsuit against Chevron. </p>
<p>Nineteen Nigerians sued the company, claiming it was liable
for the actions of the Nigerian soldiers it hired to provide
security for the oil platform. </p>
<p>After almost 10 years of trial court proceedings, the case
went before a jury in October 2008. The jury cleared Chevron,
the second-largest U.S. oil company, of wrongful death, torture,
assault, battery and negligence claims. </p>
<p>Theresa Traber, a lawyer representing the Nigerians and
their families, didn''t immediately return a call for comment. </p>
<p>The case is Larry Bowoto v. Chevron, 09-15641, 9th U.S.
Court of Appeals (San Francisco). </p>

its real estate investing business. </p>
<p>Klopp and de Poulpiquet will report to Jay Mantz, who was
named vice chairman of the unit, said Alyson Barnes, a
spokeswoman for the New York-based firm. Owen Thomas, who was
chairman and CEO of the real estate investing group, will remain
chairman and will continue in his primary role of CEO of Morgan
Stanley Asia, Barnes said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley had $43.6 billion of property assets under
management as of June 30, according to its website. The bank is
trying to return the unit to profitability after the firm
recorded about $4.4 billion of real-estate losses in 2008 and
2009 amid the worst commercial property rout in about 20 years. </p>
<p>Klopp, 56, joined the firm as head of investing in Americas
real estate and global property debt in February, after more
than 20 years at Sam Zell''s Capital Trust Inc. and its
predecessor. De Poulpiquet, who began his career at Morgan
Stanley in 1994, rejoined the firm in April after leaving for
Pirelli  C. Real Estate SpA in 2003. </p>
<p>Klopp will be based in New York, while de Poulpiquet will
operate from London, Barnes said. Mantz was previously president
and CIO of the group. </p>

<p>General Motors Co., the largest
U.S. automaker, and a unit of Itochu Corp. are investing $4.2
million in battery developer Sakti3 for technology that may
increase the range of electric vehicles. </p>
<p>Sakti3 received $3.2 million from Detroit-based GM''s
venture capital unit and $1 million from Itochu Ventures of
Tokyo, said Ann Marie Sastry, chief executive officer of Sakti3.
GM will get an undisclosed stake in Ann Arbor, Michigan-based
Sakti3 in return for the funds, she said in a telephone
interview. </p>
<p>GM, 61 percent owned by the U.S. government, is developing
battery technologies such as those used in the electric-drive
Chevrolet Volt in part to comply with fuel-efficiency standards.
Automakers are required to reach an average of 35.5 miles per
gallon across their vehicle lineups by 2016. </p>
<p>You must take risks and work with innovators, Sastry
said. That is the only way to maintain leadership in any
sector, particularly in automotive. </p>
<p>The New York Times reported GM''s investment in Sakti3
yesterday on its Wheels blog. </p>
<p>The investment is the second by General Motors Ventures
LLC, the unit formed in June with $100 million in capital for
technology startups. GM Ventures provided $5 million to
Anderson, Indiana-based Bright Automotive in August to help
develop its Idea plug-in commercial van. </p>
<p>GM plans to sell the Volt in November for a starting price
of $41,000. The Volt can travel 340 miles on a tank of fuel,
with the first 40 in electric drive before a gasoline engine
starts to recharge the battery. </p>
<p>Sakti3 was founded in 2007 and was spun out of the
University of Michigan, also in Ann Arbor, the company said
today in a statement. </p>
<p>Itochu Ventures is the corporate venture arm of Itochu
Corp., Japan''s fourth-largest trading company by market value. </p>

<p>Net capital inflows into emerging
market economies are running at record levels, pushing up asset
prices and raising the risk governments may impose capital
controls, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a research report
today. </p>
<p>Capital inflows into emerging markets are running at $575
billion a year, more than ever before and 20 percent higher than
before the world financial crisis, according to an e-mailed
report by Robin Brooks, a senior foreign exchange strategist for
Goldman in New York. Low interest rates in the developed world
are leading investors to seek higher returns in faster-growing
emerging economies, he said. </p>
<p>Our baseline case remains of moderate growth in the
advanced economies, Brooks said. This is contributing to
direct a wall of money'' to emerging markets in search of higher
yields. </p>
<p>Capital inflows help emerging economies by providing cheap
financing, lowering bond yields and boosting domestic demand,
Goldman said. They also push currencies to appreciate and create
inflationary pressures which could lead some countries to impose
controls on funds entering from abroad, Brooks said. </p>
<p>Some emerging markets have already resorted to capital
controls, and the risk of further such measures remains, he
said. </p>
<p>Emerging-market sovereign bonds have returned 11.8 percent
this year, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s EMBI+ index.
Stocks included in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index have risen
2.3 percent so far in 2010, compared to a 2.8 percent decline in
the MSCI World Index of 24 developed countries. </p>
<p>Capital Controls </p>
<p>In June, South Korea tightened limits on maximum holdings
of currency derivatives by banks in an attempt to reduce the
volatility of capital inflows. The same month, Indonesia''s
central bank said it would insist investors in its one-month
bills hold the securities for at least four weeks. Brazil
imposed a 2 percent tax on foreign investors'' purchases of
shares and bonds in October last year. </p>
<p>South Africa''s ruling African National Congress proposed in
a discussion document July 30 that an inflow tax be considered
to help curb the rand''s appreciation. The currency has
strengthened more than 30 percent against the dollar since the
beginning of 2009. National Treasury Director-General Lesetja Kganyago said in September the country relies on the foreign
money to finance its current-account deficit, and shouldn''t
impose a tax on the inflows. </p>
<p>Goldman recommends investing in the currencies of Asian
countries benefitting from growth in China, he said. </p>

<p>O''Neill, 53, will remain in London and report to Ed Forst

firm said. </p>
<p>Mr. O''Neill will help lead all aspects of the GSAM
business and serve as an important voice for GSAM in expressing
his views on global investment themes, the statement said.
He will also continue to write about his views in this newly

perspective on world markets. </p>
<p>O''Neill, who joined Goldman Sachs as a partner in 1995,

<p>Goldman Sachs Asset Management is the fund unit within the
company''s investment management division run by Forst and Tim
O''Neill. In the second quarter, assets under management fell 4.5
percent to $802 billion as clients pulled money out of money
market and equity funds and because of stock market declines. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co.''s ESPN sports

network geared toward historically black colleges and

<p>The HBCU Network plans to begin carrying live sporting
events from predominantly black colleges in August 2011, said
Curtis Symonds, chief executive of the venture. </p>
<p>In addition to sports, the HBCU Network will broadcast
entertainment, culture and lifestyle programming, Symonds said.
The network will be somewhat modeled after News Corp.''s Big
Ten Network, he said. </p>
<p>The partnership is likely to be announced later this week,
Symonds said. Chris LaPlaca, a spokesman at ESPN, couldn''t
immediately be reached for comment. </p>
<p>Symonds, the former head of affiliate sales and marketing
at Viacom Inc.''s BET cable network, said distribution agreements
are being negotiated with at least two cable companies, which he
declined to name. He said he expects the HBCU network to be
available in about 10 million homes when it starts. </p>
<p>ESPN owns the rights to games from the Mid-Eastern Athletic
Conference, the Southwestern Athletic Conference, the Southern
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference and the Central
Intercollegiate Athletic Association, which include the majority
of the country''s 105 historically black colleges and
universities. Those programming rights, Symonds said, will be
shared with the HBCU Network. </p>
<p>It''s a nice piece of programming for us, Symonds said.
You want to partner with folks like ESPN. </p>
<p>The universities themselves will own 20 percent of the
equity in the network, Symonds said. It has not been determined
how those ownership stakes will be divided among the colleges,
he said. </p>

<p>Microsoft will take more steps to ensure that NGOs and
other groups that act as public advocates aren''t mistreated amid
anti-piracy efforts, Smith said. On Sept. 11, the New York Times
reported that Russian security services monitored outspoken
advocacy groups and seized their computers, claiming the groups

<p>Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc., the
world''s biggest payments networks, fell to 52-week lows after an
analyst said federal caps on fees and pending litigation may
limit their ability to raise prices. </p>
<p>Visa, the worst performer in the Standard  Poor''s 500
Index today, dropped $2.73, or 4 percent, to $65.36 at 1:19 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. MasterCard
declined 3 percent to $192.27. Both companies were downgraded to
market perform from outperform by Sanford C. Bernstein 
Co. analyst Rod Bourgeois. </p>
<p>Investors will need to get used to substantially lessened
pricing power, Bourgeois said today in a research note. We
see a higher probability that Visa''s and MasterCard''s stocks
will be dead money.''  </p>
<p>Visa and MasterCard have plunged more than 20 percent this
year as U.S. lawmakers approved caps on interchange, or
swipe fees, charged to merchants on each debit-card
transaction. San Francisco-based Visa and Purchase, New York-
based MasterCard also are defendants in a federal antitrust
lawsuit that may lead to lower interchange for credit-card
transactions. </p>
<p>If credit interchange were to be reduced, this would be
another blow to sentiment for Visa and MasterCard, Bourgeois
said. </p>
<p>The Dodd-Frank Act directs the Federal Reserve to determine
interchange rates that are reasonable and proportional to
the cost of processing debit transactions. MasterCard and Visa,
which now set the rates and pass the money to card-issuing
banks, may face pressure from lenders seeking to renegotiate
their contracts. Bank of America Corp. has said the debit caps
could trim annual revenue by as much as $2.3 billion. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. halted jet fuel
production at its Sarpom refinery in Trecate, Italy, following
the second fire in less than two weeks in the larger of the
site''s two crude distillation units. </p>
<p>The facility, which supplies fuel to Milan''s Malpensa
airport, has a week of aviation fuel stored, Rosario Lentini, a
spokesman for the refinery, said today by phone. Eni SpA also
transports the oil-product via pipeline to the airport, he said. </p>
<p>The crude unit, which was being started following an Aug.
31 fire, was forced to shut after a blaze at 8:45 a.m. local
time on Sept. 11. Even as the site''s smaller unit is operating,
output of fuels such as gasoline has dropped because of the
lower-than-usual feed, the company said yesterday. </p>
<p>The refinery can process 230,000 barrels of oil a day and
is running at 30 percent to 40 percent of capacity, according to
Lentini. He couldn''t give a time for the restart of the crude
unit as Italian prosecutors are investigating, he said. </p>
<p>There won''t be any shortage of jet fuel to Malpensa,
according to an official at Sea SpA, which manages both of
Milan''s airports. The firm can tap into its own stockpiles and
call on other suppliers to increase flows, said the official,
who declined to be named in line with company policy. </p>

<p>JPMorgan''s active online customers have grown by an average

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank, is moving some credit-default and commodities
swaps businesses to a subsidiary to comply with new U.S.
financial rules. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is moving certain investment-grade CDS and some
of the commodities to a separate subsidiary, Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon said today in New York at a conference
sponsored by Barclays Capital. </p>
<p>It''s a real pain. It''s an operational nightmare, Dimon
said. In my opinion, it''s highly ill conceived, doesn''t reduce
risk at all. As a matter of fact, it probably complicates it for
some people. </p>
<p>Dimon estimated the new rules, which President Barack Obama
signed into law July 21, will cost the bank roughly $1 billion
in lost revenue but won''t affect profit that much. The
legislation requires banks to move their derivatives trading
operations into separately capitalized subsidiaries and moves
much of the market to regulated exchanges and clearinghouses. </p>
<p>Some of these things will create more volume, more
opportunity as long as we build the systems, Dimon said.
This really is an issue more for clients than for us. The
capital impact for dealers is unclear but largely positive. He
said that moving a lot of activity to a clearinghouse reduces
capital requirements for broker-dealers, while requiring clients
to set aside more collateral. </p>
<p>Derivatives are financial contracts whose value is derived
from stocks, bonds, loans, currencies and physical commodities

eager to get their hands on Halo: Reach, the first update of
Microsoft Corp.''s alien-shooting game in three years. </p>
<p>Microsoft is predicting the fourth iteration of its

won''t disclose how much. Online ads started Aug. 23, featuring a
dramatization of life on the planet Reach the day before alien

Reach,'' and we expect record sales for the game, given

<p>Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, rose 19 cents to
$25.30 at 12:28 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market

<p>Hardware Sales </p>
<p>The game will boost sales for Microsoft''s Xbox 360 console
months before the company''s introduction of a motion-sensing
peripheral for casual gamers called Kinect, said Anita Frazier,
an analyst for product-tracking researcher NPD Group Inc.
Microsoft is selling a limited edition version of its Xbox 360
console with Halo: Reach for $399. </p>
<p>If hardware sales react in a similar fashion to what was
experienced when Halo 3 was launched in September 2007,
September could be a huge sales month for Xbox 360 hardware,
Frazier said in a Sept. 10 statement, before the game''s release. </p>
<p>Halo, Kinect and Sony Corp.''s planned Move motion-control
peripheral for the PlayStation 3 may help the video-game
industry in what has been a sluggish year. U.S. software sales
in the first nine months of the year have dropped almost 10
percent from the same period a year earlier, NPD reported Sept.
9. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG
are missing out on Chinese initial public offerings as local
investment banks lead record numbers of small companies to sell
shares in Shenzhen. </p>
<p>China accounts for a third of the $150 billion raised
worldwide in IPOs this year -- yet the average deal size has
shrunk as companies rush to list on Shenzhen''s ChiNext startup
board introduced in October. Goldman Sachs, ranked first in
overseas IPOs by Chinese companies, has expanded its local
investment-banking unit''s workforce by about 40 percent in 2010
as it moves to target smaller domestic offerings. </p>
<p>We are going to put more focus on ChiNext IPO deals,
Thomas Deng, head of China equity capital markets at New York-
based Goldman Sachs, said in a Sept. 8 interview. Our pipeline
has traditionally been mostly big deals, or at least that''s the
perception. This may change. </p>
<p>Companies have raised 358 billion yuan ($53 billion) in
first-time sales in Shanghai and Shenzhen since Jan. 1, putting
this year on track to overtake 2007 as the biggest for local
IPOs, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Goldman Sachs
hasn''t worked on any such deals. UBS, in 18th place overall,
ranks first among foreign investment banks in underwriting yuan-
denominated IPOs after advising on one offering in 2010. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. is joining five companies, including Citigroup Inc. and ATT
Inc., to create a website that streamlines applications by small
businesses seeking to become suppliers to the group. </p>
<p>The site will offer one electronic form to be filled out by
potential suppliers to contact all six companies, Armonk, New
York-based IBM and the other five said today in a joint
statement. Participants in the program also include Bank of
America Corp., Pfizer Inc. and United Parcel Service Inc. </p>
<p>Small businesses often increase sales and employees when
they begin supplying large corporations, which could boost the
economy, Jonathan Bowles, director of the Center for an Urban

can inhibit small suppliers, which don''t have a lot of resources
or manpower, said Alison Bates Fisher, an event designer at Main
Events Catering. </p>
<p>We don''t have the time, said Fisher, who helps her
Arlington, Virginia-based company host marketing events and
executive board meetings for corporations such as PNC Financial

clients saves me time, which gives me more time to get other
business. </p>
<p>The six corporate members of the site award about $150
billion in contracts for supplies annually, IBM said. As the
program grows, more corporations are expected to join. </p>
<p>The site, called Supplier Connection, is scheduled to start
in the first quarter of next year. IBM will create and maintain
the site with a grant of more than $10 million from its
foundation. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was sued
by three former female employees who claim they faced
discrimination in pay and fewer opportunities for promotion than
men at the firm. </p>
<p>The violations of its female employees'' rights are
systemic, are based upon companywide policies and practices, and
are the result of unchecked gender bias that pervades Goldman
Sachs''s corporate culture, the women said today in a complaint
in federal court in Manhattan. </p>
<p>The plaintiffs, H. Cristina Chen-Oster, 39, a former vice
president; Lisa Parisi, 48, a former managing director; and
Shanna Orlich, 30, a former associate, seek class-action status
to represent all female Goldman Sachs employees with those job
titles. </p>
<p>The women seek unspecified damages and a court order
requiring Goldman Sachs to remedy the systemic sex
discrimination at the firm, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>We believe this suit is without merit, said Lucas van Praag, a Goldman spokesman. People are critical to our
business, and we make extraordinary efforts to recruit, develop
and retain outstanding women professionals. </p>
<p>Chen-Oster is currently a managing director in sales at
Deutsche Bank AG in New York, where she''s worked since 2006. A
spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment. </p>
<p>Fewer Women </p>
<p>According to the complaint, the proportion of women among
Goldman Sachs managers decreases as their job level increases.
The women claim that, according to figures published by Goldman
Sachs in 2009, women constituted 29 percent of vice presidents
and 17 percent of managing directors. </p>
<p>According to 2008 figures, women represented 14 percent of
partners, the plaintiffs claimed. Four members of the 30-person
management committee are women, and just one of nine executive
officers, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>While Goldman Sachs ceased to be a partnership when the
firm became a public company in 1999, it has retained the term
partner to denote the prestige of its highest-ranking
managing directors. Partners also receive part of a pool of
compensation that''s specially designated for them, frequently in
the form of restricted stock awards. </p>
<p>The plaintiffs claim that Goldman Sachs gives its managers,
most of whom are men, unchecked discretion over assigning
responsibilities to their subordinates. </p>
<p>Biased System </p>
<p>The complaint also says that Goldman Sachs''s system for
evaluating employee performance is biased against women. </p>
<p>Men at Goldman Sachs are viewed more favorably, receive
more compensation, and are more likely to be promoted, the ex-
Goldman Sachs employees claimed. </p>
<p>The former employees are seeking to represent an
unspecified number of female associates, vice presidents and
managing directors who worked for Goldman Sachs at any time from
Sept. 10, 2004, through the resolution of their federal
discrimination claims and from July 7, 2002, for claims under
New York state law. </p>
<p>Chen-Oster claimed she told her supervisor in 1999 about an
incident that took place in 1997 at a firm-sponsored dinner for
a male employee who had been promoted to managing director.
After the outing, which included a stop at a Manhattan topless
bar, a male colleague pinned Chen-Oster against a wall outside
her apartment, kissing and groping her. </p>
<p>Chen-Oster claimed that, after reporting the incident, she
was subjected to increased hostility and found herself
marginalized at the firm. </p>
<p>Golf Outing </p>
<p>While Chen-Oster''s career growth stagnated, the male
colleague involved in the 1997 incident was promoted to managing
director and finally partner, according to the complaint.
Over the same period, he saw his compensation increase by more
than 400 percent. </p>
<p>Orlich claimed she was treated differently from male
employees and denied the opportunity to work as a trader. She
claims she and other women were shut out of work-related social
events. </p>
<p>Orlich said she learned of a golf outing attended by 80
Goldman Sachs employees, only one of whom was a woman. Orlich,
who said she has played golf since childhood and competed on her
high school varsity golf team, wasn''t invited while several less
senior male analysts attended. </p>
<p>Orlich also claimed she was assigned clerical and
administrative work that male associates didn''t have to do. A
senior male analyst often gave her demeaning and menial
assignments, such as setting up his blackberry, making
photocopies, and answering calls from his wife, according to
the complaint. </p>
<p>Chen-Oster filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission and received a notice of right to sue.
The other two plaintiffs have also asked for right-to-sue
notices from the EEOC, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>Other Wall Street firms, including Morgan Stanley and
Citigroup Inc.''s Smith Barney brokerage unit, have settled sex-
discrimination lawsuits in recent years. </p>
<p>In 2004 Morgan Stanley agreed to pay $54 million to settle
a suit brought by former bond saleswoman, Allison Schieffelin,
and the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
Schieffelin was represented by Outten  Golden LLP, one of the
firms representing the plaintiff in the case against Goldman
Sachs. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs in March was sued for bias by a former vice
president who said she was pushed onto the mommy-track and
eventually fired after she chose to work part-time following her
pregnancy. That lawsuit, which alleged violations of the U.S.
Family Medical Leave Act, gender and pregnancy discrimination,
was filed in Manhattan federal court and is pending. </p>
<p>The case is Chen-Oster v. Goldman Sachs  Co., 10-cv-6950,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. released a new
version of its Internet Explorer Web browser today, aiming to
stem market-share losses to Firefox, Google Inc.''s Chrome and
Apple Inc.''s Safari. </p>
<p>Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, marked the public
release of a test version of Internet Explorer 9 at an event in
San Francisco. The software offers support for HTML 5 technology
and loads pages faster. </p>
<p>Internet Explorer''s share of the browser market has fallen
to 60 percent from 74 percent about two years earlier, as
Firefox, Chrome and Safari gain ground, according to Net
Applications. With Chrome usage up sevenfold, Microsoft needs to
ensure that users keep their focus on the Windows operating
system, rather than run programs through Google''s browser, said
Matt Rosoff, an analyst at Directions on Microsoft, a research
firm in Kirkland, Washington. </p>
<p>Based on developer buzz, it seems tech enthusiasts are
more excited about IE 9 than any version of IE in recent times,
Rosoff said. We might start to see IE regain some market share
from Firefox, whose growth has slowed, he said. Chrome still
seems to be the one people are most interested in, in terms of
the cutting edge. </p>
<p>Market share for Firefox, made by Mozilla Corp., rose to 23
percent last month from 19 percent about two years earlier,
according to Net Applications, which tracks Internet usage
statistics. Chrome jumped to 7.5 percent from 1.1 percent, and
Safari climbed to 5.2 percent from 2.8 percent. </p>
<p>New Features </p>
<p>Microsoft, the world''s largest software maker, had as much
as 97 percent of the Internet-browser market as recently as
2003. </p>
<p>Internet Explorer''s HTML 5 support delivers high-quality
video playback faster and lets users do things like open a
virtual book and flip through its pages. The set of technologies
may eventually replace Adobe Systems Inc.''s Flash and
Microsoft''s competing Silverlight, Rosoff said. </p>
<p>At the event, the company showed how its Bing search engine
can take advantage of the new browser to put video images on the
home page and let users zoom in to images on the home page. </p>
<p>The new browser also is faster at loading and running
applications written in JavaScript, an area where IE 8 was far
slower than Chrome, Rosoff said. </p>
<p>Microsoft rose 9 cents to $25.12 at 4 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have dropped 18 percent
this year. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., whose website
failed today for the second time this week, will refund late
fees and help fix other problems for the 16.6 million online
customers unable to access their accounts. </p>
<p>We will work with customers on any issues that occurred,
including late fees, Tom Kelly, a spokesman for the New York-
based bank, said in an e-mail. The site went down late Sept. 13
and service was restored around 1 a.m. New York time today. The
system failed again several hours later and was back online by
this afternoon. </p>
<p>The problem was a software glitch and customers'' accounts
weren''t at risk, Christine Holevas, a company spokeswoman, said
in an interview. </p>
<p>The bank''s primary regulator in Washington was on alert
after the service initially failed. </p>
<p>We monitored this situation very closely, said Bob Garsson, a spokesman for the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency, declining to elaborate. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s active online customers have increased by an
average annual rate of 42 percent since 2006, according to a
presentation to investors by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon
yesterday. More than 3.7 million households use JPMorgan''s
website to pay their bills. </p>
<p>Visit a Branch </p>
<p>Online customers should contact Chase telephone banking
at 800-935-9935 or visit a branch to correct late fees that were
incurred during the outage, Holevas said in an e-mail.
JPMorgan will also refund late fees charged by other
institutions, she said. </p>
<p>The length of the outage raises operational risk and
internal control issues for the bank, which was the only major
Wall Street firm to make it through the financial crisis without
posting quarterly losses, said Christopher Whalen, a former
analyst for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and co-founder
of Institutional Risk Analytics in Torrance, California. </p>
<p>These systems are big and complex, but they should have
redundancy to take the A'' system offline if need be for hours
at least, Whalen said. </p>
<p>Dimon apologized for the inconvenience during his
presentation at Barclays Capital yesterday, saying, I know our
system is down today. I apologize for that. </p>

<p>Alert the antitrust police.
Microsoft Corp. is back to doing what it was accused of years
ago: taking advantage of its dominant position in personal
computers to benefit its Web browser. It''s blatant. And it''s
terrific. </p>
<p>Internet Explorer 9, available in beta, or test, form this
week, is the best browser Microsoft has ever produced. If that
isn''t saying much, this says more: It may turn out to be the
best browser for Windows computers that anyone has produced. </p>
<p>And that''s saying quite a lot, given the proliferation of
top-notch browsers that have eaten into Explorer''s dominance in
recent years: Mozilla Corp.''s Firefox, Google Inc.''s Chrome, and
even the Windows version of Apple Inc.''s Safari. Indeed, it''s a
mark of how much the digital world has changed that nary a
regulator''s eyebrow was raised by aspects of the new Internet
Explorer that might have set off alarm bells a decade ago. </p>
<p>IE9 isn''t for everyone; in fact, it isn''t even for every
Windows user. The browser, which is available as a free
download, doesn''t work with Windows XP, the 9-year-old operating
system that remains the most widely used version; it is
compatible only with the more recent Vista and Windows 7
flavors. </p>
<p>Particularly with Windows 7, the new browser blurs the
distinction between Web content and applications that run on
your PC. You can now pin website icons to the Windows task bar,
where they look and act just like the programs installed on your
local hard drive, even down to the right-mouse-click that opens
a menu of things you can do on the site. </p>
<p>Topping Rivals </p>
<p>The new software also goes well beyond its competitors in
taking advantage of the hardware inside your computer. By and
large, most browsers tap very little of a machine''s raw
computing power, such as the potent graphics chips found in
modern PCs. Developers writing software to run on many different
operating systems aren''t that interested in optimizing it for
just one platform. </p>
<p>Microsoft, though, has no such qualms. It junked the Mac
version of Explorer years ago, and with IE9 it takes full
advantage of its Windows-only focus by using the PC''s hardware
to provide a speed boost. </p>
<p>Now a lot of other factors besides the browser affect how
fast the Web feels to you. First and foremost is the quality of
your Internet connection itself. The design of the site you''re
visiting has an impact as well. </p>
<p>Noticeably Faster </p>
<p>Still, the browser is an important piece of the experience,
and IE9 is demonstrably faster than its predecessor. The
difference is most noticeable on websites that are heavy on
graphics or animation. With this browser, Microsoft is also
embracing HTML5, the same online-graphics standard that Apple''s
Steve Jobs has been touting as a faster, better alternative to
Adobe Systems Inc.''s Flash software. </p>
<p>Microsoft even extends its quest for speed to the length of
time it takes to launch Explorer. If you have a third-party
toolbar installed -- say, the one from Microsoft''s arch-nemesis
Google -- IE9 will tell you just how much it''s adding to your
start-up time, and encourage you to disable it. If you still
want to conduct searches directly from the browser, don''t fear:
Explorer now lets you type a search term right into the address
bar, a feature Chrome has had for some time. </p>
<p>Visually, the new browser is almost minimalist. Microsoft
has cut down considerably on the number of buttons and menus
visible by default. Messages and dialogue boxes that used to
appear in the middle of the browser window, disrupting content,
have moved to a less obtrusive bottom-of-the-screen location. </p>
<p>Safety Screen </p>
<p>IE9 also has a new download manager that shows your
progress in pulling content from the Internet and keeps track of
where on your hard drive the saved files are located, while a
new safety screen warns you of potential hazards and blocks
risky activity. </p>
<p>The net effect -- no pun intended -- of all Microsoft''s
changes is a browser that is thoroughly clean, fast and modern,
attributes that haven''t always been attached to Internet
Explorer. If the new software can also avoid the security lapses
that plagued some previous releases, Microsoft will be able to
claim that its No. 1 market share on PCs isn''t just because of
who makes it, but of how good it is. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley Chairman John Mack
and Chief Executive Officer James Gorman sought to defeat a
shareholder lawsuit over allegedly unconscionable
compensation paid to employees. </p>
<p>A lawyer for Mack, Gorman and Morgan Stanley executives
named in the lawsuit asked New York State Supreme Court Justice
Shirley Werner Kornreich to dismiss the complaint at a court
hearing today in Manhattan. Morgan Stanley directors also sought
to throw out the lawsuit. </p>
<p>In times of crisis you want the most talented people to
stay. You pay them to stay, said Evan Chesler, who represents
Mack, Gorman and the executives. The court, he added, can''t
second-guess company decisions over pay for its 60,000
employees. </p>
<p>A group of Morgan Stanley shareholders sued Morgan Stanley
executives and directors earlier this year over $45 billion in
employee compensation in 2006, 2007 and 2009. In the complaint,
it calls the pay unconscionable and staggering given the
company''s performance, including relying on government bailout
money in 2009. </p>
<p>Jay Eisenhofer, an attorney for the shareholders, told
Kornreich at the hearing that there was no relationship
between pay and profitability at Morgan Stanley. </p>
<p>This was done without regard to profitability of the
company, he said. </p>
<p>Suffered Harm </p>
<p>The shareholders who filed the lawsuit are the Security
Police and Fire Professionals of America Retirement Fund, the
Central Laborers'' Pension Fund, and Arthur Murphy Jr. on behalf
of the Jean E. Murphy Revocable Trust. </p>
<p>The complaint alleges shareholders suffered harm from the

<p>General Motors Co., 61 percent
owned by the U.S. Treasury, will be patient with efforts to
turn around its unprofitable European unit, Chief Executive
Officer Dan Akerson said today. </p>
<p>The automaker doesn''t need to find a partner for the Opel
business at this time, Akerson, 61, told reporters at GM''s
Renaissance Center headquarters in Detroit. Europe is GM''s only
unprofitable region, with losses totaling $637 million before
interest and taxes in the first half. </p>
<p>We''re willing to be patient and invest, Akerson said.
I''m confident that we''ll see progress over the longer term. </p>
<p>Akerson became CEO this month after Ed Whitacre, 68,
stepped down to give GM a longer-term executive as it sells
investors on the company''s initial public offering. The company
is seeking to raise as much as $16 billion in the IPO, a person
familiar with the plans said in August. The offering will reduce
the stake the U.S. government acquired in GM''s $50 billion
taxpayer bailout last year. </p>
<p>It is a goal of this company to return that money to the
taxpayers of America, Akerson said. I don''t think that''s
going to be in one fell swoop. I think that''s unrealistic. We
have to post numbers and provide some consistent results, and
over the next couple years that will happen. </p>

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
proprietary traders who created a hedge fund within the firm in
2007 have generated a return of about 3 percent this year,
beating the industry average, people briefed on the gain said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Investment Partners, composed of former
employees of the principal-strategies team led by Raanan Agus
and Kenneth Eberts, manages more than $7 billion. The fund
gained about 26 percent last year, net of fees, after losing 
more than 18 percent in 2008, the people said. Andrea Raphael, 
a spokeswoman for New York-based Goldman Sachs, declined to 
comment. </p>
<p>GSIP''s performance may help other members of the
proprietary trading group, Goldman Sachs Principal Strategies,
as they pursue work outside the firm. Pierre Henri Flamand, who
succeeded Agus in running principal-strategies, left in March
and is starting a hedge fund called Edoma Capital Partners LLP.
The team he left behind is being disbanded to comply with U.S.
rules aimed at curbing risk, two people with knowledge of the
decision said earlier this month. </p>
<p>Morgan Sze, the Hong Kong-based partner who took charge of
principal-strategies after Flamand left, is considering raising
money for a new hedge fund focused on Asia, according to people
familiar with the matter. Perella Weinberg Partners LP and KKR 
Co. are among the firms that are in talks to hire members of the
U.S. principal-strategies group led by Bob Howard, two people
briefed on the negotiations said last week. </p>
<p>Dodd-Frank Act </p>
<p>The hedge fund industry posted an average return of 1.45
percent this year through August, 20 percent last year and lost
a record 19 percent in 2008, according to Chicago-based research
firm Hedge Fund Research Inc. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Investment Partners started with about $7
billion, the biggest start-up in the hedge fund industry, and
had climbed to $7.5 billion as of October 2009. The company''s
investment in the fund accounted for about 35 percent of assets
as of October, according to fund marketing documents obtained by
Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>The fund''s investments include stocks, credit, distressed
securities as well as hard-to-sell assets, the documents show. </p>
<p>Agus, 42, joined Goldman Sachs in 1993 in the equities
arbitrage group, co-ran the principal-strategies group and
became head of the group until 2007. Eberts, 43, had worked on
the equity derivatives desk from 1992 to 1998, when he moved to
the principal strategies group. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which says about 10 percent of its revenue
comes from proprietary trading, is grappling with a provision of
the Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul act that prohibits banks from
risking capital by betting for their own accounts. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Principal Strategies is housed within the
firm''s equities division and traces its roots to the risk
arbitrage team once led by Robert Rubin, 72, who later became
U.S. Treasury secretary. Alumni of the division who have left to
start their own hedge funds include Frank Brosens at Taconic
Capital Advisors LLC and Thomas Steyer at Farallon Capital
Management. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. said it aims to
supply China''s largest oil company with liquefied natural gas
from its proposed Wheatstone project in Australia, the nation at
the center of the U.S. energy producer''s growth plans. </p>
<p>Chevron and China National Petroleum Corp. may collaborate
on the development of gas fields in the Carnarvon Basin off
northwest Australia and on exploration in China as part of a
preliminary accord signed in Beijing, Gareth Johnstone, a
spokesman for Chevron in Singapore, said in an e-mail today. </p>
<p>Wheatstone is among A$200 billion ($187 billion) of
proposed LNG ventures in Australia targeting Asian demand for
cleaner-burning alternatives to coal, according to figures this
month from the Australian Petroleum Production  Exploration
Association. The biggest of the projects is Chevron''s A$43
billion Gorgon development on Australia''s Barrow Island. </p>
<p>Our Australian investments will transform Chevron into
one of the world''s leading LNG producers, Jim Blackwell,
president of Chevron''s Asia-Pacific exploration and production,
said at a conference in New York yesterday. Blackwell called
Australia the centerpiece of the growth story for Chevron. </p>
<p>Wheatstone may have as many as six processing units,
producing as much as 25 million metric tons of the fuel a year,
Chevron said in July. The second-biggest U.S. energy company
aims to approve Wheatstone in the middle of 2011, after gaining
environmental approval, a development timeline shows. </p>
<p>Considerable Expertise'' </p>
<p>Chevron continues to talk with third-party suppliers
that would provide gas to support an expansion of Wheatstone,
Blackwell said, according to a transcript on Chevron''s website. </p>
<p>Apache Corp. and Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Co.
have agreed to feed gas to the first two Wheatstone processing
units. In exchange, Houston-based Apache will receive a stake of
about 16.3 percent in the project and Kuwait''s state-owned oil
company will take about 8.8 percent, Chevron said last year. </p>
<p>The Chevron and CNPC memorandum of understanding allows
each company to leverage the other''s considerable technology,
operational expertise and processes to explore, appraise and
develop strategic upstream projects around the world,
Johnstone said. The agreement offers CNPC an offtake
opportunity from the expanded project, according to his e-mail. </p>
<p>Liu Weijiang, a Beijing-based spokesman for CNPC, the
state-owned parent of PetroChina Co., didn''t answer calls made
to his office and mobile phone. </p>
<p>Strengthen Relationship </p>
<p>Asian customers typically seek to acquire stakes in
Australian LNG projects, Benjamin Wilson, an analyst with
JPMorgan Chase  Co. in Sydney, said by phone today. Chevron
didn''t provide any details about how much fuel it may provide to
CNPC or how big a stake it may sell to the Chinese company. </p>
<p>Chevron looks as though it is trying to strengthen its
relationship with PetroChina, presumably with the intention to
have it participate in Wheatstone expansion, Wilson said. </p>
<p>The initial agreement doesn''t preclude a supply deal
between PetroChina and Woodside Petroleum Ltd., the Australian
producer advancing plans for the Pluto and Browse LNG
developments, he said. It indicates China is not finished with
their willingness to contract Australian LNG, he said. </p>
<p>Chevron in August announced its ninth gas discovery off
Australia in 12 months as it advances with Gorgon and Wheatstone.
The San Ramon, California-based company has found enough gas to
support a Gorgon expansion, Blackwell said yesterday. </p>
<p>As we continue to discover more gas, expansions at Gorgon
and Wheatstone become more likely, he said. </p>
<p>Chevron initially plans to produce 8.6 million tons of LNG
a year from two Wheatstone units, known as trains, located near
the town of Onslow, 1,400 kilometers (870 miles) north of Perth. </p>
<p>Tokyo Electric Power Co. plans to take 4.1 million tons of
LNG a year from Wheatstone. Korea Gas Corp. said it would buy
almost 2 million tons of LNG a year under an initial accord that
also gives it a 5 percent stake in the venture. </p>
<p>LNG is gas chilled to liquid form for transportation by
ship between points not connected by pipelines. </p>

<p>Lehman Sues CIBC, Says Claim Change Cost $3 Billion </p>
<p>Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and its creditors were
deprived of more than $3 billion they were due to receive from
collateralized debt obligation deals because its claims lost
priority as a result of its bankruptcy filing two years ago, the
bank said in a lawsuit. </p>
<p>Lehman sued to recover $1.3 billion it claims it was owed
by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in connection with one
of the biggest of the 43 CDO deals it was involved in. </p>
<p>Lehman is entitled to a declaration that the purported
termination of the note purchase agreement was null and void and
CIBC''s obligation to pay amounts due remains in force and
effect, the company said in court documents filed Sept. 14 in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. </p>
<p>The former investment bank, whose bankruptcy was the
biggest in U.S. history with assets of $639 billion, has said
creditors may have to wait years to recover about 15 cents to 44
cents on the dollar. Any money from lawsuits would swell those
amounts. Filing several lawsuits yesterday over the change in
claims priorities, the bank beat the two-year deadline for so-
called fraudulent-transfer suits. </p>
<p>Lehman, based in New York, said it had contracts giving it
senior payment priority in derivative deals, which were replaced
with junior payment priority after the bank filed for bankruptcy
protection. The flip was improper, Lehman said in suing the U.S.
Bank National Association, Deutsche Bank AG''s trust unit and
dozens of companies that issued notes. </p>
<p>In the CDO deals, Lehman''s right to priority payment was
replaced by noteholders, who received proceeds from the swap
agreements, Lehman said. </p>
<p>Canadian Imperial, based in Toronto, said the matter is not
new and has been disclosed in earnings statements since the
fourth quarter of 2009. The Toronto-based bank had a C$895
million ($869 million) gain in the fourth quarter of 2008 from
the reduction of an unfunded commitment on a note issued by a
CDO. Lehman was a guarantor of a related credit default swap
agreement with that CDO, according to Canadian Imperial
statements. </p>
<p>We continue to believe that the CDO indenture trustee''s
actions were fully supported by the terms of the governing
contracts and the relevant legal standards, the bank said in a
statement yesterday. </p>

<p>Two Iowa Egg Farms Are Sued Over Salmonella Outbreak </p>
<p>People from six U.S. states sued two Iowa egg farms,
accusing them of failing to prevent an outbreak of salmonella
poisoning. </p>
<p>The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has
said that as many as 1,519 diagnosed case reported since May 1
may be linked to eggs from the Wright County Egg farm in Galt
and Hillandale Farms of Iowa in New Hampton. </p>
<p>Self-policing doesn''t work, Kenneth Moll, a lawyer for
the consumers, said yesterday at a press conference announcing
the suit was filed in federal court in Chicago. The farms failed
to follow U.S. regulations to prevent contamination, he said. </p>
<p>Wright, the trade name for Quality Egg LLC, and Hillandale
have recalled 550 million eggs since the outbreak was detected.
It is the largest instance of salmonella poisoning since the
Atlanta-based CDC began tracking cases more than 30 years ago. </p>
<p>Salmonella can cause fever, abdominal cramps and severe
diarrhea. It can lead to fatal complications in infants, the
elderly and people with weakened immune systems. </p>

<p>Soros Insider Trading Case to Be Reviewed by Court </p>
<p>Billionaire investor George Soros won a bid to have the
European Court of Human Rights review his French insider-trading
conviction from 2002, one of his lawyers said yesterday. </p>
<p>The court notified Soros it will rule on the complaint
without a hearing, based on submissions by the parties, Ron
Soffer, a Paris-based attorney, said in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>We hope that the court will issue a final ruling in the
same spirit and are certain that the conviction will be
overturned as a result, said Soffer, who''s working with London
lawyer Anthony Lester, on the complaint. </p>
<p>Soros, 80, was convicted of insider trading and ordered to
repay 2.2 million euros ($2.9 million) he''d made from a 1988
purchase of Societe Generale SA shares after a Paris court found
he''d acted with the knowledge that the bank might be a takeover
target. </p>
<p>Soros turned to the human rights tribunal after he lost his
appeal to Cour de Cassation, France''s highest appeals court,
which quashed the fine while upholding the conviction. </p>
<p>French stock market regulators didn''t pursue Soros, saying
insider trading laws were too vague to determine whether he''d
broken them. </p>
<p>Toyota Urges U.S. Judge to Throw Out Lawsuits Over Acceleration </p>
<p>Toyota Motor Corp. urged a U.S. judge to dismiss lawsuits
over sudden acceleration claims saying they''re based on
anecdotes and fail to identify any specific defects in the
vehicles. </p>
<p>Toyota, the world''s largest automaker, faces more than 300
federal and state lawsuits including proposed class actions over
economic losses and claims of personal injuries or deaths
related to allegations the vehicles suddenly accelerated and
couldn''t be stopped. </p>
<p>Plaintiffs infer negligence and strict liability on the
part of Toyota based on unsubstantiated circumstantial
information, the automaker said in papers filed in federal
court in Santa Ana, California, Sept. 13. </p>
<p>The automaker, based in Toyota City, Japan, has recalled
more than 8 million vehicles worldwide in the past year for
defects including pedals that stuck or snagged on floor mats. </p>
<p>A hearing on Toyota''s request to dismiss the lawsuits is

<p>Father-Son Developers Hid Assets in Web of Lies,'' U.S. Says </p>
<p>A father and son who built hotels used a web of lies to
hide income and assets including Miami Beach mansions, luxury
cars, a yacht and a helicopter from U.S. tax authorities, a
Florida federal prosecutor told jurors. </p>
<p>Mauricio Cohen Assor, 77, and his son, Leon Cohen Levy, 46,
concealed their wealth behind nominee owners of companies in tax
havens while reporting annual income of no more than about
$46,000 a year, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Neiman said
yesterday in federal court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. </p>
<p>This is a case of greed, deception and manipulation,
Neiman said at the start of the trial. The men cheated the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service through a web of lies, forged
documents and false statements, he said. </p>
<p>An attorney for Cohen Assor and his son countered that the
evidence will show that the men never thought they broke the
law. He denied charges that they hid ownership of one Miami
Beach home valued at $26 million and another worth $20 million,
and that they failed to declare $45 million in investments,
commercial properties worth $55 million and cars including a
Rolls-Royce Phantom and a Porsche Carrera GT. </p>
<p>Michael Pasano, a defense attorney, said foreign companies
employing the men owned the assets, and they paid taxes on their
income. They were idea-rich but cash- and asset-poor while
helping other people make money, Pasano said in his opening
statement. One owner of their companies was Cohen Assor''s
brother-in-law in Venezuela, Pasano said. </p>

gambling debts, make mortgage payments on a $5 million house,
and buy floor seats to Miami Heat basketball games. Shapiro, who

<p>Coffey Won''t Return to Law After Electoral Defeat </p>
<p>Sean Coffey, the lawyer who won more than $6.15 billion in
settlements for WorldCom Inc. investors, has no plans to return
to practicing law after his defeat in a run for New York
Attorney General. </p>
<p>I''m retired from the practice of law, Coffey, 54, said
in a phone interview yesterday. I don''t see returning to
practicing law, certainly in the near term. </p>
<p>Coffey came in third in the Sept. 14 Democratic primary for
the state''s top lawyer job with 16 percent of the vote, based on
98 percent of precincts reporting, behind winner Eric T.
Schneiderman and Kathleen Rice, according to the New York Times. </p>
<p>Coffey, a former partner at New York''s Bernstein Litowitz
Berger  Grossmann LLP, which represents investors in
securities-fraud lawsuits against companies, won the WorldCom
settlements in 2004 and 2005 following a collapse of the company
linked to accounting fraud. A novel settlement with WorldCom''s
former directors required them to pay a portion, a precedent
that reverberated in boardrooms nationwide. </p>
<p>Coffey left Bernstein Litowitz in October to run for public
office for the first time, seeking to succeed Andrew Cuomo, who
is running for governor. </p>
<p>Coffey said he may teach law as an adjunct professor, and
is considering writing an article about his 11 months running
for office, for which he kept a diary. He said he also hopes to
do some traveling with his family. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp.''s decision yesterday to set up a research center with the
Lithuanian government may stoke concern that Estonia and Latvia
are falling behind as the Baltic neighbors vie for foreign
investment after Europe''s deepest recessions. </p>
<p>Lithuania has attracted since the beginning of last year
investments from international companies including London-based
Barclays Plc, which opened an information technology center in
Vilnius, and Englewood, Colorado-based Western Union Co., which
plans to establish a regional service center in the country. </p>
<p>Lithuania is winning as Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius
acts as investment czar, said Kitty Kubo, who heads the
foresight division of the Estonian Development Fund in Tallinn,
which advises the country''s government. Estonian lawmakers
haven''t acted on the fund''s suggestion that they name a top
official to head the country''s investment drive, she said. </p>
<p>The doors of companies such as IBM are open for a prime
minister, even when it is difficult for an investment promotion
agency to get its foot in the door, Kubo said. If Lithuania
continues successfully, it has a good chance of grabbing the
best investments in the region and the best talents with it. </p>
<p>The competition is vital as the Baltic states try to revive
growth after their economies shrank by 20-25 percent from peak
levels during the global recession, according to an
International Monetary Fund report released this week. </p>
<p>Estonia is the Baltic region''s traditional leader in
foreign direct investment, with $16.2 billion of accumulated
FDI, according to the World Investment Report 2010 by the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Lithuania is second
at $13.8 billion, followed by Latvia''s $11.7 billion. </p>
<p>Gap Closing </p>
<p>Lithuania narrowed the gap last year as the stock of
foreign investment rose 7 percent, compared with Estonia''s 3
percent drop and Latvia''s 2 percent increase, the report shows. </p>
<p>Kubilius'' government plans to boost FDI to 20 billion euros
($26 billion) within five years by focusing on computer services
and energy as the country seeks to establish itself as a service
hub for the Baltic and Nordic regions, Economy Minister Dainius Kreivys said in June. </p>
<p>While all three countries promote their European Union
membership, central location and cheap, well-educated workers,
Estonia leads its neighbors in the World Bank''s Ease of Doing
Business rankings. Estonia placed 24th in the most recent
survey, Lithuania 26th and Latvia 27th. </p>
<p>Estonia''s slight edge in business conditions may not be
enough to ensure success, said Christian Ketels, a professor at
Harvard Business School''s Institute for Strategy and
Competitiveness. </p>
<p>Right Direction </p>
<p>Countries that market themselves by focusing on their
capabilities in specific clusters of economic activities find it
easier to communicate their specific advantages, said Ketels,
who is also a member of the Baltic Development Forum''s advisory
board. As far as the Lithuanian campaign fits that bill, I
think it is a step in the right direction. </p>
<p>Armonk, New York-based IBM, the world''s biggest computer-
services company, said yesterday it will collaborate with the
Lithuanian government on a research and development center in
Vilnius. Each party will invest 42 million litai ($15.9 million)
annually and share in any patents they develop. </p>
<p>Estonia, the smallest of the three Baltic nations, has
not based its attraction of FDI on specially designed support
schemes, the Estonian Investment and Trade agency says on its
website, listing Skype Technologies SA, Playtech Ltd. and
Swedbank AB among successful investors. It is our favorable
business environment that makes the difference. </p>
<p>Euro Advantage </p>
<p>The country may gain an advantage in the competition next
year when it adopts the euro, making it easier for companies to
do business in the countries sharing Europe''s common currency. </p>
<p>Lithuania''s marketing efforts have been good, but they
don''t really offset Estonia''s euro entry, said James Oates,
chief executive officer of Tallinn-based Cicero Capital, and a
former head of east European equities at UBS AG. Attracting
investment is one thing, but keeping it in the country is
another as we have seen a number of big investors enter a Baltic
country and leave in a couple of years. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief
Economist Jim O''Neill said Japan''s intervention to weaken the
yen this week suggests Group of 20 officials coordinated to
support the policy. </p>
<p>The fact they''ve done it in a week when Washington is so
noisy about China''s renminbi is particularly interesting and
suggests to me that behind the scenes that there may be subtle
coordination going on here, he said today on Bloomberg Radio''s
Bloomberg Surveillance with Tom Keene. The renminbi''s
continued to strengthen. You can build it all into some pretty
well thought out thing going on behind the scenes by the G20
policy makers. </p>
<p>Japan sold yen this week after it touched 82.88 per dollar,
the strongest level since May 1995. The yuan completed its
biggest weekly advance in 28 months after U.S. Treasury
Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said yesterday gains in the
currency were too slow. He said the U.S. will use every
available tool to urge China to let the yuan rise more quickly. </p>
<p>Chinese authorities have only delivered on a small part
of yuan loosening, said O''Neill, who is incoming
chairman of Goldman Sachs'' asset-management unit. My
suspicion is that they''ve rather cleverly held the timing
back for when they thought it would have its biggest impact in
Washington. </p>
<p>O''Neill also said Japan''s intervention was the right
thing for them to do. The yen was little changed today at
85.72 per dollar, having slid about 2 percent this week. </p>

<p>The best returns in commodities
over the next 12 months will probably be in energy and the
biggest losses in agriculture, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. </p>
<p>The bank is forecasting a 27 percent advance in energy over
12 months, a 17 percent jump in precious metals and a 15 percent
gain in industrial metals, analysts led by London-based Jeffrey Currie said in a report today. Agriculture will decline 10
percent, the team forecast. </p>
<p>For the more cyclical commodities, oil and copper, while
continued indications of more supportive policy in the U.S. and
China, better macro data in these key countries, and improving
commodity data have pushed prices higher within their respective
trading ranges, we continue to expect them to break out to the
upside in coming months, the analysts wrote in the report. </p>
<p>The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials fell
1.7 percent this year, led by declines in natural gas, cocoa and
sugar, amid mounting concern about the strength of the global
recovery. Crude, gasoline and heating oil inventories reached a
20-year-high last month as the U.S. Commerce Department said the
economy probably expanded at a 1.6 percent annual pace in the
second quarter from an initially reported 2.4 percent. </p>
<p>While agriculture is forecast by Goldman to be the only
commodity group to drop over 12 months, the bank raised its
three-month forecasts for corn, cotton, arabica and raw sugar. </p>
<p>Goldman increased its three-month corn estimate to $4.65 a
bushel from $4.15 and said the market will have a further
tightening because of demand for ethanol and animal feed.
Wheat prices, which as much as doubled since June, may decline
in the medium term, Goldman said. </p>
<p>Coffee Forecast </p>
<p>The bank also raised its arabica-coffee forecast to $1.80 a
pound from $1.55 and raw-sugar to 20 cents a pound from 15
cents. The cotton estimate increased to 90 cents a pound from 85
cents. The cocoa forecast declined to $2,700 a metric ton from
$3,100. Goldman raised its live-cattle forecast to 105 cents a
pound from 93 cents. </p>
<p>The bank is forecasting a 19 percent return in the SP GSCI
Enhanced Total Return Index over 12 months. The gauge declined 4
percent this year. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. and China
Petrochemical Corp., known as Sinopec Group, are in talks on
developing shale gas, a harder-to-extract form of the fuel that
may exceed conventional reserves in China by as much as 12-fold. </p>
<p>We are in discussions with Sinopec, Gareth Johnstone,
the Singapore-based spokesman for the second-biggest U.S. energy
producer, said by e-mail today. We are not disclosing further
details at this stage. </p>
<p>China is seeking to tap its unconventional gas resources,
including gas in shale and coal seams, with the help of global
majors like Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc. Chevron and
Sinopec Group, the country''s second-largest oil company, may
sign an accord by the year-end to develop shale gas in
southwestern China, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing an
unidentified person familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>Energy demand in China is very strong, but its technology
is relatively backward when it comes to developing
unconventional resources, said Wang Aochao, head of energy
research at UOB-Kay Hian Ltd. in Shanghai. In the future,
exploration and production in China will be a long-term area of
cooperation between Chinese and foreign companies. </p>
<p>The world''s biggest polluting nation is seeking to triple
the use of gas to about 10 percent of energy consumption by 2020
and cut reliance on coal and oil, which produce more emissions. </p>
<p>China holds 2.46 trillion cubic meters of natural gas
reserves, according to BP''s Statistical Review of World Energy.
That compares with possibly 30 trillion cubic meters of gas
deposits in shale, a type of sedimentary rock, said China
National Petroleum Corp., the country''s largest energy company. </p>
<p>Southwestern Provinces </p>
<p>Chevron has found a gas block near Guiyang city in Guizhou
province, close to an area that BP and Sinopec Group are
exploring, the Journal said in the report, citing the
unidentified person. Huang Wensheng, a Beijing-based spokesman
for the state-controlled Chinese company, didn''t immediately
respond to calls made to his office or mobile phone. </p>
<p>Sinopec Group aims to boost its unconventional gas
production capacity to more than 2.5 billion cubic meters a year
by 2015. Unconventional gas resources will be an important
contributor to earnings within five to 10 years, the company
said on June 1. </p>
<p>China''s three oil companies, led by PetroChina Co., are
increasing spending on the development of unconventional gas,
including tight gas, coal-bed methane and shale gas, Jia
Chengzao, president of the Chinese Petroleum Society and a
former vice president at the China National Petroleum unit. </p>
<p>Massive Production'' </p>
<p>PetroChina signed an agreement with Shell last year to
explore for shale gas in the Sichuan basin in southwest China.
Shell may invest $1 billion annually in China in the next five
to seven years should two wells there show potential for
commercial production, Chief Financial Officer Simon Henry said
on Sept. 14. </p>
<p>It may take China four to five years to achieve commercial
development of shale gas and a fairly longer time before
massive production, Jia said. </p>
<p>Hong Kong-listed PetroChina teamed up with Shell in March
this year to acquire Australian coal-bed gas producer Arrow
Energy Ltd., partly to acquire the expertise needed to help the
company develop China''s reserves of unconventional gas, Chairman
Jiang Jiemin said then. </p>
<p>The U.S. last year overtook Russia as the world''s largest
producer of natural gas as shale-gas output rose to 10 percent
of total supplies from 2 percent in 1990 in what BP''s Chief
Executive Officer Tony Hayward called a quiet revolution. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp., the second-biggest
U.S. energy company, expanded its exploration operations into
Turkey by signing an agreement with the country''s state oil
company to jointly drill wells in the Black Sea. </p>
<p>Chevron will buy a 50 percent stake in a western portion of
License 3921, an exploration block about the size of New Jersey
in waters 220 miles (354 kilometers) northwest of the Turkish
capital of Ankara, according to a statement today by the San
Ramon, California-based company. </p>
<p>State-owned Turkiye Petrolleri AO will be operator of the
initial well currently being drilled and of a well that may be
drilled in 2012, said Chevron, which would take over as operator
thereafter. The U.S. company is expanding into new oil provinces
to keep production rising as access to petroleum reserves around
the world becomes more difficult. </p>
<p>This is an opportunity to build on recent positions we''ve
acquired in other locations in West Africa, Asia and Europe, and
it''s a highly prospective new basin for Chevron, Kurt Glaubitz, a company spokesman, said today in a telephone
interview. </p>
<p>Turkiye Petrolleri plans three wells through the venture
with Chevron that will cost about $750 million, Mehmet Uysal,
chief executive officer for the state oil company, told
reporters at a signing ceremony in Ankara. He said Turkiye
Petrolleri will get a $50 million bonus from Chevron if oil is
found. </p>
<p>Chevron rose $1.44, or 1.8 percent, to $79.90 as of 4:10
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil Corp., which also has a Black Sea venture with
Turkiye Petrolleri, is the largest U.S. oil company. </p>

<p>     Sept. 20 (Bloomberg) -- International Business Machines
Corp.''s $27-a-share deal to acquire Netezza Corp. pushed the
stock above that level, suggesting investors may expect a
competing bid for the analytics-technology provider. </p>
<p>IBM, the world''s largest computer-services provider, struck
a cash deal worth about $1.7 billion, according to a statement
from the company today. Marlborough, Massachusetts-based
Netezza''s stock topped the per-share offer by $1.27. </p>
<p>Netezza, whose clients include NYSE Euronext and Estee
Lauder Cos., integrates hardware with programs that store and
analyze data. It''s one of the few data-warehousing companies
that''s gained customers, making it an attractive buy for large
technology corporations looking to increase sales, said Keith Bachman, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets. </p>
<p>Larger companies are finding it harder to grow so when
they see an interesting technology, they''re willing to pay up
for it, said New York-based Bachman, who rates IBM
outperform. Possible counter-bidders could include Hewlett-
Packard Co., Dell Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc., he said. </p>
<p>Netezza rose $3.67, or 15 percent, to $28.27 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. IBM, based in Armonk,
New York, gained $1.60 to $131.79. Teradata Corp., which also
provides analytics and storage technology, climbed 7.5 percent
after analysts cited it as a potential target. </p>

<p>General Motors Co., which is making

<p>Detroit-based GM, 61 percent owned by the U.S. Treasury,
resumed donations through its political action committee,
according to the company''s August FEC report, and has given
$91,500 to candidates of both political parties. The PAC

Eric Cantor of Virginia, the No. 2 House Republican, and the

<p>SAIC Motor Corp. said it may invest
in the initial public offering of partner General Motors Co.,
cementing ties between the biggest U.S. and Chinese automakers. </p>
<p>SAIC will consider investing in GM if conditions are
favorable, Chairman Hu Maoyuan said in Shanghai. The company
hasn''t yet made a decision whether to make the investment and is
waiting for the details of the share sale, he said today. </p>
<p>GM is our important strategic partner, Hu said. We
are not clear about the details of its IPO. We will make the
right decision once we know details. </p>
<p>The automakers, which have made cars together in China for
more than a decade, said in December they would also sell low-
cost vehicles in India. GM filed for an IPO in August as the
U.S. government seeks to pare the 61 percent stake it gained in
the company through its bankruptcy and $50 billion taxpayer
bailout last year. </p>
<p>It would be a political hot potato if the already-
unpopular bailout of GM was followed by a Chinese company
acquiring a stake, Aaron Bragman, an analyst with IHS
Automotive in Northville, Michigan, said in a telephone
interview. </p>
<p>GM''s initial public offering will be open to overseas
investors, the U.S. Treasury said in a statement on its website.
Retail and institutional investors will be offered shares, and
the Treasury will not involve itself in decisions regarding
allocation of shares to specific buyers, the department said. </p>
<p>GM cannot comment on speculation surrounding a public
offering, Shanghai-based spokesman Mike Albano said in an e-
mailed statement on Sept. 18. </p>
<p>Chinese Sales </p>
<p>The Detroit-based automaker, whose partners in China also
include Wuling Motors Co. and China FAW Group Corp., sold 1.2
million vehicles in the nation during the six months ended June
30, according to a company filing related to the IPO. </p>
<p>Combined income from the joint ventures with SAIC and
Wuling rose to $734 million in the first six months of the year
from $298 million a year earlier. </p>
<p>It''s not a bad idea for GM and SAIC to further their ties
if it means getting GM better ingrained in the Chinese market,
IHS Automotive''s Bragman said. That''s where the money is going
to be made for the industry. </p>
<p>China''s wholesale deliveries of passenger cars increased
18.7 percent to 1.02 million units in August, compared with 13.6
percent growth in July, the China Association of Automobile
Manufacturers said in an e-mailed statement on Sept. 9. </p>
<p>China Offsets Slump </p>
<p>Sales in markets such as China and India are helping offset
slumping demand in the U.S. and Europe. China''s auto sales may
rise to 16 million this year, the association said last month,
boosting its forecast from a previous estimate of 15 million. </p>
<p>GM is in great shape to hold an offering, United Auto
Workers President Bob King said today in a Bloomberg Television
interview. </p>
<p>It will actually help them sell more product when they''ve
done the IPO, King said. I think the American public will
see that they''re a strong and healthy company. </p>
<p>Carlos Ghosn, the head of the Renault SA-Nissan Motor Co.
alliance, said today that he isn''t interested in investing in
GM. He spoke at a plant opening in Zhengzhou, central China. </p>

<p>General Growth Properties Inc., the
mall owner planning to exit bankruptcy next month, agreed to pay
$230 million to heirs of Howard Hughes to settle a dispute over
the Summerlin planned community in Las Vegas. </p>
<p>The heirs will receive $10 million in cash and the
remainder in cash or new General Growth common stock soon after
it leaves bankruptcy, the Chicago-based company said today in a
statement. The heirs had disagreed with the company over how to
value Summerlin. </p>
<p>General Growth, as part of its bankruptcy reorganization,
is separating its traditional retail properties from master-
planned community and commercial real estate operations. General
Growth plans to give existing shareholders the majority of a new
spinoff company now known as Spinco Inc., according to court
filings. Summerlin will be part of Spinco, according to a
regulatory filing. </p>
<p>With this agreement, GGP settles one of the last
remaining material issues impacting the capital structure of the
new GGP and Spinco'' as we continue our steady march toward
emergence from bankruptcy, Chief Operating Officer Thomas H. Nolan Jr. said in the statement. </p>
<p>Hughes, a billionaire aviator, industrialist and filmmaker,
died in 1976 at the age of 70. In 1996, Rouse Co. bought his
remaining assets, including 22,500 acres (9,100 hectares) of
land in Nevada. The Hughes heirs were to receive a portion of
profits from future land sales under the deal. </p>
<p>General Growth bought Rouse in 2004 for $11.3 billion and
assumed the obligation to Hughes heirs. General Growth filed for
bankruptcy protection in April 2009. </p>

<p>Samuel Palmisano, chief executive
officer of International Business Machines Corp., said improving
the U.S. electric-transmission grid depends on providing better
information to consumers. </p>
<p>Companies shouldn''t wait for government to set standards
for data and technologies to create a smart grid, which lets
consumers monitor their energy use and take conservation steps
that can save energy and money, Palmisano said today at the
Gridwise Global Forum in Washington. </p>
<p>There is an incredible buy-in for change in the U.S.,
and backers of new energy technology should tap into the
sentiment, he said in a speech opening the conference. </p>
<p>A smart electric grid is part of a push by companies and
regulators to make the nation''s energy system more efficient,
eliminating a need to build new generation sources that would
raise electricity prices and add to greenhouse-gas emissions. </p>
<p>Michael Morris, CEO of American Electric Power Co. of
Columbus, Ohio, said during a panel discussion with Palmisano
and Anders Eldrup, CEO of Dong Energy A/S, Denmark''s largest
utility, that consumers don''t think about how they use energy,
and don''t particularly want to. </p>
<p>We need to get the voters, the taxpayers, interested in
these issues, with smart-meter systems that are simple to use,
Morris said. </p>

<p>Opel''s reasons for putting the investment into Hungary
include the level of education, the economic framework and the
fact that Szentgotthard is located in an appropriate region of
the European Union, thus qualifying the plant for investment
subsidy, Reinald Hoben, Opel''s manufacturing chief, said at a
press conference in Budapest. </p>
<p>Hungary was the first European Union member-country to get
an International Monetary Fund bailout in 2008 and went through
its worst recession since 1991 last year. The country is
counting on resurgent demand in the euro region, which buys 60
percent of products made or assembled there to boost growth.
These include Audi cars, Opel engines and Nokia Oyj phones. </p>
<p>The government will decide by mid-October on the level of
subsidy it will offer Opel, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said at
the press conference. Only investments that will return state
aid in four years at the level of the national economy will be
supported, Orban said. </p>
<p>Production at the expanded plant will be highly
flexible and will include both diesel and gasoline engines,
Opel said. </p>
<p>The engines will be exported by rail to Opel/Vauxhall
plants in Germany, Britain, Poland and Spain. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is one
of the best-performing financial shares in the past decade
and it beat the SP 500 Stock Index, helping to explain Lloyd C. Blankfein''s $125 million in cash bonuses during the period. </p>
<p>Some investments did even better. One-year certificates of
deposit earned an average rate of 3.17 percent in the last 10
years, beating the 2.78 percent annual total return on Goldman
Sachs. Buying a 10-year Treasury note in mid-September 2000
would have yielded 5.8 percent annually. </p>
<p>Wall Street firms have defended the pay of chief executive
officers, including Blankfein, by pointing to the value they
generate for shareholders. Yet over the last decade, the SP 500
Financials Index, which includes 80 members, has dropped 49
percent. Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Morgan
Stanley have lost money for shareholders, while JPMorgan Chase 
Co. returned an annual 1.23 percent, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Some of the financial stocks were of course total
catastrophes, such as Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., Bear

innovating itself into obscurity, said John C. Bogle, the 81-

<p>Microsoft Corp., one of four non-
financial U.S. companies with AAA ratings, sold $4.75 billion of
bonds, including three- and five-year maturities at the lowest
coupons on record. </p>
<p>The company''s $1 billion of 0.875 percent notes due in 2013
and $1.75 billion of 1.625 percent debt maturing in 2015 have
the lowest interest rates of more than 3,500 securities in the
Barclays Capital U.S. Corporate Index of investment-grade
company debt. </p>
<p>The world''s biggest software maker sold the bonds a day
after its board boosted its dividend and approved the issuance
of as much as $6 billion in new debt. The offering came as
yields on investment-grade debt fell to 3.718 percent, the
lowest level since daily records began on Oct. 31, 1986,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. </p>
<p>A name like Microsoft is always going to garner the
biggest and best investors, said Anne Daley, managing director
at Barclays Capital in New York, which helped underwrite the
sale. </p>
<p>Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, also sold $1
billion each of 10- and 30-year bonds, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The 4.5 percent, 30-year debt tied for
the lowest coupon with an issue last month from Johnson 
Johnson. </p>
<p>Cash Held Overseas </p>
<p>Proceeds from Microsoft''s sale may be used to fund working
capital, capital expenditures, stock buybacks and acquisitions,
the company said today in a regulatory filing. The company also
plans to pay for dividends and share repurchases because much of
its cash is held overseas, a person familiar with the matter
said last week. </p>
<p>Peter Wootton, a Microsoft spokesman, wasn''t available to
comment today. </p>
<p>The 3-year notes yield 25 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries; the 5-year debt pays a 40 basis-point
spread; the 3 percent securities due in 2020 pay 55 basis
points; and 30-year bonds pay 83 basis points, Bloomberg data
show. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. </p>
<p>Spreads on investment-grade debt rose 1 basis point today
to 184 basis points, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data
show. </p>
<p>Standard  Poor''s and Moody''s Investors Service also rank
Exxon Mobil Corp., Johnson  Johnson and Automatic Data
Processing Inc. as AAA, or an equivalent Aaa, the same level
they assign to U.S. government debt. </p>
<p>Higher Dividend </p>
<p>Microsoft reported $36.8 billion in cash and short-term
investments at the end of last quarter. Much of that is held
overseas, forcing the company to pay taxes on any of the money
used for dividends or stock repurchases. </p>
<p>Microsoft boosted its quarterly dividend by 3 cents, or 23
percent, to 16 cents a share yesterday. </p>
<p>The dividend and share repurchase programs reflect
Microsoft''s commitment to returning capital to shareholders and
confidence in its long-term growth prospects, Chief Financial
Officer Peter Klein said yesterday in a statement. </p>
<p>You can take it as a sign of soft expected future stock-
market performance, said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income
strategist and economist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in
Philadelphia. Microsoft doesn''t have a lot of acquisition
opportunities, doesn''t have a lot to do internally, apparently,
with this capital, so they''re giving it back to shareholders. </p>
<p>Debut Sale </p>
<p>Microsoft sold its first bond in May 2009, a $3.75 billion
offering, in a bid to diversify its capital structure and add to
its cash pile for acquisitions, capital expenses and share
buybacks. The sale comprised $2 billion of 2.95 percent, 5-year
notes; $1 billion of 4.2 percent, 10-year debt; and $750 million
of 5.2 percent, 30-year bonds. </p>
<p>In June, Microsoft raised $1.15 billion of interest-free
financing from its first sale of convertible bonds. </p>
<p>It''s a perfect storm for issuers right now between low
rates, tight spreads and the fact that investors continue to
have cash to put to work, Daley said. We expect the active
new issue calendar to continue. </p>
<p>In addition to Barclays, Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase
 Co. helped underwrite today''s sale. </p>

didn''t disclose the size or timing of the sale. The bonds may be
sold as soon as today, said a person familiar with the
transaction said, who declined to be identified as terms aren''t
set. </p>
<p>Microsoft is marketing the debt after yields on investment-
grade corporate bonds fell to 3.73 percent yesterday, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch, the lowest since daily records
began on Oct. 31, 1986. Demand for the securities, from one of
only four nonfinancial U.S. companies with the top credit grade,
will be huge across the globe, said Mirko Mikelic, a money
manager at Fifth Third Asset Management. </p>
<p>I''m sure it''s going to be a name everyone''s going to
want, said Mikelic, who helps oversee $13 billion of fixed-
income assets in Grand Rapids, Michigan. It''s a triple-A
credit, great company, well-run, what''s there not to like, other
than the pricing? </p>
<p>Microsoft plans to sell $1 billion each of 3-, 10- and 30-
year bonds and $1.75 billion of 5-year debt, the person said. </p>
<p>Projected Yields </p>
<p>The 3-year notes may yield 25 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, the 5-year debt may pay a spread of
40 basis points, the 10-year securities may yield 55 basis

bonds at the lowest interest rates on record for 10-year and 30-
year securities last month, according to Citigroup Inc. data
going back to 1981. </p>
<p>The Treasury markets have lower rates than mid-August and
that creates the likelihood that Microsoft will price at lower
rates than the JJ deal, said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income
strategist and economist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in
Philadelphia. </p>
<p>Overseas Cash </p>
<p>Microsoft reported $36.8 billion in cash and short-term

<p>Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs

<p>Goldman Sachs''s earnings-per-share estimate was lowered to

50 cents, analysts led by Michael Carrier said in a note to
clients yesterday. The bank has a buy recommendation on both
stocks. </p>
<p>Capital markets in the third quarter were mostly weak
across the board following a challenging second quarter,
including muted equity trading, the Deutsche Bank analysts
said. The combination of derisking during the European crises,
ongoing regulatory reform uncertainty and negative macro data
points led investors to stay out of the markets. </p>
<p>Deutsche Bank said it''s expecting another subdued quarter
at New York-based Goldman Sachs because of poor conditions in
trading and soft investment banking. Morgan Stanley, also
based in New York, may post a weak quarter because of its
trading results and slowing revenue from investment banking,
asset management and wealth management, the analysts said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs fell $1.90, or 1.3 percent, to $149.50 at

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. has sold $6.06
billion of corporate bonds for Texas-based energy companies,
excluding utilities, so far this year, more than the $5.03
billion it sold in all of 2009 and the highest amount in at
least a decade. </p>
<p>The bank, based in New York, is the top arranger of
corporate bonds for coal, oil and natural-gas companies in the
Lone Star state this year with 20 percent of the market, the
largest share controlled by a single firm since 2003, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Energy producers and companies that provide them with
equipment and pipeline services are benefiting from borrowing
costs near the lowest on record, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data. They''re also capitalizing on investor
discontent with equity markets, said Sean Sexton with Fitch
Ratings Ltd. The value of JPMorgan''s Texas energy-bond sales
rose even as they fell in number to 25 from 37 in all of 2009. </p>
<p>Even for companies with no near-term need for cash, now''s
a smart time to refinance bonds set to mature in the latter half
of 2011 or 2012 because nobody''s sure if interest rates will
still be this low by then, said Sexton, managing director of
energy, chemicals and commodities for New York-based Fitch.
They''ve got to strike while the iron''s hot. </p>
<p>Energy company bond yields fell to 4.04 percent on Aug. 24,
the lowest on record going back to December 1996, Bank of
America Merrill Lynch''s U.S. Corporates Energy index shows. </p>
<p>The securities yield 4.07 percent as of Sept. 21, compared
with the overall investment-grade U.S. corporate bond market''s
yield of 3.73 percent, index data show. </p>
<p>Motiva, ATP </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s biggest Texas energy deals this year included $1
billion in 10- and 30-year bonds sold for Motiva Enterprises
LLC, a joint venture between Saudi Arabia''s state-owned oil
company and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, and $750 million in 5-year
debt for ATP Oil  Gas Corp. Both are Houston-based. </p>
<p>Almost two-thirds of JPMorgan''s Texas energy debt sales
occurred during the first half of the year, when the Standard 
Poor''s 500 equity index lost 7.6 percent of its value. The bank
has dominated the Texas energy debt market for seven of the past
11 years, Bloomberg data showed. Justin Perras, a JPMorgan
spokesman, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Credit Suisse Group AG was the second-biggest underwriter
this year with $3.07 billion in debt sales for Texas energy
companies on 12 issuances. Duncan King, a spokesman for Credit
Suisse, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Last year''s second-best performer, Citigroup Inc., fell to
fourth with $2.87 billion in debt sales, down from $4.2 billion
in 2009. </p>
<p>Denbury Resources </p>
<p>The size of JPMorgan''s Texas underwriting this year ranged
from Motiva''s $1 billion debt sale to a $50 million issuance for
Plains Exploration  Production Co., a Houston-based oil and gas
explorer. </p>
<p>Denbury Resources Inc. was JPMorgan''s highest-paying Texas-
based energy client on a percentage basis. The Plano, Texas-
based oil producer was charged a 2 percent fee on $200 million
in 15-year bonds, Bloomberg data showed. That was more than
double the average 0.963 percent fee JPMorgan collected from the
Texas energy sector this year. </p>
<p>Oil, gas, coal, oilfield-equipment and pipeline companies
based in Texas sold $30.1 billion in debt during the year
through Sept. 17, compared with $36.6 billion for all of 2009,
Bloomberg data showed. The average size of each deal expanded to
$684 million from $530 million in 2009. </p>
<p>Before this year, the last time a single firm controlled
more than one-fifth of the Texas energy debt market was in 2003,
when Citigroup underwrote $2.66 billion in sales, or 22 percent
of the market, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>

<p>Qatar Petroleum Ltd. will retain its position as the

<p>There''s virtually no supply of that debt, said LeBas,
whose Philadelphia-based firm provides financial advisory
services. Johnson  Johnson issued 30-year debt last month
that''s tied with Microsoft for the lowest coupon. </p>
<p>Microsoft sold $4.75 billion of bonds yesterday in a four-
part offering, including three- and five-year maturities at the
lowest coupons on record. The software maker issued $1 billion
of 0.875 percent notes due in 2013 and $1.75 billion of 1.625
percent debt maturing in 2015. </p>
<p>The company''s debt is almost Treasury like in its lack
of risk, said William Larkin, who helps manage $500 million in
fixed-income assets at Cabot Money Management in Salem,
Massachusetts. The software maker reported $36.8 billion in cash
and short-term investments at the end of last quarter. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s $1 billion of 3 percent bonds due in 2020
climbed 0.872 cent to 100.008 cents on the dollar. Bonds often
rise in first-day trading because initial offerings are priced
with slightly wider spreads to make sure they''re sold, LeBas
said. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. is developing a process that may pack more music on Apple
Inc.''s iPod Nanos or make solar panels more efficient. </p>
<p>IBM scientists are unveiling today a technique for
observing atomic reactions in real-time. It may help
manufacturers make smaller devices with greater memory, Spike
Narayan, an IBM researcher, said in a phone interview. </p>
<p>It''s easy to make things on a small scale, but to
understand how things behave going down to the smaller scale,
that''s really what''s needed, said Narayan, who manages science
and technology at IBM''s Almaden Research Center in San Jose,
California. </p>
<p>IBM, the world''s largest computer-services provider,
invested about $6 billion, or about 6 percent of its sales, in
research projects last year. The company is aiming to design
more efficient methods to process and store information as
customers demand more computing power. </p>
<p>The technique may enable manufacturers to make hard-drives
that hold 1,000 times more data than now, said Rob Enderle, a
principal analyst at Enderle Group. One version of the iPhone 4,
Apple''s newest model with features including video calls, Web
surfing and a music player, has a capacity of 32 gigabytes. </p>
<p>Think of iPhones that, instead of having gigabytes, have
terabytes -- that''s what this could mean, Enderle said. One
terabyte is equivalent to about 1,000 gigabytes. It allows
them to put vastly more data in a vastly smaller space, the
San Jose-based analyst said. </p>
<p>Atom Magnetism </p>
<p>Using a special microscope that images atoms, scientists
moved an atom with voltage and measured its magnetism at various
points, observing how it acted at a speed 1 million times faster
than has been possible. The study enabled them to time how long
an atom can hold 1 byte of data. For an iron atom on a copper
surface, it was 200 nanoseconds, comparable to typical dynamic
random access memory, which is used in personal computers,
Narayan said. </p>
<p>Now scientists may use the technique to see how certain
combinations hold data, and how few atoms are needed for various
functions. </p>
<p>Observing atom''s reactions in real-time also has
implications outside the storage industry, Narayan said.
Scientists could manipulate how atoms react to light, helping
make solar panels more efficient, he said. The technique could
help study how atoms in bodies consume energy, he said. </p>
<p>IBM, based in Armonk, New York, makes about $1 billion a
year in licensing revenue, according to regulatory filings. </p>
<p>This month, IBM Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano
criticized rival Hewlett Packard Co. for cutting investments in
research and development, saying it forces them to pay more for
acquisitions. HP agreed to pay $2.35 billion this month for
data-storage maker 3Par, after a bidding contest with Dell Inc. </p>
<p>IBM fell 90 cents to $131.67 at 4:01 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares are little changed this
year. </p>

<p>General Motors Co. will probably
seek to raise $8 billion to $10 billion in an initial public
offering in November, a smaller sale than the automaker
originally targeted, said two people familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury Department, which owns 61 percent of GM,
is more interested in fetching a higher share price to
eventually recoup its $49.5 billion investment than in cashing
out a bigger portion of its position, said the people who asked
not to be identified because the discussions are private. </p>
<p>A larger deal at a lower price would place more pressure on
the government to win higher prices in future offerings, the
people said today. GM and its investment banks have been
considering a deal as large as $16 billion, people familiar with
the plans said in August. </p>
<p>They''re taking a more sober view, said Joe Phillippi,
principal of AutoTrends Inc., a consulting firm in Short Hills,
New Jersey. The real question is what''s the price? There are
questions in people''s minds about the market and the world''s
economies. </p>
<p>Chairman Ed Whitacre, who handed CEO duties to Dan Akerson
on Sept. 1, had favored an IPO that would sell as much of the
government''s position as possible, the people said. GM''s banks
also sought a larger deal because it would generate higher fees. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. is urging an
overhaul of U.S. laws for electronic privacy to help new
services such as cloud computing, a technology that may double
sales in five years. </p>
<p>As more data are stored on remote servers and away from
personal computers, a 1986 digital law needs to be updated to
give consumers confidence their information is protected, Brad Smith, Microsoft''s general counsel, said yesterday at a Senate
Judiciary Committee hearing in Washington. </p>
<p>The law needs to catch up, Smith said after the
hearing. Cloud computing is a critical part of the future and
quite central to all that we''re doing. </p>
<p>Collecting and storing data using remote computer servers,
called cloud computing, may generate global sales of $148.8
billion by the end of 2014, up from $58.6 billion last year,
according to researcher Gartner Inc. in Stamford, Connecticut.
If consumers worry about online security, it could limit the
industry''s growth, Smith said in prepared testimony. </p>
<p>Microsoft sells cloud-computing software such as
HealthVault, which helps patients manage chronic health
conditions by storing data online, and Windows Azure, which lets
a company such as Domino''s Pizza Inc. manage its orders when
demand is high, Smith said. While the U.S. Constitution shields
letters and telephone calls from government seizure, data
transferred to a third party may lack such protection. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley says investors
should buy the lowest-rated corporate debt, while Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. says stay away, underscoring the dilemma faced by
investors as junk-bond prices rise to the highest since 2007. </p>
<p>Bonds graded CCC in the U.S. are the cheapest high-
yield securities with economic data once again beginning to
surprise to the upside, Morgan Stanley told clients yesterday
in a report. Goldman Sachs says higher-rated speculative-grade
debt is the way to go as the economy decelerates. </p>
<p>Bondholders faced with near-zero interest rates and record-
low yields are turning to higher-risk notes to boost returns,
betting growth will be strong enough to keep defaults in check.
Investors poured $480.2 billion into mutual funds that focus on
debt in the two years ended June 30, more than went into stock
funds during the Internet bubble, according to the Washington-
based Investment Company Institute. That has helped companies
sell a record amount of junk bonds in 2010 with three months
still left in the year. </p>
<p>A lot of very mediocre to marginal deals have been able
to get out of the gate over the last few months because there''s
still tremendous risk appetite, said Margaret Patel, who
oversees about $1 billion of assets at Wells Fargo  Co.''s
Advantage Diversified Capital Builder Fund and Advantage
Diversified Income Builder Fund in Boston. The economy is at
least growing slowly, but it''s growing positively, so that''s a
very, very favorable backdrop for high yield. </p>
<p>Prices Climb </p>
<p>Prices of U.S. corporate bonds rated below Baa3 by Moody''s
Investors Service and less than BBB- by Standard  Poor''s closed
at an average of 100.4 cents on the dollar yesterday, up from 55
cents in December 2008, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data. </p>
<p>The lowest-ranked debt, rated CCC and lower, has done even
better, rising to 89.2 cents from 31.6 cents. The securities
have returned 3 percent this month, with relative yields
averaging 10.9 percentage points more than Treasuries. </p>
<p>While the securities are beating BB debt by 0.94 percentage
point this month, they''re trailing for the year. The highest
tier of junk debt has gained 12.4 percent this year compared
with 10.4 percent for bonds rated CCC and lower, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data show. </p>
<p>Elsewhere in credit markets, the extra yield investors
demand to own company bonds instead of similar-maturity
government debt rose 1 basis point to 172 basis points, or 1.72
percentage points, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch''s
Global Broad Market Corporate Index. Yields averaged 3.476
percent, the lowest since reaching the same level Aug. 31. </p>
<p>The cost of insuring Irish debt against default surged to a
record as the government auctioned bills, while Microsoft Corp.
sold bonds yesterday at the lowest interest rates on record as
September issuance continued to surge. Private equity firm KKR 
Co. issued notes for the first time. </p>
<p>Microsoft Offering </p>
<p>Microsoft, one of only four non-financial companies rated
AAA by SP and Moody''s, issued $4.75 billion of debentures one
day after boosting its dividend and getting board approval to
sell debt. The world''s biggest software maker, based in Redmond,
Washington, raised $1 billion from 0.875 percent three-year
debt, $1.75 billion from 1.625 percent five-year debentures, $1
billion from 3 percent notes due 2020 and $1 billion from 4.5
percent bonds maturing in 2040, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>The coupon on the three-year security is less than the 1
percent on a similar-maturity note issued last month by
International Business Machines Corp., which was previously the
lowest of the more than 3,500 securities in the Barclays Capital
U.S. Corporate Index of investment-grade company debt. </p>
<p>KKR Bonds </p>
<p>KKR, which began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in
July, boosted its offering of 10-year senior unsecured notes to
$500 million from $350 million. The notes yield 387.5 basis
points more than Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>The New York-based firm, founded by Henry Kravis and George Roberts in 1976, raised the cash as it expands beyond
traditional buyouts, in which it pools money from investors to
take over companies, and into capital markets, underwriting
equity and bond offerings. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps insuring Ireland''s sovereign debt
surged 31 basis points to an all-time high 495.5, according to
data provider CMA. </p>
<p>Ireland sold 300 million euros of securities due February
2011 today at an average yield of 1.907 percent, compared with
1.925 percent at a Sept. 9 sale, according to the nation''s debt
agency. It also issued 100 million euros of April 2011
securities at an average yield of 2.231 percent, up from 2.19
percent. </p>
<p>Corporate Risk </p>
<p>A benchmark indicator of corporate credit risk in the U.S.
climbed for a third day. Credit-default swaps on the Markit CDX
North America Investment Grade Index, which investors use to
hedge against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, increased 1.6 basis points to a mid-price of
112.95 basis points as of 10:07 a.m. in New York, according to
index administrator Markit Group Ltd. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower
fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted
debt. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a swap protecting
$10 million of debt. </p>
<p>Concern the U.S. economy will falter led the Federal
Reserve to say Sept. 21 it''s willing to ease monetary policy
further to spur growth. Fed policy makers said the pace of
recovery and job growth have slowed in recent months. The
central bank has kept its target rate for overnight loans
between banks in a range of zero to 0.25 percent since December
2008. </p>
<p>Gross Domestic Product </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley forecasts annualized growth in gross
domestic product of 2 percent to 2.5 percent in the second-half
of this year. </p>
<p>That typically has been an ideal environment for
credit, Adam Richmond, a credit strategist at Morgan Stanley
in New York, said yesterday. Unless you really think that
we''re going to double dip, even in zero to 2 percent growth, we
find that high yield holds up OK, even the lower quality
bucket. </p>
<p>Moody''s said this week the number of U.S. companies at
greatest risk of default dropped to the lowest level in two
years. Companies rated at or below B3 with a negative outlook
declined to 195 as of Sept. 1 from a high of 288 in June 2009.
Clear Channel Communications Inc. and Energy Future Holdings
Corp., formerly named TXU Corp., were among the biggest
companies on the list. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs economists estimate growth at 1.5 percent on
an annualized basis this quarter, next quarter and in the first
period of 2011, said Alberto Gallo, a credit strategist for the
firm in New York. Goldman Sachs has favored BB corporate bonds
over CCC debt since the end of 2009. </p>
<p>Deceleration'' </p>
<p>We do like high yield much more in the BB and B space,
Gallo said. Because of the potential for deceleration in the
economy in the second half of the year, as well as relatively
compressed valuations, we prefer to be in the upper end of high
yield. </p>
<p>The average yield on CCC bonds is 12.3 percent, compared
with BB debt that pays 6.5 percent, or a spread over Treasuries
of 465 basis points, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data. </p>
<p>Lower-quality high yield to us is cheaper on a risk-
adjusted valuation than higher-quality high yield, Richmond
said. Over the next year or so, the right trade is to be long
credit risk and short or neutral on rate risk. The best way to
get the most credit exposure with the least rate exposure is in
lower-quality high yield. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley estimates the 10-year Treasury note yield
will rise to 3 percent this year and to 4.25 percent by the end
of 2011, while Goldman Sachs forecasts 2.5 percent in December
2010 and 3.3 percent a year later. The yield closed at 2.56
percent yesterday in New York. </p>
<p>Sales Booming </p>
<p>Junk bond sales are booming. Speculative-grade debt
issuance in the U.S. jumped to $187.3 billion this year compared
with $100.1 billion in the same period of 2009, Bloomberg data
show. Companies rated Caa1 or lower by Moody''s have issued at
least $2.63 billion of bonds this month, compared with $2.56
billion in August and the most since April. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs has underwritten 84 issues totaling $12.95
billion of high-yield U.S. offerings this year, 6.9 percent of
the market and the sixth-highest amount, Bloomberg data show.
Morgan Stanley is seventh, having helped manage 81 offerings for
$12.7 billion of sales, or 6.8 percent of the market. </p>
<p>The firms helped underwrite Valeant Pharmaceuticals
International''s two-part, $1.2 billion sale of senior notes on
Sept. 21, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Demand for the lowest debt is evident with Freescale
Semiconductor Inc., bought in a 2006 leveraged buyout led by
Blackstone Group LP, selling $750 million of notes yesterday
after increasing the size of the offering from $500 million. The
10-year, 10.75 percent debentures are rated Caa2 by Moody''s and
the equivalent CCC by SP. The Austin, Texas-based chipmaker''s
$1.265 billion of 8.875 percent notes due 2014 rose 2.94 cents
to 100 cents on the dollar, Trace data show. </p>

<p>Repsol YPF SA''s planned sale of
shares in its Brazilian unit is a positive trigger for the
valuation of Spain''s biggest oil company, JPMorgan said. </p>
<p>It will help to realize a fuller valuation for its pre-
salt discoveries, London-based analysts Fred Lucas and Nitin Sharma wrote today in a note. Concerns on potential demand
weakness in the local market are overdone. We believe that the
company''s good exploration track record, pure upstream bias and
well appraised resource base ought to be an attractive
preposition for investors. </p>
<p>Repsol, which plans to sell about 40 percent of its
Brazilian business through an initial public offering, filed to
sell voting shares in the unit on Aug. 9. The Madrid-based
company is seeking to raise about $4 billion from the stock
sale, valuing the unit at about $10 billion, two people familiar
with the plan said in July. </p>
<p>The JPMorgan analysts have an overweight rating on
Repsol and increased the share-price estimate to 23 euros from
21 euros. The shares have advanced 0.4 percent in Madrid so far
this year, giving Repsol a market value of 23 billion euros ($31
billion). </p>
<p>Repsol has stakes in blocks in Brazil''s Santos, Campos and
Espirito Santo basins, and will invest as much as $5 billion
there from 2010 through 2014, and as much as $9 billion from
2015 through 2019. </p>
<p>Since 2007, Repsol and partners BG Group Plc and Brazil''s
state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA have found hydrocarbons
in the offshore Carioca, Guara and Iguacu fields in the Santos
Basin''s BM-S-9 block. These are ultra-deep deposits beneath a
salt layer under the seabed. </p>
<p>Petrobras, as Brazil''s state-controlled oil company is
known, estimated in November 2007 that the Santos Basin''s pre-
salt Tupi field may contain as many as 8 billion barrels of oil,
the largest find in the Americas since Mexico''s Cantarell field
in 1976. Repsol doesn''t own a stake in Tupi. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. said Steve Wadsworth will step down as president of the company''s
Interactive Media Group. </p>
<p>A replacement will be named shortly, the Burbank,
California-based company said in a statement. In an e-mail to
employees last night, Wadsworth said he''ll remain through a
transition after Disney Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger
picks his successor. </p>
<p>Wadsworth, a 17-year veteran, becomes the sixth Disney
division head to leave his job this year. That includes Chief
Financial Officer Tom Staggs and Parks chief Jay Rasulo swapping
roles. John Pleasants, CEO of Playdom, the social games company
Disney bought in July, is the leading candidate for Wadsworth''s
job, the New York Times reported yesterday, citing unidentified
people with knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>There are a number of career adventures and new endeavors
that I have been interested in exploring, but my commitment and
focus have been here at Disney, Wadsworth wrote in the e-mail.
While there is never a good time to leave a great role at a
great company, for many reasons now is the right time for me to
move on. </p>
<p>Courtney Simmons, a spokeswoman for Disney''s Interactive
division, said Wadsworth was unavailable to comment further. </p>
<p>Big media companies typically lose money online. Disney''s
interactive group lost $65 million last quarter, while News
Corp.''s digital media unit lost $174 million in the quarter
ended in June. CBS Corp. stopped reporting interactive results
after it lost $41.3 million in the first nine months of 2009. </p>
<p>Acquisitions </p>
<p>Wadsworth has run Disney''s Interactive group since 1999 and
assumed oversight of video-game operations in 2008. Since paying
$350 million for the kids'' social network Club Penguin three
years ago, Disney has purchased Wideload Games, whose founder
helped create Microsoft Corp.''s hit Halo franchise. And in
July, Disney acquired Tapulous, a publisher of music-related
games for Apple Inc.''s iPhone. </p>
<p>I am confident that the business is well positioned for
continued significant growth, Wadsworth wrote. Our recent

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. listed Ford
Motor Co. and Southwest Airlines Co. as among 24 low-priced
cyclical stocks that may lure investors by year-end. </p>
<p>Improved 2011 earnings estimates and attractive valuations
may help cyclical companies, which are more sensitive to
economic growth, outperform versus so-called defensive stocks,
according to Thomas Lee, the firm''s chief U.S. equity
strategist. Stocks priced below $22 a share have trailed gains
by the broader equity markets and may begin to rally in the next
three months, he said. </p>
<p>There is a strong and intuitive relationship between
economic momentum and cyclical outperformance, Lee wrote in a
research note today. The improved tone of equity markets in
recent weeks is notable. </p>
<p>The Standard  Poor''s 500 Index has climbed 7.2 percent in
September through yesterday as improved economic data has
bolstered optimism in the economic recovery. The benchmark for
U.S. equities was still 7.6 percent below this year''s high in
April, after falling on concern that American unemployment and
widening budget deficits in Europe would derail global growth. </p>
<p>US Airways Group Inc., CBS Corp. and Macy''s Inc. are among
the companies with the highest market capitalizations listed in
the group. Lee selected the 24 cyclical, high-beta companies
with 2011 earnings forecasts that have been raised by analysts
since April, shares priced less than $22 and market
capitalization greater than $1 billion. </p>
<p>High-beta stocks move the most relative to benchmark
indexes. </p>
<p>The SP 500''s rally may continue based on the index''s
performance in midterm election years, according to Lee.
Equities have risen from mid-September to year-end in 21 of the
past 28 midterm election years. Lee''s forecast for where the SP
500 will be at the end of the year is 1,300, the highest of the
11 strategists who gave an estimate in a survey by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>History strongly favors equities to outperform in the
fourth quarter, Lee said. Given the mixed performance of
many asset managers year-to-date, this suggests we should see
performance chasing this year. </p>

<p>     Sept. 27 (Bloomberg) -- International Business Machines
Corp., the world''s largest computer-services provider, agreed to
buy closely held Blade Network Technologies Inc. to gain
products that connect server computers in company data centers. </p>
<p>IBM didn''t give a value for the purchase in its statement
today. Santa Clara, California-based Blade Network''s investors
include Garnett  Helfrich Capital and Juniper Networks Inc. </p>
<p>IBM is bolstering data-center offerings as rivals expand in
corporate computing. Blade Network makes switches that connect
servers, storage and networks in data centers, large rooms of
computers that handle corporate tasks. It''s the third
acquisition IBM has announced this month, after a $1.7 billion
deal for storage-analytics maker Netezza Corp. and a purchase of
software maker OpenPages Inc. for an undisclosed sum. </p>
<p>The move may help IBM compete as rivals increasingly tie
networking gear with data centers. Cisco Systems Inc., the
world''s largest maker of networking equipment, last year
released its first blade servers, pushing into the data-center
market and pitting it against Hewlett-Packard Co. and IBM. In
April, HP bought 3Com Corp. for $2.7 billion to bolster its
data-center networking. </p>
<p>Sam Palmisano, IBM''s chief executive officer, said in May
he is planning to spend about $20 billion on acquisitions in the
next five years. He''s made more than 100 purchases since taking
over the company eight years ago. </p>
<p>IBM, based in Armonk, New York, gained 54 cents to $134.65
at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares have added 2.9 percent this year. </p>
<p>Oracle Corp., the world''s second-largest software maker,
bought server-maker Sun Microsystems Inc. for more than $7
billion in January. This month, HP agreed to pay $2.35 billion
for data-storage maker 3Par Inc., after a bidding contest with
Dell Inc. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc., the world''s biggest
drugmaker, sued Danish competitor Novo Nordisk A/S in a U.K.
court to invalidate its patent for an injection mechanism that
prevents overdoses. </p>
<p>Novo Nordisk''s European patent for the dose-setting device
is based on claims that weren''t new when the patent application
was filed, New York-based Pfizer said in a complaint in the High
Court in London. The suit, filed July 5 and made public this
week, didn''t say if Pfizer is using the technology. </p>
<p>We disagree with Pfizer''s claim and we will defend the
patent in court, Mike Rulis, a spokesman for Bagsvaerd,
Denmark-based Novo Nordisk, said today in a phone interview. </p>
<p>Pfizer and Novo Nordisk, the world''s biggest maker of the
diabetes treatment insulin, have sparred over delivery methods
for the drug since at least 2005. The disputed patent concerns a
device that lets doctors set maximum dose limits to prevent the
visually impaired and other groups from using too much during
self injections. </p>
<p>Pfizer also sued Novo Nordisk in Switzerland over the same
patent, which expires in 2026, Pfizer spokeswoman Charlotte
Binstead said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Novo Nordisk in December started the first human tests on
an experimental insulin pill, joining companies seeking to
develop an alternative to daily injections. </p>
<p>The companies'' earlier dispute concerned Pfizer''s inhaled-
insulin product Exubera, seen as a possible replacement to
injections. Pfizer stopped selling the product in 2007 when it
failed to catch on with doctors and patients, while Novo Nordisk
abandoned its inhaled version the following year. </p>
<p>The companies in 2007 settled a U.S. patent-infringement
suit over Exubera. In that case, Novo Nordisk sued Pfizer in
federal court in New York, claiming Exubera infringed two
patents. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. said there''s a
75 percent chance that the Federal Reserve will start another
round of asset purchases before the end of this year to boost
the economy, supporting Treasury bond prices. </p>
<p>The U.S. central bank may spend a few hundred billion
dollars on a so-called quantitative easing program, and it''s
likely to keep the official rate on hold until 2012, said Pavan Wadhwa, head of European interest-rate strategy in London at
JPMorgan. </p>
<p>The Fed is likely to do more quantitative easing, and
that will pull Treasury yields lower, Wadhwa said in an
interview. It''s hard to argue that these bonds are overvalued
when inflation and resource utilisation rates remain very low,
and the unemployment rate is high. </p>
<p>The Federal Open Market Committee''s Sept. 21 statement said
it will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial
developments and is prepared to provide additional accommodation
if needed to support the economic recovery. </p>
<p>The Fed''s statement indicates it''s focused on an inflation
level below the preferred long-term range as the main reason to
provide additional stimulus. Consumer prices excluding food and
fuel costs rose 0.9 percent in August from a year earlier,
matching the smallest increase since the 1960s. </p>
<p>The Fed retained its policy, begun last month, of
reinvesting proceeds from mortgage debt repayments into long-
term Treasuries. It has bought $34 billion since it began the
program on Aug. 17. Policy makers also kept the benchmark
federal funds rate in a range of zero to 0.25 percent, where
it''s been since December 2008, and reiterated the rate will stay
exceptionally low for an extended period. </p>
<p>Japanese Intervention </p>
<p>Other factors that may also push Treasury yields lower
include the consequences of intervention in the currency market
by the Bank of Japan, said Wadhwa. Earlier this month, Japan
intervened in the foreign-exchange market for the first time
since 2004 after the yen''s advance to a 15-year high against the
dollar threatened to stunt the nation''s economic recovery. </p>
<p>The Bank of Japan bought a significant amount of dollars
during the forex intervention, and may do another round, said
Wadhwa. They will need to invest these dollars somewhere. I
suspect they will end up investing in Treasuries. </p>
<p>The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury declined 4 basis
points to 2.56 percent as of 11:45 a.m. in London. The two-year
note yield was down 2 basis points to 0.43 percent. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. faces a legal
challenge next month that could cast doubt on thousands of
foreclosures after a mortgage executive at the bank said she
didn''t verify documents used to justify home seizures. </p>
<p>Lawyers for a Palm Beach County, Florida, homeowner asked a
judge to throw out a foreclosure as a penalty for misleading the
court, according to attorney Tom Ice of Ice Legal PA. They''re
citing a May 17 deposition in which the JPMorgan executive said
she signed thousands of affidavits and documents supporting the
New York-based bank''s claims without personally checking loan
records. The court is scheduled to hear arguments Oct. 19. </p>
<p>The Chase Home Finance operation supervisor, Beth Ann
Cottrell, said in May she was among eight managers who together
sign about 18,000 documents a month, according to a transcript
of her sworn deposition provided by Ice. Asked how they were
prepared, she said she relied on other people at the firm. </p>
<p>My review is more or less signing the document unless
it''s questionable, she said. That means, somebody has a
question and brings it to me and says, Beth, can you take a
look at this?'' </p>
<p>Inaccurate statements by banks in foreclosure documents may
give borrowers who have lost their homes a legal basis to
challenge the seizures, derailing resales and casting doubts on
property titles. A Florida court sanctioned Ally Financial
Inc.''s GMAC Mortgage unit for faulty affidavits in 2006, and the
firm suspended evictions in 23 states this month after finding
employees still signing affidavits without checking the data. </p>
<p>Titles in Doubt </p>
<p>JPMorgan spokesman Tom Kelly declined requests for comment.
Cottrell didn''t return phone calls to her office requesting
comment. A lawyer representing her at the deposition, Joseph
Mancilla of the Florida Default Law Group PL, didn''t return
calls. Cottrell isn''t named as a defendant. </p>
<p>Cottrell signed the affidavit at issue in the case, dated
June 2009, while at her previous employer, an outside servicing
firm working for JPMorgan, according to court documents. When
signing documents there for the JPMorgan unit, she used the
title assistant secretary and vice president of Chase Home
Finance, according to the transcript. She became a JPMorgan
employee about three months after signing the affidavit.
Document signers sometimes endorse affidavits on behalf of other
firms as a way to streamline the foreclosure process, said
Dustin Zacks, an attorney at Ice''s firm. </p>
<p>JPMorgan was the third-largest U.S. servicer of home
mortgages as of June 30, with $1.35 trillion or almost 13
percent of the market, according to industry newsletter Inside
Mortgage Finance. Ally is the fifth-biggest mortgage servicer,
with $349.1 billion. The other three in the top five are Bank of
America Corp., Wells Fargo  Co., and Citigroup Inc. </p>
<p>Foreclosures Averted </p>
<p>Servicers perform billing and collections on home loans.
When borrowers default, the firms handle the foreclosure
process. Affidavits lay the legal foundation for a foreclosure
by attesting that the borrower is delinquent and that the lender
is entitled to seize the home. Details of the JPMorgan case were
reported earlier last week by the Financial Times. </p>
<p>Lawyers in Florida and New York, among other states, have
halted foreclosures and evictions by showing affidavits were
faulty. Attorneys general in Texas, Iowa and Illinois have
started investigations into mortgage practices at GMAC Mortgage
following last week''s revelations. California has ordered the
company to prove its foreclosures are legal or halt them. </p>
<p>If the documents are shown to be false after a home has
already been resold by a bank, that casts doubt on who is the
rightful owner, said O. Max Gardner III, an attorney at law firm
Gardner  Gardner PLLC in Shelby, North Carolina, who has
represented homeowners in fighting foreclosures and has cases
pending against JPMorgan. </p>
<p>Title Insurers </p>
<p>I''m sure a lot of title insurance companies are concerned
about the potential liability right now, as borrowers
challenge how banks made statements, he said. The judges could
absolutely hold the bank and attorneys in contempt. </p>
<p>U.S. home seizures reached a record for the third time in
five months in August as lenders completed the foreclosure
process for thousands of delinquent owners, according to
RealtyTrac Inc. </p>
<p>Ice, the founding partner of his foreclosure-defense law
firm in Royal Palm Beach, Florida, said some lenders are
accepting voluntary dismissal of their cases. </p>
<p>During the deposition, Cottrell said a staff of in-house
specialists scrutinize loan documents and prepare affidavits,
the transcript shows. If they have difficulties or questions,
they come to her. She signs in a notary''s presence, she said. </p>
<p>No Knowledge'' </p>
<p>During questioning by Ice lawyer Zacks, Cottrell said she
had worked at Chase Home Finance for about eight months,
according to the transcript. </p>
<p>As to everything in the affidavit, did you have personal
knowledge? Zacks asked. </p>
<p>My own personal knowledge, no, Cottrell answered. </p>
<p>You stated That plaintiff is entitled to enforce the
note and mortgage,'' Zacks said. Again, did you have personal
knowledge of that? </p>
<p>No knowledge, she answered. </p>
<p>Florida Attorney General William McCollum is investigating
three law firms that represent loan servicers in foreclosures,
and are alleged to have submitted fraudulent documents to the
courts, according to an Aug. 10 statement. The firms handled
about 80 percent of foreclosure cases in the state, according to
a letter from U.S. Representative Alan Grayson, a Florida
Democrat. </p>
<p>Judges overseeing foreclosures in the wake of the housing
crisis are growing skeptical of banks, said Christopher L. Peterson, a professor at the University of Utah''s S.J. Quinney
College of Law. A surge in proceedings has helped expose a
variety of paperwork lapses, he said in an interview. </p>
<p>Early in the process the judges were very cavalier and
they just took the financiers'' word, Peterson said. Now
there are enough disputes out there about ownership of loans
that the judges are starting to feel like they need to hold the
financial institutions to the basic rules of evidence. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. plans to
triple private banking assets in Asia, its fastest-growing
market, over the next five years after moving one of its top
executives to the region. </p>
<p>The unit, which manages money for wealthy clients and
employs 400 people in Asia, intends to increase its number of
client advisors in the region by 40 percent this year and next,
after growing at a similar pace in 2009, Douglas Wurth, chief
executive officer for international private banking at New York-
based JPMorgan, said in an interview. </p>
<p>JPMorgan aims to generate about half of its non-U.S.
business from Asia, up from the current 20 percent, according to
Wurth, who moved to Hong Kong in February from New York. Rivals
including UBS AG are also expanding in the region, where assets
of millionaires grew 31 percent in 2009, according to a June
report by Capgemini SA and Bank of America Corp. </p>
<p>However excited one can be about the opportunities when
you''re in New York, that only magnifies ten-fold once you''re
here in Hong Kong, Singapore, Beijing, Jakarta, Wurth said in
Singapore yesterday. You just see up close and personal the
dynamic changes taking place. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s expansion comes after the number of millionaires
in the Asia-Pacific region reached 3 million in 2009, matching
those in Europe for the first time, according to the report by
Bank of America''s Merrill Lynch unit and Capgemini. The
millionaires'' assets rose 31 percent to $9.7 trillion, it said. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co.''s ABC, CBS Corp.
and other broadcasters sued Ivi, an online subscription service,
for streaming television programs over the Web without
authorization. </p>
<p>The companies, also including News Corp.''s Fox, General
Electric Co.''s NBC and the Public Broadcasting Service, today
accused Ivi and its founder Todd Weaver of copyright
infringement in a federal court complaint in New York. </p>
<p>Defendants have launched their infringing Internet TV
service to coincide with the start of the new fall television
season, the broadcasters said in the complaint. </p>
<p>Ivi, based in Seattle, began streaming TV stations there
and in New York 24 hours a day to Web subscribers worldwide on
Sept. 13, according to the lawsuit. Viewers would pay $4.99 a
month after a 30-day free trial, the complaint said.
Broadcasters have deals with companies including Hulu LLC,
Netflix Inc. and Apple Inc. to stream TV shows. Hulu''s owners
include NBC, Fox and ABC. </p>
<p>On Sept. 20, Ivi and Weaver filed suit in federal court in
Seattle seeking a ruling that Ivi isn''t infringing copyrights. </p>
<p>Big media is choosing to fight Internet delivery the same
way they fought against cable delivery and satellite delivery,
when in reality it is legal to retransmit, Weaver said in an
e-mail today. </p>
<p>Big Media'' </p>
<p>Broadcasters charge more in advertising due to the
increase in viewers, Weaver said. It is too bad big media
must fight innovation that is legal, pays them and increases
their revenue. </p>
<p>The broadcasters said that after they demanded that Ivi
stop streaming their stations, the company initially responded
that it was open to engaging in discussions to explore more
direct contractual agreements with certain plaintiffs. Ivi
sued several days later. </p>
<p>Major League Baseball, Univision, Telemundo, Cox Media,
Tribune Television, Fisher Broadcasting, WPIX, WGBH and WNET.org
are also plaintiffs in the New York suit. </p>
<p>Today''s case is WPIX Inc. v. Ivi Inc., 10-7415, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The

<p>(Corrects to say deal is sold in headline, first

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sold $14.5
million of so-called range accrual notes linked to interbank
lending rates and the yen, which reached a 15-year high versus
the dollar this month. </p>
<p>The sale includes a $9.5 million portion with a 15-year
maturity, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In the first
five years, the notes pay an annualized return of 8.5 percent
each day the six-month London interbank offered rate is below
6.5 percent and the dollar is worth more than 80 yen. After five
years, the Libor limit increases to 7 percent. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs also sold $5 million of 12-year notes that
pay a coupon of 7.2 percent if three-month Libor stays below 6.5
percent and the dollar is above 78 yen. </p>
<p>Both notes don''t pay any interest if Libor or the dollar
moves outside the notes'' ranges. The securities were issued at
100 percent of face value. </p>
<p>The yen rose 0.25 percent to 84.08 per dollar at 12:26 p.m.
in London. The Japanese currency strengthened to 82.88 on Sept.
15, its highest level against the dollar since May 1995. </p>
<p>Six-month Libor, an average of rates set daily by banks and
used as a borrowing benchmark, is 0.463 percent, the lowest
since April 19. The rate was last above 6.5 percent in December

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp.,
Royal Dutch Shell Plc and OAO Gazprom are among 13 companies

<p>Among the other companies registered to bid are Eni Spa,
Mitsubishi Corp. and Japan Petroleum Exploration Co., Abdul Hadi
al-Hassani, vice chairman of the parliament''s oil and gas
committee, said in an interview in Istanbul today. The bidding
round for gas rights is planned for Oct. 20 in Baghdad. </p>
<p>There is strong interest from the big majors, and this is
excellent, Hassani said. We care more about the fact that
big majors are interested, rather than in the number of
bidders. </p>
<p>Preparations for bidding are proceeding well and according

<p>Iraq, reliant on oil for most of its income, seeks foreign

<p>Oracle Corp. sued Micron Technology
Inc., alleging it overcharged Sun Microsystems Inc., which
Oracle acquired, by conspiring to fix prices for computer memory
chips. </p>
<p>Micron and other makers of dynamic random access memory, or
DRAM, artificially inflated the price of chips they sold to Sun,
Oracle claimed in an antitrust complaint filed Sept. 24 in
federal court in San Jose, California. </p>
<p>The case is partly based on a 2002 U.S. Justice Department
investigation of price fixing in the memory-chip industry that
led to claims against four companies and 16 people who have been
fined as much as $731 million. Micron cooperated with U.S.
officials in exchange for not being charged with a crime,
according to Oracle''s complaint. </p>
<p>The memory manufacturers conspired to control production
capacity, raise prices or slow their decline, allocate
customers, and otherwise unlawfully overcharge their DRAM
customers, Oracle said in its complaint. </p>
<p>Dan Francisco, a spokesman for Boise, Idaho-based Micron,
declined to comment. </p>
<p>Ichon, South Korea-based Hynix Semiconductor Inc., Suwon,
South Korea-based Samsung Electronics Co., Tokyo-based Elpida
Memory Inc. and Neubiberg, Germany-based Infineon Technologies
AG are indentified by Oracle as co-conspirators in the case.
Those companies aren''t named as defendants. </p>

<p>Lawsuits </p>
<p>JPMorgan Based Home Foreclosures on Faulty Court Documents </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. faces a legal challenge next month
that could cast doubt on thousands of foreclosures after a
mortgage executive at the bank said she didn''t verify documents
used to justify home seizures. </p>
<p>Lawyers for a Palm Beach County, Florida, homeowner asked a
judge to throw out a foreclosure as a penalty for misleading the
court, according to attorney Tom Ice of Ice Legal PA. They''re
citing a May 17 deposition in which the JPMorgan executive said
she signed thousands of affidavits and documents supporting the
New York-based bank''s claims without personally checking loan
records. The court is scheduled to hear arguments Oct. 19. </p>
<p>The Chase Home Finance operation supervisor, Beth Ann
Cottrell, said in May she was among eight managers who together
sign about 18,000 documents a month, according to a transcript
of her sworn deposition provided by Ice. Asked how they were
prepared, she said she relied on other people at the firm. </p>
<p>My review is more or less signing the document unless
it''s questionable, she said. That means, somebody has a
question and brings it to me and says, Beth, can you take a
look at this?'' </p>
<p>Inaccurate statements by banks in foreclosure documents may
give borrowers who have lost their homes a legal basis to
challenge the seizures, derailing resales and casting doubts on
property titles. A Florida court sanctioned Ally Financial
Inc.''s GMAC Mortgage unit for faulty affidavits in 2006, and the
firm suspended evictions in 23 states this month after finding
employees still signing affidavits without checking the data. </p>
<p>JPMorgan spokesman Tom Kelly declined to comment. Cottrell
didn''t return phone calls to her office requesting comment. A
lawyer representing her at the deposition, Joseph Mancilla of
the Florida Default Law Group PL, didn''t return calls. Cottrell
isn''t named as a defendant. </p>

<p>Potash Corp. Can Examine BHP Evidence U.S. Judge Says </p>
<p>Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. is entitled to
documentary evidence requested from BHP Billiton Ltd. in a
lawsuit in which the Canadian fertilizer company seeks to block
a $40 billion hostile takeover offer. </p>
<p>Unless BHP is prepared to extend the tender date, I''m not
going to stay discovery, U.S. District Judge David H. Coar in
Chicago told lawyers for both sides yesterday. BHP set a Nov. 18
deadline for Potash stockholders to accept its $130-a-share
offer. </p>
<p>The world''s largest fertilizer maker, Saskatoon-based
Potash sued BHP on Sept. 22, alleging that the company''s
executives made misleading public statements to drive down its
share value, increasing the likelihood of a successful bid. </p>
<p>Potash asked Coar for an order barring Melbourne-based BHP
from taking further steps to acquire its shares. It also asked
the judge to direct BHP to issue a corrective disclosure
statement, and to give Potash shareholders 60 days to consider
it. </p>
<p>Coar yesterday scheduled a hearing on the injunction
request for Nov. 4. </p>
<p>BHP, in a Sept. 24 court filing, called Potash''s demand
that it hand over large quantities of documents burdensome and a
fishing expedition and said the company waited too long to
make the request. </p>
<p>The company said Coar should deny the discovery demand
until he rules on a dismissal request the Australian company has
not yet submitted. </p>
<p>Coar yesterday told BHP attorney Michele Odorizzi that he
won''t set any dates concerning a dismissal motion until one is
actually filed. </p>
<p>He said the Potash evidence demand was overly broad and
that BHP would not be required to produce documentation until
the scope of that demand had been narrowed either by mutual
agreement or the direction of a federal magistrate judge. </p>
<p>We are pleased that the court has scheduled a hearing on
Nov. 4, well in advance of the Nov. 18 scheduled expiration of
our offer, BHP said in an e-mailed press statement after
yesterday''s court appearance. We believe the case is without
merit and we intend to contest it vigorously, including by
filing a motion to dismiss later this week. </p>
<p>Potash declined to comment on the court''s ruling. </p>
<p>The case is Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan v. BHP Billiton,
10-06024, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois
(Chicago). </p>
<p>BP''s Probation Over Fatal Texas Blast Won''t Be Revoked by U.S. </p>
<p>BP Plc''s probation for violating a plea deal that resolved
the company''s criminal liability for a fatal 2005 explosion at
its Texas City, Texas, refinery won''t be revoked by the U.S.
Justice Department. </p>
<p>After consulting with BP, regulators and blast victims,
prosecutors said they would give the company 18 more months to
complete required safety reviews and upgrades at the Texas
refinery, according to documents filed in federal court in
Houston. </p>
<p>The Department of Justice is not seeking a revocation or
extension of probation at this time, Daniel Dooher, a senior
trial attorney in the U.S. environmental crimes division, said
in a Sept. 8 letter to U.S. District Judge Lee Rosenthal. Dooher
said safety regulators and BP have executed a stipulation and
agreement resolving the allegations of non-compliance, which
includes an extension of BP''s deadline to complete the work
until March 12, 2012, the date its probation will expire. </p>
<p>BP Products North America, a unit of the London-based
company, agreed in March 2009 to pay a $50 million fine and
complete three years probation for violating U.S. air pollution
laws linked to the March 2005 explosion that killed 15 and
injured thousands. </p>
<p>BP''s plea deal required it to complete a review of
pressure-relief valves throughout its largest U.S. refinery and
complete installation of automated safety instrumentation, as
required by the company''s settlement with the U.S. Occupational
Safety and Health Administration. </p>
<p>Brent Coon, the lead lawyer for victims of the explosion,
called the government''s decision disappointing but not
surprising. He said yesterday in an e-mail that prosecutors
had told him they don''t want to reopen the case unless
negotiations with OSHA collapse. </p>
<p>Daren Beaudo, a BP spokesman, didn''t return a call and e-
mail seeking comment yesterday after regular business hours. </p>
<p>The 2005 explosion occurred when an octane-boosting unit
overflowed as it was being restarted, igniting a blast that
shattered windows five miles away. The U.S. Chemical Safety
Board found numerous safety lapses that rendered the plant a
catastrophe waiting to happen, according to John Bresland, the
board''s chairman. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. BP Products North America, 4:07-cr-
00434, U.S. District Courts, Southern District of Texas
(Houston). </p>
<p>Kerimov''s Assets Are Frozen in Second Court Order </p>
<p>A Cyprus court extended a freeze on Russian billionaire
Suleiman Kerimov''s assets, including stakes in mining company
OAO Polyus Gold and fertilizer maker OAO Uralkali. </p>
<p>The case, reviewed yesterday, will be heard again on Nov.
17, Nicosia District Court President Michalis Christodoulou said
at the court. A Sept. 17 order already banned Cyprus-registered
entities controlled by Kerimov from any transactions using
shares in Uralkali and Polyus. </p>
<p>The move follows a complaint against Kerimov by Ashot
Egiazaryan, a member of Russia''s lower house of parliament, who
claims Kerimov forced him to relinquish 25.5 percent of the
Moskva hotel near Moscow''s Red Square. Egiazaryan filed a
request for $2 billion in damages at the London Court of
International Arbitration on Sept. 13, according to court
documents in Cyprus. </p>
<p>A lawyer for Kerimov, Michael Stepek at Akin Gump Strauss
Hauer  Feld LLP in Geneva, would only say he was aware of the
Cypriot injunction. </p>
<p>Soteris Flourentzos and George Triantafyllides, lawyers who
represent five of Kerimov''s companies affected by the
injunction, had appealed against the Sept. 17 order. </p>
<p>Those five companies have been officially notified of the
court''s latest ruling, Andreas Chaviaras, Egiazaryan''s lawyer,
said yesterday. We have indications that also the remaining
companies have been notified, he said. </p>
<p>Kerimov, ranked by Finans magazine as Russia''s fourth-
richest man with a fortune of $14.5 billion, owns 37 percent of
Polyus, according to a July 2009 company filing, and 25 percent
of Uralkali. The stakes, of which part are pledged for bank
loans, are worth $3.4 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively,
Bloomberg calculations show. </p>

<p>Legal Reviews </p>
<p>Bar to GMAC/Ally Foreclosures Sought by Connecticut </p>
<p>Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said his
office is investigating defective foreclosure documents filed by
GMAC/Ally Finance Inc. and demanding that the company freeze
foreclosures in the state. </p>
<p>The GMAC/Ally foreclosure steamroller should be stopped
so the company can be held accountable, Blumenthal said
yesterday in a statement. My office has already confirmed that
some defective documents were filed in Connecticut. </p>
<p>Blumenthal''s action follows news of investigations by
Texas, Iowa and Illinois into mortgage practices at Ally.
California ordered the company to stop foreclosures until it can
prove it is complying with state law. </p>
<p>Ally, the Detroit-based auto and home lender, faces claims
that its GMAC unit evicted people from their homes without first
ensuring that the borrowers were in default or the firm had
legal standing to take possession of the homes. </p>
<p>GMAC Mortgage on Sept. 17 notified agents and brokers that
it was suspending evictions in 23 states. </p>
<p>New Suits </p>
<p>Pfizer Sues Novo Nordisk Over Insulin-Device Patent </p>
<p>Pfizer Inc., the world''s biggest drugmaker, sued Danish
competitor Novo Nordisk A/S in a U.K. court to invalidate its
patent for an injection mechanism that prevents overdoses. </p>
<p>Novo Nordisk''s European patent for the dose-setting device
is based on claims that weren''t new when the patent application
was filed, New York-based Pfizer said in a complaint in the High
Court in London. The suit, filed July 5 and made public this
week, didn''t say if Pfizer is using the technology. </p>
<p>We disagree with Pfizer''s claim and we will defend the
patent in court, Mike Rulis, a spokesman for Bagsvaerd,
Denmark-based Novo Nordisk, said yesterday in a phone interview. </p>
<p>Pfizer and Novo Nordisk, the world''s biggest maker of the
diabetes treatment insulin, have sparred over delivery methods
for the drug since at least 2005. The disputed patent concerns a
device that lets doctors set maximum dose limits to prevent the
visually impaired and other groups from using too much during
self injections. </p>
<p>Pfizer also sued Novo Nordisk in Switzerland over the same
patent, which expires in 2026, Pfizer spokeswoman Charlotte
Binstead said in an e-mailed statement. </p>

<p>Trials/Appeals </p>
<p>India Court Tells Authorities to Fix Vodafone Taxes </p>
<p>India''s Supreme Court gave the tax department four weeks to
fix the amount it''s claiming from Vodafone Group Plc on the
company''s purchase of Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.''s wireless assets
in the country. </p>
<p>A three-judge bench of India''s highest court headed by
Chief Justice S.H. Kapadia yesterday set Oct. 25 as the date for
its next hearing on an appeal by Vodafone of a lower court
ruling that upheld authorities'' right to claim the taxes. The
company may need to pay a part of the liability, estimated at
more than 120 billion rupees ($2.6 billion) including interest,
pending disposal of the case, the court indicated. </p>
<p>The Newbury, England-based company is appealing against the
Sept. 8 verdict of the Bombay High Court, which ruled
authorities have the jurisdiction to seek taxes from Vodafone
International Holdings BV on its 2007 purchase of Hutchison''s
Indian wireless operations. </p>
<p>The Supreme Court will now give a final take on the
Vodafone matter, Hitesh Jain, a partner at Mumbai-based law
firm ALMT Legal, said by telephone. It''s also one more forum
for Vodafone to debate the issue, to explain their position, so
it''s a positive development for the company. </p>
<p>The carrier firmly believes its acquisition isn''t
liable for tax in India, Vodafone said in an e-mail. The
transaction was between Netherlands-based Vodafone International
and Hong Kong-based Hutchison and the stake Vodafone acquired
was owned by a Cayman Islands-based holding company. </p>
<p>U.S. Urges Stem-Cell Funding Stay by Appeals Court </p>
<p>The U.S. Justice Department urged a federal appeals court
to maintain its stay on a lower-court order cutting off funds
for embryonic stem cell research while it seeks to overturn the
trial judge''s ruling. </p>
<p>A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia, after an hour-long hearing, didn''t say
when it would decide whether to make the emergency hold extend
through the appeal. The Obama administration attorneys argued
that even a temporary cutoff would cause irreparable harm to
researchers, taxpayers and scientific progress. </p>
<p>The appeals court ruled on Sept. 9 that the government can
keep funds flowing for the research at least during the initial
stages of the administration''s challenge to the order banning
taxpayer support for any activity using cells taken from human
embryos. </p>
<p>U.S. Judge Royce Lamberth last month cited the still-in-
force 1996 Dickey-Wicker Amendment in his ruling, saying
Congress prohibited funding any research in which a human embryo
was destroyed. </p>
<p>The decision will be made by Judith Rogers, appointed by
former President Bill Clinton, and Thomas Griffith and Brett
Kavanaugh, both appointed by former President George W. Bush. </p>
<p>Beth Brinkmann, an attorney for the Justice Department,
told the panel that cutting off funding would waste millions of
dollars in already earmarked grants and force scientists to
start research over should Lamberth''s ruling ultimately be
overturned,. </p>
<p>We''re not here to decide upon the wisdom of the
government policy, said Griffith. Rather, the court is
deciding whether the funding violates the statute. </p>
<p>Thomas Hungar, an attorney for stem-cell research
opponents, said government attorneys are only speculating on the
potential harm, and no injury is imminent or irreversible. </p>
<p>The case is Sherley v. Sebelius, 10-5287, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia (Washington). </p>

<p>A group of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
traders in the U.S. is being pursued by at least three competing
firms including Avenue Capital Group as the investment bank
prepares to break up the unit, according to two people briefed
on the discussions. </p>
<p>Marc Lasry, founder of Avenue Capital, is courting the
Goldman Sachs team run by Bob Howard to expand his New York-
based firm beyond its focus on distressed and credit investing,
the people, who asked not to be named because the talks are
private, said yesterday. He''s vying with buyout firm KKR  Co.
and investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners LP, which also are
negotiating with Howard, people with knowledge of the matter
said Sept. 8. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is disbanding the principal-strategies
business to comply with new U.S. rules aimed at curbing risk.
Members of the unit, which uses multiple strategies to make bets
with the New York-based firm''s own money, could go their own way
if an agreement isn''t reached soon, said Robert Olman, president
of Alpha Search Advisory Partners, a recruitment firm based in
Roslyn, New York. </p>
<p>The longer it takes to work out a deal, the more likely
that members of the team will work something out for themselves
elsewhere, Olman said. </p>
<p>Lasry, 51, declined to comment, as did Ed Canaday, a
spokesman for Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>Avenue Capital was founded by Lasry and Sonia Gardner in
1995 and managed $18.8 billion at the end of July, according to
its website. The firm says it has more than 300 employees. </p>
<p>Post-Goldman Options </p>
<p>The Goldman Sachs group is led globally by Hong Kong-based
Morgan Sze, who may start his own hedge fund focused on Asia,
two people with knowledge of the matter said earlier this month.
Sze in March replaced Pierre-Henri Flamand, the former global
head who left to set up a London-based hedge fund called Edoma
Capital Partners LLP. </p>
<p>Some of the principal strategies group''s traders and
support staff may get roles at Goldman Sachs or seek jobs
independently, the people said. </p>
<p>BlackRock Inc., the world''s biggest asset manager, also
held talks to hire one or more people from the Goldman Sachs
group, a person with knowledge of the talks said earlier this
month. </p>

<p>An experimental arthritis drug from
Pfizer Inc. reduced pain more than researchers anticipated,
doctors said. It also allowed previously hobbled patients to
overuse and permanently damage their joints. </p>
<p>Bone destruction developed in 16 of 6,800 patients taking
the medicine, tanezumab, as part of Pfizer''s development
program, and they all needed a complete joint replacement for
the affected knee, hip or shoulder, according to a report in the
New England Journal of Medicine. Pain-free patients may have put
excessive pressure on their fragile joints because they weren''t
getting natural pain signals to take it easy, said the lead
researcher, Nancy Lane. </p>
<p>This is more potent than any pain medication I have ever
had in arthritis, said Lane, director of the Center for Aging
at the University of California at Davis School of Medicine in
Sacramento, in a telephone interview. Because this is a new
chapter in controlling pain, we didn''t realize we needed to
counsel our patients in using their joints that were still
diseased. Now we need to figure out how to use it so the risks
don''t outweigh the benefits. </p>
<p>New York-based Pfizer halted studies of the drug for
osteoarthritis, chronic back pain and diabetes-related nerve
disorders at the request of U.S. regulators in June and July.
The market potential for tanezumab and similar medicines was
estimated at $11 billion, Catherine Arnold, a New York-based
managing director at Credit Suisse, wrote in a May 3 note to
investors before the drug problems emerged. </p>
<p>Talking with FDA </p>
<p>Pfizer is discussing tanezumab''s development program with
officials at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, said MacKay
Jimeson, a company spokesman. The definitive cause of the
complication hasn''t been determined. </p>
<p>Studies of the drug in patients with cancer pain and
chronic pancreatitis are under way. Publication of the paper
underscores the scientific interest in finding new methods to
treat pain, Jimeson said. </p>
<p>Lane''s group studied 450 patients with moderate to severe
osteoarthritis, a disease of the cartilage that protects the
ends of bones in a joint. The tissue absorbs the impact from
movement and allows the bones to slide along each other with
less friction. For 27 million Americans with osteoarthritis, the
cartilage wears away, causing pain and swelling and limiting
motion. </p>
<p>Patients in the study received an injection of tanezumab or
placebo on the first day and during the eighth week of
treatment. Almost half of the patients were already candidates
for joint replacement because of damage. Reduction in knee pain
ranged from 45 percent to 62 percent in those given the Pfizer
drug, depending on the dose, compared with 22 percent for those
given placebo. </p>
<p>Side Effects </p>
<p>The most common side effects were headaches, colds and
numbness or tingling of the skin. </p>
<p>The findings, from the second of three stages needed for
regulatory approval, prompted Pfizer to move the medicine into
final studies. It was in those 13 trials involving 9,100
patients that the rapid progression of arthritis occurred in 16
people, triggering regulators to put the research on hold. </p>
<p>Pain has an important role in the avoidance of self-harm,
but chronic inflammatory pain has generally been considered to
be wholly undesirable, said John Wood, professor of
neurobiology at University College London, in an editorial that
accompanied the research. The study by Lane et al. suggests
that a complete quenching of pain in patients with
osteoarthritis may not necessarily be a good thing. </p>
<p>Different Joint </p>
<p>For more than half of the 16 patients, worsening arthritis
and the need for surgery occurred in a joint other than the one
originally targeted in the study, the researchers said. One
patient developed a problem in the shoulder, an uncommon
location for damage from osteoarthritis. </p>
<p>Tanezumab, a nerve growth factor inhibitor, was considered
one of Pfizer''s most promising compounds in development. </p>
<p>Similar treatments are in early stages of development at
Johnson  Johnson of New Brunswick, New Jersey; Regeneron
Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Tarrytown, New York; Sanofi-Aventis SA
of Paris; Abbott Laboratories of Abbott Park, Illinois; and
AstraZeneca Plc of London, Lane said. </p>
<p>I''ve never worked with anything that''s been this good for
pain, Lane said. I''m not saying it''s perfect, but it is a
game changer, provided we learn how to use it. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which
agreed in July to pay $550 million to settle a U.S. regulator''s
fraud suit, rolled out an advertising campaign today with ads
that emphasize the firm''s role in alternative energy and job
creation. </p>
<p>The ads began in the New York Times and the Wall Street
Journal and will extend to other national, regional and local
newspapers during the next few months, said David Wells, a
spokesman for the New York firm. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the most profitable U.S. securities firm in
Wall Street history, is trying to repair a reputation tarnished
by the Securities and Exchange Commission''s suit and an April
U.S. Senate hearing at which it was accused of betting against
the investments sold to clients. The ads will feature different
descriptions of the firm''s business and also appear on the
Internet. </p>
<p>We''re expanding our communication to a broader audience
in an effort to promote a better understanding of who we are and
what we do, Wells said. The ads show how we support our
clients, including corporations, municipalities, institutions
and individuals. </p>
<p>In today''s full-page ads, a photo of a field of wind
turbines under a cloudy sky is juxtaposed with a picture of a
smiling man in a hard hat and work clothes. The ad, carrying the
tag line Progress is Everyone''s Business, describes how the
firm helped an unidentified renewable energy company find
investors, enabling it to expand and create jobs. </p>
<p>Mealy-Mouthed'' </p>
<p>It''s like they''re apologizing for being bad boys,
said Jerry Della Femina, chairman and chief executive officer of
Della Femina/Jeary and Partners in New York, who has worked in
the ad industry since the 1960s. The ad is too weak, too
wimpy, too mealy-mouthed, he said. </p>
<p>The people who don''t like them and the people who don''t
respect them are not going to have their opinion changed by
looking at this, he said. The people who do like them and
respect them may see them as a bit diminished. </p>
<p>Wells declined to disclose the budget for the campaign,
which is being handled by Young  Rubicam Inc., a division of
Dublin-based WPP Plc. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs shares fell $2.30, or 1.6 percent, to $142.71
at 10 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. They

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is seeking
to reap HK$15.9 billion ($2.05 billion) from selling shares in
Industrial  Commercial Bank of China Ltd. in a transaction that
would give it a fourfold return on its 2006 investment. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is offering 2.75 billion shares at HK$5.70 to
HK$5.79 apiece, according to a term sheet for the proposed sale.
The offer represents a discount of as much as 4.5 percent from
the closing price in Hong Kong today for the world''s largest
lender by market value. </p>
<p>The sale follows Goldman Sachs''s disposal of an almost
$2 billion stake in ICBC in June 2009, when it offloaded the
shares it was free to divest as it repaid bailout funds to the
U.S. government. The New York-based lender will hold a stake
worth about $8 billion in Beijing-based ICBC following the
latest transaction, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Shares of ICBC have slumped 7.3 percent in Hong Kong
trading this year, compared with a 2.3 percent gain in the
benchmark Hang Seng Index. Edward Naylor, a Hong Kong-based
spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs bought 4.9 percent of ICBC for about $2.59
billion in 2006, when the U.S. bank invested $940 million and
funds managed by the company paid about $1.65 billion for stakes
in ICBC, according to a regulatory filing. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest

for the Americas, as global head of legal. </p>
<p>Grossman will oversee all of the firm''s advisory law and
litigation in the newly created position, according to an
internal memo from Frank Barron, who joined the New York-based

<p>Grossman, who also previously was global head of litigation
and general counsel for Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, was named
to the firm''s management committee in July. He joined the
company in 2006 shortly after Gary Lynch, who he had worked for
at Davis Polk  Wardwell LLP, became Morgan Stanley''s chief
legal officer. Grossman had been a candidate to replace Lynch, a
person briefed on the matter said in February. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley also named Anne Cooney general counsel of
its brokerage unit, according to the memo. Cooney had previously
been Morgan Stanley Smith Barney''s deputy general counsel. Jim Mangan and Scott Tucker were named co-heads of litigation,
according to the memo. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley had its third-
quarter earnings estimates cut by Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
analysts, who cited soft revenue from the firm''s fixed-
income, currency and commodities and equities divisions. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s earnings-per-share estimate was reduced to
15 cents from 60 cents, analysts led by Richard Ramsden said in
a note to clients dated yesterday. The analysts kept their
neutral recommendation on the stock. </p>
<p>Investment bank earnings are likely to be soft in the
third quarter 2010, as evidenced by Jefferies'' shortfall last
week, the analysts said. The largest adjustments are due to
muted activity in fixed income and equities, they said. </p>
<p>Jefferies Group Inc., the first Wall Street firm to release
third-quarter results, said Sept. 22 that revenue from trading
stocks and bonds dropped 51 percent in the three months though
August. Industry-wide bond-trading volume declined 12 percent in
the period, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system
of the Financial Regulatory Authority. </p>
<p>The analysts also said it''s hard to gauge the impact of
implementing the Basel capital accords, in particular how the

<p>Chevron Corp.''s Kazakh oil venture,
the country''s biggest exporter of the fuel, more than doubled
crude extraction tax payments as the government seeks a larger
share of resource revenue. </p>
<p>TengizChevroil paid 245.2 billion tenge ($1.7 billion) in
the first seven months, compared with 122 billion tenge in all
of 2009, according to data published on the Finance Ministry''s
Tax Committee website, without elaboration. </p>
<p>Kazakhstan, which holds 3 percent of the world''s oil
reserves according to BP Plc, introduced the extraction tax,
replacing royalty payments, to boost revenue and narrow a budget
deficit. The government started levying export taxes on crude
oil from the venture led by Chevron, in the government''s latest
effort to gain more from the country''s energy wealth. The
Central Asian nation raised the oil export tax to $20 a metric
ton ($2.73 a barrel) in August and plans to double that to $40
starting next year. </p>
<p>TengizChevroil increased oil production to 12.5 million
tons in the first half, more than a half of the 22.5 million
tons it produced in 2009, the company said on its website. </p>
<p>The venture''s total tax burden rose to 514 billion tenge
through July from 452 billion tenge in all of 2009, the tax
committee said. The venture paid 248 billion tenge in corporate
income tax, compared with 294 billion tenge for all of 2009,
according to the statement. </p>
<p>Linsi Crain, an Atyrau-based spokeswoman for TengizChevroil
wasn''t immediately available for comment. Raikhan Sharipova, a
spokeswoman for tax committee, declined to comment immediately. </p>
<p>Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, holds 50 percent
of TengizChevroil. Exxon Mobil Corp. has 25 percent, state-run
KazMunaiGaz National Co. owns 20 percent and Lukarco, owned by
Russia''s OAO Lukoil, 5 percent. </p>

<p>The U.S. House of Representatives''
measure passed yesterday, aimed at pushing up the value of the
yuan, is bad politics and bad economics, said Stephen S. Roach, non-executive chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia. </p>
<p>It''s an important step on the road to a very
confrontational approach between Washington and China, Roach
said today on Bloomberg Radio''s Bloomberg Surveillance with
Tom Keene. It''s bad politics, it''s bad economics, it''s not the
right way to deal with this. </p>
<p>The House of Representatives voted yesterday for a measure
that would let domestic companies petition for duties on Chinese
imports to compensate for the effect of a weak yuan. Roach said
the currency charge against China was ridiculous, and its
government has said the legislation would do nothing to cut the
U.S. trade deficit and would only risk harming growth. </p>
<p>Why can''t we rise to the competitive challenge as we have
always done in the past rather than go after them with some
ridiculous currency charge, Roach said. This is not a good
approach for an American economy that needs jobs. We''re going at
this the wrong way. </p>
<p>China, the U.S.''s third largest export market, should be
encouraged to boost private consumption, said Roach, who added
this could be a huge opportunity for the U.S. </p>
<p>The U.S. is enduring persistently high unemployment and a
surge this year in the trade deficit with China, which rose 27
percent to $25.9 billion in July from a year ago. </p>
<p>The big issue in America is jobs, Roach said. If we
can drive exports into that market that''s how we can compete and
grow ourselves. </p>
<p>The issue may become a point of contention at the meeting
of Group of 20 nations leaders in Seoul in November, Roach said. </p>
<p>When you have a tough global environment, nobody wants
their currency to get stronger, he said. It''s going to be a
pretty contentious debate. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. leapfrogged
six competitors including Bank of America Corp. to become this
year''s top underwriter for California technology companies, amid
a jump in borrowing for acquisitions and stock buybacks. </p>
<p>JPMorgan has underwritten $3.08 billion in bonds for the
state''s computer and software makers, winning a 31 percent
share, the largest controlled by a firm since 2007, when it and
Citigroup Inc. split about 80 percent of the market, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. JPMorgan was in a sixth-place tie in
2008 and tied for seventh in 2009. </p>
<p>Borrowing by companies including Hewlett-Packard Co. and
Adobe Systems Inc. has climbed this year as they seek growth and
look to shore up stock prices after the economic slump. The New
York-based bank, traditionally the national leader in corporate
debt underwriting, is winning business in the state after
navigating the global credit crisis without a quarterly loss. </p>
<p>JPMorgan came out of the financial crisis with a much
stronger franchise in investment banking, partly because of its
acquisition of Bear Stearns, but also because of the strength of
its balance sheet and management, Darrell Duffie, a Stanford
University professor of finance, said in an e-mail. These
days, no corporate CFO would ever be criticized by the board or
CEO for choosing JPMorgan as its underwriter. </p>
<p>Citigroup, based in New York, ranks second in California
this year through Sept. 15 after underwriting $1.55 billion,
Bloomberg data show. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of
America is third with $1.38 billion. </p>
<p>Marketing Advantage </p>
<p>Richard Bove, an analyst at Rochdale Securities in Lutz,
Florida, said underwriters rely on high rankings to win more
business. </p>
<p>Being No. 1 is very important in a given sector, Bove
said in a phone interview. They go out and say, We''re on top,
and therefore you should do business with us.'' It''s a major part
of the marketing approach that they use. </p>
<p>Justin Perras, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment.
Citigroup spokeswoman Danielle Romero-Apsilos and Bank of
America spokesman Kerrie McHugh also declined to comment. </p>
<p>Borrowing by California technology companies slumped last
year as they shored up their balance sheets and reduced debt
levels in the wake of the credit crisis. Yields on investment-
grade corporate bonds are now the lowest since daily records
began on Oct. 31, 1986, and companies are borrowing again. </p>
<p>More Acquisitions </p>
<p>The 159 acquisitions announced by those companies this year
total $16.7 billion, according to Bloomberg data. That compares
with 152 deals worth $14.6 billion in the same period last year. </p>
<p>At today''s interest rates, financing debt can make more
sense than spending cash, said Mark MacLennan, head of corporate
finance for Santa Clara, California-based Silicon Valley Bank. </p>
<p>A lot of companies are sitting on huge cash reserves, but
one thing you need to analyze is, where are those cash
reserves? he said. Are they domestic cash or foreign cash
that might have tax ramifications if you repatriate it? </p>
<p>Microsoft Corp., the world''s largest software maker, sold
$4.75 billion of bonds earlier this month and may use the
proceeds to fund stock buybacks and acquisitions, the company
said Sept. 22 in a regulatory filing. The company plans to pay
for dividends and stock repurchases because much of its cash is
held overseas, a person familiar with the matter said earlier
this month. Microsoft would have to pay taxes if it brought cash
held abroad to the U.S. </p>
<p>HP''s Debt </p>
<p>HP, the largest personal computer maker, issued debt
through JPMorgan this month totaling about $3 billion. Gina Tyler, a spokeswoman for HP, declined to comment on why it chose
the bank, saying the company doesn''t talk about outside vendors. </p>
<p>Palo Alto-based HP announced plans to acquire Palm Inc. for
$1.2 billion in April, followed by 3Par Inc. for $2.35 billion
and ArcSight Inc. for $1.5 billion this month. </p>
<p>Other companies are plowing money raised into their own
stock, MacLennan said. </p>
<p>Companies'' perceptions are that their shares are probably
on the cheap side, debt interest rates are definitely on the
cheap side, and why not use that to buy back shares or potential
acquisitions? he said. </p>
<p>U.S. companies have announced $258 billion in buybacks
through Sept. 20, compared with $52 billion in the first three
quarters of 2009, according to data compiled by Birinyi
Associates Inc. The almost fivefold increase is the largest for
any January-to-September period since at least 2000, when the
Westport, Connecticut-based research firm started tracking the
data. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is the largest underwriter of U.S. bonds, with 699
issues this year totaling $171 billion. The bank also held the
top spot in 2009 and 2008, according to Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>The bank has underwritten 11 debt issues this year for
California-based technology companies, including Adobe, Advanced
Micro Devices Inc., Brocade Communications Systems Inc., Maxim
Integrated Products Inc. and Oracle Corp. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most
profitable U.S. securities firm in history, granted stock awards
to its most senior bankers in London after the U.K. government
imposed a one-time tax on bonuses last year, a person briefed on
the discussions said. </p>
<p>The payments were made in about August and were approved by
the U.K.''s Financial Services Authority, said the person, who
declined to be identified as the details are private. The bank
has fewer than 100 partners in London, the person said. A
spokeswoman for the financial watchdog and officials at Goldman
Sachs in London declined to comment. </p>
<p>Ministers from both the coalition''s Conservative and
Liberal Democrat parties have urged banks to curb bonuses
following the credit crisis. Business Secretary Vince Cable told
party activists this month banks face an enormous kickback
from lawmakers if they pay out large bonuses this year. </p>
<p>Banks will take whatever steps they deem as being
commercially necessary to make sure they keep the people they
need to make money, said Chris Roebuck, a visiting professor
at the Cass Business School in London. These are the tricks of
the trade. </p>
<p>The shares can''t be sold for five years and may be clawed
back depending on the bank''s performance, according to Sky News,
which first reported the payments. The awards may be worth in
the high tens of millions of pounds, Sky News reported, citing
unidentified people close to Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>Ad Campaign </p>
<p>The bank, which agreed in July to pay $550 million to
settle a U.S. regulator''s fraud suit, this week rolled out an
advertising campaign that sought to emphasize the firm''s role in
alternative energy and job creation. </p>
<p>The 50 percent levy on discretionary bonus payments of more
than 25,000 pounds ($40,000) raised 3.5 billion pounds for the
Treasury, according to government figures published this month.
That''s 1 billion pounds more than Chancellor of the Exchequer
George Osborne estimated in June. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs said in July the U.K. bonus tax cost it about
$600 million. The firm set aside $9.3 billion to pay its 34,100
employees worldwide in the first half of the year, or an average
of $272,580 per person. That compares with $11.4 billion in the
first half of 2009, which equated to $364,134 for each of the
firm''s 31,200 employees at the time. </p>

<p>Midwest refiners replenishing
inventories after the Sept. 27 restart of Enbridge Energy
Partners LP''s Line 6B may extend an eight-week decline in
Cushing, Oklahoma, stockpiles, according to JPMorgan analysts. </p>
<p>The pipeline was shut after it ruptured July 26, curtailing
heavy crude shipments to refineries in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and
Ontario. As repairs continue, the link is transporting about
245,000 barrels a day, compared with its capacity of 283,000
barrels, Terri Larson, an Enbridge spokeswoman, said in an e-
mail yesterday. </p>
<p>In the very short term, the restart of Enbridge Line 6B
could accentuate the drawdown trend in Cushing as flows are
directed to the refineries affected by the line outage,
Lawrence Eagles, head of commodities research at JPMorgan Chase
 Co., said in a note to clients. </p>
<p>Inventories at Cushing, Oklahoma, where the New York
Mercantile Exchange crude futures contract is delivered, have
declined for eight consecutive weeks to 34.3 million barrels
last week, from 37.8 million July 30, according to the Energy
Department. </p>
<p>Despite refinery maintenance picking up, it is going to
be harder for inventories to reach capacity before restarts
begin in earnest in November, the analysts wrote. </p>
<p>Refiners conduct overhauls and work on equipment following
the summer driving season when demand traditionally peaks. </p>
<p>Oil for November delivery rose 90 cents, or 1.1 percent, to
$80.87 a barrel at 10:07 a.m. on the Nymex. The discount of
November futures versus the December contract narrowed 8 cents
to 90 cents a barrel. The gap has narrowed from $1.75 on Sept.
17. The discount, known as contango, encourages traders to buy
oil for nearby delivery and store it to sell at a later date. </p>
<p>Spreads already reflect a much higher level of inventory
than is currently in place, but reaching 37 million barrels by
the end of October will be a tough ask, analysts wrote. </p>
<p>Line 6B is a 30-inch pipeline that carries heavy crude oil
from Griffith, Indiana, to Sarnia, Ontario. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. named Playdom Chief
Executive Officer John Pleasants and James Pitaro, head of
Yahoo! Inc.''s media unit, co-presidents of the interactive media
group, revamping digital operations to reverse losses. </p>
<p>The pair replace Steve Wadsworth, a 17-year Disney division
head who left in September, the company said today in a
statement. Pleasants and Pitaro, who start Oct. 18, will oversee
the unit focused on the digital-games market and selling online
sites based on Disney''s TV shows, movies and characters. </p>
<p>The appointments will allow Disney, world''s largest media
company, to build upon the digital assets acquired in the past
three years, Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger said. The
interactive business lost $130 million through the first nine
months of the year, making it the only unprofitable division. </p>
<p>We see this as a growth area and we need people
experienced in how to best operate them, Iger, 59, said in an
interview today. </p>
<p>Disney, based in Burbank, California, rose 24 cents to
$33.34 on Oct. 1. The shares have gained 22 percent during the
past year, compared with an 11 percent increase for the Standard
 Poor''s 500 Index. </p>
<p>In 2007, Disney bought children''s social network Club
Penguin for $350 million, following that this July with social-
gaming site Playdom, paying $563 million. The company also has
bought Wideload Games and mobile-content site Tapulous. </p>
<p>Iger said he intends to allow the two men freedom to
run the units, and Pleasants will keep working from Playdom''s
office in Palo Alto, California. Iger described the arrangement
as similar to Disney''s acquisition of Pixar, which operates
mostly independently of Disney''s film studio. </p>
<p>Pleasants, a former CEO at Ticketmaster, will oversee
Playdom, Disney''s Club Penguin, the World of Cars virtual unit
and Tapulous. Pitaro will run Disney.com, Family.com, and its
social-media marketing agency DigiSynd. At Yahoo, Pitaro
expanded Yahoo! Sports and upgraded its news, finance,
entertainment and lifestyle coverage, Disney said. </p>
