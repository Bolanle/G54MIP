<p>An International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) shareholder withdrew a lawsuit claiming the company''s
cooperation with a National Security Agency eavesdropping
program caused a drop in its China sales. </p>
<p>The Louisiana Sheriffs'' Pension and Relief Fund dropped the
securities fraud suit after investigating its claims against
IBM, lawyers for the fund said in a letter to U.S. District
Judge Denise Cote made public today. </p>
<p>The decision was based on new information that wasn''t
available earlier, John C. Browne, a lawyer for the fund, said
in a telephone interview today. </p>
<p>IBM, which had criticized the suit as pushing a wild
conspiracy theory, said the fund did the right thing. </p>
<p>At the time this suit was filed, we said the complaint
proceeded to make numerous specious and false accusations, and
IBM called upon the law firm that filed this action to do the
right thing and dismiss it, Doug Shelton, an IBM spokesman,
said in an e-mailed statement today. </p>
<p>IBM, the largest computer-services provider, reported a 22
percent drop in sales in China on Oct. 16 compared with the
previous quarter as a result of disclosures by Edward Snowden
that the company was cooperating with the NSA, the Louisiana
fund said in the complaint. </p>
<p>Snowden, now living in Russia, had revealed details of an
NSA surveillance program showing that technology companies were
providing data at the request of government agencies. IBM in
March said it hadn''t disclosed client data to the U.S.
government. </p>
<p>The Louisiana fund said it pays retirement, death and
disability benefits to more than 20,000 active and retired
employees of sheriffs'' offices across the state. </p>
<p>The case is Louisiana Sheriffs'' Pension  Relief Fund v.
International Business Machines Corp., 13-cv-08818, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Since Ian Read became Pfizer Inc.''s
leader, he''s shed two non-drug businesses, reorganized the
company into three separate units and pursued the largest merger
in the history of the pharmaceutical industry. </p>
<p>Now, even with AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) in his sights as a takeover
target, Read said he could theoretically see a time in the
future when Pfizer splits into two parts to boost investor
value, potentially making a proposed mega-company short lived. </p>
<p>We''re not talking about a three or four-way split, we''re
talking about two major segments, said Read, 60, a native of
Scotland who started his career at Pfizer as an accountant and
became chief executive officer in 2010, </p>
<p>Pfizer never really thought of itself as three businesses,
Read said on a conference call with investors and analysts
today. It''s a shift from last year, when the company began
dividing the company into three units, each with its own leader.
Read emphasized he''s made no decision about a breakup. </p>
<p>Pfizer shares fell 2.6 percent to $29.96 at the close in
New York. The stock had gained 3.5 percent in the last 12
months, the worst performance of any major brand drugmaker on
the Standard  Poor''s 500 Pharmaceutical Index of 13 companies. </p>
<p>Pfizer last week offered about $106 billion to buy
AstraZeneca Plc, a bid that was promptly dismissed by the
London-based company. Along with the lower tax rate linked to
AstraZeneca''s U.K. base, Read has said the acquisition would
give New York-based Pfizer a promising new generation of
experimental cancer drugs that use the body''s own immune system
to attack the disease. </p>
<h2>Seeking Efficiency </h2>
<p>Being bigger would also help Pfizer be more efficient,
strengthen it in key drug development areas, and give the
company more leverage against the governments and insurers
buying its products, he said during the call. </p>
<p>Immune-oncology is exciting, it''s something to hang your
hat on. But the tax stuff and the synergies are really where
this lies, said Judson Clark, an analyst with Edward Jones 
Co.  based in Des Peres, Missouri. </p>
<p>The deal to buy AstraZeneca is being looked at closely by
the U.K. government, over concerns it could reduce British
pharmaceutical industry jobs. </p>
<p>So far, it hasn''t attracted nearly the same level of
scrutiny in the U.S., where Read has said Pfizer will largely
keep its operating headquarters even as it moves its legal
residence to the U.K. for the lower tax rate. We clearly will
stay with a massive presence in the U.S. with a combined
company, he said. </p>
<p>Read declined to say when or if Pfizer might take its case
directly to AstraZeneca shareholders in a hostile takeover
attempt, though he hinted they might. </p>
<h2>Considering Options'' </h2>
<p>We are very disappointed with their unwillingness to
engage in conversations and believe it is in the best interests
of both companies and AstraZeneca and Pfizer shareholders that
we pursue a friendly negotiated transaction, Read said. We
are considering our options on how we progress these
discussions. </p>
<p>Two units inside Pfizer makes more sense than three, with
half the company focused on brand-name drugs while the other
part focuses on older products, Clark said. </p>
<p>It calls in the question why restructure into three unit
instead of two in the first place, Clark said by telephone.
They''re tacking a bit more toward the center if they do
acquire AstraZeneca. </p>
<p>Read''s comment followed a first-quarter report in which the
company''s profit beat analysts estimates while revenue fell
short of analyst expectations. </p>
<h2>Estimates Beat </h2>
<p>Earnings excluding one-time items were 57 cents a share, 2
cents above the average of 12 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Revenue fell 9 percent to $11.4 billion as foreign exchange
rates reduced sales by 3 percent, the company said in a
statement today. Analysts expected $12.1 billion. </p>
<p>Overall, a weak quarter with disappointing revenues,
said Timothy Anderson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein 
Co., who called it a low-quality beat of earnings estimates. </p>
<p>First-quarter net income fell 15 percent to $2.33 billion,
or 36 cents, from $2.75 billion, or 38 cents, the company said.
Pfizer said it would change its full-year earnings outlook,
though wasn''t permitted to do so now because of rules
surrounding its offer to buy the U.K. drugmaker. </p>
<p>Pfizer for the first time broke out separate financial
results for the three units. Total first-quarter drug sales fell
9 percent to $10.5 billion from a year earlier. Sales of
Prevnar, Pfizer''s pneumonia vaccine, were little changed at $927
million. Viagra, a pill for erectile dysfunction, had sales that
dropped 19 percent to $374 million. </p>
<p>The quarter''s results were helped by a 11 percent reduction
in cost of sales, which fell to $2.05 billion. Administrative
expenses declined 6 percent to $3.04 billion, and research-and-development spending decreased 5 percent to $1.62 billion. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest U.S.
bank by assets, sees no signs of a bubble in emerging-market
corporate debt, challenging the International Monetary Fund''s
warning on rising risks in the bond market. </p>
<p>Bonds sold by developing-country companies account for just
3 percent of gross domestic product in these economies, compared
with 35 percent in the U.S., according to Joyce Chang, global
head of research at the New York-based bank. Most of the lenders
selling debt are rated investment grade or backed by their
governments while maturities have been extended, she said in a
May 2 interview. </p>
<p>The IMF warned last month that some emerging-market
companies are vulnerable to capital flight if global borrowing
costs rise further as the Federal Reserve gradually withdraws
its expansionary monetary polices. Corporate debt for developing
countries tracked by Bank of America Corp. surged to $1.1
trillion from $411 billion at the end of 2009 as companies took
advantage of low interest rates to raise cash. </p>
<p>I would reallychallenge some of the views fromofficial
creditors that emerging-market corporate debt isthe next asset
bubble, Chang, who was promoted from head of fixed-income
research last month amid a leadership reshuffle in the global
banking division, said in New York. Thecreditquality of
emerging-marketissuancehas been prettygood. </p>
<p>Olga Stankova, a spokeswoman for the IMF, didn''t respond to
a phone call and an e-mail seeking comment. </p>
<h2>Crisis Catalyst </h2>
<p>Growth of emerging-market bonds is mostly driven by supply-demand imbalances rather than speculation, Chang said. </p>
<p>The rise of developing-country debt has happened after the
supply of fixed-income products from mature markets shrank
following the 2008 global financial crisis, according to Chang. </p>
<p>At the same time, banks, pension funds and insurance
companies are required to hold more bonds in their investment
portfolio as part of tighter financial regulation, boosting the
demand for emerging-market securities, she said. </p>
<p>You have a structural shift in the market with a supply
and demand imbalance and emerging marketshave benefited from
the lack of alternative investment opportunities, Chang said.
Theincrease in issuance is obviously something to flag, but
then you have to look at whetherthe issuance isshort-term debt
for refinancing.EM issuance is the longest duration within
fixed income and EM is not facing a wall of maturities. </p>
<p>The IMF said on April 9 in a report that corporate bonds of
developing nations are vulnerable in an environment of rising
global interest rates and slower growth prospects. About $740
billion, or 35 percent of emerging-market outstanding debt, may
be at risk of default in a scenario involving a 25 percent
increase in borrowing costs and a 25 percent drop in corporate
earnings, according to the Washington-based fund. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s Corporate EMBI Broad Diversified Index returned
3.8 percent this year through May 2. The gauge lost 0.6 percent
last year, the first annual decline since 2008. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) led shares of
Wall Street banks lower, dropping the most in almost a month,
after warning that a deepening trading slump may last through
the second quarter. </p>
<p>Shares of the company fell 2.7 percent to $54.08 at 9:58
a.m., the worst performance in the 83-company Standard  Poor''s
500 Financials Index. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
Citigroup Inc. (C) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) all lost at least 1.3
percent. </p>
<p>Fixed-income and equities trading revenue will fall about
20 percent from last year''s second quarter, New York-based
JPMorgan said in a regulatory filing after the market closed
last week. The firm blamed a continued challenging environment
and lower client activity levels. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 58, was the first head
of a major U.S. bank to warn investors this year that trading
was down, saying in February that revenue had fallen 15 percent.
A 20 percent slide from the $5.37 billion posted in last year''s
second quarter would mean about $4.3 billion from the trading
business this period. That would mark the company''s worst first
half in trading since the financial crisis. </p>
<p>The division''s actual results will hinge on its performance
during remaining months in the quarter, which can be
volatile, the company said. </p>
<p>Analysts have cited the Federal Reserve''s decision to slow
its bond-purchasing program for some of the decline, which
eroded first-quarter results at U.S. financial firms including
Bank of America and Goldman Sachs. </p>
<h2>Citigroup, Goldman </h2>
<p>We expect that the weakness JPM is experiencing in
trading-related revenues will be duplicated at other capital-markets-oriented banks, Charles Peabody, an analyst at
Portales Partners LLC, said today in a research note, referring
to the bank by its stock symbol. He singled out Citigroup and
Goldman Sachs as most likely to report weak trading results. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), which is concentrated more on equities than
bonds, was alone in registering a trading increase during the
first three months of 2014, though Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, 56, said she saw weakness ahead. </p>
<p>The volumes that we talked a lot about during the first
quarter -- lower activity -- we''re continuing to see that really
does persist into the second quarter, Porat said in a
Bloomberg Television interview last week. </p>
<p>JPMorgan gave forecasts on other business units. Mortgage
banking will post a pretax production loss of $100 million to
$150 million in the second quarter, driven by higher interest
rates, the bank said. Expenses will be lower than the $59
billion reported last year, according to the forecast. </p>
<p>First-quarter profit fell 19 percent to $5.27 billion,
driven by a 21 percent tumble in fixed-income trading, JPMorgan
said April 11. </p>

<p>Even after the longest run of gains in
16 months for Poland''s zloty bonds, BNP Paribas SA and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. say there''s still reason to be bullish. </p>
<p>Government debt returned 1 percent in April and 3.6 percent
during the past three months, the longest stretch since December
2012, the Bloomberg Poland Local Sovereign Index shows. Yields
on five-year notes reached 3.53 percent, 58 basis points less
than this year''s high and 302 basis points over similar German
securities, compared with 272 on Dec. 31. </p>
<p>Policy maker Adam Glapinski told PAP newswire April 28 that
the National Bank of Poland may be free to keep its benchmark
rate at a record-low 2.50 percent until the middle of 2015 amid
consumer-price growth 2.1 percentage points below its five-year
average. BNP Paribas advises buying five-year zloty notes given
persistently low inflation and prospects of quantitative
easing by the European Central Bank, emerging-market strategists
Piotr Chwiejczak and Dina Ahmad wrote in an April 29 report. </p>
<p>Poland is one foot in the euro area and will offer a
positive real interest rate of about 2 percent in the next two
years, while Europe will show negative real rates, Chwiejczak
said by phone from London on May 2. </p>
<p>The central bank pledged in March to keep rates on hold at
least until the end of the third quarter as growth in the
European Union''s largest eastern economy accelerates without
stoking price growth. Inflation stayed unchanged at 0.7 percent
in March, leaving the real interest rate at 1.8 percent. </p>
<h2>ECB Outlook </h2>
<p>The ECB will probably keep its benchmark rate at an all-time low of 0.25 percent at the next meeting on May 8, according
to the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey.
Policy makers will take some sort of action within two months
against the threat of low prices, which rose a less-than-forecast 0.7 percent in April, another survey showed last month. </p>
<p>Given the outlook for price growth across Europe, analysts
will probably push back forecasts for Polish rate increases,
creating scope for further bond gains, Andrew Matheny, an
analyst at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a note on April 22. </p>
<p>Poland is seen raising rates by 50 basis points to 3
percent in the first three months of next year and to 3.25
percent by the end of the first half, according to the median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>More Dovish'' </h2>
<p>Our views are significantly more dovish than market
pricing in Poland on a 12-18 month horizon, which translates
into a constructive outlook on Polish bonds, Matheny wrote
in the report. He predicted a 25 basis-point increase by the end
of June 2015. The view was still valid on May 2, the bank''s
Frankfurt-based spokeswoman Katharina Jung said by e-mail. </p>
<p>Traders have scaled back bets for higher rates in Poland,
now predicting less than a quarter-point increase over the next
year, according to forward-rate agreements on May 2. That
compares with expectations for a full 25 basis-point jump in the
12 months from April 23 and more than a half-point increase in
the year from Jan. 31, the data show. </p>
<p>The zloty slipped less than 0.1 percent to 4.2077 against
the euro at 12:49 p.m. in Warsaw, taking its 2014 drop to 1.3
percent. The additional yield on Poland''s dollar bonds over
Treasuries was unchanged at 119 basis points, JPMorgan Chase 
Co. indexes show. That compares with this year''s low of 103
basis points on April 17. </p>
<p>Poland may decide to start raising rates in the fourth
quarter as the economy accelerates, Andrzej Rzonca, a member of
the central bank''s Monetary Policy Council, said in an interview
for newspaper Parkiet on May 2. </p>
<p>The sooner we raise rates, the more gradual the increases
will be and their total scale will be more limited, he said. </p>
<h2>Zloty Weakens </h2>
<p>Inflation will probably accelerate to 1.3 percent this year
from 0.9 percent in 2013, as the economy expands 3.2 percent,
double last year''s pace, according Bloomberg surveys of
economists. The central bank is targeting price growth of 2.5
percent. </p>
<p>An escalating crisis may damp economic expansion, shaving
off about 0.6 percentage point from growth in the worst-case
scenario, according to BNP''s Chwiejczak. </p>
<p>Violence increased in Ukraine''s easternmost regions as the
government pursued its offensive to dislodge rebels and the
conflict spread to the south. The easternmost area is
essentially at war, the head of the country''s anti-terrorist
agency said May 3. </p>
<p>The geopolitical situation works toward lower inflation
in Poland, further supporting zloty bonds, Chwiejczak said. </p>

U.S. lenders, is moving to Asia to head the financial-institutions group in that region. </p>
<p>Mahoney, 56, will replace Peter Enns, who''s becoming chief
executive officer of Goldman Sachs''s business in Canada,
according to an April memo to employees obtained yesterday by
Bloomberg News. Kenneth Coquillette and Scott Romanoff will
replace Mahoney as co-heads of the banking industry for FIG in
the Americas, according to a separate memo last month. </p>
<p>Global mergers and acquisitions involving financial
companies totaled less than $1.2 trillion each of the past five
years, after surpassing $2 trillion in 2007, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Goldman Sachs is the top-ranked adviser
on financial company deals so far this year. </p>
<p>Mahoney will be head of FIG for Asia ex-Japan, based in
Hong Kong, according to the April 11 memo from executives
including FIG global co-heads Mike Esposito and Todd Leland.
Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the New York-based bank,
confirmed the contents of the memos. </p>
<p>Mahoney joined Goldman Sachs in 1987 and became a partner
in 2000. He advised Toronto-Dominion Bank on its 2006 sale of TD
Waterhouse USA to Ameritrade Holding Corp. and Countrywide
Financial Corp. on its 2008 sale to Bank of America Corp. </p>
<p>Craig Murray and Bernard Teo were named co-chief operating
officers of FIG for Asia ex-Japan under Mahoney. Goldman Sachs
said last month that Enns, a Canadian, would move from Hong Kong
to Toronto to replace Jack Curtin, 63, who''s retiring at year-end. </p>
<p>Coquillette, co-head of investment banking for the Midwest
region, joined Goldman Sachs in 1988 and became a partner in
2010. He''ll move from Chicago to New York in his new role. </p>

<p>U.K. lawmakers decided to call
executives from Pfizer Inc. (PFE) to testify on the proposed takeover
of AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), as London Mayor Boris Johnson added his
voice to those urging caution on the deal. </p>
<p>Representatives of London-based AstraZeneca will also be
asked to appear before the House of Commons Business Committee,
the panel said in an e-mailed statement after meeting in London
today. Business SecretaryVince Cable, answering lawmakers''
concerns in the House of Commons today, said the government is
approaching the Pfizer bid from a position of neutrality. </p>
<p>Lawmakers from across Britain''s political parties have
raised questions about the offer of more than $100 billion and
are pressing for assurances that New York-based Pfizer honors
its pledge, made in a letter to Prime Minister David Cameron
last week, that it will protect jobs and investment in
pharmaceutical research and development in the U.K. </p>
<p>It would be very important to establish that Pfizer is
genuinely committed to RD in this country, Johnson, a member
of Cameron''s Conservative Party, told LBC Radio today. I
believe in principle that we should have an open system of
markets in this country, but when I look at something like
AstraZeneca and I look at an organization of that scale, of its
relative importance to the U.K. economy, the sheer percentage of
its money that goes into RD, I think it is of great importance
to Britain. </p>
<h2>Union Demand </h2>
<p>Labor unions Unite and the GMB asked for a meeting with
Cable, a member of Cameron''s Liberal Democrat coalition
partners, to urge him to impose a national interest test on
the deal. They accused Cameron and Tory Chancellor of the
Exchequer George Osborne of being supportive of the Pfizer bid
while AstraZeneca workers have not been consulted. </p>
<p>AstraZeneca is a key player in the U.K.''s advanced
manufacturing sector and as such is strategically important to
the U.K., yet David Cameron and George Osborne seem comfortable
waving the deal through, leaving any manufacturing strategy in
tatters, Unite Assistant General Secretary Tony Burke said in
an e-mailed statement. The workforce and the unions have acted
in a responsible manner and shown remarkable patience, but that
is now wearing thin. </p>
<p>Cable, who said he would be happy to meet with the unions,
insisted the government is working hard within the constraints
we have to secure a positive outcome for British jobs and
science. He said European Union rules restrict the amount that
government can intervene and British law only allows
intervention on issues of national security, media plurality and
banking. </p>
<h2>Even-Handed Neutrality'' </h2>
<p>The government must and will approach this from a
position of even-handed neutrality, Cable said in Parliament.
I''m not ruling out intervention, we have to look at all the
options open to us. </p>
<p>Cameron''s spokesman, Jean-Christophe Gray, defended the
prime minister''s involvement and repeated the government''s view
that the final decision should rest with the companies''
shareholders. </p>
<p>The government''s position is one of active engagement
with both companies in terms of assessing the link to jobs and
skills, Gray told reporters in London today. The sole basis
on which the government is engaging is with regard to
underlining the importance we attach to continuing to expand the
life-science sector in the U.K. </p>
<h2>AstraZeneca Defense </h2>
<p>AstraZeneca, which last week rejected Pfizer''s 62.6
billion-pound ($106 billion) bid, said today that its plan for
growth is working and it is aiming for annual revenues of more
than $45 billion by 2023. The company highlighted drugs it has
developed, including Brilinta and Farxiga, which it said will be
the drivers of growth. </p>
<p>The increasingly visible success of our independent
strategy highlights the future prospects for our shareholders,
Chairman Leif Johansson said in a statement. These are
benefits that should fully accrue to AstraZeneca''s
shareholders. </p>
<p>Cable praised AstraZeneca''s plans and the company''s
investment in research and development of new drugs. </p>
<p>AstraZeneca do have an ambitious and attractive long-term
investment plan which we encouraged as part of the industrial
strategy, he said. We want to see it fulfilled. </p>
<p>Science Minister David Willetts will also testify to the
House of Commons Science and Technology Committee about the
government''s involvement in the deal. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) was fined $5 million by
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority for sales practices
involving initial public offerings to individual investors,
including that of Facebook Inc. (FB) </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s brokerage, the world''s largest by number
of advisers, didn''t distinguish in its policy between a client''s
indication of interest in an IPO and a conditional request to
buy, the industry-funded watchdog group said today in a
statement. The New York-based firm also failed to monitor
compliance with the policy, Finra said. </p>
<p>The fine highlights the potential pitfalls as Morgan
Stanley uses the size of its retail brokerage, with more than
$1.9 trillion in client assets, to boost its equity-underwriting
business. It was the top issuer of global IPOs from February
2012 to May 2013, the time period the fine covers. </p>
<p>Customers must understand when they are entering a
contract to buy shares in an IPO, Brad Bennett, Finra''s chief
of enforcement, said in the statement. There must not be
ambiguity regarding the customer''s obligations given the
significant legal differences between an indication of interest
and a conditional offer to buy. </p>
<p>Brokers often gauge clients'' interest in IPOs before the
offering''s registration. Indications of interest have to be
reconfirmed before becoming binding orders, while conditional
orders can be filled if they aren''t canceled. </p>
<h2>Yelp IPO </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s unclear policy and lack of training may
have resulted in the firm''s staff and customers being unsure
about the type of commitments made in 83 IPOs over the 15
months, according to Finra. </p>
<p>The company neither admitted nor denied the charges, while
consenting to the entry of Finra''s findings. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley Wealth Management is committed to offering
our clients participation in initial public offerings in
accordance with applicable Finra rules and we have enhanced our
practices on this point, Jim Wiggins, a bank spokesman, said
in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Facebook became the largest technology IPO when it raised
$16 billion in May 2012. The underwriters split about $176
million in fees, and Morgan Stanley handled about 39 percent of
the shares. Today''s fine also covered Yelp Inc. (YELP)''s March 2012
IPO, which raised $107.3 million. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which stood
by Steven A. Cohen last year as his SAC Capital Advisors LP bore
the brunt of a massive insider trading probe, has come to the
billionaire''s aid again. </p>
<p>The top prime broker to the former hedge-fund firm, Goldman
Sachs is making a personal loan to Cohen for the first time,
according to a regulatory filing, joining the list of banks that
have provided SAC''s founder with credit lines backed by his $1
billion art collection. Like Citigroup Inc. (C), JPMorgan Chase 
Co. and Bank of America Corp., New York-based Goldman Sachs is
making the loan through its private bank as part of an effort to
expand its business catering to ultra-wealthy individuals. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and
President Gary Cohn expressed support for Cohen, 57, after SAC
was indicted in July by federal regulators for insider trading,
and continued to do business with the firm after it agreed to
pay $1.8 billion in November to settle the charges. Goldman
Sachs stepped in after Cohen had been seeking an art loan for
months, having paid off and terminated his personal credit line
from Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), said two people familiar with the matter,
who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. </p>

<p>Frozen continues to sizzle for
Walt Disney Co. (DIS), where quarterly profit rose 27 percent as kids
snapped up DVDs and merchandise tied to the animated mega-hit. </p>
<p>Disney, the world''s largest entertainment company, reported
second-quarter net income of $1.92 billion, or $1.08 a share,
beating the average of analysts'' estimates. Sales grew to $11.6
billion, the company said yesterday in a statement, exceeding
projections of $11.2 billion. </p>
<p>Frozen is working magic for Disney in home video, after
scoring a record $1.17 billion in worldwide ticket sales, the
most for an animated feature. The film was also the top-selling
DVD six weeks after its release, according to Rentrak Corp.
Meanwhile, Disney''s other businesses, led by TV networks such as
ESPN and its namesake theme parks, also delivered higher sales
and profit. </p>
<p>The whole thing is doing well, said Frank Beck,
president and chief investment adviser at Beck Capital
Management LLC in Austin, Texas, which holds more than 45,000
Disney shares. You talk about hitting on every cylinder. </p>
<p>Disney fell 0.9 percent to $80.29 at the close in New York.
The stock has advanced 5.1 percent this year. </p>
<p>The company generated profit growth of 15 percent or more
from its four largest divisions, including the film studio,
where earnings rose fourfold. Excluding some items, profit
totaled $1.11 a share in the quarter ended March 29, exceeding
the 96-cent average of analysts'' estimates. </p>
<p>Earnings at the Disney studios soared to $475 million,
reflecting home-video sales of Frozen and Thor: The Dark
World, according to the company. Revenue grew 35 percent to
$1.8 billion, Disney said. </p>
<h2>Frozen'' Assets </h2>
<p>Frozen came out in home video during the period and has
become the company''s biggest digital and Blu-ray release ever,
Robert Iger, Disney''s chairman and chief executive officer, said
yesterday on a conference call. The company is working on
related theme-park attractions and a Broadway show, with Iger
predicting revenue could last for five years. </p>
<p>Given the passion for this film and these characters is
so extraordinary, so well beyond what we ever even imagined, it
would be hard to believe that it wouldn''t sustain itself over a
fairly long period of  time, he said. </p>
<p>With help from Marvel pictures and the resurgent Disney
animation unit, film studio profit for the year may top $1
billion for the first time since 2008, Alan Gould, an analyst at
Evercore Group LLC, wrote in an April 16 note. He has the
equivalent of a buy rating on Burbank, California-based Disney. </p>
<p>Operating income at Disney cable networks rose 15 percent
to $1.97 billion, reflecting growth in pay-TV subscriber fees
for channels such as ESPN. Revenue increased 5 percent to $3.63
billion, even as ad sales shrank at the sports channel. </p>
<h2>Broadcast Division </h2>
<p>Profit at the ABC broadcast unit increased 15 percent to
$159 million, buoyed by higher affiliate fees and cost-cutting,
the company said. Revenue was little changed at $1.5 billion,
reflecting smaller audiences watching the broadcast network </p>
<p>Disney''s namesake theme parks increased profit 19 percent
to $457 million as the division weathered a later Easter
holiday, which pulled business from the January-March quarter
into the current period. </p>
<p>The company credited higher attendance at California''s
Disneyland resort and increased guest spending at Walt Disney
World in Florida. Revenue grew 7.9 percent to $3.56 billion. </p>
<p>Profit from consumer products expanded 37 percent to $274
million, Disney said. </p>
<h2>Disney Stores </h2>
<p>Nine out of the 10 highest-selling items at the Disney
store in the quarter were Frozen'' merchandise, Chief
Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said on the call. </p>
<p>Licensing revenue grew on sales of merchandise related to
Disney channel program, along with products based on Mickey
Mouse and Minnie and the animated feature Planes. </p>
<p>Toys and costumes featuring the film''s Elsa character have
outsold perennial top-performers Cinderella and Snow White on
EBay Inc. in the past year, according to Terapeak, an online
commerce tracker. </p>
<p>The interactive division posted a profit of $14 million,
reversing a loss a year earlier, on the strength of sales of
Disney Infinity, the company''s video-game platform. Revenue grew
38 percent to $268 million. </p>

<p>Concern that regulatory scrutiny will
curb the market for collateralized loan obligations may have
been overblown. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley raised its forecast for new CLOs in the U.S.
this year to as much as $85 billion, at least the third bank
since April to boost projections for the biggest buyers of junk
loans. JPMorgan Chase  Co. boosted its projection to as much as
$100 billion on May 2, while Wells Fargo  (WFC) Co. lifted it to as
high as $90 billion last month. </p>
<p>CLO issuance is accelerating after concern regulatory
attention would damp new formation of the funds, which provide
financing to speculative-grade companies. The Volcker Rule,
adopted in December as part of the financial overhaul mandated
by the Dodd-Frank Act, prohibits banks from investing in a CLO
that owns bonds. </p>
<p>The new issue market has shrugged off this year''s slow
start, as well as the potential regulatory headwinds from the
Volcker rule, Morgan Stanley analysts Vishwanath Tirupattur
and Mia Qian wrote in a research note today. </p>
<p>A total $12.3 billion of broadly syndicated U.S. CLOs were
formed last month, the highest monthly volume since the
financial crisis, bringing total issuance this year through
April to $31.7 billion as the investor base expanded, according
to the report. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo raised its forecast to what would potentially
be the most in seven years, according to an April 1 research
note. JPMorgan increased its projections to $90 billion to $100
billion from $60 billion to $70 billion, according to a May 2
research note. </p>
<h2>Resurging Issuance  </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) revised its forecast to $75 billion to $85
billion of CLOs, from previous projections for $55 billion to
$65 billion, according to the research note. </p>
<p>Issuance of CLOs collapsed to $20.6 billion in 2008, the
year Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. failed, from a record $104.7
billion in 2007, according to Wells Fargo. Last year''s issuance
totaled $82.6 billion. </p>
<p>CLOs were the biggest buyers of new high-yield loans last
quarter, with about 55 percent of the primary market, according
to Standard  Poor''s Capital IQ Leveraged Commentary  Data. </p>
<p>Companies have raised $223 billion of U.S. loans this year
from institutional investors such as CLOs and mutual funds,
after a record $686 billion in 2013, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Junk loans are rated below Baa3 by Moody''s Investors
Service and below BBB- at SP. </p>
<p>Prices of the debt have climbed this week to 98.47 cents on
the dollar yesterday, the highest level since February,
according to the SP/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 index. </p>

<p>British and French politicians have
traditionally had diametrically opposed attitudes to takeovers
of their corporate crown jewels by foreigners. In Pfizer Inc.''s (PFE)
bid for AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), the difference is a lot smaller. </p>
<p>The offer worth more than $106 billion, the largest ever
for a U.K. company, prompted demands for guarantees on jobs,
facilities, and retaining research work from Prime Minister
David Cameron''s Conservative-led coalition. Opposition Labour
Party leader Ed Miliband called for a public-interest test
on major deals by foreign acquirers and Liberal Democrat
Business Secretary Vince Cable said he might support one. </p>
<p>With U.K. national elections a year away today, British
leaders are sounding more like their counterparts in France,
where lawmakers can intervene to stop companies deemed
strategic from being bought, and the state rarely hesitates
to get involved. President Francois Hollande said yesterday that
General Electric Co.''s proposed $17 billion acquisition of most
of Alstom SA (ALO) was not acceptable in its current form because
of its impact on employment. Cameron said today he''s not
satisfied with the Pfizer offer so far. </p>
<h2>Clear Message'' </h2>
<p>The U.K. government is reacting more strongly now to
Pfizer''s intention to take over AstraZeneca because they need to
start sending a clear message to citizens that they are
concerned about them as the next general election gets closer,
said Daniel Lacalle, a senior fund manager at Ecofin Ltd. in
London. </p>
<p>U.K. politicians'' attitudes reflect the anxieties of a
country that''s seen high-profile companies from carmakers to
confectioners absorbed by foreign buyers. </p>
<p>Unlike in the U.S., Canada, France and Australia, British
officials have no direct legal mechanism to halt foreign
acquisitions -- an absence illustrated by Kraft Foods Inc.''s
successful takeover of chocolate-maker Cadbury Plc in 2010 over
the objections of lawmakers, with the subsequent closing of a
factory in southwest England. </p>
<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne was probably too
enthusiastic in quickly hailing the Pfizer bid, which would see
the American company move its legal domicile to the U.K., as
positive for the country and an endorsement of its corporate-tax
regime, according to two government officials with knowledge of
the discussions. </p>
<h2>Legal Constraints'' </h2>
<p>Cameron''s government is now trying to show it is neutral by
stressing that it''s talking to both Pfizer and AstraZeneca, the
people said on condition of anonymity because the talks are
private. Cable told lawmakers yesterday the government is
operating within serious European legal constraints. </p>
<p>Today, the prime minister told Parliament at his weekly
question-and-answer session that evaluating the bid would
include examining its impact on jobs and science in the U.K. </p>
<p>The commitments that have been made so far are
encouraging, Cameron said. I''m not satisfied. I want more. </p>
<p>The chief executive officers of both companies will testify
before the House of Commons Business and Science Committees over
two days next week, the panels said today. </p>
<p>Cameron, Cable and Osborne have Paris to look to for a
recent example of navigating an unexpected offer from an
American company. After Bloomberg News reported GE''s Alstom bid
on April 23, French officials led by Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg began a last-ditch effort to encourage a counterbid
from Siemens AG. Even after securing guarantees on jobs and
keeping French sites from GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt, Montebourg and
Hollande said this week the American company''s offer still isn''t
sufficient. </p>
<h2>Outside Buyers </h2>
<p>The U.K.''s generally hands-off approach to deal making has
helped make it more attractive than its neighbors to foreign
acquirers. Buyers from outside Europe have spent about $358
billion on deals in the U.K. over the last five years, not
including AstraZeneca, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That
compares with just $86 billion in France and $114 billion in
Germany. </p>
<p>A takeover of AstraZeneca would be the biggest-ever
acquisition of a U.K. company by value -- about five times
bigger than the largest transaction of the past half-decade,
Liberty Global Plc (LBTYA)''s $22 billion deal for U.K. broadband
provider Virgin Media last year. </p>
<p>A deal would also mean ceding control of a large part of
the country''s pharmaceutical infrastructure. The London-based
company has about 7,000 domestic staff, a major RD facility in
Cambridge, eastern England, and a 2,900-employee global hub for
cancer research outside Manchester in the north. </p>
<p>Pfizer, based in New York, is very unlikely to proceed with
a bid for AstraZeneca if it can''t win the blessing of Cameron''s
government, a person familiar with the matter said. </p>
<h2>More Difficult </h2>
<p>Even in the absence of a direct mechanism to block the
deal, the U.K. could make doing business much more difficult for
Pfizer if it chose to, especially in an industry as heavily
regulated as pharmaceuticals, the person said, asking not to be
identified discussing private deliberations. </p>
<p>According to one Cameron aide, there are many more
political risks for the government if the takeover goes ahead
than if it collapses. As with previous deals in which the
government has been involved, such as Lloyds TSB Group Plc''s
2008 rescue of HBOS Plc, ministers risk being criticized if job
losses follow or the deal is seen as a failure. </p>
<p>AstraZeneca Chairman Leif Johansson told Cameron in a May 2
phone call that even by engaging with Pfizer, the government
risked being seen as supporting the takeover, according to a
person familiar with the call. </p>
<h2>Mayor''s Concern </h2>
<p>Along with Cameron, London Mayor Boris Johnson, a possible
candidate to succeed Cameron as Tory leader, has said he''s
concerned about AstraZeneca being in foreign hands. </p>
<p>After meetings with U.K. officials, Pfizer has pledged to
keep about 20 percent of the combined group''s research staff in
the U.K. for five years. That promise comes with a caveat,
though: that Pfizer may have to adjust these obligations
should circumstances significantly change, the company said. </p>
<p>Both Cable and Miliband have said they''re worried about
Pfizer''s commitment to those promises. </p>
<p>Britain''s government is almost alone among major economies
in having never in recent years scuttled a major foreign
takeover. German Chancellor Angela Merkel''s government torpedoed
the proposed merger of BAE Systems Plc (BA/) and what''s now Airbus
Group NV (AIR) in 2012, citing concerns over the loss of German
control and jobs. </p>
<p>In recent years Canada has blocked deals by BHP Billiton (BHP)
Ltd. and Petroliam Nasional Bhd., although the latter was
eventually approved. Australia intervened last year to stop the
$2.9 billion acquisition of GrainCorp Ltd. by Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. </p>
<h2>Special Case </h2>
<p>While British politicians are clearly concerned about the
Pfizer deal, its size and relevance to high-tech research make
it a special case, said Stephen Blackshaw, a partner in London
at law firm Sidley Austin LLP. For that reason the country isn''t
likely to go down the road to a more formalized test for
foreign deals, as in Canada and Australia, he said. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s case isn''t being helped by concerns it''s moved to
shut down research after past acquisitions, and by its decision
in 2011 to close a lab in Sandwich in southeast England that
cost about 2,000 jobs. Since it bought rival Wyeth in 2009, it''s
cut $4.6 billion in research spending and narrowed its
scientific focus to six areas of medicine. Pfizer''s plan to be
domiciled in the U.K. for tax purposes would also give it a
lower tax rate. </p>
<p>I''m sure these companies are motivated by hard-headed
commercial considerations, and we should be motivated by hard-headed considerations of national interest, Cable told
lawmakers yesterday. We see the future of the U.K. as a
knowledge economy, not a tax haven. </p>

scoring a record $1.17 billion in worldwide ticket sales, the
most for an animated feature. The film was also the top-selling
DVD six weeks after its release, according to Rentrak Corp.
Meanwhile, Disney''s other businesses, led by TV networks such as
ESPN and its namesake theme parks, also delivered higher sales
and profit. </p>
<p>The whole thing is doing well, said Frank Beck,
president and chief investment adviser at Beck Capital
Management LLC in Austin, Texas, which holds more than 45,000
Disney shares. You talk about hitting on every cylinder. </p>
<p>Disney fell 0.9 percent to $80.29 at the close in New York.
The stock has advanced 5.1 percent this year. </p>
<p>The company generated profit growth of 15 percent or more
from its four largest divisions, including the film studio,
where earnings rose fourfold. Excluding some items, profit
totaled $1.11 a share in the quarter ended March 29, exceeding
the 96-cent average of analysts'' estimates. </p>
<p>Earnings at the Disney studios soared to $475 million,
reflecting home-video sales of Frozen and Thor: The Dark
World, according to the company. Revenue grew 35 percent to
$1.8 billion, Disney said. </p>
<h2>Frozen'' Assets </h2>
<p>Frozen came out in home video during the period and has
become the company''s biggest digital and Blu-ray release ever,
Robert Iger, Disney''s chairman and chief executive officer, said
yesterday on a conference call. The company is working on
related theme-park attractions and a Broadway show, with Iger
predicting revenue could last for five years. </p>
<p>Given the passion for this film and these characters is
so extraordinary, so well beyond what we ever even imagined, it
would be hard to believe that it wouldn''t sustain itself over a
fairly long period of  time, he said. </p>
<p>With help from Marvel pictures and the resurgent Disney
animation unit, film studio profit for the year may top $1
billion for the first time since 2008, Alan Gould, an analyst at
Evercore Group LLC, wrote in an April 16 note. He has the
equivalent of a buy rating on Burbank, California-based Disney. </p>
<p>Operating income at Disney cable networks rose 15 percent
to $1.97 billion, reflecting growth in pay-TV subscriber fees
for channels such as ESPN. Revenue increased 5 percent to $3.63
billion, even as ad sales shrank at the sports channel. </p>
<h2>Broadcast Division </h2>
<p>Profit at the ABC broadcast unit increased 15 percent to
$159 million, buoyed by higher affiliate fees and cost-cutting,
the company said. Revenue was little changed at $1.5 billion,
reflecting smaller audiences watching the broadcast network </p>
<p>Disney''s namesake theme parks increased profit 19 percent
to $457 million as the division weathered a later Easter
holiday, which pulled business from the January-March quarter
into the current period. </p>
<p>The company credited higher attendance at California''s
Disneyland resort and increased guest spending at Walt Disney
World in Florida. Revenue grew 7.9 percent to $3.56 billion. </p>
<p>Profit from consumer products expanded 37 percent to $274
million, Disney said. </p>
<h2>Disney Stores </h2>
<p>Nine out of the 10 highest-selling items at the Disney
store in the quarter were Frozen'' merchandise, Chief
Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said on the call. </p>
<p>Licensing revenue grew on sales of merchandise related to
Disney channel program, along with products based on Mickey
Mouse and Minnie and the animated feature Planes. </p>
<p>Toys and costumes featuring the film''s Elsa character have
outsold perennial top-performers Cinderella and Snow White on
EBay Inc. in the past year, according to Terapeak, an online
commerce tracker. </p>
<p>The interactive division posted a profit of $14 million,
reversing a loss a year earlier, on the strength of sales of
Disney Infinity, the company''s video-game platform. Revenue grew
38 percent to $268 million. </p>

<p>If you''ve followed analyst Natalia Corfield during her stints at two of Wall Street''s biggest
banks, you know one call has been constant: her recommendation
to buy Banco BMG SA''s bonds. You also know that she''s been
right. </p>
<p>Corfield, now at JPMorgan Chase  Co., began recommending
the notes in July 2012 when she was at Deutsche Bank AG. In that
span, BMG''s $250 million of bonds due in 2020 have returned 46
percent -- more than four times the average gain for emerging-market corporate debt. </p>
<p>BMG''s decision to form a joint venture with Itau Unibanco
Holding SA, Latin America''s biggest bank, 22 months ago has
propelled its $1.1 billion of notes and prompted Corfield to
stick with her view. The bank, based in the Brazilian Corfield''s
home state of Minas Gerais before moving to Sao Paulo this year,
said April 29 it will boost its stake in the venture to 40
percent from 30 percent, adding to bond gains. The unit has
allowed BMG to obtain cheaper funding and stem losses after
Banco Cruzeiro do Sul SA''s collapse dried up funding for midsize
banks. </p>
<p>Everyone was afraid because of what happened to Cruzeiro,
but I knew BMG, Corfield, who reiterated a buy on the BMG
notes after the April 29 announcement, said by phone from New
York. It''s a very good story. The cost of funding surged after
Cruzeiro, and it decreased with the joint venture, and it will
likely drop more now. </p>
<h2>Drastically'' Reduced </h2>
<p>Yields on BMG''s bonds soared to a record 18.51 percent in
June 2012 after Cruzeiro defaulted on $1.6 billion of notes and
was seized by Brazilian regulators. A month later, BMG announced
the joint venture with Itau, which agreed to provide as much as
300 million reais ($134.6 million) per month for five years to
finance BMG''s payroll loans. The 2020 securities now yield 7.94
percent. </p>
<p>The deal has drastically reduced BMG''s funding costs as
the market prices in improvements in the bank''s performance and
margins, according to investor relations manager Danilo
Herculano Andrade Silva. BMG''s increased stake in the venture
will be reflected in the bank''s fourth-quarter earnings, he
said. </p>
<p>The lender''s net income totaled 428.5 million reais last
year, reversing a loss of 580 million reais in 2012. Net
interest margin reached 9.3 percent in 2013, 5.1 percentage
points higher than the previous year. </p>
<p>The joint venture is exceeding all our estimates, BMG''s
Silva said in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo. The
performance of the bonds shows that investors see the deal was a
success. I think we''ll still see an improvement in the market''s
perception of BMG. </p>
<h2>Huge Success'' </h2>
<p>The bank has no plans to buy back bonds and is unlikely to
increase the stake in the venture further, Silva said. </p>
<p>Marcelo Kopel, Itau''s head of investor relations, said on a
conference call with reporters April 29 that he expects Banco
Itau BMG Consignado''s loan portfolio to reach 20 billion reais
by the end of this year from about 12 billion reais now. </p>
<p>An Itau official who asked not to be named in accordance
with company policy declined to comment further on the venture
or on BMG''s bond performance when contacted by Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>The partnership has been a huge success, with the obvious
benefit being the decreased cost of funding, Jim Harper, the
head of research at BCP Securities LLC in Greenwich,
Connecticut, said in a telephone interview. The BMG bonds will
react favorably to anything that represents a move towards
integration. </p>
<h2>Yield Gap </h2>
<p>Carlos Gribel, vice president for emerging markets at INTL
FCStone Securities, said that while BMG''s notes may continue to
climb as the partnership grows, they will still trade at a
premium to Itau''s bonds. </p>
<p>Itau''s $1 billion of subordinated debt due in 2020 yields
4.38 percent, or 3.56 percentage points less than BMG''s notes. </p>
<p>BMG''s curve has climbed a lot, but the yield will not
reach Itau''s, Gribel said in a telephone interview from Miami.
It will be somewhere between mid-sized banks and Itau, because
at the end of the day, Itau doesn''t guarantee the bonds. There''s
an extra risk, and there''s a premium for that. </p>
<p>BMG''s 2020 bonds have gained 5.8 cents to 104.5 cents on
the dollar, the highest since 2011, since the bank said it will
boost its stake in the joint venture, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. While the rally will continue, further gains will
be more gradual, Corfield said. </p>
<p>This will free up capital and decrease their funding
costs even more, she said. Bondholders are seeing the
venture is working well. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
shifted its real estate focus to lending from buying properties
after the financial crisis, completed fundraising for its second
real estate credit pool at $4.2 billion. </p>
<p>The New York-based firm raised $1.8 billion in equity
pledges from institutions and wealthy individuals, supplemented
by the same amount in borrowings and $600 million of the firm''s
own money, said Alan Kava, co-head of the real estate investing
group in Goldman''s merchant banking division. About 60 percent
of the capital pledged came from U.S. investors and most of the
rest was from Europe, with a small amount from Asian investors. </p>
<p>Goldman is competing with other private debt funds,
mortgage-oriented real estate investment trusts and banks in
offering ways to earn higher yields at a time of low interest
rates. The new vehicle will invest in Europe and the U.S.,
expanding on Goldman''s first real estate credit fund, which made
about $3.5 billion of loans, according to a marketing document. </p>
<p>We will be opportunistic in terms of where we see
value, Kava said in a telephone interview. The first fund
was U.S. only. We''re hopeful we will end up with about 50-50
between the U.S. and Europe. </p>
<p>The new Broad Street Real Estate Credit Partners II plans
to make senior loans and mezzanine loans backed by high-quality
commercial real estate, to fund acquisitions, refinancings and
recapitalizations, according to the document. It intends to
generate returns in the mid-teens by charging interest rates
of 7 percent to 10 percent and leveraging the equity. </p>
<h2>Current Yield </h2>
<p>The new fund will make and hold the loans, distributing the
interest income it receives to investors quarterly, said Peter
Weidman, the managing director who oversees the new fund. </p>
<p>What our investors like about this is it''s a current
yield so we''re not just making one-time distributions by
securitizing, Weidman said in a phone interview. </p>
<p>The new fund has invested about $500 million already, in
five deals, according to the marketing document. They include a
mezzanine loan to help finance the purchase of a group of
Southern California office buildings, and a senior loan, or
first mortgage, on a New York City rental apartment building
that''s being converted to for-sale condominiums. Higher-yielding
mezzanine loans are used to fill the gap between first mortgages
and equity. </p>
<p>Goldman''s first real estate credit fund, known as Real
Estate Mezzanine Partners, made 28 investments, about two-thirds
of which were senior mortgages and one-third mezzanine loans,
according to the marketing document. </p>
<p>We have a competitive advantage by focusing on larger
deals and being able to provide the entire loan to our
borrowers, Weidman said. We see less competition in the
larger loan space. </p>
<p>The new fund has an investment period of three years, with
possible extensions, according to the marketing document. </p>

<p>A potential raised bid for AstraZeneca
Plc (AZN) means that Pfizer Inc. (PFE) would have to generate more than $2
billion in annual savings from the deal, and that job cuts are
more likely to happen outside the U.K. </p>
<p>AstraZeneca, the U.K.''s second-biggest drugmaker, rejected
Pfizer''s offer last week of more than $106 billion, about 50
pounds a share, some 32 percent of which is in cash. At that
price, Pfizer would have to save at least $2 billion for the bid
to add to earnings in 2014 and 2015, according to an analysis by
Bloomberg Industries. </p>
<p>That amount would rise to at least $3 billion if the New
York-based company raised its bid to 55 pounds a share, and
Pfizer may need to increase the cash portion to 40 percent,
Bloomberg Industries analyst Sam Fazeli said. If Pfizer sticks
to the current cash offer, the savings may have to exceed $3.5
billion, approaching a prohibitive level in terms of U.K.
job reductions, he wrote. </p>
<p>Any cost savings are likely to come partly from RD in
Sweden and the U.S., as well as the global commercial
infrastructure, Fazeli wrote. Pfizer''s pledge to Prime
Minister David Cameron suggests AstraZeneca''s 2,000 U.K.
research and development jobs should be safe from cuts if a
deal goes ahead. </p>
<p>The largest U.S. drugmaker told Cameron last week that it
would keep at least 20 percent of the combined company''s
research and development workforce in the U.K. for at least five
years and retain substantial manufacturing facilities at
AstraZeneca''s site south of Manchester. </p>
<h2>Swedish Workers </h2>
<p>Pfizer''s global RD workforce totals about 10,880 and
AstraZeneca''s about 9,000, according to estimates by Bloomberg
Industries. With fewer than 20 percent of those jobs in the
U.K., job cuts may occur outside Britain, said Asthika Goonewardene, a London-based analyst at Bloomberg Industries. </p>
<p>AstraZeneca employs about 5,900 people in Sweden, home of
predecessor company Astra AB. Sweden, unlike the U.K., hasn''t
received any promises on jobs from Pfizer. </p>
<p>Pfizer may be more likely to cut its own RD operations
than eliminate jobs in the U.K. because of tax benefits, said
Fabian Wenner, an analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux in Zurich. Keeping
research operations in Britain enables Pfizer to say that
products were invented in the U.K., and use the country''s lower
tax rate, Wenner said. Pfizer''s tax rate is 27.4 percent, while
AstraZeneca''s is 21.3 percent, according to Fazeli. </p>
<h2>Lower Taxes </h2>
<p>They want to lower the tax rate for the overall group by
implementing transfer pricing, which you can only get when you
have sufficient RD in the lower tax regime, Wenner said. It
would make more sense to save 15 to 20 percent of Pfizer RD. It
would make sense from a both a political point of view and a tax
point of view. </p>
<p>Manufacturing jobs in Britain could also be preserved in
this way, Wenner said. The most probable positions to be
eliminated would be in sales and administration, he said. </p>
<p>Typically, a merger results in cost reductions equivalent
to about 10 percent of the target''s global sales, Wenner said.
In this case, Pfizer may cut $3.3 billion in costs, which
include a 10 percent decrease in cost of goods sold, 20 percent
of sales and administrative costs and 20 percent of research and
development costs. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which wagered more than $300 billion last year on things like yen rates and bond spreads, just laid down a bet that guys like Nelson Johnny Aguilar can stay out of jail. </p> <p>Aguilar was at a Dunkin'' Donuts near Boston on a Sunday night in March when a shooting outside left a 21-year-old man with a bullet wound to the gut, police said. They arrested Aguilar, a 19-year-old gang member with a criminal record and a tattoo that says Life''s a Gamble. </p> <p>Such crime-blotter moments are Goldman''s concern thanks to a financial product called a social-impact bond. Goldman is anchoring a $21 million plan to help a Boston-area nonprofit called Roca expand its efforts to steer young men like Aguilar away from dealing drugs, stealing cars or committing assaults and murders. </p> <p>Under the deal, if men targeted by Roca spend 22 percent fewer days in jails and prisons than their peers, Massachusetts would save enough to repay Goldman''s $9 million loan. An even bigger drop in recidivism would hand Goldman as much as $1 million in profit. If Roca fails and too many men end up behind bars, Goldman will lose almost everything it ventured. </p> <p>It''s not that different than if you were looking at any company to invest in, said Andrea Phillips, vice president of Goldman''s Urban Investment Group, who leads the bank''s social-impact bond transactions. You''re relying on a management team. You''re relying on their human capital, their folks who work at the plant and deliver and do what they''re supposed to do. </p> <h2>Bottom Line </h2> <p>Young men like Aguilar are part of the bottom line: Each participant Roca keeps out of jail for a year saves Massachusetts $12,400, the state calculated. If it can close a 300-person facility and keep from expanding jail space, it could save $47,500 per person per year. </p>

<p>Todd Vitale, a personal trainer who opened his own gym last year, said he was having difficulty getting a mortgage of more than $700,000 to buy a home in Greenwich, Connecticut, because his new business was untested. </p> <p>Vitale then tried Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), the biggest U.S. home lender, where he kept most of his savings in an account he opened more than a decade ago, he said. He worked with the bank''s private mortgage unit, whose clients are entitled to loans of up to $6 million and personalized service, and had the opportunity to explain that he had already run a similar business and could make the gym succeed. Wells Fargo approved his 30-year fixed-rate mortgage of more than $700,000, he said. </p> <p>I don''t think I would have gotten a loan unless Wells Fargo private mortgage gave me a shot, said Vitale, 38, who moved in to his new 3,000 square-foot home in February. I would have had to walk away from the home. </p> <p>Jumbos, or loans of at least $417,000 in most areas, are one of the few thriving pieces of an otherwise shrinking mortgage market. The biggest banks, including San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Bank of America Corp., are ratcheting up efforts to win wealthier borrowers while keeping credit tight for almost everyone else. Lenders are allowing assets in accounts to serve as collateral in lieu of down payments, cutting rates if customers have or set up investment accounts, rolling out new adjustable-rate jumbo mortgages, and accepting lower down payments. </p> <h2>Applications Increase </h2> <p>Jumbos are growing while almost everything else is dead, said Paul Miller, a banking analyst at FBR Capital Markets Corp. based in Arlington, Virginia. Big banks need loan growth. If they were getting decent commercial loan growth, they wouldn''t be so aggressive on competing for jumbos. </p> <p>Applications for jumbo mortgages of at least $729,000 increased 4.9 percent in March from a year earlier, while requests for loans of less than $150,000 fell by 21 percent, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The average purchase application loan amount reached $280,500 in the week ended April 18, the highest since the survey started in January 1990, the MBA said. </p> <p>Jumbos, also called non-conforming loans because they exceed the limit for government-backed Fannie Mae (FMCC) and Freddie Mac to guarantee, are loans of more than $625,500 in pricier markets such as Manhattan and Los Angeles. They''re generally made to the most creditworthy borrowers with FICO scores of 760 on average and held by banks instead of being packaged into securities and sold to investors. </p> <h2>Job Cuts </h2> <p>Plunging mortgage lending at Wells Fargo and JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. mortgage lender, dragged down their first-quarter earnings. Both banks are paring staff, with New York-based JPMorgan reducing the number of jobs at its mortgage unit by 30 percent, or 14,000 positions, since the start of last year. Wells Fargo got rid of 1,100 jobs in its residential mortgage business in the first quarter to keep expenses in line with demand for loans. Bank of America, the fourth-largest mortgage lender, swung to a surprise loss in the first quarter on costs tied to mortgage disputes. </p> <p>Refinancing, which drove lenders'' profits last year, fell in the week ended April 25 to the lowest level since 2008, according to the MBA, after increases in borrowing rates. While the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage declined to 4.21 percent this week, it''s still up almost a full percentage point from a near-record low last May, data from Freddie Mac show. </p> <h2>Lower Rates </h2> <p>That level of drop sends everyone everywhere looking for business, said Joel Kan, director of economic forecasting at Washington-based MBA. </p> <p>Lenders are also vying for jumbos since they don''t have to pay higher guarantee fees charged by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to insure the bonds, as they do with conforming loans, said Richard Lepre, an Alamo, California-based loan officer with RPM Mortgage. That means they can charge lower rates on jumbos, making them more attractive than traditional loans. </p> <p>The rate at Wells Fargo for a 30-year fixed jumbo mortgage was 4.13 percent as of yesterday, compared with 4.25 percent for a conventional 30-year fixed loan. </p> <p>JPMorgan modified its guidelines in the third quarter for making jumbo loans to take into account a client''s total assets at the bank. The bank made the change after seeing that customers who had long-term relationships with JPMorgan were less likely to default on their loans. </p> <h2>Leverage Relationships </h2> <p>The lender created a separate process last year to review all declined loans to ensure those decisions made sense. It also set up a group that works with wealthy clients who have more complex financial situations, such as self-employed borrowers. </p> <p>We leverage relationships to let the customers know we really want to do business with them, said Lesley Corydon, a senior vice president in the private client mortgage group at JPMorgan. </p> <p>JPMorgan''s jumbo mortgage originations represented 21 percent of its total originations in the first quarter of 2014 compared with 10 percent a year earlier, according to the bank. </p> <p>Customers of Chase Private Client, who have assets ranging from about $500,000 to $5 million in total wealth, increasingly are opting to use their deposits and investments as collateral when borrowing. Some clients use the credit as bridge loans or to make larger down payments. </p> <p>Vitale, the trainer who works with high school and college athletes at his Division 1 Prep gym, said he considered going to a non-bank, such as a hedge fund, for his home loan. He said he was dissuaded by the high rates and hoops he would have had to jump through to get the loan, compared with getting his Wells Fargo mortgage. </p> <h2>100% Financing </h2> <p>We are pleased to know that Mr. Vitale received assistance with his home lending needs, said Emmanuel Vuillequez, product manager for non-conforming mortgages at Wells Fargo. </p> <p>Last year, Wells Fargo created a team of 400 underwriters spread across six U.S. locations who just focus on jumbo loans. The bank is trying to win more jumbo business through better execution, deploying specially trained underwriters who can handle complicated deals and complete them by the closing date, Vuillequez said. </p> <p>Jumbo lenders are looking for ways to distinguish themselves from other jumbo lenders, said Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance, a trade publication in Bethesda, Maryland. Jumbo lending was the bright star of the mortgage market last year, so everyone is looking to ride that momentum into 2014. </p> <p>At Bank of New York Mellon Corp., where the average size of a mortgage is $1 million, clients can get 100 percent financing. They don''t have to put any money down and can instead pledge assets in investment accounts as collateral, said Bill Sappington, head of private banking at the New York-based firm. </p> <h2>Smaller Deposits </h2> <p>BNY Mellon earlier this year started offering customers the option to lock in mortgage rates for 90 days, instead of the typical 30-day term. The additional days give them more time to close knowing the rate is secure. </p> <p>Bank of America in October reduced the down payment to 15 percent from 20 percent for most jumbos of less than $1 million. Existing customers at the bank may receive discounts on their mortgages based on their level of business with the firm, said Susan Atran, a Bank of America spokeswoman. </p> <p>At the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank, nonconforming mortgage originations were 37 percent of overall loans made during the first quarter compared with 22 percent a year earlier, according to the firm. </p> <p>RPM Mortgage this year began offering new jumbo adjustable-rate mortgages with initial low rates. One of their loan products provides a fixed rate for five years at a maximum of 2.63 percent, and then resets once during the next five years to no more than 4.63 percent, Lepre said. </p> <h2>Jumbo Defaults </h2> <p>Jumbo originations are still lower than they were before the financial crisis. A decade ago, jumbo ARMs helped fuel the housing bubble by letting buyers qualify for homes they could only afford at the low rates before they reset. </p> <p>When home prices stopped climbing in mid-2006, both jumbo and conventional ARM borrowers began defaulting in higher numbers, contributing to the collapse of the mortgage market that in turn led to the most severe financial crisis in decades. </p> <p>Today, demand for jumbos is growing as borrowers resume buying second homes or investment properties, according to Chase''s Corydon. Banks are often fighting for loans in the $1 million to $2 million range, said Mike McPartland, head of lending for Citigroup Inc.''s (C) private bank in North America. </p> <p>If in the past, I was competing with two private banks, now it feels like I''m competing with two private banks and two regional lenders for that $2 million mortgage, said McPartland, whose clients generally have at least $25 million in net worth. The benefit to working with a bank that knows you is we don''t treat a mortgage like an isolated financial transaction. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Emma Charlton" date="May 10, 2014  4:33 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-10/pfizer-s-read-says-astrazeneca-deal-will-meet-scientific-needs.html"><headline>Pfizer''s Read Says AstraZeneca Deal Will Meet Scientific Needs</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the U.S. drugmaker
seeking to acquire AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), advanced its U.K. charm
offensive with a series of videos extolling the scientific
benefits, while downplaying the potential tax advantages. </p>
<p>It really meets the scientific needs, Chief Executive
Officer Ian Read said today in a video and statement on Pfizer''s
website. It meets needs of efficiency, it meets needs of
strengthening our balance sheet and strengthening our fiscal
position. </p>
<p>AstraZeneca rejected the bid of about $106 billion from
Pfizer earlier this month. Buying the company would give Pfizer
a lower tax rate and a portfolio of experimental cancer drugs.
Read and Pascal Soriot, CEO of London-based AstraZeneca, will
testify to U.K. lawmakers next week amid political tension over
public-interest issues related to the takeover. </p>
<p>U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said on BBC
Radio 4 today that the government wants to clarify what a deal
would mean for British scientific research and jobs. Lawmakers
are prepared to negotiate hard as they engage both companies, he
said. </p>
<p>AstraZeneca shareholders will get an immediate benefit
from the cash that we would pay them, Pfizer''s Read said. It
allows them to participate in a very strong combined company
with great cash flows and a great portfolio, and it allows a
very efficient allocation of capital. </p>
<p>Improving the efficiency of the organization and the
ability to liberate the balance sheet and tax of the combined
companies are the key reasons for the takeover, Read said.
We liked where their science is being done, which is in the
U.K. We liked the complementary nature of the portfolio. </p>
<p>Read may soon also face government inquiries in the U.S.
Pfizer has said it plans to keep the company''s operating
headquarters in the U.S., even as its legal address shifts to
the U.K. for the lower tax rate. </p>
<p>There was no immediate reply to two telephone messages and
an e-mail sent to AstraZeneca''s London offices. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chief Executive Officer
Ian Read faces heightened public scrutiny of his bid for
AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) this week when he''ll be questioned by lawmakers
on his commitment to the U.K. in hearings broadcast live. </p>
<p>Read has been summoned by separate parliamentary committees
to testify on the U.S. company''s offer of about $106 billion for
London-based AstraZeneca, the biggest takeover bid in U.K.
history. He and AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot are scheduled to
appear before the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee
tomorrow and the Science and Technology Committee on May 14. </p>
<p>The hearings in London provide a first opportunity for
lawmakers to question the pharmaceutical executives amid growing
public and political concern that a takeover would mean job
losses and cuts to research. As executives from Rupert Murdoch
to Robert Diamond have learned, lawmakers acting in the name of
British taxpayers can force company changes to assuage public
concerns. </p>
<p>The entire political class and media will be spending a
couple of hours listening to Pfizer''s business and intellectual
case for the takeover, said Richard Berry, managing director
of Democratic Audit, a charity that has studied the work of
parliamentary committees. Sessions where people get a grilling
get a lot of attention and I''m sure the media will highlight the
most aggressive part. </p>
<h2>Video Appearances </h2>
<p>Read may have pre-empted some of the questions he is likely
to face with videos posted on Pfizer''s website over the weekend
in which he outlined the case for the bid, stressing his
company''s commitment to research and explaining its decision to
shutter a plant in Sandwich, England, in 2011. Pfizer''s
commitment to the new AstraZeneca headquarters being built in
Cambridge, eastern England, fits the company''s record of
bringing together scientists at its research hub in the U.S.,
Read said. </p>
<p>In the U.K. I see great similarities with Cambridge,
Massachusetts, where you have this hub of innovation, this hub
of young scientists, he said. The strategy to build a center
in Cambridge in fact is in line with our strategy as we''ve shown
by what we''ve done in Massachusetts. </p>
<p>When Read first approached ministers after announcing the
bid, Conservatives including Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne welcomed it as a vote of confidence in the U.K. Since
then, ministers have grown more cautious, demanding assurances
about jobs and research spending. According to one person
familiar with the company''s plans, Pfizer won''t proceed with the
bid if the U.K. government is hostile. </p>
<h2>Bitter Experience'' </h2>
<p>Bitter experience in other contexts has taught us about
the importance of really pinning these commitments down and not
just allowing them to rest as aspirations but to make sure they
are exacting, binding commitments, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said in an interview with Sky News broadcast yesterday.
There are various ways that they could be made more solid and
that''s exactly the kind of thing we''re discussing with Pfizer. </p>
<p>The most hostile questioning may come from members of the
opposition Labour Party, whose leader Ed Miliband has accused
Prime Minister David Cameron of being a cheerleader for the
takeover. Conservatives will also want to be seen to be asking
tough questions to demonstrate they are pursuing due diligence. </p>
<p>Frankly, we have not seen any guarantees from Pfizer that
they have an investment plan that is equal to what AstraZeneca
are putting into the science base over the next 10 years,
William Bain, a Labour lawmaker on the Business Committee, said
in an interview. Pfizer does have a record of launching
takeovers for other pharmaceutical companies and then seeing a
reduction in investment in research and development. </p>
<h2>Executive Roll-call </h2>
<p>Tomorrow''s session will begin at 9:30 a.m. in London with
evidence from union officials. At 10 a.m., Read will be joined
by Frank D''Amelio, the company''s chief financial officer, and
Jonathan Emms, its U.K. managing director. Their testimony is
scheduled to end at 11:15 a.m., when Soriot, flanked by Mene Pangalos, AstraZeneca''s executive vice president, and Ian Brimicombe, vice president in charge of corporate finance, will
make the case against the takeover. </p>
<p>The main issue is to understand what Pfizer''s commitments
to the U.K. are and how binding they are, Julian Huppert, a
lawmaker who represents Cambridge, said in an interview. The
deal is driven by their desire to avoid paying tax in the U.S. </p>
<p>The British government''s patent box allows companies to
pay reduced tax on products spun out of research done in the
U.K. For Huppert, it makes Pfizer''s attachment to Britain shaky. </p>
<h2>U.S. Pressure </h2>
<p>Pfizer is also facing political pressure in the U.S., where
the New York-based company has said it plans to keep its
operating headquarters even as it moves its legal address to the
U.K. for a lower tax rate. </p>
<p>In the videos at the weekend, Read sought to shift the
emphasis away from tax and onto the business case for the
takeover, which AstraZeneca''s board has rejected. </p>
<p>We liked where their science is being done, which is in
the U.K. We liked the complementary nature of the portfolio,
he said. The approach was, he said, a win-win for society, a
win-win for shareholders, and a win-win for stakeholders. </p>
<p>British parliamentary committees, originally introduced to
scrutinize the work of government, have become increasingly
willing to intervene in matters of more general interest. </p>
<p>In 2012, the Treasury Committee summoned Diamond, then CEO
of Barclays Plc, to explain the Libor-rigging scandal. He
resigned before he got there, despite investor support, after
politicians on all sides made him a target. </p>
<h2>Foam Pie </h2>
<p>Murdoch, chairman of News Corp., made it through three
hours of testimony to parliament''s culture committee on the
phone-hacking scandal in 2011. He emerged unscathed barring a
foam-pie assault by a member of the public after telling members
that his appearance was the most humble day of my life. His
son James wasn''t so lucky, with his account of events disputed
by two former executives. </p>
<p>The first sign of whether the U.K. government''s view on
Pfizer and AstraZeneca has shifted as a result of the testimony
will come at 1 p.m. tomorrow, when Business Secretary Vince Cable responds. </p>
<p>Cable has been examining how Pfizer''s proposed takeover
could be blocked on public-interest grounds, including the
possibility of referring the case to the European Commission or
proposing a change to the Enterprise Act that would widen the
public-interest test for takeovers, a person familiar with
discussions in government said on May 9. </p>
<p>I will do whatever is right for Britain, I will always
stand up for British jobs, British interests, British science,
British RD, Cameron said when asked on BBC TV yesterday about
toughening up the law on takeovers. But when we think of that,
it is important to make the point that Britain benefits
massively by being an economy that''s open to overseas
investment. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the U.S. drugmaker
seeking to acquire AstraZeneca (AZN) Plc, sold $4.5 billion of bonds
to repay securities that mature within a year. </p>
<p>The offering, which was increased from $4.25 billion,
included $1.5 billion of 2.1 percent, five-year notes that
yielded 48 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Proceeds of the issue will be used to repay 900 million
euros ($1.2 billion) of 4.75 percent notes due in December, and
a portion of the company''s $3 billion of 5.35 percent notes due
March 2015, according to a regulatory filing today. </p>
<p>The bond sale comes as the biggest U.S. drugmaker is
offering about $106 billion for London-based AstraZeneca. Along
with the lower tax rate linked to AstraZeneca''s U.K. base, Chief
Executive Officer Ian Read has said the acquisition would give
New York-based Pfizer a promising new generation of experimental
cancer drugs that use the body''s own immune system to attack the
disease. </p>
<p>Read has been summoned by separate parliamentary committees
to testify on the U.S. company''s offer for AstraZeneca, amid
growing public and political concern that a takeover would mean
job losses and cuts to research. </p>
<p>In one potential scenario, a successful acquisition would
entail borrowing more than $30 billion, Carol Levenson, a
New York-based analyst at Gimme Credit LLC, wrote in a report
today. </p>
<p>Pfizer also sold $1 billion of 1.1 percent, three-year
notes at 25 basis points more than benchmarks, $1 billion of 3.4
percent, 10-year bonds at a relative yield of 80 basis points,
and $500 million of 4.4 percent, 30-year debentures with a 95
basis-point spread, Bloomberg data show. The company also issued
$500 million of three-year, floating-rate securities at 15 basis
points more than the London interbank offered rate. </p>
<p>The company''s $1 billion of 3 percent notes due 2023 fell
0.4 cent to 97.7 cents on the dollar for a yield of 3.3 percent
on May 9, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) plans to hold
some of the $3.25 billion of Argentine bonds it bought from
Repsol SA as a wager the securities will rally and hasn''t hedged
them, according to a person with direct knowledge of the bank''s
strategy. </p>
<p>JPMorgan paid $2.8 billion for the 10-year notes -- about
86.6 cents on the dollar -- with the intent to sell them at a
profit in the secondary market, said the person, who asked not
to be identified because he isn''t authorized to speak publicly
about the matter. The bank sold some of the notes today and will
keep some of the securities longer term, the person said,
without giving amounts. Veronica Espinosa, a spokeswoman at the
New York-based bank, declined to comment on the deal. </p>
<p>They''ve moved about half of the bonds to large emerging-market dedicated investors, Michael Roche, a strategist at
Seaport Global Holdings LLC, said in a telephone interview,
citing trades he''s observed. There''s just a growing desire to
gain exposure to Argentina. </p>
<p>Argentina gave the so-called Bonar bonds due 2024 to
Spanish oil company Repsol in compensation for the takeover of
51 percent of YPF SA (YPF) two years ago, in addition to bonds
maturing in 2015, 2017 and 2033 for a total face value of $5.32
billion. Repsol sold the 2024 bonds to JPMorgan and agreed not
to sell the remaining notes for seven days after the transaction
closes, according to a May 9 regulatory filing. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp., the world''s third-largest energy company by market value, became the first major
international oil producer to reveal partnership plans with
state-run Petroleos Mexicanos since Mexico signed landmark
legislation to reopen its doors to foreign producers. </p>
<p>Chevron, (CVX) which operates several rigs on the U.S. side of
the Gulf of Mexico, is in talks with Mexico City-based Pemex for
exploration opportunities in deepwater, shallow water or shale,
Ali Moshiri, Chevron''s president of Latin America and Africa,
said today during a conference in Mexico City. Chevron produces
more crude in the U.S. section of the Gulf of Mexico than anyone
except Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc, according to the U.S.
Interior Department. </p>
<p>We are not here to replace Pemex, said Moshiri, who
oversees exploration and production projects from Argentina to
Angola. We are not here to change their strategy. We are here
to complement what they are doing. </p>
<p>Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, is waiting for the
passage of Mexico''s secondary energy legislation before deciding
the sites of the first partnerships in Mexico. The legislation,
which will determine Pemex''s participation in new projects and
the tax structure for private companies joining the newly opened
energy market, could be approved as soon as June, according to
Mexico''s two largest political parties. </p>
<h2>Investment Options </h2>
<p>Mexico passed an energy law last year that ended Pemex''s
75-year production monopoly to allow for private firms to tap
the country''s 13.44 billion barrels of proven oil reserves.
Private investment is anticipated to generate an additional $30
billion annually and create as many as 2 million jobs, Mexico''s
energy ministry has said. </p>
<p>We look for the opportunity that brings the most value to
the Mexican government, the Mexican people, and our
shareholders, Moshiri said. We are a huge company. We can
invest money in conventional, deepwater, or shallow water. What
drives our decision is really to see what is the best for
everybody. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc are the world''s
first- and second-biggest energy companies by market value.
Pemex and Exxon signed a technical collaboration agreement last
year before the energy law was approved by President Enrique
Pena Nieto in December. </p>
<p>We are going to align our strategic direction in Mexico
with Pemex, Moshiri said. Our future in Mexico is based on
building this exisiting partnership. </p>
<p>Chevron added 0.2 percent to close $125.24 in New York. </p>

<p>Ramsay Health Care Ltd. (RHC), Australia''s
biggest operator of private hospitals, and Credit Agricole SA (ACA)
offered to buy most of Generale de Sante for about $1.1 billion
to gain private hospitals in France. </p>
<p>Credit Agricole Assurances and Ramsay offered 16.75 euros a
share for 83 percent of Paris-based Generale de Sante, Ramsay
said in a statement. That values the stake held by Sante SA at
about 784 million euros ($1.1 billion). The price offered is 8
percent above Generale de Sante''s close on May 9. The stock rose
to its highest level in almost six years. </p>
<p>The deal would be the latest in a string of private
hospital acquisitions in Europe. Korian in March bought Medica
SA, a French operator of nursing homes, for about 1.07 billion
euros, after Fresenius SE in February paid 3.07 billion euros
for 43 hospitals in Germany owned by Rhoen-Klinikum AG. Ramsay,
based in Sydney, has bought private hospitals in the U.K.,
France and Indonesia to help sustain profit growth, which is
slowing in its home market. </p>
<p>Ramsay Sante, the joint venture making the approach, and
its holders Ramsay and Credit Agricole Assurances, have a period
of exclusivity that runs until June 6 to conduct due diligence
and consider submitting a legally-binding offer, Ramsay said. </p>
<p>The Generale de Sante stake is held by Sante SA. DeA
Capital (DEA), an Italian private equity firm, owns 43 percent of
Sante. Mediobanca SpA (MB), Italy''s biggest publicly-traded
investment bank, holds 10 percent and the remaining 47 percent
belongs to Generale de Sante Chairman Antonino Ligresti,
according to a spokeswoman for DeA Capital. </p>
<h2>Shares Surge </h2>
<p>Generale de Sante shares rose as much as 7.9 percent to
16.73 euros in Paris, the highest level since May 27, 2008. </p>
<p>Chris Rex, Ramsay''s chief executive officer, said in
February last year that he would be willing to pay as much as
A$1 billion ($937 million) to expand the company''s geographical
reach. </p>
<p>Generale de Sante operates 75 health-care facilities in
France with about 1.7 billion euros in annual revenue and 19,000
employees, Ramsay said in the statement. </p>
<p>Under the agreement with Credit Agricole, Ramsay would pay
a maximum of 539 million euros for 57 percent of Generale de
Sante if the deal goes ahead, the company said. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) agreed to buy
Argentine government bonds from oil producer Repsol SA (REP) for $2
billion, bringing its purchases of the country''s securities to
about $5 billion in less than a week. </p>
<p>JPMorgan agreed to purchase Argentine bonds due in 2015,
2017 and 2033, Madrid-based Repsol said in a filing. The oil
company said last week that it agreed to sell Argentine
government bonds due in 2024 to JPMorgan for $2.8 billion. </p>
<p>The biggest U.S. bank is facilitating Repsol''s efforts to
reduce ties with the Argentine government, which nationalized
its 51 percent stake in local oil producer YPF SA in April 2012.
Under an agreement Repsol with the government reached earlier
this year, Repsol last week received $5.32 billion of bonds as
compensation for the seizure. </p>
<p>The transaction disclosed today is expected to be completed
by the end of this week, according to the filing. Repsol said it
sold all of its securities due in 2017 and 2033 and all but $117
million of those due in 2015. </p>
<p>Repsol previously had said it received $500 million of the
2017 securities from Argentina, $1.25 billion of the 2033 bonds
and $317 million of those due in 2015. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, which has already sold some of the Argentine

Green Mountain Inc. (GMCR)''s largest shareholder after raising its
stake to 16 percent, doubling down on the maker of Keurig coffee
brewers at a time when consumers are increasingly shunning
sugary sodas. </p>
<p>Keurig jumped 7.6 percent to $119.07 after Coca-Cola
announced the plan in a filing today. The soft-drink company
will own about 26 million shares within nine months after it
exercises an option to add additional stock. It had bought an
initial stake of 10 percent in February. </p>
<p>The investment fits into Coca-Cola''s strategy of taking
equity stakes in promising new brands and technologies as
healthier habits hits its main revenue growth. The companies are
working together on the Keurig Cold single-cup beverage system
that will be sold in Keurig''s fiscal 2015, starting later this
year. The coffee maker will also produce and sell Coca-Cola-branded pods to go with the machine. </p>
<p>The purchases demonstrate our continued belief that
Keurig Green Mountain has substantial growth potential,
Atlanta-based Coca-Cola said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Shares of Waterbury, Vermont-based Keurig have jumped 47
percent since Feb. 5, the day Coca-Cola announced it was the
buying the stake. Coca-Cola''s stock advanced 0.7 percent to
$41.11 today. </p>
<h2>SodaStream Competition </h2>
<p>Under today''s agreement, Coca-Cola owns about 19.5 million
shares and has the right to buy as much as 6.5 million more. The
company signed a pact with Credit Suisse Group AG to purchase
the balance of the stake by Feb. 13, 2015. The bank will set the
price, determined by timing and an agreed-upon formula,
according to the filing. </p>
<p>The partnership between Coca-Cola and Keurig will ratchet
up competition for SodaStream International Ltd., a Lod, Israel-based company that makes home carbonation appliances and soft-drink syrups. </p>
<p>In February, Coca-Cola bought 16.7 million newly issued
shares in Keurig for about $1.25 billion and said it had the
option to raise the stake to as much as 16 percent during the
first 36 months. Amanda Rosseter, a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola,
declined to elaborate on the timing of the agreement beyond the
filing. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola previously took equity stakes in Zico coconut
water and Honest Tea, and helped incubate them. Coca-Cola
eventually acquired all of Zico and Honest. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola''s investment in Keurig could be seen as a
precursor to an eventual acquisition, though not right away, Ali Dibadj, a New York-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co.,
said last month. </p>
<p>Keurig, which changed its name from Green Mountain Coffee
Roasters Inc. in March, has been speculated as a takeover
candidate for at least three years, in part because of its rapid
growth. </p>

<p>International Business Machines (IBM) Corp.
Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty will face a skeptical
audience when she speaks to Wall Street analysts tomorrow. </p>
<p>As she''s worked to revamp the company in a shifting
technology industry, Rometty has kept herself bound to IBM''s
target of at least $18 a share in adjusted earnings this year --
a number that 60 percent of analysts anticipate the company will
miss. After eight consecutive quarters of revenue declines, she
must start increasing sales or reduce expenses further to avoid
missing the profit goals. </p>
<p>At a daylong conference in New York, Rometty, 56, will
probably lay out her plan to use newer technology, such as data
analytics and cloud computing, to mount a strong comeback in the
coming quarters. The question is whether those lines of business
can expand quickly enough to make up for falling sales in IBM''s
hardware unit and in emerging markets like China. </p>
<p>There has to be intense pressure on her to carry out the
execution of the plan, Bill Kreher, an analyst at Edward Jones
 Co., said in an interview from St. Louis. The concern is
largely about the way to get there. He advises buying the
shares and estimates IBM will hit the $18 target. </p>
<p>Mike Fay, an IBM spokesman, declined to comment. </p>
<p>We''re transitioning to key growth areas and transforming
parts of the business, Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter said on a conference call last month. We''re
continuing to make investments in key growth areas such as
mobility, security and cloud, and these initiatives are gaining
traction but are not yet at scale. </p>
<p>Abandon Roadmap? </p>
<p>Those changes need to happen more quickly, and Rometty
should consider dropping her earnings targets so she can focus
on the transition, said Ben Reitzes, an analyst at Barclays Plc. </p>
<p>Given the deterioration in earnings quality and revenue
challenges, we believe it makes sense for IBM to abandon its
roadmap and change its business model, he said in a research
note. The company needs to more aggressively shift to providing
technology as a service rather than a product, he said. He has
the equivalent of a neutral rating and estimates IBM will report
adjusted earnings of $17.80 this year, short of its target. </p>
<p>IBM shares are up 2.5 percent this year, in line with the
Standard  Poor''s 500 Index. They fell less than 1 percent to
$192.19 at the close today in New York. Eight analysts advise
buying the stock, while 24 say to hold and three recommend
selling. </p>
<p>After a 30-year career at IBM, Rometty stepped into the
role of CEO in 2012 amid sweeping changes in the industry. Her
company is still adjusting to the upheaval in the technology
world. </p>
<p>Technology customers are increasingly storing data and
software on cloud-computing networks, rather than on site,
limiting their need for servers and mainframes and the IBM
consultants needed to install and maintain them. While the
company has shifted its focus to cloud services and data
analytics to keep up, the effort has not been enough to
reinvigorate sales growth. </p>
<h2>Hardware Slump </h2>
<p>Lagging demand for IBM''s hardware division continues to
drag down revenue, with the unit''s sales falling 23 percent to
$2.4 billion in the first quarter. Revenue in developing
countries slid 11 percent, or 5 percent when adjusting for
currency fluctuations. Revenue from China fell 20 percent. </p>
<p>Tomorrow''s meeting with analysts gives Rometty and her
executive team a chance to show how their more recent
investments will produce more revenue. </p>
<p>IBM has implemented significant actions as it shifts
toward a higher valued-added mix; by no means is the company
standing still, Jim Kelleher, an analyst at Argus Research in
New York, said in a note. IBM has also shown an ability to
align costs in periods of challenging revenue growth. He has a
hold rating on the shares and estimates IBM will fall short of
its target with earnings of $17.96 a share this year. </p>
<h2>New Products </h2>
<p>The company will probably highlight newer products tomorrow
like the cloud offerings from SoftLayer Technologies Inc., which
it acquired last year, or the Watson cognitive-computing tool,
said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co.
In a note to investors, he questioned whether those initiatives
are incremental for the company or can actually help boost sales
growth. He has the equivalent of a hold rating on the shares and
estimates IBM will hit its $18 target. </p>
<h2>Cloud Promise </h2>
<p>IBM has held up cloud computing as one of its biggest
opportunities for growth. Cloud revenue grew more than 50
percent last quarter, and cloud offerings delivered as a service
are now on pace to generate about $2.3 billion a year. That''s
still a fraction of IBM''s total $100 billion in annual sales. </p>
<p>While it searches for growth, IBM is also cutting expenses
and shedding less profitable businesses. Earlier this year,
China''s Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) agreed to buy IBM''s low-end server
business for $2.3 billion. The deal is awaiting government
review before closing, and the companies must convince U.S.
officials that the transaction won''t give China back-door access
to secrets and infrastructure. </p>
<h2>Job Cuts </h2>
<p>Lower tax rates have also helped profits continue to grow,
and a surge in buybacks has helped IBM hit its targets for
earnings per share. It also took an $870 million charge last
quarter to cut jobs, and has changed the information it provides
in U.S. severance packages in a way that may help reduce age-discrimination lawsuits, according to lawyers and labor law
experts. IBM said the changes were made to protect worker
privacy. </p>
<p>The company''s cost-cutting moves helped lift adjusted
profit to $16.28 a share last year, up 40 percent from 2010. </p>
<p>For this year, the average estimate of 25 analysts is for
$17.88 a share in adjusted earnings, less than the company''s $18
target. Next year''s average analyst estimate of $19.79 a share
also falls short of a $20 goal. </p>
<p>IBM has said it can meet its forecasts, even as costs mount
in its pursuit of the goals. IBM''s debt has climbed, and its
cash balance has dropped, partly because of spending on stock
repurchases -- spending that could have gone to acquisitions or
other investments. </p>
<p>Some Wall Street analysts, such as Morningstar Inc.''s Peter Wahlstrom, argue that Rometty shouldn''t be trying to hit the
targets. Yardsticks like revenue and free cash flow are more
important than earnings per share anyway, Wahlstrom said. He has
a hold rating and estimates IBM''s adjusted earnings will fall
short of the target at $17.47 a share this year. </p>
<p>Those are things that can be kind of managed, he said
of earnings per share. You don''t really give a company credit
for that. </p>
<p>Numbers to watch include: </p>
<p>*Free cash flow: CFO Schroeter said last month that the company
expects at least $16 billion for the year, up from $15 billion
in 2013. </p>
<p>Given that non-operating forces have a limited impact on
FCF vs. EPS (buybacks, tax rate, one-time gains, etc), we expect
investors to remain focused on this metric and to look for both
upside and downside risk at the analyst day, Bernstein''s
Sacconaghi said in a note. </p>
<p>*Acquisitions: IBM said in 2010 it planned to spend $20 billion
on acquisitions through 2015. With revenue declining, some
analysts say a large acquisition could be warranted. </p>
<p>Given the ongoing challenges with weak organic revenue
(especially in hardware), IBM may need to do a large deal to
help stabilize the revenue, Reitzes of Barclays said in a
note. </p>
<p>*Growth markets: IBM has said it expects emerging markets to
approach 30 percent of revenue in 2015. Last year, the markets
made up 23 percent of total sales after falling 4.9 percent
year-over-year. </p>
<p>We also expect to hear about IBM''s growth markets and
what changes have been put in place to stimulate revenue
growth, Reitzes said in a note. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chief Executive Officer Ian Read refused to be pinned down on his commitment to preserve jobs in the U.K. as skeptical lawmakers grilled him about the company''s unsolicited offer for AstraZeneca Plc. (AZN) </p> <p>AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot followed Read, telling the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee he couldn''t rule out accepting an offer from Pfizer. The U.S. company plans to sweeten the 60.4-billion-pound ($101.9 billion) bid for a second time, people with knowledge of the matter said.

Pfizer reiterated its pledge to keep 20 percent of its global research and development workforce in the U.K. and maintain AstraZeneca''s factory in Macclesfield. The company would reduce employment after the acquisition, Read said, though when questioned he wouldn''t say if that means Pfizer could cut science jobs in the U.K. </p> <p>The commitment of 20 percent of a global company''s RD is an unprecedented commitment, said Read. It''s a substantial commitment. </p> <p>U.K. politicians, led by Prime Minister David Cameron, have said they want New York-based Pfizer to do more to ensure it will protect British jobs and science. Business Secretary Vince Cable told the committee the government is considering legislation that would allow it to intervene in the transaction. </p>

<p>Anthony Noto, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc.''s head banker on Twitter Inc.''s initial public offering
last year, is leaving to join hedge-fund firm Coatue Management
LLC. </p>
<p>Dan Dees, who became co-head of technology, media and
telecommunications banking with Noto earlier this year, will
become sole leader of the group, according to an internal memo.
David Wells, a spokesman for the New York-based firm, confirmed
the contents of the memo. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs was the top-ranked adviser on mergers and
acquisitions involving technology, media and telecommunications
companies last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Noto, 46, rejoined the firm in 2010 after leaving in 2008 to
become chief financial officer of the National Football League. </p>
<p>Coatue, which manages about $9.2 billion, was founded in
1999 by Philippe Laffont, who worked for Julian Robertson at
Tiger Management LLC, according to a regulatory filing last
month. Coatue managed the 20th-most-profitable hedge fund in the
world last year, according to Bloomberg Rankings. The New York-based firm has made investments in technology companies such as
Snapchat Inc. and Flipboard Inc. </p>
<p>Anthony is a key addition to our private investing
effort, helping us build on the momentum we have established,
Laffont said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Noto''s move was reported earlier today by website Re/Code. </p>
<h2>Big Personalities'' </h2>
<p>Simon Holden, Nick Giovanni and Michael Ronen will become
co-chief operating officers of the group at Goldman Sachs,
according to the memo. Holden runs the telecommunications sector
and leads the TMT group in Europe. Giovanni is head of the
Internet sector, while Ronen leads the media and
telecommunications MA business in the Americas. </p>
<p>Dees was co-head of the investment-banking division for
Asia Pacific ex-Japan before moving back to the U.S. to take the
TMT job. George Lee and Gene Sykes will remain co-chairmen of
the TMT group, according to a memo sent by investment banking
co-heads Richard Gnodde, David Solomon and John Weinberg. </p>
<p>Deals in technology, media and telecom are really
interesting to the world, they involve really big
personalities, Lee said in a March interview. It''s a big
revenue and profit contributor, and it''s so high-profile that
our success there has an overweight impact on the way people
perceive our overall franchise. </p>
<h2>West Point </h2>
<p>Noto, a football player at the U.S. Military Academy at
West Point, New York, trained to be a member of the Army Rangers
and spent time in the Middle East while serving as a signal
officer in the infantry. He was a research analyst covering
Internet companies in his first stint at Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>Since returning to the firm, Noto has competed with Morgan
Stanley (MS) for the lead spot on a string of high-profile IPOs.
Goldman Sachs led the offerings for Yelp Inc. and Twitter, while
Morgan Stanley won the prime spot on LinkedIn Corp. and Facebook
Inc. </p>
<p>My last four years at Goldman Sachs have been as equally
rewarding as the first nine years, Noto said in an e-mailed
statement. The TMT franchise has never been stronger and I
look forward to seeing the continued success of such a fantastic
team and to working with the firm as a client. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) introduced a lower-priced option for its Xbox One, seeking to take back the lead in
video-game console sales from Sony Corp. (6758) </p>
<p>The new version, which will cost $399 and won''t include the
Kinect motion-sensing camera, will be available on June 9 in all
markets where Xbox One is available, the Redmond, Washington-based company said in a statement today. </p>
<p>The move reverses a controversial decision by Microsoft to
bundle Xbox One with Kinect, increasing the price of the console
to $499, or $100 more than Sony''s PlayStation 4. Although
Microsoft had insisted it needed Kinect to convince game
developers to write software for the motion sensor, Sony''s big
lead is prompting Microsoft to change its strategy. The
PlayStation 4 outsold Xbox One consoles in the U.S. in March,
holding the lead for a third month. </p>
<p>The vision we have had for Xbox One continues, and that
is that the premium experience is with Kinect, Yusuf Mehdi,
Xbox vice president for strategy and marketing, said in an
interview. We did get a lot of customer feedback since launch
from people saying I''d like more choices,'' and for some people
$399 is an important price point, </p>
<p>Microsoft will also start giving users more access to
entertainment applications such as YouTube, Netflix and HBO GO,
changing another policy that annoyed customers. The company had
required users to pay for an Xbox Live Gold subscription to use
such apps. Starting in June, anyone with an Xbox One and Xbox
360 can use those apps. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is betting the
world''s biggest bond gains are far from over. </p>
<p>The New York-based bank bought $3.25 billion of Argentine
bonds from Repsol SA (REP) as a wager the notes will rally and hasn''t
hedged them, according to a person with direct knowledge of the
bank''s strategy. It paid $2.8 billion for the 10-year debt, or
about 86.6 cents on the dollar, and will keep some of the bonds
longer-term, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because he wasn''t authorized to speak publicly about the matter. </p>
<p>Argentina''s bonds, rated seven levels below investment
grade, have soared 46 percent in the past year, the most among
emerging-market government debt, as the country repairs ties
with the International Monetary Fund and seeks to stem a drop in
the foreign reserves it uses to pay debt. The government gave
the Bonar notes due in 2024 to Madrid-based Repsol as
compensation after seizing 51 percent of YPF SA two years ago,
as part of a package with a total face value of $5.32 billion. </p>
<p>People were aching to be a part of the Argentine story,
Patrick Esteruelas, senior sovereign analyst at Emso Partners
Ltd., which oversees about $2 billion, said in an interview in
New York. It''s a junk credit, but it''s a credit that people
are evaluating as part of a broad convergence play. </p>
<h2>Repsol Deal </h2>
<p>JPMorgan sold some of the notes and will keep some with the
intent to sell at a profit, the person said, without giving
amounts. Veronica Espinosa, a spokeswoman for the bank, declined
to comment on the deal. </p>
<p>Repsol sold the 2024 bonds to JPMorgan and agreed not to
sell the remaining notes for seven days after the transaction
closes, according to a May 9 regulatory filing. </p>
<p>JPMorgan sold some of the 2024 securities for about 86.75
cents on the dollar to at least two investment firms, according
to two people familiar with the transactions. The 8.75 percent
notes were trading late yesterday at 88.35 cents on the dollar,
with a yield of 10.7 percent. </p>
<p>Given prices on other Argentine government bonds, the 2024
notes should be about 8 cents higher at 96.5 cents on the dollar
with a yield of 9.4 percent, according to a May 12 report by
Citigroup Inc. strategists Jeff Williams and Guillermo Mondino. </p>
<p>Argentina''s notes due in 2017 traded at 92.4 cents on the
dollar with a 10.3 percent yield. </p>
<h2>Steady Increase'' </h2>
<p>JPMorgan, which opened its first office in Buenos Aires in
1978, sold about half of the bonds, according to Michael Roche,
a strategist at Seaport Global Holdings LLC, citing trades he''s
observed. The country hasn''t issued international bonds since it
defaulted on $95 billion of debt in 2001. It restructured 93
percent of the debt in swaps in 2005 and 2010. </p>
<p>They''ve demonstrated that they''re able to access
international capital markets, Roche said in a telephone
interview from New York. We''re continuing to see a steady
increase in the breadth of investors interested in getting
exposure to Argentina. </p>
<p>Joshua Rosner, managing director and bank analyst at Graham
Fisher  Co., said JPMorgan is making a risky bet. </p>
<p>They may be betting that the government will ultimately
act rationally, he said in a telephone interview from New
York. If they didn''t hedge it, and are holding this for their
own portfolios, it''s a wildly risky thing to do especially given
the statements and actions of the government. </p>
<h2>Regime Change </h2>
<p>Since taking office in 2007, President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has also seized $24 billion of private pension funds
and flagship airline Aerolineas Argentinas SA. The country still
hasn''t settled claims with defaulted-debt creditors demanding
full payment. </p>
<p>Fernandez''s efforts to mend ties with overseas creditors
and the prospect of a new government after elections next year
will spark further bond gains, Seaport Global''s Roche said. </p>
<p>Argentina revamped its economic data indexes earlier this
year at the behest of the IMF, which had censured the country
for inaccurate inflation and growth figures in 2013. It has also
settled with five companies in the World Bank''s arbitration arm
and is in negotiations with the Paris Club of creditors. </p>
<p>Investors are pretty convinced that a new political force
at the new elections will continue to normalize the country''s
relations with international investors, Roche said. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) pressed its case for

discuss Pfizer''s pursuit of the country''s second-biggest
drugmaker. </p>
<p>In a presentation to AstraZeneca shareholders published

would create an industry leader with scale and operational
efficiency as well as a broader portfolio of experimental
medicines. AstraZeneca faces challenges as a standalone company,
including the declining revenue from products losing patent
protection, Pfizer said. </p>
<p>The offer proposed by Pfizer on May 2, which AstraZeneca
rejected as undervaluing the company, was based solely on public
information, Pfizer said today in a statement. Talks between the
companies would enable AstraZeneca''s management to provide
Pfizer with a better understanding of the company, Pfizer said. </p>

AstraZeneca can recommend, Pfizer said. Pfizer will continue

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chief Executive Officer
Ian Read told the governors of Maryland and Delaware it''s too
soon to determine what effect the company''s bid for AstraZeneca
Plc (AZN) will have on jobs and manufacturing in their states. </p>
<p>AstraZeneca, the U.K.''s second-biggest drugmaker, rejected
an offer of about $106 billion from Pfizer earlier this month,
saying the New York-based pharmaceutical company wasn''t offering
enough. Pfizer is planning to increase its bid, said people with
knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified because
the information is private. </p>
<p>Pfizer, the biggest U.S.-based drugmaker, said it would
shift its legal address to the U.K. to reap tax benefits if the
deal goes through. Maryland Governor Martin O''Malley and
Delaware Governor Jack Markell wrote Read last week asking what
assurances he could give them for the 5,700 AstraZeneca workers
in their states. Pfizer already has pledged to keep at least
one-fifth of the companies'' research units and a substantial
manufacturing presence in the U.K. for at least five years. </p>
<p>Because we are in the very early stages of our proposal
and are not in direct discussions, it is premature to speculate
on any specific impact this would have on jobs and facilities in
any given state, Read said in letters dated yesterday to the
two Democratic governors. I can tell you that Pfizer will
continue to perform operational, research and manufacturing
activity and will continue to have a significant number of
employees in the U.S. </p>
<p>Maryland''s U.S. congressional delegation sent its own
letter to Read yesterday expressing concern that there may be
job losses among AstraZeneca''s 3,000-plus employees in the
state. </p>
<h2>Similar Assurances'' </h2>
<p>As you evaluate your next steps, we ask you to extend
similar assurances to those you gave in the U.K. to the research
and development workforce in Maryland, wrote U.S. Senators
Barbara Mikulski and Benjamin Cardin and Representatives C.A. Dutch'' Ruppersberger, Chris Van Hollen, John Sarbanes and John Delaney. AstraZeneca and its MedImmune subsidiary have strong
presences in the state, and their workforces are highly skilled
and extremely effective. </p>

<p>Katsunori Sago, deputy president of
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s Japanese unit, will leave the firm
where he began his career 22 years ago. </p>
<p>Sago, 46, will resign from his post in June and serve as an
advisory director and vice chairman until he departs by March
31, Hiroko Matsumoto, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman, said by phone
today. The company has no plan to fill the deputy president
position, she said. </p>
<p>Among his roles, Sago served as co-chairman of the bank''s
diversity committee in Asia. Goldman Sachs formed a daycare
center in Tokyo in 2009 and has been running a campaign under
the banner Womenomics to urge Japan''s government and
companies to promote women in the workplace. </p>
<p>Two women were among nine Japan employees who were promoted
to managing director in January, according to the Wall Street

<p>Sago is also head of the company''s securities division in
Japan. That post will be filled by Mark Agne and Hidehiro Imatsu, according to an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg

<p>Sago joined Goldman Sachs in Tokyo in 1992 after graduating
from the University of Tokyo''s engineering school. He worked in
fixed-income trading and became a managing director in 1999
before joining the Japan unit''s board in 2007. </p>

<p>Morgans Hotel Group Co. (MHGC) investors
elected seven of the nine board members proposed by the New
York-based company and two nominated by stakeholder Kerrisdale
Capital Management LLC, according to preliminary results. </p>
<p>The board members elected include Marty Edelman, Michelle
Russo and Derex Walker, Morgans Chairman Jason Kalisman said
today in a statement. John Brecker and Andrew Broad, nominated
by Kerrisdale in March, were also chosen, Morgans said. </p>
<p>Kerrisdale and Ron Burkle''s Yucaipa Cos., an investor in
Morgans through holdings of preferred stock, notes and warrants,
have been lobbying to overturn the current board and have pushed
for a sale of the company. In March, Kerrisdale proposed a new
slate of candidates who are committed to exploring strategic
alternatives in a robust and transparent manner. </p>
<p>Kalisman said today that we have received constructive
feedback from our stockholders, and our board looks forward to
continuing that open dialogue. </p>
<p>Proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis  Co. earlier this month
recommended that investors vote for Brecker and Broad. Morgans,
which operates boutique hotels including the Mondrian in Los
Angeles and the Delano in Miami''s South Beach, has lost money
each quarter since 2007, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Purchase Offer </h2>
<p>In October, Burkle sent a letter to the Morgans board
expressing a desire to make a proposal to the board to
purchase the company for $8 per share. Yucaipa also encouraged
Morgans to seek other bids to see if a higher price can be
obtained. </p>
<p>Morgans has hired Morgan Stanley to help explore strategic
alternatives, including a sale, according to a statement
yesterday. Earlier this year, the company said it would cut
jobs, resulting in about $8 million of annual savings. </p>
<p>Morgans fell 3.2 percent to $7.81 today. The stock has
gained 4.6 percent since last year''s board election, on June 14. </p>

<p>AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) Chief Executive
Officer Pascal Soriot said a sale of the U.K. drugmaker is not
inevitable, increasing pressure on Pfizer Inc. to raise its
60.4 billion-pound ($101 billion) offer to kick-start talks. </p>
<p>The price is really far from what we think the value of
the company is, Soriot said today in a telephone interview.
Because Pfizer is offering stock as part of the deal,
AstraZeneca would also need assurances about the future of the
new company before agreeing to negotiate, he said. </p>
<p>Soriot''s comments may increase speculation that New York-based Pfizer will take its offer directly to AstraZeneca
shareholders. The proposed takeover is facing skepticism from
U.K. lawmakers concerned about possible job cuts and Pfizer (PFE)''s
unwillingness to commit to preserving the workforce of the
country''s second-biggest drugmaker. Pfizer CEO Ian Read said it
was difficult to make more specific guarantees because
AstraZeneca hasn''t engaged in talks. </p>
<p>Read and Soriot both appeared before parliamentary
committees yesterday and today to answer questions about
consequences of the acquisition. With their testimony behind
them, the focus is shifting to Pfizer''s next move. Pfizer plans
to raise its offer, people with knowledge of the matter said. </p>
<p>A takeover could distract London-based AstraZeneca from
advancing its pipeline of experimental drugs, and even more so
were Pfizer to make a hostile bid, Soriot said. </p>
<h2>Drug Pipeline </h2>
<p>The risks are exacerbated in a hostile situation, he
said in the interview. Any merger of this magnitude is
disruptive and that''s why we would want to discuss strategy, the
operating model and how we would go about merging these
companies, if we ever get to this. </p>
<p>Pfizer would try to protect AstraZeneca''s most valuable
products in a takeover and wouldn''t jeopardize the pipeline,
Read said to the Science and Technology committee today. </p>
<p>There''s no truth that products of a critical nature would
be delayed getting to patients, Read said. If anything, we
would accelerate those products. </p>
<p>Pfizer urged AstraZeneca to engage in talks so that the two
companies could reach an agreement. </p>
<p>Pfizer contacted AstraZeneca last year to discuss a
purchase, and Chairman Leif Johansson and Soriot flew to New
York to meet with Pfizer, which made the initial bid of about
46.61 pounds a share, Soriot said. </p>
<h2>Lower Offer </h2>
<p>The subsequent cash-and-stock offer initially valued the
company at about 50 pounds a share and now has a value of 47.83
pounds a share. AstraZeneca rose 0.3 percent to 46.54 pounds at
the close of trading in London. </p>
<p>The offer today is 48 pounds, Soriot said. The offer
is hardly different from the January price, but in the meantime,
our pipeline has progressed quite a lot. I don''t see why we
would accept today what we didn''t think was the right price in
January. </p>
<p>None of AstraZeneca''s shareholders have pressed him to
accept the current offer, said Soriot, who is on the company''s
board of directors. </p>
<p>Of course, shareholders will tell us, but they don''t even
need to tell us, that if the appropriate offer was made, we
should consider the offer, he said. But we know this and we
certainly agree. </p>

<p>Three oil fields operated by Exxon
Mobil (XOM) Corp. in the Norwegian North Sea could be shut by a strike
if mediation with a union over pensions fails, cutting about
50,000 barrels of crude output a day. </p>
<p>The Safe union will order as many as 154 offshore-platform
workers to walk out if the talks fail, paralyzing production at
the Ringhorne, Jotun and Balder fields, the group''s leader
Hilde-Marit Rysst said by phone. Though the date for a possible
walkout has been set at June 16, a strike could start earlier or
later, depending on the date of the mediation, which has yet to
be scheduled, she said. </p>
<p>We expect Exxon to take the hint, Rysst said. We
expect this to be dealt with either before or during the
mediation. </p>
<p>Safe and another oil-worker union broke off talks over
pensions last week, raising the risk of a strike two years after
the same issue triggered the longest ever labor action by
platform employees and reduced output by western Europe''s
biggest oil and gas producer. The government used its power to
stop the strike as a lockout by oil companies threatened to shut
production entirely. </p>
<p>The three Exxon fields, including satellite Ringhorne East,
produced about 50,000 barrels of oil a day in 2013, according to
figures from the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate. </p>
<p>Exxon has a 100 percent stake in the Balder and Ringhorne
fields, while it holds 77.4 percent in Ringhorne East, which is
tied in to the Balder and Jotun installations. Exxon holds 45
percent in Jotun, where other partners include Dana Petroleum
Plc with 45 percent. </p>
<p>Safe is targeting Exxon specifically because the company
has yet to implement an early-pension plan for 31 employees that
are members of the union, it said in a statement. </p>
<p>The pension plan isn''t an issue that should be discussed in
wage talks, Exxon spokesman Knut Riple said by phone, echoing
the position held by the organization representing employers,
the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association. Exxon declined to say
whether there was room to meet Safe''s demands, he said. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) agreed to buy
Argentine government bonds from oil producer Repsol SA (REP) for $2
billion, bringing its purchases of the Latin American country''s
securities to almost $5 billion in the past week. </p>
<p>The bank will buy Argentine bonds due in 2015, 2017 and
2033, Madrid-based Repsol said yesterday in a regulatory filing.
The oil company agreed last week to sell new Argentine bonds due
in 2024 to JPMorgan for $2.8 billion. Those bonds have since
rallied 1.7 cents on the dollar. </p>
<p>The biggest U.S. bank is facilitating Repsol''s efforts to
reduce ties with the Argentine government, which nationalized
its 51 percent stake in local oil producer YPF SA in April 2012.
Under an agreement reached with the government earlier this
year, Repsol received bonds last week with a face value of $5.32
billion as compensation. </p>
<p>JPMorgan has now bought almost all of that. The New York-based bank, which has already sold some of the Argentine bonds
received from the first purchase, is wagering that the remaining
holdings will gain in value, a person with direct knowledge of
the bank''s strategy said earlier this week. </p>
<p>Veronica Navarro Espinosa, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan,
declined to comment. </p>
<p>Argentina''s bonds, rated seven levels below investment
grade, have soared 46 percent in the past year, the most in
emerging markets, as the country took steps to repair ties with
international investors, including Repsol and the International
Monetary Fund. </p>
<h2>Riskiest Debt </h2>
<p>The country''s debt is still considered risky, with the cost
of five-year protection in the credit-default swaps market at
1,567 basis points, according to CMA, the highest in the world.
The country hasn''t sold bonds directly to international markets
since a $95 billion default in 2001, and it''s locked in a
dispute with some creditors in a case now before the U.S.
Supreme Court. </p>
<p>The transaction disclosed yesterday is expected to be
completed by May 16, according to the filing. </p>
<p>The sale included all of Repsol''s Argentine securities due
in 2017 and 2033 and all except $117 million of those due in
2015, known as Bodens, according to the filing. </p>
<p>Boden bonds maturing 2015 gained 0.20 cent to 97.65 cents
on the dollar at 9:31 a.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Repsol previously said it had $500 million of the 2017
securities, $1.25 billion of the 2033 bonds and $317 million of
the 2015 debt. All the securities are governed by Argentine law. </p>

<p>After a rough ride in front of the
U.K. Parliament''s Business Committee yesterday, Pfizer Inc. (PFE)
Chief Executive Officer Ian Read got gentler treatment from its
science and technology panel today over his plan to take over
AstraZeneca Plc. (AZN) </p>
<p>There was a smaller audience for the hearing in London,
with empty seats compared with the standing-room-only session
the previous day. It was still a larger one than the committee
chairman, Andrew Miller, was used to. A lot of people are
interested, he commented, looking around. </p>
<p>Much of the questioning focused on how a merged company
would look. Read said it would enable us to be competitive.
Testifying separately later for AstraZeneca, CEO Pascal Soriot
argued it was a little bit more complicated than putting two
pieces of paper together. </p>
<p>While neither committee has any formal influence over a
possible takeover, both show how much Pfizer is operating in an
atmosphere of anxiety about its offer of more than $100 billion,
which AstraZeneca has rebuffed. With European and local
elections next week, the bid has been pushed to the center of
British political debate and dominated Prime Minister David Cameron''s questions session in the House of Commons today for
the second week running. </p>
<p>There was little fresh argument today from either side.
Read said there was no truth in yesterday''s suggestion from
AstraZeneca that a merger would delay the development of life-saving drugs. Such work would be ring-fenced, he said. </p>
<h2>Lose Momentum'' </h2>
<p>Soriot replied that mergers cause anxiety, with scientists
not sure if their job will exist tomorrow. In such a
situation, he said, you can quickly lose momentum. </p>
<p>Jim Dowd, a lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party,
which has opposed the takeover, again raised Pfizer''s record in
Sweden, where it closed a research center after a takeover.
Why do people say your word''s not to be trusted? he asked. </p>
<p>People who talk to me don''t say my word''s not to be
trusted, Read replied. I''d like people to tell me a
commitment Pfizer hasn''t met. </p>
<p>Soriot was questioned by Miller about why a merger would be
more disruptive than his own plan to move research from
Manchester, in England''s northwest, to Cambridge in the east.
Mene Pangalos, AstraZeneca''s vice president in charge of
development and a former Pfizer executive, said the two
companies had entirely different research structures. </p>
<p>Soriot declined to say whether the government should
intervene to block the takeover. I''m a biologist, I just try
to do my job, he said. I''m not a policy maker. </p>
<p>Last to appear before the panel was Science Minister David Willetts, who insisted he was optimistic about the future,
whatever the outcome. </p>
<h2>Sandwich Success </h2>
<p>Asked about Pfizer''s 2011 decision to close its Sandwich
plant in southeast England, he said it had worked out well
thanks to government intervention. </p>
<p>There was a nightmare scenario where that would end up as
an empty building, with a padlock swinging in the wind, he
said. We''ve ended up instead with a discovery park with 40
tenants. </p>
<p>Willetts argued that while the government was pressing
very hard for Pfizer commitments, there was no need for
national pessimism because Britain was known as a great
place for science. </p>
<p>You''d be idiotic if you weren''t doing research and
development in the U.K. -- it''s a great place, Willetts told
the committee. </p>
<p>We''re all proud, Tory lawmaker Sarah Newton replied. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chief Executive Officer
Ian Read fought back against accusations that his bid for
AstraZeneca Plc would harm patients and damage science in the
U.K. as he faced Parliament for a second day. </p>
<p>AstraZeneca has resisted the 60.4-billion-pound ($101.9
billion) offer, and said yesterday that the disruption of a
buyout could jeopardize its pipeline of experimental drugs. </p>
<p>There''s no truth that products of a critical nature would
be delayed getting to patients, Read told the Science and
Technology Committee. If anything, we would accelerate those
products. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s proposed takeover is facing skepticism from U.K.
lawmakers concerned by possible job cuts and the company''s
unwillingness to commit to preserving AstraZeneca''s workforce.
Pfizer said it would maintain 20 percent of its global research
and development employees in the U.K. for five years, without
specifying the number of jobs. Read said the merger would result
in job cuts and a reduction in total RD spending. </p>
<p>I suspect the combined research budget will go down,
Read said. I suspect there will be less scientists than the
natural arithmetic combination of the two. </p>
<p>The combined company would be more efficient and more
productive, and reflects the changing shape of the industry as
governments pressure drug companies to reduce costs, he said. </p>

<p>Commodities as an asset class remain
appealing as the global economic recovery extends into 2015,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>The bank raised its 12-month allocation for commodities to
neutral from underweight, analysts led by Jeffrey Currie and
Damien Courvalin wrote in a report dated yesterday. They
increased their three and six-month price forecasts for nickel
and rolled the 12-month predictions for aluminum and zinc
forward to higher levels. </p>
<p>Raw materials as measured by total returns on the Standard
 Poor''s GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index added 4.2 percent this
year as global equities increased 2.3 percent and the Bloomberg
U.S. Treasury Bond Index rose 2.7 percent. Citigroup Inc. said
last month it was time to take commodities seriously again to
diversify investment portfolios after they beat equities and
bonds in the first quarter. </p>
<p>Commodities have been caught in a tug of war, the
Goldman Sachs analysts wrote. As the global business cycle
shifts into an expansion phase over the next few years we expect
commodity performance to improve. </p>
<p>Total returns for the enhanced index may be zero percent
over the next three months and decline 2.2 percent over 12
months, according to the bank. It expected the gauge to drop 4
percent over 12 months in an April 13 note. </p>
<h2>Asset Market </h2>
<p>We continue to believe the commodity super cycle is
over, Aakash Doshi, a Citigroup Global Markets vice president
in New York, said in a telephone interview on March 28. That
doesn''t mean that there is going to be an absence of seasonality
and cyclical turns in the asset market. </p>
<p>A Barclays survey published in an April 4 report showed 54
percent of investors planned to boost their stake in commodities
in the next 12 months versus 27 percent who did in the preceding
year, according to analysts led by Kevin Norrish. </p>
<p>There has been little clear directionality in commodity
markets over the past month, the Goldman analysts said. Tension
in Ukraine has supported corn and wheat even as global
agriculture stockpiles remain elevated, while weakness in the
Chinese property sector weighed on copper amid a seasonal pick-up in demand, they said. </p>
<p>As growth accelerates, supply and demand fundamentals in
base metals are expected to tighten by the middle of next year,
the bank said. It raised its six-month forecast for nickel to
$22,000 a metric ton from $20,000 amid supply disruptions at
Vale SA''s New Caledonia plant, Indonesia''s ban on ore exports
and tension between Russia and Ukraine. </p>
<p>Goldman kept its 12-month nickel target at $16,000 as
Chinese producers will probably increase blast furnace nickel

<p>Banks are issuing lower-ranked bonds
and preferred securities in the U.S. at the fastest pace since
the financial crisis, capitalizing on yield-starved investors to
satisfy regulatory requirements. </p>
<p>Financial institutions including JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and
Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) are meeting demands to raise more capital by
selling $31.8 billion of subordinated debt and preferred shares
this year, with $22.7 billion in March and April alone,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The pace of issuance is
the fastest since 2008. </p>
<p>Lenders need to sell the notes in part because new
regulations designed to make banks safer have rendered a
previously popular form -- called trust-preferred securities --
useless for capital purposes, ruling it must be replaced by
2016. Now that banks'' creditworthiness has improved, investors
are snapping up the offerings because they can pay more than one
percentage point of extra interest over senior bonds that rank
higher for repayment in a bankruptcy. </p>
<p>From an investor perspective, it is incremental yield in
a historically low-rate environment, Pri de Silva, an analyst
at New York-based CreditSights Inc., said in a May 6 telephone
interview. The credit profiles of banks are a lot better now
than they were in the pre-crisis days. </p>
<h2>Losing Funding </h2>
<p>Wells Fargo in April sold $2 billion of 5.9 percent
perpetual securities after initially marketing the debt with a
higher coupon of as much as 6.125 percent, Bloomberg data show.
The notes offered interest payments of more than two percentage
points above the 3 percent senior notes due in 2021 that the San
Francisco-based bank sold in January. </p>
<p>Subordinated debt and preferred shares are replacing trust-preferred securities, known as TruPS, which were popular before
the crisis in part because interest payments were tax-deductible. About $149 billion were outstanding at the end of
2008, according to Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia data. </p>
<p>Banks could also count TruPS as Tier 1 capital because they
allowed issuers to stop paying interest and were supposed to act
as a buffer against potential losses. Lenders proved reluctant
to suspend payments during the crisis because those that did
risked losing other funding on concerns about their solvency. </p>
<h2>New Regulations </h2>
<p>U.S. regulators, implementing the international Basel III
accord and U.S. Dodd-Frank Act, have ruled that banks with
assets of more than $15 billion can''t count TruPS as Tier 1
capital anymore. They have until 2016 to replace the securities,
and common equity and preferred shares are the main types that
count as Tier 1 capital. Subordinated debt counts as Tier 2
capital, which banks are also required to maintain. </p>
<p>Attention in Europe has focused on additional Tier 1 notes,
a similar-level as preferred shares in the U.S., where issuance
has soared this year to $25.7 billion, Bloomberg data show. A
total of $36.5 billion of the debt is outstanding. </p>
<p>Under the new rules, there is a space in the capital
structure that could be filled with subordinated debt, common
equity or preferred equity, de Silva said. The latter two
are generally more expensive, so in order to meet that capital
need cost-effectively, they have been issuing subordinated
debt. </p>
<h2>Bank Safety </h2>
<p>The issuance comes as confidence in bank creditworthiness
improves. The average cost to protect against defaults by the
six-largest U.S. banks fell this week to the lowest level since
the end of 2007, according to credit-default swaps prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts, a gauge of the banks''
risk, are used to hedge against losses or to speculate on the
ability of companies to meet their obligations. </p>
<p>Without question, the banks are more stable, said
Arthur Tetyevsky, a credit strategist at Imperial Capital LLC.
Even under the most extreme economic scenarios, banks should
have enough capital to withstand a shock, so investors are more
comfortable. </p>
<p>While subordinated debtholders may not be bailed out in
another crisis, people are not particularly worried about that
right now, said Kathleen Shanley, a New York-based analyst at
Gimme Credit LLC. </p>
<p>Emboldened by improving bank creditworthiness, investors
are eager to buy their higher-yielding debt after more than five
years of near-zero interest rates from the Fed. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is this year''s biggest bank issuer of the
securities, selling $3.9 billion, according to Bloomberg data.
The New York-based lender sold $1 billion of perpetual
securities on March 5 that pay interest of 6.125 percent for a
decade and then switch to a floating-rate coupon. The notes were
initially marketed with a coupon of as much as 6.25 percent,
according to Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>They climbed about 0.1 cent to 101.3 cents on the dollar at
9:18 a.m. in New York, rising for the sixth consecutive day,
Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>The way the credit markets have been running, almost
everything that comes is well oversubscribed, said Thomas Urano, a money manager at Austin, Texas-based Sage Advisory
Services Ltd., which oversees about $10 billion. The trends
have been favorable for banks to be able to place it. </p>

<p>New Jersey awarded JPMorgan Chase (JPM) 
Co. and RBC Capital Markets $300 million of tax credits over 10
years after the companies pledged to create 1,900 new jobs in
Jersey City, across the Hudson River from Manhattan. </p>
<p>The Economic Development Authority approved annual grants
of $22.5 million for JPMorgan and $7.9 million for RBC at a
meeting today in Trenton. JPMorgan''s project would add 1,000
jobs and retain 2,612, while RBC''s would add 900 positions,
according to their applications. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, in its application, said it has been evaluating
the location of its expanding regional technology and operations
hub. Its options included consolidating multiple New Jersey
facilities into one in Jersey City or relocating most of those
operations to lower-cost locations in Delaware and Ohio. </p>
<p>RBC leases space in five locations in Manhattan with about
2,700 employees. With leases expiring at One Liberty Plaza and
the World Financial Center, it began evaluating options,
including renovating and expanding space in Jersey City and in
Minnesota. While the one-time cost of expanding would be greater
in Minnesota, annual operating costs would be higher in New
Jersey, according to its application. </p>
<p>Financial services up in the Jersey City and Hoboken area
has always been a sweet spot for us, Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno, the state''s top economic-development official, said in
an interview. It''s a perfect story: As New York''s financial-services sector looks for other places to go, they want to look
some place convenient to New York. </p>
<h2>High Earners </h2>
<p>The median salary of $120,000 for the covered positions at
JPMorgan, listed on its application, is more than triple New
Jersey''s median of $35,928, according to the Census Bureau. RBC
listed the median salary at $126,000. </p>
<p>Financial positions have become increasingly coveted as
states look to poach jobs from neighbors and even far-away
locales. Texas Governor Rick Perry, a Republican, today said his
state is actively recruiting New York companies to move there. </p>
<p>This would not impact the location of our U.S.
headquarters, which remains in lower Manhattan and will continue
to house the majority of our employees, RBC spokeswoman Elisa
Barsotti said in a statement. We are exploring an upgraded
location to relocate our data center from our ancillary location
at One Liberty Plaza and support function positions. </p>
<h2>Two Centuries </h2>
<p>The JPMorgan project is expected to bring a net benefit to
the state of $1.1 billion over the life of the package and will
enlarge the company''s space in Jersey City to more than 1
million square feet, officials said. </p>
<p>We''ve invested in this community for nearly two
centuries, and this agreement only deepens that commitment for
the long term, JPMorgan Chief Operating Officer Matt Zames
said in a statement. </p>
<p>Guadagno, a Republican who serves as the state''s economic
development chief, said New Jersey has aggressively courted
financial-services jobs with a message to decision makers to
keep their New York address and move support jobs to New Jersey. </p>
<p>Jersey City, a community of 254,000 one stop from Manhattan
by train, has worked in the past decade to re-craft itself as
Wall Street West. Mayor Steven Fulop, 37, worked at Citigroup
Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., leaving after the 2001 World
Trade Center attacks to join the U.S. Marine Corps and serve in
Iraq. </p>
<h2>Lifting State </h2>
<p>Jersey City is leading the state economy in terms of job
creation and is the driving force in lifting New Jersey out of
the recession, he said in a statement. </p>
<p>New Jersey has struggled to shake off the lingering effects
of the U.S. recession that ended in 2009. Governor Chris Christie''s administration said yesterday that the jobless rate
slid to 6.9 percent in April, the first time it has dipped under
7 percent since November 2008. The national level was 6.3
percent. </p>
<p>The state has regained 125,700 jobs, or about half of those
lost during the slump. Nancy Mantell, director of the Rutgers
Economic Advisory Service, said this month that the state isn''t
expected to recover all of them until 2018. </p>

<p>Sales of corporate bonds in the U.S.
are capping the busiest week this month as companies seized on
borrowing costs that dropped to the lowest in a year. </p>
<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the biggest U.S. drugmaker, issued $4.5
billion and Wolfsburg, Germany-based Volkswagen AG raised $3.5
billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Offerings of
about $41 billion were the most since $47.3 billion in the five
days ended April 25 and compare with a weekly average of $29.1
billion over the past 12 months. </p>
<p>Issuance rose as yields decreased amid signs U.S. economic
growth is faltering. Industrial production unexpectedly declined
in April and consumer confidence fell in May from a nine-month
high. David Tepper, founder of $20 billion hedge-fund firm
Appaloosa Management LP, said he''s nervous about markets as the
economy isn''t growing fast enough. </p>
<p>The rates environment has changed a bit from where it was
a couple weeks ago, and that has provided a lot of companies the
opportunity to come to market, Jody Lurie, a corporate credit
analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia, said in
a telephone interview. It has let them access the debt market
more attractively. </p>
<p>The extra yield investors demand to own corporate bonds
rather than government debentures widened by 1 basis point this
week to 170 basis points yesterday, up from an almost seven-year
low of 167 basis points on April 22, according to the Bank of
America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate  High Yield Index. Yields
fell to 3.62 percent, the least since May 2013 and down from 3.7
percent on May 9. </p>
<h2>Pfizer, Volkswagen </h2>
<p>Pfizer''s sale included $1.5 billion of 2.1 percent, five-year notes that yielded 48 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. Proceeds from the
deal, its first since last May, will be used by the New York-based company to repay debt. </p>
<p>Volkswagen, Europe''s largest automaker, issued debt in five
parts including $1.45 billion of 1.25 percent, three-year notes
with a relative yield of 47 basis points, Bloomberg data show.
The sale was its biggest dollar-denominated offering ever, the
data show. </p>
<p>Sales of investment-grade debentures rose to $32.2 billion
from $21.7 billion last week and compared with a weekly average
of $22.2 billion over the past 12 months, Bloomberg data show.
Offerings of speculative-grade bonds fell to $9 billion, from
$10.9 billion last week and compared with a weekly average of
$6.8 billion over the past year. </p>
<p>High-risk, high-yield bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody''s
Investors Service and lower than BBB- at Standard  Poor''s. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) has expanded
its workforce outside New York and San Francisco mainly to cut
costs. Its office in Irving, Texas, also aims to boost revenue. </p>
<p>The office, among the firm''s largest in the nation with
about 650 employees, hosted the investment bank''s annual
shareholders meeting today with Texas Governor Rick Perry giving
a speech. In addition to typical back-office functions such as
accounting and information security, the location houses a
commercial real estate lending group and is the headquarters for
the realty-management division. </p>
<p>That group is the descendant of a joint venture named
Archon that Goldman Sachs set up in 1991 with J.E. Robert Cos.
to buy distressed assets from the Resolution Trust Corp. after
the savings and loan crisis. The division, led by partner Tom Dowling, now sources deals and manages real estate investments
for the bank''s special-situations group and property funds. </p>
<p>While the division doesn''t have its own balance sheet, and
instead aids deals by the firm''s revenue-producing units, it
deployed about $7 billion in loans and investments last year,
according to a person with knowledge of its operations. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs acquired all of Archon in 2000, and the
business operated as an independent subsidiary for years. It
purchased more than $1 billion of property in the U.S. in some
years, mostly for the bank''s Whitehall real estate funds,
according to a former employee. That activity dropped as the
U.S. property market plunged, and the last Whitehall fund was
raised in 2008. </p>
<h2>Dallas, Bangalore </h2>
<p>Irving, in Dallas''s shadow with a population of about
225,500, is home to businesses including Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the
world''s second most valuable company, and CEC Entertainment
Inc., owner of the Chuck E. Cheese pizza chain. Goldman Sachs
also has an office in Dallas with several private wealth
management advisers and one investment banker, managing director
Peter Brundage. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 59, said in
November that a quarter of the firm''s employees were located
near Dallas, Salt Lake City, Singapore and Bangalore, India.
That''s increased from 10 percent in 2007 as the bank looks to
cut expenses, he said. The firm hosted its annual meeting in
Salt Lake City last year. </p>
<h2>Pay Approved </h2>
<p>Shareholders elected all of the firm''s nominees for the
board of directors, General Counsel Greg Palm said today,
announcing a preliminary count of the votes. About 83 percent of
votes approved the bank''s executive pay plan, he said. </p>
<p>Like Morgan Stanley''s annual meeting earlier this week,
today''s gathering featured no questions from shareholders and
lasted fewer than 40 minutes. About half the meeting was taken
up by Perry''s speech, which extolled the benefits of companies
moving to Texas. </p>
<p>Blankfein thanked Perry for his support of Goldman Sachs''s
businesses in the state. The CEO didn''t accept a shareholder''s
invitation to move the firm''s headquarters to Texas. </p>
<p>I think there''s a lot of compelling reasons to move to
Texas and a lot of compelling reasons to stay where we are,
including Newton''s first law of inertia, Blankfein said in an
interview after the meeting. </p>
<p>Beyond the meeting, Goldman Sachs is trying to cement ties
to the area. Dina H. Powell, a partner who leads the firm''s
charitable efforts, announced this week the start of the bank''s
10,000 Small Businesses education and funding program in Dallas. </p>

<p>The European Central Bank is unlikely
to begin large-scale asset purchases to stimulate inflation and
such a plan would have limited effect as nations'' borrowing
costs are already low, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) </p>
<p>We doubt that a large-scale asset-purchase program would
have a meaningful impact on yields, Goldman Sachs analysts,
including London-based chief European economist Huw Pill, wrote
in a client report. With rates at such low levels, it is
unclear how attractive euro-area government yields will look for
investors. </p>
<p>ECB President Mario Draghi said on May 8 that the Governing
Council was ready to act at its meeting next month to boost the
currency bloc''s economy. He had previously indicated stimulus
measures being considered included quantitative easing. </p>
<p>With a rally in the region''s sovereign bonds leaving
borrowing costs in the most-indebted nations near record lows,
the likelihood of a large-scale asset-purchase program remains
small, the Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in the report, dated
yesterday. </p>
<p>The yield on Spanish 10-year bonds was at 2.95 percent as
of 2:52 p.m. London time after falling to 2.83 percent
yesterday, the least since Bloomberg began collecting the data
in 1993. The rates on similar maturity Italian debt were at 3.05
percent, from a euro-era low of 2.89 percent yesterday. </p>
<p>Consumer prices in the euro area rose an annualized 0.7
percent in April, below half the central bank''s goal of just
under 2 percent for a seventh month. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) sold 150 billion yen
($1.5 billion) of Samurai bonds in its first offering of the
yen-denominated notes since the financial crisis. </p>
<p>The New York-based bank issued 122.5 billion yen of four-year fixed-rate debt at a yield of 0.557 percent as part of a
three-tranche offering today. It was the biggest sale since
Rabobank Groep sold 161.8 billion yen of similar notes in
October 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s offering was in excess of a 130 billion
yen cap on the deal that was set as late as yesterday, two
people familiar with the matter said. The last time the bank
sold Samurai bonds was in January 2008, as the subprime mortgage
crisis in the U.S. intensified and led Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. to collapse later that year. </p>
<p>Demand for Samurai bonds among investors is strong,
said Ryosuke Kaneko, a credit analyst in Tokyo at Mizuho
Securities Co., a unit of Japan''s third-largest bank by market
value. The fact that Morgan Stanley hasn''t sold for a while
was a big factor. </p>
<p>The number of U.S. Samurai issuers has also declined in
favor of European names in recent years, and that may have
supported demand for Morgan Stanley''s sale too, Kaneko said. </p>
<p>Japan''s Samurai market is recovering from just 60 billion
yen of sales in the first quarter of last year, which dragged
full-year issuance down to its least in four years.
Unprecedented stimulus by the Bank of Japan pushed the average
yields on yen notes offered by overseas borrowers to 0.599
percent on April 15, the lowest on record in data going back to
October 2000, Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes show. </p>
<h2>Credit Rating </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s notes are expected to be rated A- by
Standard  Poor''s, the fourth-lowest investment grade, and A by
Japan''s Rating  Investment Information Inc., one level higher,
according to a statement from sale co-manager Mitsubishi UFJ
Morgan Stanley Securities Co. That''s in line with Morgan
Stanley''s corporate ratings. </p>
<p>Utrecht, Netherlands-based Rabobank sold 100.3 billion yen
of Samurai bonds this week in its first such offering of the
year. Nordea Bank AB, based in Stockholm, plans to issue Samurai
bonds next week, two people familiar said today. </p>
<p>About 948 billion yen of Samurai bonds have been sold this
year, a more than 15-fold increase over the same period a year
ago, according to Bloomberg data. </p>

<p>And then there were three: Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Macquarie Group Ltd.
are sticking to bets the Reserve Bank of Australia will resume
lowering interest rates as others ditch their rate-cut calls. </p>
<p>Westpac Banking Corp., National Australia Bank Ltd. and
Bank of America Merrill Lynch economists -- with a century in
combined experience -- now expect the RBA will maintain the
record-low 2.5 percent cash rate. While keeping expectations for
sub-par growth, they''ve bowed to Governor Glenn Stevens''s
insistence borrowing costs are on hold for some time yet. </p>
<p>Goldman''s Tim Toohey, JPMorgan''s Stephen Walters and
Macquarie''s Richard Gibbs think Stevens is wrong, with subdued
prices, a forecast rise in unemployment, an elevated currency
and government budget cuts seen forcing further reductions. </p>
<p>You''ve got fiscal tightening being accelerated, so
there''s absolutely no scope for the Reserve Bank to be
considering hiking rates, Sydney-based Gibbs said in a May 19
interview. On the same day, Walters said he sees unemployment
rising, the currency too high and the budget weighing on growth,
while recognizing  something will have to change to prompt
the RBA to overcome its reluctance to lower rates again. </p>
<p>Australia''s treasurer last week announced cuts to spending
on welfare and the public service and a new tax on the highest
paid, adding fiscal consolidation to a slump in mining
investment as brakes on growth. At stake: the survival of a
domestic demand revival that''s seen the jobless rate drop, house
prices surge, and most economists and financial markets abandon
any expectation of further monetary policy easing. </p>
<h2>Fiscal Grind </h2>
<p>Consumer sentiment plunged 6.8 percent to 92.9 in May from
a month earlier, an index from Westpac and the Melbourne
Institute showed today. That''s the lowest level since August
2011, prior to the central bank''s most recent easing cycle. </p>
<p>In an environment where domestic demand is already
fragile and significant risks remain in the handover from mining
led economic growth, this budget does pose a risk to the near
term outlook, Goldman''s Melbourne-based Chief Australia
Economist Toohey wrote in a note to clients dated May 14. A
return to the grind of fiscal repair looms large. </p>
<p>Walters and Gibbs say the budget cuts and resulting hit to
consumer confidence from the measures, a stubbornly high
currency, rising unemployment as growth remains below trend and
incomplete transition from mining investment will prompt another
move. </p>
<p>Gee, that''s positive for the Aussie dollar, Gibbs cited
foreign investors as saying after the budget release forecast
narrowing deficits, meaning the elevated Aussie will remain a
drag on growth. It''s the tightening of conditions leading to
probably another round of job losses and pressure on domestic
demand that will drive the RBA to cut again, he said. </p>
<h2>Aussie Dollar </h2>
<p>The Australian dollar has firmed since Stevens switched to
a neutral bias in February, curbing exporters'' competitiveness.
It traded at 92.38 U.S. cents at 12:16 p.m. in Sydney. Swaps
traders see the cash rate moving 3 basis points higher in a
year, according to a Credit Suisse Group AG index, down from 8
points yesterday and from 3 points in cuts on March 3. </p>
<p>Even those economists who have abandoned rate-cut calls
recently and now see the central bank remaining on hold for an
extended period don''t necessarily believe it should be. </p>
<p>It doesn''t reflect any change of view on our part about
the outlook, said Merrill Lynch''s Chief Australia Economist
Saul Eslake, who on May 16 switched his rate call to on hold.
Dropping it doesn''t mean we''ve become a lot more optimistic or
less pessimistic about the economy, just that we now accept the
Reserve Bank is reading things differently from us and it''s
their view that counts, not ours. </p>
<h2>Sharp Fall'' </h2>
<p>Westpac''s Bill Evans, who called the most recent easing
cycle, abandoned his prediction of further rate cuts in March
after stronger-than-expected jobs data and said the central bank
was indicating a high hurdle for easier policy. </p>
<p>The sharp fall in the index is clearly indicating an
unfavorable response to the recent federal budget, Evans said
today of the sentiment slump. Respondents were particularly
concerned about the impact of the budget on their own
finances. </p>
<p>NAB''s Alan Oster announced he had dropped his reduction
call on May 12. </p>
<p>Low rates have spurred property prices. House and apartment
prices in the largest cities climbed 11.5 percent in April from
a year earlier, led by a 16.7 percent increase in Sydney. </p>
<h2>Export Boom </h2>
<p>Government data released this month showed Australia''s
exports to China, its biggest trading partner, climbed to a
record A$9.5 billion ($8.8 billion) in March, even as the trade
surplus narrowed to A$731 million for the month. </p>
<p>The RBA maintained its steady view in minutes of the May 6
meeting released yesterday in Sydney. Overall growth in coming
quarters was likely to be below trend given expected slower
growth in exports, the decline in mining investment and the
planned fiscal consolidation, it said. The current
accommodative stance of policy was likely to be appropriate for
some time yet. </p>
<p>The nation''s Secretary to the Treasury Martin Parkinson, in
his traditional speech after the budget, said non-mining
industries need to grow more rapidly to keep unemployment low. </p>
<p>We are seeing some positive signs, particularly in the
household sector, he said in Sydney yesterday. But with
businesses in the non-resources sectors continuing to exercise
caution in their investment and hiring decisions, the forward
indicators suggest that it will be at least another year or two
before strong broad-based growth takes hold. </p>
<p>Evans, when he made his call for the RBA to cut rates in
July 2011, was Australia''s loneliest forecaster at the time. Yet
within a few weeks markets swung to his view. In 2009,
JPMorgan''s Walters was alone in picking Stevens''s decision to
become the first Group of 20 policy maker to boost rates after
the height of the global recession. </p>
<p>Our job is to forecast what the Reserve Bank will do, not
preach as to what they should do, Eslake said. </p>

<p>Jay Rasulo, seen as one of two
possible successors to Walt Disney (DIS) Co. Chief Executive Officer
Robert Iger, invokes his company''s well-known characters when
discussing his role as chief financial officer. </p>
<p>I gotta have a big heart, I gotta love everybody, I''ve
gotta reach out to the world as Woody does in our stories,
Rasulo said today at the Bloomberg CFO Conference when asked why
he sometimes compares himself to the Toy Story hero. But
on the other hand I''m still counting the money like Scrooge
McDuck. </p>
<p>Rasulo said Disney often faces decisions that cost in the
short run and yet build stronger ties with consumers, such as
policing foreign makers of licensed goods. He became finance
chief in 2009, after leading Disney''s parks for about seven
years, when Iger asked him and then-CFO Tom Staggs to switch
jobs. Both men are seen as possible successors when Iger steps
down in 2016. Rasulo didn''t address that issue today. </p>
<p>It has been an incredible learning and broadening
experience, certainly for me, I''m sure on both sides of it,
said Rasulo, 58. In this role you get to experience the
breadth of the Walt Disney Co. </p>
<p>Rasulo, a Columbia University economics graduate who
started out with the company in strategic planning in 1986, said
part of Disney''s success lies in how it deploys capital. </p>
<p>About 65 percent is reinvested in the businesses, such as
theme-park rides, movies or sports rights for the ESPN network,
among the largest contributors to Disney profit, he said. The
company also pays dividends, buys back stock, and seeks
acquisitions that add to its character library or provide new
distribution outlets. </p>
<h2>Cost-Cutting </h2>
<p>Last year, Rasulo, who also has master''s degrees from the
University of Chicago, supervised a company-wide cost-cutting
initiative, designed to make sure the company was adapting to
technological changes in its businesses. That led to hundreds
firings across several divisions. </p>
<p>In March, Rasulo''s boss appointed him to oversee Disney''s
$500 million acquisition of Maker Studios, the money-losing
provider of online short-form videos. </p>
<p>Rasulo often speaks to Disney employees about career
planning, including his own. </p>
<p>I advise people, just do what''s right in front of you and
good things happen rather than trying to be Machiavellian in
planning the next five steps of your career, Rasulo said. It
will never turn out the way you think. </p>
<p>Rasulo sits about 40 feet from Iger and the two chat all
the time, along with communicating by e-mail, and when traveling
together, he said. </p>
<p>There''s not a lot of formality to Bob, Rasulo said.
He''s a very free and easy, casual interactor. </p>
<h2>28 Years </h2>
<p>When Rasulo joined Disney 28 years ago, the company had
about $2 billion in annual sales and earned most of its profit
from theme parks. The studio, established by Walt Disney in
1923, was struggling, the Disney Channel had fewer than 3
million subscribers, and Rasulo described the consumer products
business as fledgling. </p>
<p>We used to get this check from Europe, we never knew what
it was for, Rasulo recalled. Presumably it was from people
selling consumer products. We never audited anybody. </p>
<p>Today, Disney is the world''s largest entertainment company,
with more than $45 billion in sales. More than half its profit
comes from television, including ESPN, the Disney channels and
the ABC television network. </p>
<p>In his free time, Rasulo said he likes to fly fish, a hobby
that provides lessons for life. </p>
<p>The reason I love fly fishing is because you focus right
on the here and now, and put away all other distractions,
Rasulo said. Otherwise you basically just get cold and wet and
come home with no fish. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said it has
begun the process to sell Metro International Trade Services
LLC, the metals warehouse business purchased by the bank in
2010. </p>
<p>Metro is not strategic to our client activities, and the
firm has concluded that this is the right time to explore a
sale, given recent interest by potential buyers, Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, said in an e-mailed
statement today. A formal sales process has begun. </p>
<p>Barclays Plc, JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Morgan Stanley are
scaling back their raw-material businesses. Commodity revenue at
the 10 largest banks fell 18 percent last year amid reduced
volatility, Coalition, a London-based analytics company, said in
February. Regulators are concerned that lenders might be able to
wield control over prices, or suffer losses that would endanger
the financial system. </p>
<p>The Standard  Poor''s GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities
posted its worst year in five in 2013 as gold fell the most
since 1981 and corn, arabica coffee and wheat slid at least 20
percent. Commodity-related assets under management shrank by
about $100 billion, or about 25 percent of the total held at the
year''s start, Barclays estimated in February. The GSCI index
rose 3.5 percent this year. </p>
<p>Goldman received inquiries from potential buyers in
November after the London Metal Exchange proposed new rules on
how storage facilities operate, a person briefed on the matter
said at the time. The LME postponed implementation after the
plan, intended to ease aluminum bottlenecks at warehouses, was
tossed out by a judge. This month, the LME was granted
permission to appeal the ruling. </p>
<p>Consumers of metals including brewer MillerCoors LLC
complained that lengthy waits for stockpiled supplies inflated
costs. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), struggling to break
into the tablet market, backed off plans to introduce a smaller
version of its Surface tablet based on Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) processors,
people with knowledge of the decision said. </p>
<p>Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella and
Executive Vice President Stephen Elop decided that the product
in development wasn''t different enough from rivals and probably
wouldn''t be a hit, said one of the people, who asked not to be
identified because the plans weren''t public. Engineers had been
working on the device and had planned to unveil it as early as
today at an event in New York, two of the people said. </p>
<p>Instead, the company removed any references to Surface
devices based on Qualcomm''s processors from the event and
unveiled Surface Pro 3, an upgraded version of its pricier
Windows-based tablet, which uses chips from Intel Corp. (INTC) and
features a larger 12-inch screen. Microsoft is still working on
smaller versions, Panos Panay, who runs the Surface business,
said in an interview after the event. Panay declined to provide
details on future products. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s Surface had just 1.3 percent share of the
market in the first quarter, while smaller-size tablets
accounted for 53 percent of sales in the period, according to
researcher IDC. Nadella has said he wants to turn the Redmond,
Washington-based company into one that focuses on mobile
first, cloud first. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) plans to invest
$100 million to revitalize Detroit, the Detroit News reported,
citing three people with knowledge of the plan. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the biggest investment bank by revenue, plans to
back firms that promise to provide jobs and invest in the city,
which is going through the largest U.S. municipal bankruptcy,
the newspaper reported today. The investment, over five years,
will include loans and grants, the Detroit Free Press reported. </p>
<p>The move follows as much as $15 million in loans to Detroit
small businesses by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), and signals Wall
Street''s rising interest in Michigan''s largest city, which faces
$18 billion in long-term debt. </p>
<p>Jamie Dimon, chairman of New York-based JPMorgan, is
expected to meet with Mayor Mike Duggan, a representative of
Republican Governor Rick Snyder''s office, and possibly
billionaire Warren Buffett before the plan is detailed on NBC''s
Today Show tomorrow, according to the Detroit News. Dimon
discussed the plan with Snyder in April in New York, the
newspaper reported. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s program would provide guidance and services
including consulting. </p>
<p>Duggan and Steve O''Halloran, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined
to comment on the report. Buffett didn''t immediately respond to
a request for comment sent to an assistant. </p>
<p>Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein said in November that the New

<p>Investors should reduce holdings of
riskier municipal-bond holdings after the strongest rally for
speculative debt since 2009, according to Morgan Stanley. </p>
<p>Slowing bond issuance and demand for tax-free securities
have pushed investors in the $3.7 trillion market toward higher-yielding assets as benchmark interest rates are close to 11-month lows. Junk-rated local debt has gained about 9 percent in
2014, the strongest start to a year since a 15.7 percent return
in the same period of 2009, Barclays Plc data show. The broader
market has rallied 5.7 percent this year. </p>
<p>The potential is diminishing for speculative-grade bonds to
keep beating the market, said Michael Zezas, chief muni
strategist at Morgan Stanley in New York. High-yield debt will
probably suffer more when demand slows and municipalities ramp
up bond sales, he said. </p>
<p>For some of these riskier trades that have done well,
there are only marginal benefits going forward, Zezas said in
an interview. </p>
<p>Investors holding high-yield munis should move from
overweight to neutral relative to their benchmarks, Zezas said
in a report released yesterday. </p>
<p>Junk securities are ranked below Baa3 by Moody''s Investors
Service or lower than BBB- by Standard  Poor''s and Fitch
Ratings. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley joins Citigroup Inc. and Vanguard Group Inc.
in questioning the sustainability of the muni rally. The market
suffered its worst losses since 2008 last year, and Zezas in
December forecast a second year of declines. He said in March
that returns were poised to cool off. </p>
<p>Zezas said he doesn''t have a specific timeframe on when the
high-yield muni outperformance will end. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) introduced a larger-screen Surface tablet that is thinner and faster than the previous Surface Pro model, its latest attempt to gain share in the market dominated by Google Inc. and Apple Inc. </p> <p>This is the tablet that can replace your laptop, Panos Panay, Surface vice president, said at an event in New York to unveil the new device. The product has a 12-inch screen, up from the previous version''s 10.6 inches, and runs an Intel Corp. processor. </p> <p>The Surface had 1.3 percent of the tablet market in the first quarter, according to researcher IDC. The device hasn''t made significant inroads in the 20 months since Microsoft introduced its first computer-hardware product, as consumers opt for Apple''s iPad and tablets based on Google''s Android software. Another challenge facing Microsoft is slowing growth in the touchscreen-device market, which IDC predicts will grow 19 percent this year, compared with 52 percent in 2013. </p> <p>They need to clear up their messaging, they need to unify their apps so you can have the same apps run across multiple devices and form factors, said Jitesh Ubrani, an analyst at Framingham, Massachusetts-based IDC. These are all things they are working on but not fast enough. There''s also a certain level of beauty and polish on the iPad and the Surface isn''t quite there yet. </p> <p>Google''s Android, which powers tablets such as Samsung Electronics Co.''s Galaxy and Amazon.com Inc.''s Kindle Fire, ran 63 percent of the tablets sold in the first quarter, according to IDC. Apple''s iOS had 33 percent share. Windows, which includes Surface and tablets from companies like Dell Inc., had 4.5 percent. Dell, Toshiba Corp. and others have already released smaller tablets running Windows. </p> <h2>Mobile, Cloud </h2> <p>Since taking the helm as chief executive officer in February, Satya Nadella has said he wants to turn the Redmond, Washington-based company into one that focuses on mobile first, cloud first. His initial efforts have included rolling out its Office productivity software for Apple''s (AAPL) iPad and updating Windows Phone mobile software. </p> <p>Fewer consumer purchases in developed markets are behind slowing growth in the tablet market, according to IDC. The slowdown is already being seen -- Apple said iPad sales fell 16 percent, the largest drop on record, in the quarter that ended in March. </p> <p>Still, Microsoft is counting on tablets and mobile computing for growth amid a persistent decline in the personal-computer market, where about 90 percent of machines run on the company''s software. In April, IDC said first-quarter PC shipments fell 4.4 percent worldwide. </p> <p>Microsoft still has room to gain ground in tablets, Ubrani said, though the company will need to connect with customers soon. </p> <p>It''s tough to say how many chances they will have, he said. But they are certainly running out of time. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Christopher Palmeri" date="May 20, 2014 11:21 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-20/disney-analyzing-pay-tv-mergers-for-impact-on-business.html"><headline>Disney Analyzing Pay-TV Mergers for Impact on Business</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) is evaluating how the
planned merger of ATT Inc. (T) and DirecTV will affect its
business, according to Jay Rasulo, chief financial officer of
the world''s biggest entertainment company. </p>
<p>Whether it''s that merger or Comcast-Time Warner Cable (TWC),
it''s no surprise to us that there is consolidation, Rasulo
said today at the Bloomberg CFO Conference in New York. We
have strong relationships with all of those companies. We are
analyzing how that will affect the ecosystem. This is early
days. </p>
<p>Disney, owner of ESPN, the Disney Channel and the ABC
broadcast network, is one of the biggest suppliers of
programming to cable and satellite TV providers. Like other
content producers, the company has been selling more of its
shows to online networks such as Netflix Inc. (NFLX), which represent a
threat to pay-TV distributors. </p>
<p>The $48.5 billion ATT-DirecTV deal, announced this week,
and Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)''s $45 billion plan to acquire Time Warner
Cable Inc., involve four of the biggest buyers, potentially
giving them more clout in content negotiations. </p>
<p>We recognize there is a change in the landscape from what
has been a very valuable and profitable landscape, Rasulo
said. The world is evolving toward more content being
distributed over the top. Netflix is a great example. There will
be more. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) hired
Jonathan Strain as a managing director in its commercial-mortgage bond business, according to two people familiar with
the move. </p>
<p>Strain, previously at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), will be co-head
of the U.S. real estate finance group alongside Ted Borter, said
one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the
move hasn''t been announced. He will be based at the lender''s New
York headquarters. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is bolstering the team that underwrites bond
deals linked to everything from skyscrapers to strip malls as
Wall Street banks vie for the most lucrative lending assignments
amid growing competition. The number of firms originating
property loans to be packaged into securities has almost tripled
to 27 since issuance revived in 2010 following the financial
crisis, according to Standard  Poor''s. </p>
<p>Strain, who started at JPMorgan in 2007, is joining Goldman
Sachs after the departure earlier this year of Dan Bennett, who
held a similar position. Justin Perras, a spokesman for
JPMorgan, and Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, said
they couldn''t comment. </p>
<p>Issuance of commercial-mortgage backed securities is
falling short of predictions of a banner year, pushing
underwriters to be more aggressive to meet their origination
goals. Banks have arranged about $25 billion of CMBS this year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg, on track to disappoint
Wall Street forecasts for as much as $100 billion in 2014
issuance after sales doubled to $80 billion in 2013. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs was the fourth-ranked underwriter of U.S.
CMBS last year, according to industry newsletter Commercial
Mortgage Alert. JPMorgan was second, behind top-ranked Deutsche

<p>The trio received antitrust complaints alleging they
participated in a cartel to rig Euribor. The so-called statement
of objections is the next step in the EU enforcement process
after the lenders dropped out of settlement talks last year. </p>
<p>The European Commission has concerns that the three banks
may have taken part in a collusive scheme which aimed at
distorting the normal course of pricing components for euro
interest rate derivatives, it said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>While six financial firms, including Societe Generale SA (GLE),
agreed in December to a combined record of 1.7 billion euros
($2.3 billion) in fines in the Euribor case and a similar yen
Libor probe, the regulator''s attempt to get a clean sweep of

<p>Depending on whether you listen to
Morgan Stanley or JPMorgan Chase  Co., the imposition of
martial law in Thailand will either send the baht tumbling to
levels last seen in 2006 or put an end to its losses. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley yesterday reiterated its prediction that the
baht will weaken 12 percent by year-end to 37 per dollar as the
political crisis pushes the country toward a recession. JPMorgan
was more optimistic, confirming an overweight recommendation on
the currency, amid bets the army''s move will help end months of
street protests. </p>
<p>The disparity of opinion on the outlook for the currency
mirrors the mixed signals coming from Thailand''s economy. While
an official report this week showed gross domestic product
shrank in the first quarter, the nation has the biggest
cumulative trade surplus for more than three years, and exports
are rising. </p>
<p>The market tends to be complacent about Thai politics,
it''s not the first coup, Paul McNamara, a London-based
investment director at GAM U.K. Ltd., which manages $129 billion
in assets, said yesterday by e-mail. It''s not just noise, the
chances of something terrible happening are rising. But until we
see convincing spill-over to the real economy, I think the
fallout will be limited. </p>
<h2>Paring Decline </h2>
<p>The baht is the only one of 12 Asian currencies tracked by
Bloomberg to drop versus the dollar this month, slipping 0.4
percent. It has retreated 4.3 percent since the anti-government
protests started at the end of October, the worst performance in
the region. </p>
<p>The currency fell as much as 0.6 percent yesterday to
32.660 per dollar, before paring its retreat amid speculation of
intervention by the central bank. It climbed 0.1 percent today
to 32.493 as of 1:06 p.m. in New York. </p>
<p>Our target of 37 is very achievable, Geoffrey Kendrick,
Morgan Stanley''s head of Asia currency and interest-rate
strategy in Hong Kong, said yesterday in a phone interview.
The economy is in a massive hole. Thailand is certainly going
to have a technical recession in the first half. </p>
<p>Thailand''s army chief declared martial law yesterday,
telling local television that the move wasn''t a coup and would
help end the street protests that led to Yingluck Shinawatra''s
removal as prime minister this month. </p>
<p>The violence has driven away tourists and hurt the economy,
with a May 19 report showing GDP shrank 2.1 percent in the first
quarter, after growing a revised 0.1 percent in the previous
three-month period. </p>
<h2>Airport Shutdown </h2>
<p>Thailand''s last quarter-on-quarter recession was in 2009,
when anti-government protesters shut down Bangkok''s main
international airport for more than a week at the height of the
global financial meltdown. The baht tumbled 17 percent against
the dollar in the five quarters ending March 2009, the sharpest
decline since the Asian crisis of the late 1990s. </p>
<p>Money poured out of the country yesterday. Overseas
investors sold $256 million more Thai shares than they bought,
the heaviest net sales since November, and pulled $61 million
from bonds, exchange data show. Global funds have withdrawn
about $1 billion from local debt and equities in May, snapping
two months of inflows. </p>
<p>Others are optimistic about the baht''s prospects. </p>
<p>I''m not worried about the baht, I''m looking for levels to
buy, Rajeev De Mello, who manages $10 billion as the head of
Asian fixed income at Schroder Investment Management Ltd., said
by phone yesterday from Singapore. The main support of the
baht in the past has really been the trade side. On the investor
side, the people who wanted to get out of Thailand have already
gotten out. </p>
<h2>Baht Appreciation'' </h2>
<p>Westpac Banking Corp., Australia''s second-biggest lender by
market value, expects the baht to strengthen about 3 percent by
year-end to 31.4 per dollar. The median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of 24 strategists is for a decline to 33. </p>
<p>Foreigners are excessively underweight baht assets, and
covering this positioning on any reduction of political risk
would trigger baht appreciation, Daniel Hui, the head of
emerging-Asia currency strategy at JPMorgan in Singapore, wrote
yesterday in a report. </p>
<p>Yesterday marked the army''s most direct involvement in
Thailand''s politics since 2006, when then-premier Thaksin
Shinawatra, Yingluck''s brother, was removed in a coup. </p>
<h2>Surviving Coups </h2>
<p>Thailand has had 11 coups since direct rule by kings ended
in 1932, and the currency has ridden out most of them. Martial
law was last invoked in April 2010, and a month later the baht
had risen 0.3 percent against the dollar, the best performance
in Asia. It was little changed in September 2006, when Thaksin
was ousted. </p>
<p>The country has been without a fully functioning government
since December, when Yingluck called snap elections in a bid to
ease the unrest. To Australia  New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.,
that will lead to a drop in the baht of about 4 percent this
year to 34 per dollar. </p>
<p>Politics definitely is the biggest risk at present, and
there are negative effects on the economy, Khoon Goh, a
Singapore-based senior strategist at ANZ, said in a May 19 phone
interview. We''ve already seen portfolio outflows. The risk is
that foreign-direct investment slows down sharply if investor
concern over the political situation intensifies. </p>

<p>The global seaborne iron ore glut
will probably be 21 percent bigger than forecast next year as
steel production slows in China, the world''s largest consumer,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>The surplus will reach 175 million metric tons in 2015,
compared with a prior prediction of 145 million tons, Goldman
Sachs said in a report dated yesterday. The bank estimates that
output will exceed demand by 72 million tons and prices will
average $109 a ton in 2014, before dropping to $80 next year. </p>
<p>Iron ore has slumped 27 percent this year as economic
growth in China slowed and mining companies from BHP Billiton
Ltd. to Rio Tinto Group in Australia boosted output, shifting
the global seaborne market into a glut. Banks from Standard
Chartered Plc to Credit Suisse Group AG say more Chinese steel
mills will go bankrupt and hurt consumption. </p>
<p>The market is no longer in balance but in the early stage
of a structural surplus, analysts including Christian Lelong
wrote in the report. China will not act as the safety valve in
an oversupplied market for much longer. </p>
<p>Ore with 62 percent iron content delivered to the Chinese
port of Tianjin fell 1 percent to $97.50 a dry ton yesterday,
the lowest level since September 2012, according to data from
The Steel Index Ltd. The decline in iron ore, Australia''s
biggest export earner, pulled the country''s dollar today to the
weakest level since May 2. </p>
<h2>Record Stockpiles </h2>
<p>While the last decline below $100 in 2012 spurred buyers to
rebuild inventories, boosting prices to about $159 in four
months, this time around expectations of ample supply will
encourage users to keep reserves at a minimum, said Goldman. </p>
<p>We believe the current downturn could trigger another
destocking cycle of similar scale, Lelong, Daniel Quigley and
Amber Cai wrote. But the eventual rebound will be far less
robust than previously. </p>
<p>Reduced Chinese imports will also offset any impact of
expected supply disruptions in India and a possible strike at
Australia''s Port Hedland, the world''s largest bulk-export
terminal, the bank said. Maritime Union of Australia, which
represents tugboat deckhands at the port, approved unlimited
work stoppages of 24 hours, 48 hours and 7 days on May 12. </p>
<p>BHP, the third-largest exporter, won''t be able to make up
shipments lost during a strike, the company''s iron ore president
Jimmy Wilson said in a statement today. The union said May 12 it
hadn''t decided whether to take action. </p>
<h2>Port Strike </h2>
<p>Disruption in Port Hedland would be costly for the
producers affected and would drive a temporary price rally, but
it would ultimately be washed out by global market
fundamentals, Goldman said. </p>
<p>China''s inventory at ports rose 1.8 percent to a record
112.55 million tons in the week to May 16 from a week earlier,
according to Shanghai Steelhome Information Technology Co. As
much as 40 percent of inventory at ports may be tied up in
financing purposes, according to Daiwa Securities Group Inc. </p>
<p>A meaningful amount of iron ore stockpiles in China is
tied to financing, which means an unwinding can be excessive,
said Doug King, the London-based chief investment officer of the
Merchant Commodity Fund, which returned 15.4 percent from
January to April partly from iron ore. Real demand will be
dampened when those stockpiles are sold into the market. </p>
<p>China''s economy that creates demand for 69 percent of the
world''s seaborne ore will grow by 7.3 percent this year, the
lowest since 1990, according to a Bloomberg survey. </p>
<p>The Australian dollar touched 92.16 U.S. cents today. It
dropped 0.9 percent yesterday, the biggest loss since March 19. </p>
<p>Changes in spot iron ore prices affect the currency far
more quickly these days, Gareth Berry, a foreign-exchange
strategist at UBS AG, wrote in a client note dated yesterday.
That''s largely due to the demise of annual fixed price iron
ore contracts, and the subsequent shift to quarterly, then to
monthly, then to spot pricing. </p>
<p>Shares of BHP fell 0.8 percent to A$37.17 ($34.32) at the
close in Sydney today and Rio, the second-biggest exporter,
declined 1.1 percent to A$59.40. </p>

<p>Italy will include prostitution and illegal drug sales in the gross domestic product calculation this year, a boost for its chronically stagnant economy and Prime Minister Matteo Renzi''s effort to meet deficit targets. </p> <p>Drugs, prostitution and smuggling will be part of GDP as of 2014 and prior-year figures will be adjusted to reflect the change in methodology, the Istat national statistics office said today. The revision was made to comply with European Union rules, it said. </p> <p>Renzi, 39, is committed to narrowing Italy''s deficit to 2.6 percent of GDP this year, a task that''s easier if output is boosted by portions of the underground economy that previously went uncounted. Four recessions in the last 13 years left Italy''s GDP at 1.56 trillion euros ($2.13 trillion) last year, 2 percent lower than in 2001 after adjusting for inflation. </p> <p>Even if the impact is hard to quantify, it''s obvious it will have a positive impact on GDP, said Giuseppe Di Taranto, economist and professor of financial history at Rome''s Luiss University.

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM), Glencore PLC (GLEN) and the London Metal Exchange were
sued by a company that claimed they conspired to restrict zinc
supplies and drive up prices. </p>
<p>Duncan Galvanizing Corp. alleged that in 2010 Goldman
Sachs, JPMorgan and Glencore each acquired one of the world''s
three biggest metals warehouse operators, giving them control
over the London Metals Exchange, where 90 percent of zinc metals
futures are traded, according to a complaint filed today in
Manhattan federal court. </p>
<p>Duncan, based in Everett, Massachusetts, provides
protective coatings for steel. It claims the defendants
conspired to drive up prices by artificially limiting zinc
supplies. Duncan is seeking to represent a class of purchasers
of LME-grade zinc for physical delivery in the U.S., from May
24, 2010, to the present. </p>
<p>Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, said the firm intends to contest the lawsuit. Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for New York based JPMorgan Chase, and
Charles Watenphul, a spokesman for Glencore, based in Baar,
Switzerland, both declined to comment. Miriam Heywood, a
spokeswoman for the London Metal Exchange, didn''t immediately
respond to an e-mail sent after regular business hours. </p>
<p>The Manhattan courthouse where the zinc suit is filed has
become a hub of commodities price-fixing claims in recent

<p>Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) plan to
keep operating in Russia after President Vladimir Putin''s
government backed away from punishing the payments firms in
response to U.S. sanctions. </p>
<p>Visa and MasterCard executives met with senior officials
including First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov and came
away very positive about finding a solution, Visa''s country
chief, Andrew Torre, said at the St. Petersburg International
Economic Forum yesterday. </p>
<p>Russia will consider easing new measures requiring the two
U.S. companies to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to
continue operating, MasterCard Russia chief Ilya Riaby said. At
stake is an estimated $403 million in combined annual revenue
for the two payments networks as well as their foothold in a
market that''s shifting from cash to electronic payments. </p>
<p>After Visa and MasterCard stopped processing payments at
four Russian banks in response to U.S. sanctions over the crisis
in Ukraine, Russia passed a law creating its own national
payments system and imposing rules for foreign firms that
include fines for denying services and a mandatory security
deposit starting in July. </p>
<p>The government is committed to working with Visa and
MasterCard, Deputy Finance Minister Alexey Moiseev said in an
interview with Bloomberg TV. </p>
<p>Moiseev said the U.S. companies agreed to create a
nationally important operator within 18 months. Under the
new law, such operators are exempt from having to post
collateral with the central bank, he said. </p>
<h2>More Talks </h2>
<p>The companies have not yet reached a formal agreement and
look forward to continuing the dialog, Paul Cohen, a
spokesman for Visa, said in a statement. MasterCard''s
suggestions on changes to the new law were regarded
favorably and the company expects a response soon, according
to Seth Eisen, a spokesman. </p>
<p>Visa and MasterCard have said they get about 2 percent of
their annual revenue from Russia, or about $167 million last
year for MasterCard and $236 million for Visa. The two control
about 95 percent of the payments market in Russia, according to
Morgan Stanley. Visa is based in Foster City, California, and
runs the world''s biggest payments network. MasterCard is based
in Purchase, New York. </p>
<p>The bigger concern may not be the loss of revenue, but
the risk of losing the opportunity for domestic processing in
Russia, Darrin Peller, an analyst at Barclays Plc, said in a
research note, adding that 80 percent of transactions in Russia
are done using cash. There will likely be a middle ground
reached. </p>
<p>(A previous version of this story was corrected to remove
an erroneous combined revenue estimate in the third paragraph.) </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) extended its
partnership with Russia''s state-controlled oil company even as
U.S. and European nations threaten additional sanctions to
punish Vladimir Putin''s regime for its actions in Ukraine. </p>
<p>Exxon signed the agreement with OAO Rosneft (ROSN) Chief Executive
Officer Igor Sechin at a forum in St. Petersburg today,
extending a pact that involves drilling for crude in the Arctic
and Siberia and liquefying natural gas for export in Russia''s
Far East, according to a statement on Moscow-based Rosneft''s
website. Exxon didn''t immediately return a phone message seeking
comment. </p>
<p>Exxon is among American oil producers that rebuffed U.S.
State Department pressure to skip the International Economic
Forum this week in Putin''s hometown. With at least $30 billion
already invested in Russia''s oil and gas sector, U.S. and
European explorers are betting the Ukraine crisis won''t derail
their aspirations to capture some of Russia''s 75 billion barrels
of reserves. </p>
<p>Among U.S. companies, Irving, Texas-based Exxon is the
biggest player in Russia, where it has a series of joint
ventures with Rosneft. (ROSN) It already produces oil in Russia''s Far
East with Rosneft and the two companies plan to start drilling
an exploration well in the Kara Sea this year. Together they
hold licenses to explore huge swathes of the Arctic Ocean. </p>
<h2>Stronger Action </h2>
<p>While sanctions against Russia have targeted individuals --
including Sechin -- and avoided industrywide measures, the U.S.
has threatened stronger action if Putin''s government obstructs
the Ukraine presidential election scheduled for May 25.
Producers still plan to invest more in Russia, pursuing
exploration in the Arctic Ocean and drilling shale oil fields in
Siberia. </p>
<p>Foreign companies are expected to invest billions of
dollars in Russian projects, said Timur Salikhov, an oil and
gas analyst at BCS Financial Group. I don''t think many of them
will do so until there is resolution to the ongoing standoff
with Ukraine. </p>
<p>U.S. and European energy producers hold equity partnerships
in Russian oil and gas worth at least $30 billion, according to
Alexander Nazarov, an analyst at OAO Gazprombank in Moscow. The
investments are led by BP Plc (BP/)''s almost 20 percent stake in
Rosneft, Total SA (FP)''s stake in gas producer OAO Novatek (NVTK) and a gas
project operated by Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (RDSA) </p>
<p>Some oil-industry leaders declined to attend this week''s
forum after U.S. officials called for a boycott. Others came
anyway. </p>
<p>Christophe de Margerie, CEO of France''s Total, was at the
forum, where he signed an agreement with OAO Lukoil to seek
shale oil in Western Siberia. BP CEO Bob Dudley attended the
meeting and said he had no plans to exit Russia. </p>
<p>Neil Duffin, president of Exxon''s development unit, signed
the agreement today at the forum, according to Rosneft. Exxon
has declined to say whether CEO Rex Tillerson will make an
appearance. </p>

<p>Russian retailers may be best
positioned to crack open international credit markets as they''re
far removed from people blacklisted by the U.S. and Europe over
Ukraine, said Clemens Grafe, chief economist at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) in Russia. </p>
<p>While Russia''s retailers have eschewed dollar bonds, they
may find investor appetite internationally, Grafe said. </p>
<p>There will eventually be some kind of separation whereby
those that are far away from sanctions can come back to the
market, Grafe said in an interview at the St. Petersburg
International Economic Forum. If one of the retailers said
they wanted to issue a bond, I think the market would react
pretty positively. It''s a question of how we move out of
there. </p>
<p>Russian capital outflows rose to $50.6 billion in the first
quarter as President Vladimir Putin annexed Crimea and as
tensions with the U.S. and European Union rose before the May 25
presidential election in Ukraine. So far, the sanctions have
targeted politicians and businessmen with interests in energy,
construction and banking. </p>
<p>If political uncertainty continues, Grafe said the risk-adjusted cost of capital will go higher and that affects
companies'' credit ratings and has an impact on investment
decisions. </p>
<p>The market has rallied quite a bit but the problem is no
one really knows where the  sanctions are going, Grafe said.
It''s not black and white. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), operator of a $19
billion liquefied natural gas project in Papua New Guinea, is
talking to customers in Asia about selling cargoes on the spot
market as demand traditionally rises over summer. </p>
<p>Exxon expects an LNG cargo from the project every four to
six days, Decie Autin, Exxon''s project executive in Papua New
Guinea, said today in a a phone interview. The next shipment
will go to CPC Corp. of Taiwan, she said. The first one has left
the country headed to Tokyo Electric Power Co. in Japan, Exxon
said earlier today in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>There are a few other customers we''re talking to, and
Asia is clearly the focus, she said. We''ll sell on the spot
market until we''re comfortable we''ve got reliable, sustainable
sales. We''re not seeing any issues with placing our cargoes. </p>
<p>Spot LNG prices in northeast Asia fell to $13.50 a million
British thermal units, their lowest since October 2012, in the
week to May 19, according to World Gas Intelligence assessments
of cargoes for delivery in four to eight weeks published May 21.
They reached $19.70 in February. </p>
<p>Exxon and its partners, including Oil Search Ltd. (OSH) and
Santos Ltd. (STO), are considering expansion of the development to tap
Asian demand. Exxon is focused on exploration to underpin an
expansion rather than trying to obtain gas from InterOil Corp.''s
Elk and Antelope gas discoveries, Autin said. </p>
<p>Santos rose 1.1 percent to close at A$14.36 in Sydney
trading, while Oil Search climbed 1.1 percent to A$9.40. </p>
<h2>Second Development </h2>
<p>Total SA and InterOil want to build a second export
development in Papua New Guinea based on gas from the Elk and
Antelope fields. Oil Search also agreed earlier this year to
acquire part of those fields. </p>
<p>It looks like they have a deal, it looks like they''re
building a greenfield facility, and to my knowledge, that''s a
go, and something that''s happening, Autin said. I don''t know
of a lot of opportunity there for Exxon, she said. </p>
<p>Oil Search has contested Total''s agreement to buy part of
InterOil''s project, saying the deal breached its pre-emptive
rights. The possibility of Oil Search blocking Total sparked
speculation Exxon could enter the Elk and Antelope license. </p>
<p>The LNG market will remain tight until at least 2015,
according to the International Energy Agency. Spot and short-term LNG trade increased to 27.4 percent of the total last year
from 25 percent in 2012, according to the International Group of
Liquefied Natural Gas Importers. </p>
<p>Importers typically purchase more spot shipments in June
through September to meet increased power needs amid hotter
weather during summer. </p>
<p>The Exxon project is expected to reach full capacity in
four to six weeks, Autin said. The development has long-term
contracts with four major customers, Tokyo Electric Power, CPC,
Osaka Gas Co. and China Petroleum  Chemical Corp. </p>

<p>The biggest proposed deal in drug
industry history is dead. Or, dead for now. </p>
<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the largest U.S. drugmaker, yesterday
abandoned its effort to buy AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) for 69.4 billion
pounds ($117 billion), saying the public bid rejected by its
London-based competitor represented full value. AstraZeneca
said it welcomed the opportunity to continue building on the
momentum we have already demonstrated. </p>
<p>Under U.K. takeover rules, Pfizer had until 5 p.m. London
time yesterday to make a firm offer. The regulations now require
a cooling-off period of at least three months before talks can
restart, giving both drugmakers time to decide what happens
next. Pfizer hopes AstraZeneca''s investors will push the
company''s board to come to the table, while AstraZeneca faces
pressure to deliver on its promises of a productive roster of
experimental medicines. </p>
<p>There is quite a decent chance actually that there will
be a deal later this year, most likely I would say after three
months, Erik Hultgard, an analyst with Nordea Bank AB in
Stockholm, said in a telephone interview. There was quite a
small spread between what the board said they could accept and
what Pfizer actually wanted to pay. There are likely
shareholders on both sides that want this to happen. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the world''s
biggest investment bank by revenue, said a pair of wrong-way
bets made by clients at the start of the year is partly to blame
for Wall Street''s trading slowdown. </p>
<p>Some of the biggest wagers included shorting Japan''s
currency and betting that U.S. interest rates would rise more
steeply than those in Europe, according to Daniel Pinto, head of
the New York-based firm''s corporate and investment bank. </p>
<p>Neither of those trades paid, Pinto, 51, said today at
an investor conference in New York. Essentially you start the
year with the wrong momentum, where you lose money at the very
beginning, and you ended up with probably a lower risk appetite
than you would have otherwise. </p>
<p>JPMorgan warned investors earlier this month that second-quarter markets revenue will probably drop about 20 percent from
a year earlier, after a 21 percent tumble in fixed-income,
currencies and commodities trading in the first quarter. That
would amount to JPMorgan''s worst first half for trading since
the financial crisis. </p>
<p>Another reason for the lackluster results is reduced
volatility, which has dropped to the lowest in 10 to 15 years
for rates, currencies and credit trading, Pinto said. </p>
<p>When the market doesn''t move, it''s really difficult to
monetize your flows, Pinto said. It makes the market more
competitive and margins really tighten because it costs you very
little to provide liquidity, so you provide a lot. </p>
<h2>Episodic Trades </h2>
<p>Clients appear to be hesitating in placing the larger
hedges that typically happen earlier in the year, he said. </p>
<p>You have episodic trades, big hedges, big corporate
trades, that happen along the year, Pinto said. Particularly
in the first and part of the second, the amount of those trades,
even though the pipeline is very healthy, they haven''t happened.
It looks like they are going to happen later in the year, and
that is a big swing factor. </p>
<p>The industry''s shrinking results are being caused more by
low volatility and monetary policy than by new regulations, he
said, adding that investment banks may have to wait until 2016
before revenue improves. </p>
<p>Probably we will have a flattish year next year, and then
probably with all that we talked about before -- markets will
grow, normalization of interest rates -- all that will sort of
bring revenues up again, Pinto said. It''s probably a bit
more down the line. </p>

<p>OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT), Russia''s

estimates on rising demand for Web browsing and messaging. </p>
<p>First-quarter operating income before depreciation and
amortization climbed 5.3 percent to 41.5 billion rubles ($1.2
billion), Moscow-based MTS said today in a statement. Analysts
predicted 40.9 billion rubles, the average of estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. Sales rose 5.1 percent to 97.6 billion rubles,
compared with the average estimate of 96.4 billion rubles. </p>
<p>MTS, controlled by billionaire Vladimir Evtushenkov, is

lagging behind, with its first-quarter sales in Russia dropping. </p>
<p>The number of customers rose by 0.8 percent during the
quarter to 108.7 million, helped by demand for cheaper
smartphones including those carrying MTS''s own brand. Data
revenue in Russia jumped 42 percent to 14.3 billion rubles. </p>
<p>MTS shares had lost 14 percent this year through yesterday
as Russia''s economy slowed amid a standoff over Ukraine which

5 percent this year and a more than 2 percent increase in Oibda.

Authorities imposing the sanctions should consider who are they really harming? </p> <p>Exxon is among American oil producers that ignored U.S. State Department recommendations to skip an energy forum in St. Petersburg last week as it extended a pact with Rosneft involving drilling for crude in the Arctic and Siberia. Exxon, through a 2011 deal with the state-run crude producer, owns drilling rights across 11.4 million acres of Russian land, including vast swaths of the Kara Sea. </p> <p>Related:</p>

<p>U.S. and European nations have imposed sanctions to punish Vladimir Putin''s regime for its actions in Ukraine. Among those targeted was Rosneft Chief Executive Officer Igor Sechin. Measures from President Barack Obama''s administration included asset freezes and bans on travel to the U.S. </p> <h2>Travel Ban </h2> <p>The travel ban on Sechin has so far not affected collaboration with Exxon, which is currently working with Rosneft to drill an exploratory well in the Arctic this year, Tillerson said. The companies'' partnership gives Rosneft the ability to buy stakes in Exxon''s North American projects in exchange for Exxon''s access to the Russian Arctic. </p> <p>We have plenty of meetings with them in Russia, Tillerson said. It''s not impacted our ability to carry on the other business activities. </p> <p>The Irving, Texas-based producer is the biggest U.S. player in Russia, where it has a series of joint ventures with Rosneft. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Michael P.

<p>Here''s the problem facing hedge funds investing in the stock market this year, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. chief equity strategist David Kostin: the sand box they like to play in has gotten a lot smaller. </p> <p>For example, equity hedge fund managers tend to have about a quarter of their investments in consumer-discretionary stocks, Kostin told Erik Schatzker and Stephanie Ruhle on Bloomberg Television''s Market Makers program today. The dispersion of returns within that group is too small for managers on the prowl for stocks to buy or short, Kostin said. </p> <p>The opportunity set, the sand box, the swimming pool is very, very small, Kostin said. It''s been a very difficult year from a stock-selection perspective. </p> <p>The biggest gain among consumer-discretionary stocks over the past three months has been a 10 percent advance in Nordstrom Inc. and the biggest loss has been a 17 percent drop in International Game Technology. That 27 percentage point dispersion of returns compares with a 71 percentage point difference during the same period last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs'' basket of the 50 stocks favored by hedge funds has underperformed the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index (SPX) by about 2 percentage points so far this year after beating the market for 13 straight years, according to Kostin. </p> <h2>Glamor Stocks'' </h2> <p>Some of the more richly valued glamor stocks have dropped down or off the list of hedge-fund ownership, according to Kostin, as managers become more value-oriented. </p> <p>Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ), Walgreen Co., American Realty Capital Properties Inc., CF Industries Holdings Inc., Forest Laboratories Inc., Halliburton Co., Cheniere Energy Inc., News Corp. and SunEdison Inc. were added to the firm''s Hedge Fund VIP Basket, according to a May 21 report. Express Scripts Holding Co., Gilead Sciences Inc., Visa Inc., Cole Real Estate Investment Inc., Liberty Global Plc, MasterCard Inc. (MA), Ocwen Financial Corp., T-Mobile US Inc. and Vodafone Group Plc were dropped. </p> <p>Kostin said, as a whole, he believes the market is fairly valued currently as the SP 500 trades about 11 points above his year-end forecast. The median stock in the SP 500 sells for about 17 times estimated earnings over the next 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p> <p>While that''s expensive on a historical basis, Kostin said growing profits will keep equities rising modestly toward the upside. The strategist expects the SP 500 to reach 2,100 by the end of next year and 2,200 by the end of 2016. </p> <p>This should give everyone plenty to talk about if they run into Bill Ackman or David Einhorn in the sand box. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Michael J.

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) President
Gary Cohn said low volatility and interest rates that are
holding in tight ranges have resulted in an abnormal trading
market. </p>
<p>The environment for all the firms is quite difficult
right now, Cohn, 53, said today at an investor conference in
New York. What drives activity in our business is volatility.
If markets never move or don''t move, our clients really don''t
need to transact. </p>
<p>Citigroup Inc. (C) Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach, 60,
said yesterday that second-quarter trading revenue could fall as
much as 25 percent from year-earlier levels, and JPMorgan Chase
 Co. (JPM) estimated a 20 percent drop earlier this month. Cohn
stopped short of forecasting the decline for New York-based
Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>We think, at the end of the day, it''s economic in
nature, Cohn said of the cause of lower client volume. We
don''t have clear vision of economic growth or lack of growth. </p>
<p>Cohn said while his firm has been gaining market share
among clients in the trading business, the lack of activity has
kept that from translating into higher revenue. </p>
<p>Low interest rates and the Federal Reserve''s program of
quantitative easing have resulted in reduced volatility, Cohn
said. He pointed to the Chicago Board Options Exchange
Volatility Index, a gauge of U.S. stock volatility known as the
VIX, which is trading 40 percent below its historical average.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note traded over the past
three months in its narrowest band in the 35 years, Cohn said. </p>

<p>Buy Brazilian stocks because the country is going to win the World Cup, giving a boost to the local equity market. </p> <p>That''s according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., whose analysts said the host nation''s chances of winning the most-watched sports event this year are more than three times higher than the next most likely team, neighboring Argentina. </p> <p>Brazil will beat Argentina 3-1 in the final after they see off Germany and Spain in the semifinals, Goldman analysts including Jan Hatzius and Sven Jari Stehn said in a report. The host nation has a 48.5 percent probability of winning the FIFA tournament, followed by Argentina on 14.1 percent and Germany on 11.4 percent. </p> <p>More on the 2014 World Cup:</p>

<p>The win will boost the country''s stock markets in the weeks after the final, based on history, Peter Oppenheimer and other Goldman strategists wrote in the note.

<p>Brazil''s top economic forecaster is
challenging calls from banks such as JPMorgan Chase  Co. and
Deutsche Bank that policy makers will end the world''s longest
tightening cycle, saying faster inflation will motivate them to
boost interest rates for a 10th straight meeting. </p>
<p>Fernando Fix, chief economist at Votorantim Asset
Management in Sao Paulo, estimates central bankers will raise
interest rates by a quarter point to 11.25 percent when the two-day meeting ends today after 6 p.m. local time. That puts him at
odds with the median estimate of 53 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg and traders, who say there''s an 80 percent chance the
central bank will hold the benchmark Selic at 11 percent. </p>
<p>Consumer prices in the world''s second-largest emerging
market have accelerated in the past four months as service costs
push annual inflation to the highest level in 10 months. Policy
makers will continue to raise the benchmark Selic rate today as
faster inflation threatens investment and confidence levels in
Brazil, Fix said. </p>
<p>The central bank recognizes problems related to the
persistence of inflation, he said by telephone. It''s
becoming clearer that high inflation is counterproductive for
growth. </p>
<p>The central bank''s press office declined to comment on
market expectations when contacted by phone. </p>
<h2>Biggest Increase </h2>
<p>Policy makers have raised the Selic by 3.75 percentage
points since April 2013 to fight inflation that Fix said is
still being fanned by falling unemployment rates and rising
wages. That''s the biggest increase of benchmark borrowing costs
in the past year after Turkey and the longest cycle of monetary
policy tightening in the world. </p>
<p>Annual inflation accelerated to 6.31 percent in mid-May
from 6.19 percent the prior month as education, health care and
housing prices increased. The central bank targets 4.5 percent
inflation, plus or minus two percentage points. </p>
<p>The jobless rate fell to 4.9 percent last month, the lowest
since January, while average real income grew from last year. </p>
<p>Industrial production has been weaker, contracting twice in
the first quarter, as economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast
economic growth will slow this year to 1.8 percent from 2.3
percent last year. Consumer confidence as measured by the
Getulio Vargas Foundation in May fell to the lowest level in
more than five years. </p>
<h2>Disappointing'' </h2>
<p>Gross domestic product expanded 0.2 percent in the first
quarter, down from 0.7 percent in the previous three months,
according to analysts polled by Bloomberg. The statistics agency
is scheduled to publish GDP data May 30. </p>
<p>The disappointing expansion in some wealthier nations
is helping reduce inflationary pressures, according to Fabio Akira, chief economist for JPMorgan in Brazil. Policy makers
also are aware that boosting the Selic more will hinder Brazil''s
economic expansion, he said. </p>
<p>Activity numbers are weakening, said Akira. We are
going to see data that will worsen further. </p>
<p>Akira is the best forecaster of Brazil''s economic data
after Fix, according to information compiled by Bloomberg. The
ranking is based on the accuracy of estimates for key economic
indicators over the past two years. </p>
<p>The local currency appreciation also will help relieve
inflationary pressures, Akira said. The real has strengthened
5.6 percent against the dollar this year, the best performance
among 24 emerging market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. It
depreciated 0.6 percent yesterday to 2.2377 per U.S. dollar. </p>
<h2>Pared Bets </h2>
<p>Traders have pared bets for further tightening as policy
makers such as central bank President Alexandre Tombini and the
institution''s international affairs director, Luiz Awazu Pereira, said at separate events this month that monetary policy
has a delayed impact on consumer prices. </p>
<p>Swap rates on the contract maturing in January 2015 have
declined 21 basis points, or 0.21 percentage point, to 10.91
percent since the central bank''s last meeting. The breakeven
rate, based on the difference in yields of inflation-linked
bonds and interest-rate swaps due in 2015, dropped 58 basis
points over the same period. </p>
<p>Jose Carlos de Faria, chief Brazil economist for Deutsche
Bank, agrees with the central bank''s assessment. </p>
<p>It''s clear that we still haven''t seen the full effect
of rate increases, said Faria. The central bank has provided
signs that it will pause. </p>
<p>For Votorantim Asset Management''s Fix, policy makers will
need to increase the Selic by 100 basis points next year to
prevent consumer price increases from breaching the ceiling of
the target range. </p>
<p>Inflation is still worrisome, he said. </p>
<p>(The headline of an earlier version of this story was
corrected to show JPMorgan forecasts no change in the Selic.) </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Executive
Officer Satya Nadella said he will seek to focus on businesses
where the company can lead, rather than harp on missed
opportunities in areas like tablet computers and hardware. </p>
<p>The question is, what is the next thing that is going to
make us better? Nadella said in a keynote interview yesterday
at Re/code''s Code conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, California.
It''s the hunt for what is it that is the inflection point that
matters more than what caused us to miss. </p>
<p>In Nadella''s first public interview since replacing Steve Ballmer as CEO in February, he also said he doesn''t plan to
change Microsoft''s plans for Xbox or sell off the Bing search
engine. The company will continue to span both enterprise and
consumer markets, he said. He highlighted Microsoft''s focus on
products that run on any device, as well as the areas of Web-based cloud computing, mobile and business software. </p>
<p>As part of that effort, the Redmond, Washington-based
company also used the conference to unveil a new Skype product
that translates Web-conference conversations in real time. Set
for a test release later this year, the Skype translator was
demonstrated in a conversation between Gurdeep Singh Pall, who
oversees Skype, and a German speaker. The product provides both
a spoken and text translation and will initially be available as
a stand-alone offering before being combined into the Skype
application. </p>
<h2>Global Product'' </h2>
<p>Skype is a very global product -- it''s all about
connecting people that are separated by distance, Pall said in
an interview. One of the biggest barriers that still remains
is really the language barrier. </p>
<p>Microsoft isn''t sure how many languages will be included
initially, Pall said. The company will release new languages as
they meet the bar for translation quality. </p>
<p>The software relies on work by Microsoft''s research arm, as
well as the Bing search unit, which has its own translation
product for Web pages and Internet content, he said. The Skype
service needs to use speech recognition to understand the
speaker, machine learning for the translation, and text-to-speech technology to send the translation to the listener. </p>
<p>Since taking over, Nadella has sought to focus the world''s
largest software maker on mobile and cloud products. He has
signaled a desire to shift attention to producing software for
rival operating systems like Apple Inc.''s iOS and Google Inc.''s
Android and has shuffled management in areas like marketing,
business development and the Xbox game console. </p>
<h2>Tablet Event </h2>
<p>A company event earlier this month to release a new Surface
tablet was noteworthy for what the CEO chose not to unveil.
While Microsoft showed a larger model of its Surface Pro, a
planned smaller tablet failed to meet with the approval of
Nadella and his executives and was pulled from the event, people
familiar with the matter said last week. </p>
<p>At the session in New York, Nadella didn''t discuss the
missing device and noted that Microsoft won''t seek to develop
hardware to compete with its partners and will instead focus on
areas where it can develop something unique. His comments
suggest a more selective approach to building devices rather
than going for the largest number of offerings. </p>
<p>In Nadella''s first quarter as CEO, Microsoft posted better-than-projected profit as cloud initiatives and cost controls
begun under Ballmer boosted results. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Salesforce.com
Inc. (CRM) agreed to make some of their business-software products
work better together, signaling a thaw between two longtime
rivals. </p>
<p>Salesforce''s customer-management programs will become
available for Microsoft''s Windows and Windows Phone operating
systems, and will work with Office 365 online productivity
software, the companies said in a statement today. </p>
<p>The agreement marks a shift in what has sometimes been a
fractious relationship. In 2010, Microsoft sued Salesforce for
patent infringement, setting off a countersuit before the
companies settled later that year. Microsoft in 2005 also
announced plans to give Salesforce a very effective run for
their money with a competing product and in 2010 ran an anti-Salesforce ad campaign with the tagline Don''t Get Forced. </p>
<p>Under new Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella, Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft has been looking to bolster its
Internet-based cloud software and corporate programs. Software
makers are looking for more ways to let applications, even from
rivals, work together as customers seek to use multiple products
and share information. </p>
<p>This announcement is really about putting our customers
first, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said on a conference call. </p>

<p>In January, employees of Chevron (CVX)''s
renewable power group, whose mission was to create large,
profitable clean-energy projects, dined at San Francisco''s
trendy Sens restaurant. Managers applauded them for almost
doubling their projected profit in 2013, the group''s first full
year of operations. </p>
<p>The mood quickly turned somber. Despite the financial
results and the team''s role in helping start more than a half-dozen solar and geothermal projects capable of powering at least
65,000 homes, managers told the group that funding for the
effort would dry up, and encouraged staffers to find jobs
elsewhere, say four people who attended the dinner, Bloomberg
Businessweek reports in its June 2 issue. </p>
<p>For the past eight years, Chevron Corp. has promoted
profitable renewable energy as a core component of its
business plan. The company''s slogan, Finding newer, cleaner
ways to power the world, is splashed across its website. And
ads begun in 2010 as part of Chevron''s We Agree campaign
declare, It''s time oil companies get behind the development of
renewable energy. Yet Chevron recently has retreated from key
efforts to produce clean energy. This includes the renewable
power group, which invested in or built utility-scale solar and
geothermal projects with margins of 15 percent to 20 percent or
more, according to a dozen people who worked on them. </p>

<p>As Bill Gross vows to restore top
performance at the world''s biggest bond fund, he''s taking a path
many of his rivals shun. </p>
<p>Gross, who manages the $230 billion Pimco Total Return Fund (PTTRX)
at Pacific Investment Management Co. in Newport Beach,
California, is betting five-year Treasuries, which are more
sensitive to changes in the central bank rate than longer-dated
bonds, will do well because markets overestimate how much the
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates. Bond managers at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., BlackRock Inc. (BLK) and JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) say he''s wrong and the intermediate bonds he holds will
suffer when the Fed lifts borrowing costs. </p>
<p>Once they see the whites of the eyes of full employment,
they will want to normalize rates at a faster clip, Jonathan Beinner, co-head of global fixed income at Goldman Sachs Asset
Management, said in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>Gross, 70, is betting on an economic view he calls the
new neutral, which argues that the top speeds of the biggest
economies and their equilibrium interest rates have declined and
won''t return to levels seen before the financial crisis. While
most bond managers agree rates will be lower, with the federal
funds target ranging somewhere between 3 percent and 4 percent
by 2018, Gross sees it at just 2 percent, making bonds
attractive to Pimco that BlackRock and Goldman Sachs won''t
touch. </p>

<p>The city of Los Angeles accused
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) of targeting minority borrowers with
predatory loans in a lawsuit filed two days after Wells Fargo 
Co. (WFC) lost a court bid to dismiss a similar case. </p>
<p>The second-largest U.S. city sued Wells Fargo, Citigroup
Inc. and Bank of America Corp. last year, saying the lenders
engaged in biased practices since at least 2004 by placing
minority borrowers in mortgages they couldn''t afford and driving
up the number of foreclosures in their neighborhoods. </p>
<p>L.A. continues to suffer from the foreclosure crisis,
from blight in our neighborhoods to diminished revenue for basic
city services, City Attorney Mike Feuer said in a statement.
We''re fighting to hold those we allege are responsible to
account. </p>
<p>The claim against New York-based JPMorgan is the most
recent in a series of lawsuits by municipalities across the U.S.
to hold mortgage lenders responsible for fallout from the
collapse of the housing market. Yesterday, Providence, Rhode
Island, sued Banco Santander SA (SAN)''s U.S. unit, alleging
discriminatory lending in the years after the recession. </p>
<p>In today''s suit and earlier ones by Los Angeles, the city
accuses the banks of historically red-lining black and
Hispanic areas as no-loan zones. Starting in the late 1990s, the
banks engaged in reverse red-lining by flooding the areas
with subprime mortgages even when minorities qualified for
better terms, according to the complaint filed today in federal
court in Los Angeles. </p>
<h2>Fair Terms'' </h2>
<p>In addition, JPMorgan has since 2009 declined to offer
refinancing or loan modification to minority customers on fair
terms, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>We are disappointed the L.A. city attorney is pursuing an
adversarial approach to address city finances impacted by the
recent economic downturn, JPMorgan spokeswoman Suzanne Ryan
said in an e-mailed statement. The downturn was beyond our
control. </p>
<p>Counties encompassing Chicago and parts of Atlanta have
made similar claims in lawsuits against units of Bank of America
and HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA) The banks deny the claims, which allege
violations of the Fair Housing Act of 1968. </p>

<p>International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
is working with Beijing TransWiseway Information Technology Co.
to offer drivers in China more connectivity in their vehicles. </p>
<p>IBM''s cloud-based technology will connect vehicles to the
Internet and each other to deliver information such as traffic
alerts, weather advisories and suggestions for alternate routes
to a driver''s mobile phone, the companies said today in a
statement. The new platform may connect with 1.5 million trucks
next year and 10 million in two to three years, the companies
estimates. </p>
<p>Drivers are increasingly looking to be connected while in
their vehicles. Technology to do that is the top selling point
for 39 percent of auto buyers, more than twice the 14 percent
who say their first consideration is traditional performance
measures such as power and speed, according to a study
consulting firm Accenture released in December. </p>
<p>This effort targeted for improving in-vehicle services
will make an important impact on the whole driving ecosystem in
China and combining mobile and cloud technologies will drive
innovation across the automotive industry, said Ernie Hu, vice
president of software for the IBM Greater China Group. IBM is
based in Armonk, New York. </p>
<p>IBM''s collaboration for the connected car in China is being
announced as tensions between the world''s two largest economies
have escalated after U.S. prosecutors accused the Chinese
military of stealing corporate secrets. China''s government is
studying whether domestic banks'' reliance on IBM''s high-end
servers threatens national security and is expanding a trial

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Salesforce.com
Inc. (CRM) plan to announce an agreement that will enable customers of
Microsoft''s cloud-computing service to use Salesforce''s
enterprise software, said people familiar with the talks,
signaling a thaw between two longtime rivals. </p>
<p>The partnership will make Salesforce''s customer-management
programs available on Microsoft''s Azure service, said the
people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions
are confidential. Salesforce will also commit to using Azure to
host some of its own applications and will integrate data from
Salesforce products into Microsoft''s Office programs, the people
said. </p>
<p>An agreement would mark a shift in what has sometimes been
a fractious relationship between the two companies. In 2010,
Microsoft sued Salesforce for patent infringement, setting off a
countersuit before the companies settled later that year.
Microsoft in 2005 also announced plans to give Salesforce a
very effective run for their money with a competing product
and in 2010 ran an anti-Salesforce ad campaign with the tagline
Don''t Get Forced. </p>
<h2>Nortel European Units Seek Slice of Asset Auction Cash Hoard </h2>
<p>Nortel Networks Corp. (NRTLQ)''s defunct units in the U.K. and
Europe deserve part of the bankrupt telecom company''s $7.3
billion cash hoard because of their technology researchers'' past
work, an investment banker said. </p>
<p>Paul Huffard, a senior managing director at Blackstone
Group LP called to testify by the European units, argued May 28
in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware, that the best way to
split the cash is based on the research and development by
Nortel''s regional units. </p>
<p>Using that method, disputed by Nortel''s defunct U.S. and
Canadian components, the U.K. and European units deserve about
18 percent of the cash, Huffard said. </p>
<p>The contingents are in the third week of a six-week trial
over how to divide money raised in auctions after what was once
North America''s largest telephone-equipment maker went bankrupt
in 2009. The money includes proceeds of a patent sale that
raised $4.5 billion. </p>
<p>The units are arguing on behalf of creditors including
bondholders in the U.S. and pensioners in the U.K. and Canada.
Each group is trying to convince a U.S. bankruptcy judge and a
Canadian judge that its method for dividing the money is best. </p>
<p>The case is Nortel Networks Inc., 09-bk-10138, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). </p>

<h2>Sanrio''s Hello Kitty, Comic Book Hero Items Seized in Singapore </h2>
<p>Sanrio Co. (8136)''s Hello Kitty items were among counterfeit
merchandise seized in a raid by Singapore Customs May 20. </p>
<p>Enforcement officers from the customs service found a 40-foot container containing toys, water bottles and accessories
with unauthorized Hello Kitty, Batman, Captain America, Spider-Man, Superman, Transformers, Barney and Care Bears marks, the
service said in a statement yesterday. </p>
<p>The goods came from Shenzhen, China, and the customs
service said it found more infringing merchandise in the office
of the importer who was bringing in the container. </p>
<h2>HR Block Settles Suit Over Peace of Mind'' Trademark </h2>
<p>HR Block Inc. (HRB) of Kansas City, Missouri, and a competing
tax-preparation service settled their trademark dispute,
according to a May 19 court filing. </p>
<p>The lawsuit involved Fast Cash Taxes LLC''s alleged
unauthorized use of HR Block''s Peace of Mind trademark. HR
Block sued Fast Cash, of Doraville, Georgia, in Atlanta federal
court on March 28, seeking a court order barring unauthorized
use of the mark and awards of money damages. </p>
<p>The court filing didn''t disclose terms of the settlement. </p>
<p>The case is HRB Innovations Inc. v. Fast Cash Taxes LLC,
14-cv-00903, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Georgia
(Atlanta). </p>

<h2>More than 1.3 Million Copyright Alert Notices Sent, Center Says </h2>
<p>The Center for Copyright Information, an advocacy group
comprising copyright holders and Internet service providers,
issued a report on the six strikes copyright alert system in
place in the U.S. since February 2013. </p>
<p>More than 1.3 million notices were sent to consumers in the
past year, with 70 percent sent at the first stage of what can
be an escalating alert and mitigation system, according to the
report. </p>
<p>Under a policy set up when the system was put into place,

<h2>Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage </h2>
<h2>Google Releases Previously Closely Held Employment Data </h2>
<p>Google Inc. (GOOG), creator of the world''s most-used Internet
search engine, backed down on its claims that numbers reflecting
the ethnic and gender makeup of its workforce were a trade
secret. </p>
<p>In a report published on the Mountain View, California-based company''s official blog May 28, Google said that it was in
the wrong when it refused to release the data. </p>
<p>The company revealed that 70 percent of its employees are
male and 61 percent are white. Only 2 percent of its workforce
is black, Google said. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) named Claudia Jury and Pranav Thakur as global co-heads of foreign exchange
and emerging markets, part of a wider reshuffle prompted by the
surprise departure of Mike Cavanagh two months ago. </p>
<p>Kanav Bhagat, who was head of U.S. rates trading, will
become global head of rates, according to a memo to employees
from James Kenny and Troy Rohrbaugh, co-heads of global rates,
foreign exchange, commodities and emerging markets. Bhagat is
filling a role that Rohrbaugh had starting in 2012. A JPMorgan
spokesman in London confirmed the contents of the document. </p>
<p>This team will focus on monetizing the opportunities made
available by changes in market structure and the competitive
landscape while also continuing to aggressively grow our client
franchise, the co-heads said in the memo. </p>
<p>Daniel Pinto, head of the corporate and investment bank for
New York-based JPMorgan, named Kenny and Rohrbaugh co-heads of
global rates, foreign exchange, commodities and emerging markets
last month. Pinto, 51, is overhauling reporting lines across the
division after becoming its sole chief following Cavanagh''s move
to private-equity firm Carlyle Group LP. </p>
<h2>Pluta, Robinson </h2>
<p>Thomas Pluta, global head of foreign-exchange forwards
trading, will have added responsibility as global head of short-term interest-rate trading, according to the memo. Pitts Robinson will be global head of foreign-exchange services to
deliver FX products to clients, and Eddie Wen was made global
head of electronic trading for the four areas overseen by Kenny
and Rohrbaugh. </p>
<p>Jury previously oversaw global foreign-exchange spot
trading and Thakur ran rates and currencies in Asia, excluding
Japan. Stephen Jefferies was named head of emerging markets and
Europe, Middle East and Africa foreign exchange, reporting to
Jury and Thakur, according to the memo. </p>
<p>Reporting to Bhagat will be Charles Bristow, who was named
head of derivatives and liquid government bonds in Europe, the
Middle East and Africa, and Carl Norrey, who will manage
sovereign credit default swap trading and non-liquid European
government bond trading. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, also named Jeff Herbert-Smith as head of Australia markets, expanding his role
managing fixed-income trading to include equities. </p>
