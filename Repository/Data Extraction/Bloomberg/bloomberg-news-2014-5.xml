&lt;p&gt;U.K. Business Secretary Vince Cable
said Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s bid for AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) raised questions of
&#8220;overriding national interest,&#8221; as the opposition Labour Party
stepped up its rejection of the proposed takeover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labour leader Ed Miliband accused Prime Minister David Cameron yesterday of promoting Pfizer&#8217;s bid for London-based
AstraZeneca. Cable later told reporters that reviewing rules on
intervening in takeovers on public interest grounds was an
option that the government was looking at. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parliament&#8217;s Business, Innovation and Skills Committee will
meet tomorrow to discuss whether to summon Pfizer executives.
Chairman Adrian Bailey, a member of Miliband&#8217;s Labour Party,
told reporters on April 29 that it was likely they would do so,
as the bid needed to be &#8220;scrutinized very carefully.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political attitudes to the bid are hardening less than
three weeks before local and European elections even after
AstraZeneca&#8217;s board rejected Pfizer&#8217;s 63.1 billion-pound ($106.5
billion) sweetened offer on May 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The British competition merger regime is non-political in
the way it is applied, I think that&#8217;s valued in that Britain is
open in that respect,&#8221; said Cable, a member of Cameron&#8217;s
Liberal Democratic junior coalition partner. &#8220;But there is an
important national interest here that we have got to safeguard
the protection of jobs and investment and particularly high
technology research in pharmaceuticals.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) partners Alison Mass and David Dase weren&#8217;t buying. The bankers stared skeptically at a glass of brownish liquid as a young man described a new technology for purifying even the filthiest water. The sample was safe to drink, he said, taking a sip. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than 1,000 investment-banking colleagues, watching a video of the encounter at a daylong strategy session at the New York Hilton Midtown in March, erupted in laughter. The man with the purification pitch was an actor. Mass and Dase, who weren&#8217;t in on the joke, were doing their best to salvage a meeting that Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn had asked each of them to take, Bloomberg Markets magazine reports in its June 2014 issue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the video was the latest episode in a series of hidden-camera pranks targeting partners, a broader message wasn&#8217;t hard to fathom: Goldman Sachs bankers have taken enough crap. Just a few years after the firm&#8217;s reputation was sullied by sales of shoddy, crisis-era mortgage bonds, including one that an executive at the company described in an e-mail as a &#8220;shitty deal,&#8221; the investment-banking unit is coming off one of its best years ever. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) shareholder withdrew a lawsuit claiming the company&#8217;s
cooperation with a National Security Agency eavesdropping
program caused a drop in its China sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Louisiana Sheriffs&#8217; Pension and Relief Fund dropped the
securities fraud suit after investigating its claims against
IBM, lawyers for the fund said in a letter to U.S. District
Judge Denise Cote made public today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision was &#8220;based on new information that wasn&#8217;t
available&#8221; earlier, John C. Browne, a lawyer for the fund, said
in a telephone interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, which had criticized the suit as &#8220;pushing a wild
conspiracy theory,&#8221; said the fund did the right thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At the time this suit was filed, we said the complaint
proceeded to make numerous specious and false accusations, and
IBM called upon the law firm that filed this action to do the
right thing and dismiss it,&#8221; Doug Shelton, an IBM spokesman,
said in an e-mailed statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, the largest computer-services provider, reported a 22
percent drop in sales in China on Oct. 16 compared with the
previous quarter as a result of disclosures by Edward Snowden
that the company was cooperating with the NSA, the Louisiana
fund said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snowden, now living in Russia, had revealed details of an
NSA surveillance program showing that technology companies were
providing data at the request of government agencies. IBM in
March said it hadn&#8217;t disclosed client data to the U.S.
government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Louisiana fund said it pays retirement, death and
disability benefits to more than 20,000 active and retired
employees of sheriffs&#8217; offices across the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Louisiana Sheriffs&#8217; Pension  Relief Fund v.
International Business Machines Corp., 13-cv-08818, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Ian Read became Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s
leader, he&#8217;s shed two non-drug businesses, reorganized the
company into three separate units and pursued the largest merger
in the history of the pharmaceutical industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, even with AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) in his sights as a takeover
target, Read said he could theoretically see a time in the
future when Pfizer splits into two parts to boost investor
value, potentially making a proposed mega-company short lived. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re not talking about a three or four-way split, we&#8217;re
talking about two major segments,&#8221; said Read, 60, a native of
Scotland who started his career at Pfizer as an accountant and
became chief executive officer in 2010, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer never really thought of itself as three businesses,
Read said on a conference call with investors and analysts
today. It&#8217;s a shift from last year, when the company began
dividing the company into three units, each with its own leader.
Read emphasized he&#8217;s made no decision about a breakup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares fell 2.6 percent to $29.96 at the close in
New York. The stock had gained 3.5 percent in the last 12
months, the worst performance of any major brand drugmaker on
the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Pharmaceutical Index of 13 companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer last week offered about $106 billion to buy
AstraZeneca Plc, a bid that was promptly dismissed by the
London-based company. Along with the lower tax rate linked to
AstraZeneca&#8217;s U.K. base, Read has said the acquisition would
give New York-based Pfizer a promising new generation of
experimental cancer drugs that use the body&#8217;s own immune system
to attack the disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seeking Efficiency &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being bigger would also help Pfizer be more efficient,
strengthen it in key drug development areas, and give the
company more leverage against the governments and insurers
buying its products, he said during the call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Immune-oncology is exciting, it&#8217;s something to hang your
hat on. But the tax stuff and the synergies are really where
this lies,&#8221; said Judson Clark, an analyst with Edward Jones 
Co.  based in Des Peres, Missouri. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal to buy AstraZeneca is being looked at closely by
the U.K. government, over concerns it could reduce British
pharmaceutical industry jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, it hasn&#8217;t attracted nearly the same level of
scrutiny in the U.S., where Read has said Pfizer will largely
keep its operating headquarters even as it moves its legal
residence to the U.K. for the lower tax rate. &#8220;We clearly will
stay with a massive presence in the U.S. with a combined
company,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read declined to say when or if Pfizer might take its case
directly to AstraZeneca shareholders in a hostile takeover
attempt, though he hinted they might. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Considering Options&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are very disappointed with their unwillingness to
engage in conversations and believe it is in the best interests
of both companies and AstraZeneca and Pfizer shareholders that
we pursue a friendly negotiated transaction,&#8221; Read said. &#8220;We
are considering our options on how we progress these
discussions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two units inside Pfizer makes more sense than three, with
half the company focused on brand-name drugs while the other
part focuses on older products, Clark said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It calls in the question why restructure into three unit
instead of two in the first place,&#8221; Clark said by telephone.
&#8220;They&#8217;re tacking a bit more toward the center if they do
acquire AstraZeneca.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read&#8217;s comment followed a first-quarter report in which the
company&#8217;s profit beat analysts estimates while revenue fell
short of analyst expectations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Estimates Beat &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings excluding one-time items were 57 cents a share, 2
cents above the average of 12 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Revenue fell 9 percent to $11.4 billion as foreign exchange
rates reduced sales by 3 percent, the company said in a
statement today. Analysts expected $12.1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Overall, a weak quarter with disappointing revenues,&#8221;
said Timothy Anderson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein 
Co., who called it a &#8220;low-quality&#8221; beat of earnings estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-quarter net income fell 15 percent to $2.33 billion,
or 36 cents, from $2.75 billion, or 38 cents, the company said.
Pfizer said it would change its full-year earnings outlook,
though wasn&#8217;t permitted to do so now because of rules
surrounding its offer to buy the U.K. drugmaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer for the first time broke out separate financial
results for the three units. Total first-quarter drug sales fell
9 percent to $10.5 billion from a year earlier. Sales of
Prevnar, Pfizer&#8217;s pneumonia vaccine, were little changed at $927
million. Viagra, a pill for erectile dysfunction, had sales that
dropped 19 percent to $374 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quarter&#8217;s results were helped by a 11 percent reduction
in cost of sales, which fell to $2.05 billion. Administrative
expenses declined 6 percent to $3.04 billion, and research-and-development spending decreased 5 percent to $1.62 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s proposal to pay
$280 million to investors who claimed they were misled in buying
mortgage-backed securities won preliminary approval from a
federal judge in Brooklyn, New York, according to court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Pamela K. Chen issued the order May 2
granting initial approval to the settlement with investors led
by the Public Employees&#8217; Retirement System of Mississippi. A
hearing on final approval is scheduled for July 24. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mississippi pension plan sued in March 2008 on behalf
of investors who bought $36.8 billion of mortgage-backed
securities from May 2006 to September 2007, claiming the bank
misrepresented the offerings for the investments. JPMorgan
didn&#8217;t admit to any wrongdoing in agreeing to settle the
lawsuit, according to the court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian J. Marchiony, a spokesman for JPMorgan, declined to
comment on the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Plumbers  Pipefitters&#8217; Local No. 562
Supplemental Plan  Trust v. JP Morgan Acceptance Corp. I, 2:08-cv-01713, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York
(Brooklyn). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest U.S.
bank by assets, sees no signs of a bubble in emerging-market
corporate debt, challenging the International Monetary Fund&#8217;s
warning on rising risks in the bond market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds sold by developing-country companies account for just
3 percent of gross domestic product in these economies, compared
with 35 percent in the U.S., according to Joyce Chang, global
head of research at the New York-based bank. Most of the lenders
selling debt are rated investment grade or backed by their
governments while maturities have been extended, she said in a
May 2 interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IMF warned last month that some emerging-market
companies are vulnerable to capital flight if global borrowing
costs rise further as the Federal Reserve gradually withdraws
its expansionary monetary polices. Corporate debt for developing
countries tracked by Bank of America Corp. surged to $1.1
trillion from $411 billion at the end of 2009 as companies took
advantage of low interest rates to raise cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would really&#160;challenge some of the views from&#160;official
creditors that emerging-market corporate debt is&#160;the next asset
bubble,&#8221; Chang, who was promoted from head of fixed-income
research last month amid a leadership reshuffle in the global
banking division, said in New York. &#8220;The&#160;credit&#160;quality of
emerging-market&#160;issuance&#160;has been pretty&#160;good.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olga Stankova, a spokeswoman for the IMF, didn&#8217;t respond to
a phone call and an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Crisis Catalyst &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth of emerging-market bonds is mostly driven by supply-demand imbalances rather than speculation, Chang said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise of developing-country debt has happened after the
supply of fixed-income products from mature markets shrank
following the 2008 global financial crisis, according to Chang. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, banks, pension funds and insurance
companies are required to hold more bonds in their investment
portfolio as part of tighter financial regulation, boosting the
demand for emerging-market securities, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You have a structural shift in the market with a supply
and demand imbalance and emerging markets&#160;have benefited from
the lack of alternative investment opportunities,&#8221; Chang said.
&#8220;The&#160;increase in issuance is obviously something to flag, but
then you have to look at whether&#160;the issuance is&#160;short-term debt
for refinancing.&#160;EM issuance is the longest duration within
fixed income and EM is not facing a wall of maturities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IMF said on April 9 in a report that corporate bonds of
developing nations are vulnerable in an environment of rising
global interest rates and slower growth prospects. About $740
billion, or 35 percent of emerging-market outstanding debt, may
be at risk of default in a scenario involving a 25 percent
increase in borrowing costs and a 25 percent drop in corporate
earnings, according to the Washington-based fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s Corporate EMBI Broad Diversified Index returned
3.8 percent this year through May 2. The gauge lost 0.6 percent
last year, the first annual decline since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) led shares of
Wall Street banks lower, dropping the most in almost a month,
after warning that a deepening trading slump may last through
the second quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of the company fell 2.7 percent to $54.08 at 9:58
a.m., the worst performance in the 83-company Standard  Poor&#8217;s
500 Financials Index. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
Citigroup Inc. (C) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) all lost at least 1.3
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed-income and equities trading revenue will fall about
20 percent from last year&#8217;s second quarter, New York-based
JPMorgan said in a regulatory filing after the market closed
last week. The firm blamed &#8220;a continued challenging environment
and lower client activity levels.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 58, was the first head
of a major U.S. bank to warn investors this year that trading
was down, saying in February that revenue had fallen 15 percent.
A 20 percent slide from the $5.37 billion posted in last year&#8217;s
second quarter would mean about $4.3 billion from the trading
business this period. That would mark the company&#8217;s worst first
half in trading since the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The division&#8217;s actual results will hinge on its performance
during remaining months in the quarter, which &#8220;can be
volatile,&#8221; the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts have cited the Federal Reserve&#8217;s decision to slow
its bond-purchasing program for some of the decline, which
eroded first-quarter results at U.S. financial firms including
Bank of America and Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Citigroup, Goldman &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect that the weakness JPM is experiencing in
trading-related revenues will be duplicated at other capital-markets-oriented banks,&#8221; Charles Peabody, an analyst at
Portales Partners LLC, said today in a research note, referring
to the bank by its stock symbol. He singled out Citigroup and
Goldman Sachs as most likely to report weak trading results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS), which is concentrated more on equities than
bonds, was alone in registering a trading increase during the
first three months of 2014, though Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, 56, said she saw weakness ahead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The volumes that we talked a lot about during the first
quarter -- lower activity -- we&#8217;re continuing to see that really
does persist into the second quarter,&#8221; Porat said in a
Bloomberg Television interview last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan gave forecasts on other business units. Mortgage
banking will post a pretax production loss of $100 million to
$150 million in the second quarter, driven by higher interest
rates, the bank said. Expenses will be lower than the $59
billion reported last year, according to the forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-quarter profit fell 19 percent to $5.27 billion,
driven by a 21 percent tumble in fixed-income trading, JPMorgan
said April 11. &lt;/p&gt;

month after warning that a deepening Wall Street trading slump
may last through the second quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of the company tumbled as much as 3.4 percent to
$53.70 before paring the loss to $54.05 at 9:39 a.m. The slide,
which brought the year-to-date decline to 7.3 percent, was the
biggest in the 24-company KBW Bank Index. Citigroup Inc. lost
1.5 percent and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) fell 1.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after the longest run of gains in
16 months for Poland&#8217;s zloty bonds, BNP Paribas SA and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. say there&#8217;s still reason to be bullish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government debt returned 1 percent in April and 3.6 percent
during the past three months, the longest stretch since December
2012, the Bloomberg Poland Local Sovereign Index shows. Yields
on five-year notes reached 3.53 percent, 58 basis points less
than this year&#8217;s high and 302 basis points over similar German
securities, compared with 272 on Dec. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Policy maker Adam Glapinski told PAP newswire April 28 that
the National Bank of Poland may be free to keep its benchmark
rate at a record-low 2.50 percent until the middle of 2015 amid
consumer-price growth 2.1 percentage points below its five-year
average. BNP Paribas advises buying five-year zloty notes given
&#8220;persistently low inflation&#8221; and prospects of quantitative
easing by the European Central Bank, emerging-market strategists
Piotr Chwiejczak and Dina Ahmad wrote in an April 29 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Poland is one foot in the euro area and will offer a
positive real interest rate of about 2 percent in the next two
years, while Europe will show negative real rates,&#8221; Chwiejczak
said by phone from London on May 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank pledged in March to keep rates on hold at
least until the end of the third quarter as growth in the
European Union&#8217;s largest eastern economy accelerates without
stoking price growth. Inflation stayed unchanged at 0.7 percent
in March, leaving the real interest rate at 1.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ECB Outlook &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ECB will probably keep its benchmark rate at an all-time low of 0.25 percent at the next meeting on May 8, according
to the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey.
Policy makers will take some sort of action within two months
against the threat of low prices, which rose a less-than-forecast 0.7 percent in April, another survey showed last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the outlook for price growth across Europe, analysts
will probably push back forecasts for Polish rate increases,
creating scope for further bond gains, Andrew Matheny, an
analyst at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a note on April 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poland is seen raising rates by 50 basis points to 3
percent in the first three months of next year and to 3.25
percent by the end of the first half, according to the median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;More Dovish&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our views are significantly more dovish than market
pricing in Poland on a 12-18 month horizon,&#8221; which translates
into a &#8220;constructive outlook&#8221; on Polish bonds, Matheny wrote
in the report. He predicted a 25 basis-point increase by the end
of June 2015. The view was still valid on May 2, the bank&#8217;s
Frankfurt-based spokeswoman Katharina Jung said by e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traders have scaled back bets for higher rates in Poland,
now predicting less than a quarter-point increase over the next
year, according to forward-rate agreements on May 2. That
compares with expectations for a full 25 basis-point jump in the
12 months from April 23 and more than a half-point increase in
the year from Jan. 31, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The zloty slipped less than 0.1 percent to 4.2077 against
the euro at 12:49 p.m. in Warsaw, taking its 2014 drop to 1.3
percent. The additional yield on Poland&#8217;s dollar bonds over
Treasuries was unchanged at 119 basis points, JPMorgan Chase 
Co. indexes show. That compares with this year&#8217;s low of 103
basis points on April 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poland may decide to start raising rates in the fourth
quarter as the economy accelerates, Andrzej Rzonca, a member of
the central bank&#8217;s Monetary Policy Council, said in an interview
for newspaper Parkiet on May 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The sooner we raise rates, the more gradual the increases
will be and their total scale will be more limited,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Zloty Weakens &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflation will probably accelerate to 1.3 percent this year
from 0.9 percent in 2013, as the economy expands 3.2 percent,
double last year&#8217;s pace, according Bloomberg surveys of
economists. The central bank is targeting price growth of 2.5
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An escalating crisis may damp economic expansion, shaving
off about 0.6 percentage point from growth in the worst-case
scenario, according to BNP&#8217;s Chwiejczak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Violence increased in Ukraine&#8217;s easternmost regions as the
government pursued its offensive to dislodge rebels and the
conflict spread to the south. The easternmost area is
&#8220;essentially at war,&#8221; the head of the country&#8217;s anti-terrorist
agency said May 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The geopolitical situation works toward lower inflation
in Poland,&#8221; further supporting zloty bonds, Chwiejczak said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Mahoney, a Goldman Sachs (GS) Group
Inc. investment banker who leads the firm&#8217;s efforts to advise
U.S. lenders, is moving to Asia to head the financial-institutions group in that region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mahoney, 56, will replace Peter Enns, who&#8217;s becoming chief
executive officer of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s business in Canada,
according to an April memo to employees obtained yesterday by
Bloomberg News. Kenneth Coquillette and Scott Romanoff will
replace Mahoney as co-heads of the banking industry for FIG in
the Americas, according to a separate memo last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global mergers and acquisitions involving financial
companies totaled less than $1.2 trillion each of the past five
years, after surpassing $2 trillion in 2007, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Goldman Sachs is the top-ranked adviser
on financial company deals so far this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mahoney will be head of FIG for Asia ex-Japan, based in
Hong Kong, according to the April 11 memo from executives
including FIG global co-heads Mike Esposito and Todd Leland.
Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the New York-based bank,
confirmed the contents of the memos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mahoney joined Goldman Sachs in 1987 and became a partner
in 2000. He advised Toronto-Dominion Bank on its 2006 sale of TD
Waterhouse USA to Ameritrade Holding Corp. and Countrywide
Financial Corp. on its 2008 sale to Bank of America Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craig Murray and Bernard Teo were named co-chief operating
officers of FIG for Asia ex-Japan under Mahoney. Goldman Sachs
said last month that Enns, a Canadian, would move from Hong Kong
to Toronto to replace Jack Curtin, 63, who&#8217;s retiring at year-end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coquillette, co-head of investment banking for the Midwest
region, joined Goldman Sachs in 1988 and became a partner in
2010. He&#8217;ll move from Chicago to New York in his new role. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romanoff, who joined in 1992 and was named a partner in
2008, will continue to serve as co-head of the FIG financing
group for the Americas, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric Warmstein, a managing director in
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s financial-institutions advisory business,
has retired, a person familiar with the move said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warmstein, 56, left last week after seven years with New
York-based JPMorgan, the person said, asking not to be
identified because the move hasn&#8217;t been announced. Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for the bank, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warmstein tied for the No. 1 ranking among bankers advising
on bank and thrift deals last year, according to SNL Financial,
a bank research firm in Charlottesville, Virginia. He helped
advise Umpqua Holdings Corp. in its $2 billion purchase of
Sterling Financial Corp., SNL data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warmstein joined JPMorgan in 2007 from UBS AG, where he
worked on transactions such Bank of New York Co.&#8217;s purchase of
Mellon Financial Corp., and Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s purchase of
U.S. Trust Corp., according to a memo at the time. His
colleagues at Zurich-based UBS included Kenneth Moelis, who
later founded advisory Moelis  Co., and Olivier Sarkozy, now at
Carlyle Group LP. Before that Warmstein was a merger adviser at
Credit Suisse First Boston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s financial-institutions group, led by Fernando Rivas, ranked No. 1 in handling U.S. bank deals last year,
advising on seven transactions worth $5.8 billion, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. That was good for about 47 percent
of the announced deal volume. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) named two
managing directors, John Anderson and Mike Camacho, to take over
from Blythe Masters as co-heads of global commodities after the
bank pulls back from physical products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anderson has been JPMorgan&#8217;s Houston-based head of non-oil
energy trading and Camacho has led EMEA commodities in London
since 2012, the New York-based company said in a memo to
employees today. Masters, who started as an intern almost three
decades ago, plans to leave as JPMorgan completes a $3.5 billion
sale of the physical commodities business to Mercuria Energy
Group Ltd., according to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are confident our franchise will continue to be
recognized for our commitment to clients, and our dedication to
providing them with the products they need across a wide range
of commodities products and services,&#8221; according to the memo
from James Kenny and Troy Rohrbaugh, co-heads of global rates,
foreign exchange, commodities and emerging markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, is getting out of physical
commodities amid pressure from regulators and lawmakers. They&#8217;re
concerned that banks handling raw materials and energy could
manipulate prices or endanger the financial system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The replacements for Masters were reported earlier by
SparkSpread, an industry trade publication. JPMorgan fell 1.6
percent to $53.34 today in New York, leaving the shares down 8.8
percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO) is stepping up dealmaking to reach one of the fastest growing U.S. audiences: Latinos with a taste for drama. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Televisa&#8217;s president of content, Jose Baston, said the company is currently in negotiations to develop exclusive shows for video-streaming provider Netflix Inc. (NFLX) Last year, Televisa distributed the highest grossing Spanish-language film of all time in the U.S., &#8220;Instructions Not Included.&#8221; About 3 million viewers watched last year&#8217;s finale of &#8220;Devious Maids,&#8221; a Lifetime drama based on a Televisa format. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Televisa is tapping into the U.S. Hispanic community, estimated to make up a fifth of the country&#8217;s population by 2025, as the company becomes the target of Mexican regulators for reaching more than 70 percent of broadcast audiences there. Televisa already provides Netflix users in Latin America with more than 3,000 hours of content, including the soap operas it helped popularize over the past 50 years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s not enough content yet that&#8217;s directly aimed at them,&#8221; said Phil Contrino, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. &#8220;You&#8217;re not really worrying about crossover potential because there&#8217;s enough of an audience there. Slapstick comedy with very serious melodrama, it connected. It&#8217;s what the audience wants.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), the target of
Pfizer&#8217;s Inc.&#8217;s takeover bid of more than $100 billion, forecast
long-term sales growth as the company seeks to convince
investors that it can succeed as a standalone drugmaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca will generate more than $45 billion in yearly
revenue by 2023, following &#8220;strong and consistent&#8221; growth
starting in 2017, the London-based company said today in a
statement. Its pipeline of drugs, led by lung and ovarian cancer
treatments, could generate as much as $63 billion in peak-year
sales, the company said. Revenue last year totaled $25.7
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca last week rejected a takeover bid by Pfizer of
62.6 billion pounds ($106 billion) in a mix of cash and stock
that valued the company at about 50 pounds a share. The offer
failed to appreciate the promising medicines the company is
developing, AstraZeneca said, and threatened to disrupt its
progress. The pipeline is the product of a strategy announced
last year to turn the company around, Pascal Soriot, who took
over as chief executive officer in 2012, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Opposing &#8216;Distraction&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Any distraction can suddenly have a negative impact,&#8221;
Soriot told analysts and investors on a conference call. &#8220;We
are in a race with many of our competitors to get products into
the marketplace. Any distraction that causes us to slow down, or
any distraction that causes us to lose talent, can destroy
value.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Widger, a spokesman in the U.K. for New York-based
Pfizer, declined to comment on AstraZeneca&#8217;s presentation today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca&#8217;s expectations are &#8220;ambitious, to say the
least,&#8221; and rely on the ultimate approval of products that are
high-risk, have unclear market potential or are in areas where
the U.K. drugmaker lags behind competitors, according to
Barclays Plc analysts, including Mark Purcell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are deeply skeptical of Astra achieving such a level
of revenues,&#8221; Purcell and his colleagues wrote in a report to
investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca fell 2.7 percent to 4,677 pence at the close in
London. Pfizer declined 1.3 percent to $29.58 as of 12:34 p.m.
in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Product Prospects &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only 30 percent of the projected $45 billion in revenue in
2023 stems from drugs in the pipeline, Soriot said. There is a
low chance of success for any one drug, he said. In aggregate,
products in the pipeline have a 36 percent chance of success and
the company isn&#8217;t relying on any of them, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you what products will make it,&#8221; the CEO
said. &#8220;But I can tell you none of the products is more than 10
percent of the pipeline.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers from across Britain&#8217;s political parties have
raised questions about implications of Pfizer&#8217;s potential
takeover of AstraZeneca on jobs and pharmaceutical investments.
Executives from the two drugmakers will also be asked to testify
about the proposed acquisition, the House of Commons lawmakers
Business Committee said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Unite and GMB labor unions asked for a meeting with
U.K. Business Secretary Vince Cable to urge him to impose a
&#8220;national interest&#8221; test on the deal. They accused Prime
Minister David Cameron and Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, both Tories, of being supportive of the Pfizer bid
while AstraZeneca workers haven&#8217;t been consulted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Intervention &#8216;Constraints&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cable, who said he would be happy to meet with the unions,
said the government is &#8220;working hard within the constraints we
have&#8221; to secure a positive outcome for British jobs and
science. European Union rules restrict the amount that states
can intervene in business transactions, and British law only
allows intervention on issues of national security, media
plurality and banking, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The government must and will approach this from a
position of even-handed neutrality,&#8221; Cable said in Parliament.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not ruling out intervention. We have to look at all the
options open to us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca reiterated that 2017 revenue will be in line
with its 2013 sales. Analysts estimate its revenue falling to
$24.3 billion in 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth will be driven by AstraZeneca&#8217;s strength in diabetes
and respiratory disease treatments, which may each bring in
about $8 billion in sales in 2023, as well as Brilinta, a heart
medicine that may garner about $3.5 billion. it said. Whether
Brilinta meets that goal depends on winning approval of the drug
for different uses, Tim Anderson, an analyst with Sanford C.
Bernstein  Co., wrote in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is also counting on increasing sales in
emerging markets, including China, and Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cancer Therapies &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca said its investment in science is paying off,
particularly in a line of cancer therapies that stimulate the
body&#8217;s immune system to fight off the disease, and its drugs are
worth more than analysts predict. For example, AZD9291, a lung
cancer medicine, could be worth $3 billion a year, compared with
estimates of as much as $2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Immuno-oncology is the therapeutic area that is getting
the most investor attention now, but AZN will be a late entrant
into the category and it is unclear how the company will compete
effectively if there is no differentiation with its molecule,&#8221;
Anderson wrote. &#8220;It does have other immuno-oncology products
also in development.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An experimental Alzheimer&#8217;s treatment could be worth $5
billion, compared with estimates of as much as $3 billion. That
drug has about a 9 percent chance of success. Merck  Co. (MRK), based
in Whitehouse Station, New Jersey, has a similar medicine in a
more advanced stage of development, Anderson said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon sees challenges from companies such as
Facebook Inc. (FB) and Google Inc. (GOOGL) as they seek to provide online
banking and money-sending services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We move $10 trillion a day,&#8221; Dimon said today at the
Euromoney Saudi Arabia conference in Riyadh. &#8220;We&#8217;re one of the
largest payments systems in the world. We&#8217;re going to have
competition from Google and Facebook and somebody else.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies are competing for a share of the global
electronic-payments market worth as much as $1.8 trillion a
year, according to Capgemini&#8217;s 2013 World Payments report.
Google created Wallet, a system using smartphones, and Facebook
is seeking regulatory approval in Ireland for a service to allow
users to store money on the site, the Financial Times reported
last month without saying where it got the information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, 58, said regulators must decide whether they should
oversee such companies providing financial services. &#8220;There&#8217;s
no way that Google wants to be a regulated bank,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc., (AAPL) which has more than 400 million credit cards on
file at its iTunes Store, is exploring an expansion of the
mobile-payments system, a person with knowledge of the matter
said in January. PayPal, the online payments system owned by
EBay Inc. (EBAY), contributes almost 40 percent of the San Jose-based
e-commerce company&#8217;s revenue, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.K. lawmakers decided to call
executives from Pfizer Inc. (PFE) to testify on the proposed takeover
of AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), as London Mayor Boris Johnson added his
voice to those urging caution on the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives of London-based AstraZeneca will also be
asked to appear before the House of Commons Business Committee,
the panel said in an e-mailed statement after meeting in London
today. Business SecretaryVince Cable, answering lawmakers&#8217;
concerns in the House of Commons today, said the government is
approaching the Pfizer bid from a position of neutrality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers from across Britain&#8217;s political parties have
raised questions about the offer of more than $100 billion and
are pressing for assurances that New York-based Pfizer honors
its pledge, made in a letter to Prime Minister David Cameron
last week, that it will protect jobs and investment in
pharmaceutical research and development in the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It would be very important to establish that Pfizer is
genuinely committed to RD in this country,&#8221; Johnson, a member
of Cameron&#8217;s Conservative Party, told LBC Radio today. &#8220;I
believe in principle that we should have an open system of
markets in this country, but when I look at something like
AstraZeneca and I look at an organization of that scale, of its
relative importance to the U.K. economy, the sheer percentage of
its money that goes into RD, I think it is of great importance
to Britain.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Union Demand &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labor unions Unite and the GMB asked for a meeting with
Cable, a member of Cameron&#8217;s Liberal Democrat coalition
partners, to urge him to impose a &#8220;national interest&#8221; test on
the deal. They accused Cameron and Tory Chancellor of the
Exchequer George Osborne of being supportive of the Pfizer bid
while AstraZeneca workers have not been consulted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;AstraZeneca is a key player in the U.K.&#8217;s advanced
manufacturing sector and as such is strategically important to
the U.K., yet David Cameron and George Osborne seem comfortable
waving the deal through, leaving any manufacturing strategy in
tatters,&#8221; Unite Assistant General Secretary Tony Burke said in
an e-mailed statement. &#8220;The workforce and the unions have acted
in a responsible manner and shown remarkable patience, but that
is now wearing thin.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cable, who said he would be happy to meet with the unions,
insisted the government is &#8220;working hard within the constraints
we have&#8221; to secure a positive outcome for British jobs and
science. He said European Union rules restrict the amount that
government can intervene and British law only allows
intervention on issues of national security, media plurality and
banking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Even-Handed Neutrality&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The government must and will approach this from a
position of even-handed neutrality,&#8221; Cable said in Parliament.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not ruling out intervention, we have to look at all the
options open to us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameron&#8217;s spokesman, Jean-Christophe Gray, defended the
prime minister&#8217;s involvement and repeated the government&#8217;s view
that the final decision should rest with the companies&#8217;
shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The government&#8217;s position is one of active engagement
with both companies in terms of assessing the link to jobs and
skills,&#8221; Gray told reporters in London today. &#8220;The sole basis
on which the government is engaging is with regard to
underlining the importance we attach to continuing to expand the
life-science sector in the U.K.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AstraZeneca Defense &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca, which last week rejected Pfizer&#8217;s 62.6
billion-pound ($106 billion) bid, said today that its plan for
growth is working and it is aiming for annual revenues of more
than $45 billion by 2023. The company highlighted drugs it has
developed, including Brilinta and Farxiga, which it said will be
the drivers of growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The increasingly visible success of our independent
strategy highlights the future prospects for our shareholders,&#8221;
Chairman Leif Johansson said in a statement. &#8220;These are
benefits that should fully accrue to AstraZeneca&#8217;s
shareholders.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cable praised AstraZeneca&#8217;s plans and the company&#8217;s
investment in research and development of new drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;AstraZeneca do have an ambitious and attractive long-term
investment plan which we encouraged as part of the industrial
strategy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We want to see it fulfilled.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science Minister David Willetts will also testify to the
House of Commons Science and Technology Committee about the
government&#8217;s involvement in the deal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which stood
by Steven A. Cohen last year as his SAC Capital Advisors LP bore
the brunt of a massive insider trading probe, has come to the
billionaire&#8217;s aid again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top prime broker to the former hedge-fund firm, Goldman
Sachs is making a personal loan to Cohen for the first time,
according to a regulatory filing, joining the list of banks that
have provided SAC&#8217;s founder with credit lines backed by his $1
billion art collection. Like Citigroup Inc. (C), JPMorgan Chase 
Co. and Bank of America Corp., New York-based Goldman Sachs is
making the loan through its private bank as part of an effort to
expand its business catering to ultra-wealthy individuals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and
President Gary Cohn expressed support for Cohen, 57, after SAC
was indicted in July by federal regulators for insider trading,
and continued to do business with the firm after it agreed to
pay $1.8 billion in November to settle the charges. Goldman
Sachs stepped in after Cohen had been seeking an art loan for
months, having paid off and terminated his personal credit line
from Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), said two people familiar with the matter,
who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lloyd Blankfein is sticking by Steven Cohen through thick and thin. While other banks have drifted
away from the personal credit lines they&#8217;ve given Cohen since,
well, you know, Goldman Sachs appears never to have wavered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The illustration of this is itself an intriguing look at
finance so removed from the reality of normal humans, so lofty,
that we&#8217;ll call it cloud financing: Borrowing against the value
of your priceless art collection for money that you can make
work harder in your own investment shop to provide better
returns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounding like a modern-day Barnes Foundation, the art
collection that is the collateral to Goldman&#8217;s private-banking
loans is valued at $1 billion and sounds like the foundation for
a foundation some day: Picasso, Van Gogh, Warhol and Pollock,
Matisse and Hirst. The best art at the Opening Line bureau are
watercolors painted by a grandmother. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where Goldman&#8217;s willing to go in search of a
dollar, Miles Weiss&#8217;s story shows, and to make sure it doesn&#8217;t
ever get too far from Cohen, whose former company, SAC, was
paying banks $1 billion in commissions and fees annually,
according to the Wall Street Journal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s probably smart business for both parties. But given
all flies SAC was attracting for a while there, if authorities
were able to come back with the case against Cohen they never
had the first time, wouldn&#8217;t this art be one of the first things
to be liquidated? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) won dismissal of
MBIA Inc. (MBI)&#8217;s lawsuit over a $1.16 billion pool of mortgages it
agreed to insure, with the judge saying the bond insurer can
revise and refile the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no evidence MBIA relied on an allegedly altered
due diligence report for the mortgages that was provided by Bear
Stearns as an underwriter, said New York Supreme Court Justice
Alan Scheinkman in White Plains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is one of many still pending against banks over
alleged misrepresentations in the packaging and sale of
mortgage-backed securities that helped bring on the 2008
financial crisis. JPMorgan, which acquired Bear Stearns in 2008,
agreed in November to pay $13 billion to settle Justice
Department allegations it defrauded investors in the securities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Frozen&#8221; continues to sizzle for
Walt Disney Co. (DIS), where quarterly profit rose 27 percent as kids
snapped up DVDs and merchandise tied to the animated mega-hit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s largest entertainment company, reported
second-quarter net income of $1.92 billion, or $1.08 a share,
beating the average of analysts&#8217; estimates. Sales grew to $11.6
billion, the company said yesterday in a statement, exceeding
projections of $11.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Frozen&#8221; is working magic for Disney in home video, after
scoring a record $1.17 billion in worldwide ticket sales, the
most for an animated feature. The film was also the top-selling
DVD six weeks after its release, according to Rentrak Corp.
Meanwhile, Disney&#8217;s other businesses, led by TV networks such as
ESPN and its namesake theme parks, also delivered higher sales
and profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The whole thing is doing well,&#8221; said Frank Beck,
president and chief investment adviser at Beck Capital
Management LLC in Austin, Texas, which holds more than 45,000
Disney shares. &#8220;You talk about hitting on every cylinder.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney fell 0.9 percent to $80.29 at the close in New York.
The stock has advanced 5.1 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company generated profit growth of 15 percent or more
from its four largest divisions, including the film studio,
where earnings rose fourfold. Excluding some items, profit
totaled $1.11 a share in the quarter ended March 29, exceeding
the 96-cent average of analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings at the Disney studios soared to $475 million,
reflecting home-video sales of &#8220;Frozen&#8221; and &#8220;Thor: The Dark
World,&#8221; according to the company. Revenue grew 35 percent to
$1.8 billion, Disney said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Frozen&#8217; Assets &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Frozen&#8221; came out in home video during the period and has
become the company&#8217;s biggest digital and Blu-ray release ever,
Robert Iger, Disney&#8217;s chairman and chief executive officer, said
yesterday on a conference call. The company is working on
related theme-park attractions and a Broadway show, with Iger
predicting revenue could last for five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given the passion for this film and these characters is
so extraordinary, so well beyond what we ever even imagined, it
would be hard to believe that it wouldn&#8217;t sustain itself over a
fairly long period of  time,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With help from Marvel pictures and the resurgent Disney
animation unit, film studio profit for the year may top $1
billion for the first time since 2008, Alan Gould, an analyst at
Evercore Group LLC, wrote in an April 16 note. He has the
equivalent of a buy rating on Burbank, California-based Disney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating income at Disney cable networks rose 15 percent
to $1.97 billion, reflecting growth in pay-TV subscriber fees
for channels such as ESPN. Revenue increased 5 percent to $3.63
billion, even as ad sales shrank at the sports channel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Broadcast Division &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit at the ABC broadcast unit increased 15 percent to
$159 million, buoyed by higher affiliate fees and cost-cutting,
the company said. Revenue was little changed at $1.5 billion,
reflecting smaller audiences watching the broadcast network &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s namesake theme parks increased profit 19 percent
to $457 million as the division weathered a later Easter
holiday, which pulled business from the January-March quarter
into the current period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company credited higher attendance at California&#8217;s
Disneyland resort and increased guest spending at Walt Disney
World in Florida. Revenue grew 7.9 percent to $3.56 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit from consumer products expanded 37 percent to $274
million, Disney said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disney Stores &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nine out of the 10 highest-selling items at the Disney
store in the quarter were &#8216;Frozen&#8217; merchandise,&#8221; Chief
Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said on the call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Licensing revenue grew on sales of merchandise related to
Disney channel program, along with products based on Mickey
Mouse and Minnie and the animated feature &#8220;Planes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toys and costumes featuring the film&#8217;s Elsa character have
outsold perennial top-performers Cinderella and Snow White on
EBay Inc. in the past year, according to Terapeak, an online
commerce tracker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interactive division posted a profit of $14 million,
reversing a loss a year earlier, on the strength of sales of
Disney Infinity, the company&#8217;s video-game platform. Revenue grew
38 percent to $268 million. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concern that regulatory scrutiny will
curb the market for collateralized loan obligations may have
been overblown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley raised its forecast for new CLOs in the U.S.
this year to as much as $85 billion, at least the third bank
since April to boost projections for the biggest buyers of junk
loans. JPMorgan Chase  Co. boosted its projection to as much as
$100 billion on May 2, while Wells Fargo  (WFC) Co. lifted it to as
high as $90 billion last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CLO issuance is accelerating after concern regulatory
attention would damp new formation of the funds, which provide
financing to speculative-grade companies. The Volcker Rule,
adopted in December as part of the financial overhaul mandated
by the Dodd-Frank Act, prohibits banks from investing in a CLO
that owns bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The new issue market has shrugged off this year&#8217;s slow
start, as well as the potential regulatory headwinds from the
Volcker rule,&#8221; Morgan Stanley analysts Vishwanath Tirupattur
and Mia Qian wrote in a research note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total $12.3 billion of broadly syndicated U.S. CLOs were
formed last month, the highest monthly volume since the
financial crisis, bringing total issuance this year through
April to $31.7 billion as the investor base expanded, according
to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo raised its forecast to what would potentially
be the most in seven years, according to an April 1 research
note. JPMorgan increased its projections to $90 billion to $100
billion from $60 billion to $70 billion, according to a May 2
research note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Resurging Issuance  &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) revised its forecast to $75 billion to $85
billion of CLOs, from previous projections for $55 billion to
$65 billion, according to the research note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issuance of CLOs collapsed to $20.6 billion in 2008, the
year Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. failed, from a record $104.7
billion in 2007, according to Wells Fargo. Last year&#8217;s issuance
totaled $82.6 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CLOs were the biggest buyers of new high-yield loans last
quarter, with about 55 percent of the primary market, according
to Standard  Poor&#8217;s Capital IQ Leveraged Commentary  Data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies have raised $223 billion of U.S. loans this year
from institutional investors such as CLOs and mutual funds,
after a record $686 billion in 2013, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junk loans are rated below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s Investors
Service and below BBB- at SP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices of the debt have climbed this week to 98.47 cents on
the dollar yesterday, the highest level since February,
according to the SP/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British and French politicians have
traditionally had diametrically opposed attitudes to takeovers
of their corporate crown jewels by foreigners. In Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s (PFE)
bid for AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), the difference is a lot smaller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offer worth more than $106 billion, the largest ever
for a U.K. company, prompted demands for guarantees on jobs,
facilities, and retaining research work from Prime Minister
David Cameron&#8217;s Conservative-led coalition. Opposition Labour
Party leader Ed Miliband called for a &#8220;public-interest test&#8221;
on major deals by foreign acquirers and Liberal Democrat
Business Secretary Vince Cable said he might support one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With U.K. national elections a year away today, British
leaders are sounding more like their counterparts in France,
where lawmakers can intervene to stop companies deemed
&#8220;strategic&#8221; from being bought, and the state rarely hesitates
to get involved. President Francois Hollande said yesterday that
General Electric Co.&#8217;s proposed $17 billion acquisition of most
of Alstom SA (ALO) was &#8220;not acceptable&#8221; in its current form because
of its impact on employment. Cameron said today he&#8217;s &#8220;not
satisfied&#8221; with the Pfizer offer so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Clear Message&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The U.K. government is reacting more strongly now to
Pfizer&#8217;s intention to take over AstraZeneca because they need to
start sending a clear message to citizens that they are
concerned about them as the next general election gets closer,&#8221;
said Daniel Lacalle, a senior fund manager at Ecofin Ltd. in
London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. politicians&#8217; attitudes reflect the anxieties of a
country that&#8217;s seen high-profile companies from carmakers to
confectioners absorbed by foreign buyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike in the U.S., Canada, France and Australia, British
officials have no direct legal mechanism to halt foreign
acquisitions -- an absence illustrated by Kraft Foods Inc.&#8217;s
successful takeover of chocolate-maker Cadbury Plc in 2010 over
the objections of lawmakers, with the subsequent closing of a
factory in southwest England. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne was probably too
enthusiastic in quickly hailing the Pfizer bid, which would see
the American company move its legal domicile to the U.K., as
positive for the country and an endorsement of its corporate-tax
regime, according to two government officials with knowledge of
the discussions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Legal Constraints&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameron&#8217;s government is now trying to show it is neutral by
stressing that it&#8217;s talking to both Pfizer and AstraZeneca, the
people said on condition of anonymity because the talks are
private. Cable told lawmakers yesterday the government is
&#8220;operating within serious European legal constraints.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the prime minister told Parliament at his weekly
question-and-answer session that evaluating the bid would
include examining its impact on jobs and science in the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The commitments that have been made so far are
encouraging,&#8221; Cameron said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not satisfied. I want more.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chief executive officers of both companies will testify
before the House of Commons Business and Science Committees over
two days next week, the panels said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameron, Cable and Osborne have Paris to look to for a
recent example of navigating an unexpected offer from an
American company. After Bloomberg News reported GE&#8217;s Alstom bid
on April 23, French officials led by Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg began a last-ditch effort to encourage a counterbid
from Siemens AG. Even after securing guarantees on jobs and
keeping French sites from GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt, Montebourg and
Hollande said this week the American company&#8217;s offer still isn&#8217;t
sufficient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Outside Buyers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K.&#8217;s generally hands-off approach to deal making has
helped make it more attractive than its neighbors to foreign
acquirers. Buyers from outside Europe have spent about $358
billion on deals in the U.K. over the last five years, not
including AstraZeneca, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That
compares with just $86 billion in France and $114 billion in
Germany. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A takeover of AstraZeneca would be the biggest-ever
acquisition of a U.K. company by value -- about five times
bigger than the largest transaction of the past half-decade,
Liberty Global Plc (LBTYA)&#8217;s $22 billion deal for U.K. broadband
provider Virgin Media last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A deal would also mean ceding control of a large part of
the country&#8217;s pharmaceutical infrastructure. The London-based
company has about 7,000 domestic staff, a major RD facility in
Cambridge, eastern England, and a 2,900-employee global hub for
cancer research outside Manchester in the north. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, based in New York, is very unlikely to proceed with
a bid for AstraZeneca if it can&#8217;t win the blessing of Cameron&#8217;s
government, a person familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More Difficult &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in the absence of a direct mechanism to block the
deal, the U.K. could make doing business much more difficult for
Pfizer if it chose to, especially in an industry as heavily
regulated as pharmaceuticals, the person said, asking not to be
identified discussing private deliberations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to one Cameron aide, there are many more
political risks for the government if the takeover goes ahead
than if it collapses. As with previous deals in which the
government has been involved, such as Lloyds TSB Group Plc&#8217;s
2008 rescue of HBOS Plc, ministers risk being criticized if job
losses follow or the deal is seen as a failure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca Chairman Leif Johansson told Cameron in a May 2
phone call that even by engaging with Pfizer, the government
risked being seen as supporting the takeover, according to a
person familiar with the call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mayor&#8217;s Concern &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with Cameron, London Mayor Boris Johnson, a possible
candidate to succeed Cameron as Tory leader, has said he&#8217;s
concerned about AstraZeneca being in foreign hands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After meetings with U.K. officials, Pfizer has pledged to
keep about 20 percent of the combined group&#8217;s research staff in
the U.K. for five years. That promise comes with a caveat,
though: that Pfizer may have to &#8220;adjust these obligations
should circumstances significantly change,&#8221; the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Cable and Miliband have said they&#8217;re worried about
Pfizer&#8217;s commitment to those promises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britain&#8217;s government is almost alone among major economies
in having never in recent years scuttled a major foreign
takeover. German Chancellor Angela Merkel&#8217;s government torpedoed
the proposed merger of BAE Systems Plc (BA/) and what&#8217;s now Airbus
Group NV (AIR) in 2012, citing concerns over the loss of German
control and jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years Canada has blocked deals by BHP Billiton (BHP)
Ltd. and Petroliam Nasional Bhd., although the latter was
eventually approved. Australia intervened last year to stop the
$2.9 billion acquisition of GrainCorp Ltd. by Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Special Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While British politicians are clearly concerned about the
Pfizer deal, its size and relevance to high-tech research make
it a special case, said Stephen Blackshaw, a partner in London
at law firm Sidley Austin LLP. For that reason the country isn&#8217;t
likely to &#8220;go down the road to a more formalized test&#8221; for
foreign deals, as in Canada and Australia, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s case isn&#8217;t being helped by concerns it&#8217;s moved to
shut down research after past acquisitions, and by its decision
in 2011 to close a lab in Sandwich in southeast England that
cost about 2,000 jobs. Since it bought rival Wyeth in 2009, it&#8217;s
cut $4.6 billion in research spending and narrowed its
scientific focus to six areas of medicine. Pfizer&#8217;s plan to be
domiciled in the U.K. for tax purposes would also give it a
lower tax rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m sure these companies are motivated by hard-headed
commercial considerations, and we should be motivated by hard-headed considerations of national interest,&#8221; Cable told
lawmakers yesterday. &#8220;We see the future of the U.K. as a
knowledge economy, not a tax haven.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Cameron said Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s bid
for AstraZeneca Plc &#8220;must do more&#8221; for British jobs and
science as the prime minister was challenged to intervene in the
proposed takeover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a series of clashes in the House of Commons today,
opposition Labour Party leader Ed Miliband urged Cameron to
apply a public-interest test to the offer valued at more than
$106 billion, the largest ever for a U.K. company, saying if he
does not &#8220;everyone will know he was acting as a cheerleader&#8221;
for the bid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameron said commitments made by Pfizer, including
retaining at least 20 percent of the research and development
workforce in the U.K., guaranteeing the completion of a new
research campus at Cambridge, eastern England, and retaining a
manufacturing base in Macclesfield, northern England, are
&#8220;encouraging.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Let me be absolutely clear, I&#8217;m not satisfied, I want
more,&#8221; Cameron said. &#8220;The more we can do to strengthen the
assurances the better.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chief executive officers of both companies will testify
to lawmakers on the proposed takeover next week. Ian Read of
Pfizer and Pascal Soriot of AstraZeneca will appear before the
Business, Innovation and Skills Committee on May 13 at 9:30 a.m.
and then before the Science and Technology Committee on May 14
at 9:15 a.m., according to statements from the panels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questioned by reporters after the exchanges in Parliament,
Cameron&#8217;s spokesman, Jean-Christophe Gray, refused to expand on
what assurances Cameron was seeking and any timetable for the
talks. Cameron has not spoken to Pfizer, Gray said, adding that
Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne and Liberal Democrat
Business Secretary Vince Cable had done so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Deep Concern&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cable refused yesterday to rule out intervening in the bid.
Miliband said today &#8220;there is deep concern&#8221; about the deal as
it would &#8220;have an impact for decades to come on British jobs,
British investment, British exports and British science.&#8221; He
said his party would back using the public-interest test to slow
down or halt the deal if it runs counter to British interests
amid jobs concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government could amend the 2002 Enterprise Act within a
month without significant difficulty to include the effect the
takeover may have on the U.K.&#8217;s research and development base as
one of the grounds for blocking the deal, according to the
Labour Party. An independent body such as the Competition and
Markets Authority could examine the proposed takeover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Playing Politics &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, U.K. rules only allow ministers to intervene to
protect national security, media plurality and the stability of
the financial system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With U.K. national elections one year away today, British
leaders are sounding more like their counterparts in France,
where lawmakers can intervene to stop companies deemed
&#8220;strategic&#8221; from being bought. President Francois Hollande
said yesterday that General Electric Co.&#8217;s proposed $17 billion
acquisition of most of Alstom SA was &#8220;not sufficient, so it&#8217;s
not acceptable&#8221; in its current form because of its impact on
employment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameron accused Miliband today of playing politics over the
bid for AstraZeneca &#8220;rather than backing the British national
interest.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Frozen&#8221; continues to sizzle for
Walt Disney Co. (DIS), where quarterly profit rose 27 percent as kids
snapped up DVDs and merchandise tied to the animated mega-hit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s largest entertainment company, reported
second-quarter net income of $1.92 billion, or $1.08 a share,
beating the average of analysts&#8217; estimates. Sales grew to $11.6
billion, the company said yesterday in a statement, exceeding
projections of $11.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Frozen&#8221; is working magic for Disney in home video, after
scoring a record $1.17 billion in worldwide ticket sales, the
most for an animated feature. The film was also the top-selling
DVD six weeks after its release, according to Rentrak Corp.
Meanwhile, Disney&#8217;s other businesses, led by TV networks such as
ESPN and its namesake theme parks, also delivered higher sales
and profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The whole thing is doing well,&#8221; said Frank Beck,
president and chief investment adviser at Beck Capital
Management LLC in Austin, Texas, which holds more than 45,000
Disney shares. &#8220;You talk about hitting on every cylinder.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney fell 0.9 percent to $80.29 at the close in New York.
The stock has advanced 5.1 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company generated profit growth of 15 percent or more
from its four largest divisions, including the film studio,
where earnings rose fourfold. Excluding some items, profit
totaled $1.11 a share in the quarter ended March 29, exceeding
the 96-cent average of analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings at the Disney studios soared to $475 million,
reflecting home-video sales of &#8220;Frozen&#8221; and &#8220;Thor: The Dark
World,&#8221; according to the company. Revenue grew 35 percent to
$1.8 billion, Disney said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Frozen&#8217; Assets &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Frozen&#8221; came out in home video during the period and has
become the company&#8217;s biggest digital and Blu-ray release ever,
Robert Iger, Disney&#8217;s chairman and chief executive officer, said
yesterday on a conference call. The company is working on
related theme-park attractions and a Broadway show, with Iger
predicting revenue could last for five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given the passion for this film and these characters is
so extraordinary, so well beyond what we ever even imagined, it
would be hard to believe that it wouldn&#8217;t sustain itself over a
fairly long period of  time,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With help from Marvel pictures and the resurgent Disney
animation unit, film studio profit for the year may top $1
billion for the first time since 2008, Alan Gould, an analyst at
Evercore Group LLC, wrote in an April 16 note. He has the
equivalent of a buy rating on Burbank, California-based Disney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating income at Disney cable networks rose 15 percent
to $1.97 billion, reflecting growth in pay-TV subscriber fees
for channels such as ESPN. Revenue increased 5 percent to $3.63
billion, even as ad sales shrank at the sports channel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Broadcast Division &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit at the ABC broadcast unit increased 15 percent to
$159 million, buoyed by higher affiliate fees and cost-cutting,
the company said. Revenue was little changed at $1.5 billion,
reflecting smaller audiences watching the broadcast network &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s namesake theme parks increased profit 19 percent
to $457 million as the division weathered a later Easter
holiday, which pulled business from the January-March quarter
into the current period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company credited higher attendance at California&#8217;s
Disneyland resort and increased guest spending at Walt Disney
World in Florida. Revenue grew 7.9 percent to $3.56 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit from consumer products expanded 37 percent to $274
million, Disney said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disney Stores &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nine out of the 10 highest-selling items at the Disney
store in the quarter were &#8216;Frozen&#8217; merchandise,&#8221; Chief
Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said on the call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Licensing revenue grew on sales of merchandise related to
Disney channel program, along with products based on Mickey
Mouse and Minnie and the animated feature &#8220;Planes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toys and costumes featuring the film&#8217;s Elsa character have
outsold perennial top-performers Cinderella and Snow White on
EBay Inc. in the past year, according to Terapeak, an online
commerce tracker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interactive division posted a profit of $14 million,
reversing a loss a year earlier, on the strength of sales of
Disney Infinity, the company&#8217;s video-game platform. Revenue grew
38 percent to $268 million. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&#8217;ve followed analyst Natalia Corfield during her stints at two of Wall Street&#8217;s biggest
banks, you know one call has been constant: her recommendation
to buy Banco BMG SA&#8217;s bonds. You also know that she&#8217;s been
right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corfield, now at JPMorgan Chase  Co., began recommending
the notes in July 2012 when she was at Deutsche Bank AG. In that
span, BMG&#8217;s $250 million of bonds due in 2020 have returned 46
percent -- more than four times the average gain for emerging-market corporate debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BMG&#8217;s decision to form a joint venture with Itau Unibanco
Holding SA, Latin America&#8217;s biggest bank, 22 months ago has
propelled its $1.1 billion of notes and prompted Corfield to
stick with her view. The bank, based in the Brazilian Corfield&#8217;s
home state of Minas Gerais before moving to Sao Paulo this year,
said April 29 it will boost its stake in the venture to 40
percent from 30 percent, adding to bond gains. The unit has
allowed BMG to obtain cheaper funding and stem losses after
Banco Cruzeiro do Sul SA&#8217;s collapse dried up funding for midsize
banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Everyone was afraid because of what happened to Cruzeiro,
but I knew BMG,&#8221; Corfield, who reiterated a buy on the BMG
notes after the April 29 announcement, said by phone from New
York. &#8220;It&#8217;s a very good story. The cost of funding surged after
Cruzeiro, and it decreased with the joint venture, and it will
likely drop more now.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Drastically&#8217; Reduced &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on BMG&#8217;s bonds soared to a record 18.51 percent in
June 2012 after Cruzeiro defaulted on $1.6 billion of notes and
was seized by Brazilian regulators. A month later, BMG announced
the joint venture with Itau, which agreed to provide as much as
300 million reais ($134.6 million) per month for five years to
finance BMG&#8217;s payroll loans. The 2020 securities now yield 7.94
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal has &#8220;drastically&#8221; reduced BMG&#8217;s funding costs as
the market prices in improvements in the bank&#8217;s performance and
margins, according to investor relations manager Danilo
Herculano Andrade Silva. BMG&#8217;s increased stake in the venture
will be reflected in the bank&#8217;s fourth-quarter earnings, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lender&#8217;s net income totaled 428.5 million reais last
year, reversing a loss of 580 million reais in 2012. Net
interest margin reached 9.3 percent in 2013, 5.1 percentage
points higher than the previous year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The joint venture is exceeding all our estimates,&#8221; BMG&#8217;s
Silva said in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo. &#8220;The
performance of the bonds shows that investors see the deal was a
success. I think we&#8217;ll still see an improvement in the market&#8217;s
perception of BMG.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Huge Success&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank has no plans to buy back bonds and is unlikely to
increase the stake in the venture further, Silva said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marcelo Kopel, Itau&#8217;s head of investor relations, said on a
conference call with reporters April 29 that he expects Banco
Itau BMG Consignado&#8217;s loan portfolio to reach 20 billion reais
by the end of this year from about 12 billion reais now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Itau official who asked not to be named in accordance
with company policy declined to comment further on the venture
or on BMG&#8217;s bond performance when contacted by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The partnership has been a huge success, with the obvious
benefit being the decreased cost of funding,&#8221; Jim Harper, the
head of research at BCP Securities LLC in Greenwich,
Connecticut, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;The BMG bonds will
react favorably to anything that represents a move towards
integration.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yield Gap &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlos Gribel, vice president for emerging markets at INTL
FCStone Securities, said that while BMG&#8217;s notes may continue to
climb as the partnership grows, they will still trade at a
premium to Itau&#8217;s bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Itau&#8217;s $1 billion of subordinated debt due in 2020 yields
4.38 percent, or 3.56 percentage points less than BMG&#8217;s notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;BMG&#8217;s curve has climbed a lot, but the yield will not
reach Itau&#8217;s,&#8221; Gribel said in a telephone interview from Miami.
&#8220;It will be somewhere between mid-sized banks and Itau, because
at the end of the day, Itau doesn&#8217;t guarantee the bonds. There&#8217;s
an extra risk, and there&#8217;s a premium for that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BMG&#8217;s 2020 bonds have gained 5.8 cents to 104.5 cents on
the dollar, the highest since 2011, since the bank said it will
boost its stake in the joint venture, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. While the rally will continue, further gains will
be more &#8220;gradual,&#8221; Corfield said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This will free up capital and decrease their funding
costs even more,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Bondholders are seeing the
venture is working well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
shifted its real estate focus to lending from buying properties
after the financial crisis, completed fundraising for its second
real estate credit pool at $4.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based firm raised $1.8 billion in equity
pledges from institutions and wealthy individuals, supplemented
by the same amount in borrowings and $600 million of the firm&#8217;s
own money, said Alan Kava, co-head of the real estate investing
group in Goldman&#8217;s merchant banking division. About 60 percent
of the capital pledged came from U.S. investors and most of the
rest was from Europe, with a small amount from Asian investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman is competing with other private debt funds,
mortgage-oriented real estate investment trusts and banks in
offering ways to earn higher yields at a time of low interest
rates. The new vehicle will invest in Europe and the U.S.,
expanding on Goldman&#8217;s first real estate credit fund, which made
about $3.5 billion of loans, according to a marketing document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will be opportunistic in terms of where we see
value,&#8221; Kava said in a telephone interview. &#8220;The first fund
was U.S. only. We&#8217;re hopeful we will end up with about 50-50&#8221;
between the U.S. and Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Broad Street Real Estate Credit Partners II plans
to make senior loans and mezzanine loans backed by high-quality
commercial real estate, to fund acquisitions, refinancings and
recapitalizations, according to the document. It intends to
generate returns in the &#8220;mid-teens&#8221; by charging interest rates
of 7 percent to 10 percent and leveraging the equity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Current Yield &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new fund will make and hold the loans, distributing the
interest income it receives to investors quarterly, said Peter
Weidman, the managing director who oversees the new fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What our investors like about this is it&#8217;s a current
yield so we&#8217;re not just making one-time distributions by
securitizing,&#8221; Weidman said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new fund has invested about $500 million already, in
five deals, according to the marketing document. They include a
mezzanine loan to help finance the purchase of a group of
Southern California office buildings, and a senior loan, or
first mortgage, on a New York City rental apartment building
that&#8217;s being converted to for-sale condominiums. Higher-yielding
mezzanine loans are used to fill the gap between first mortgages
and equity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s first real estate credit fund, known as Real
Estate Mezzanine Partners, made 28 investments, about two-thirds
of which were senior mortgages and one-third mezzanine loans,
according to the marketing document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have a competitive advantage by focusing on larger
deals and being able to provide the entire loan to our
borrowers,&#8221; Weidman said. &#8220;We see less competition in the
larger loan space.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new fund has an investment period of three years, with
possible extensions, according to the marketing document. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The governors of Maryland and Delaware have asked Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chief Executive Officer Ian Read whether jobs will be cut in their states after the drugmaker promised to keep people employed in the U.K. as a way to further a $100 billion-plus bid to buy AstraZeneca Plc. (AZN) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the acquisition occurs, it would allow Pfizer to move its legal address from New York to the U.K. to gain a lower tax rate. Read told U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron that Pfizer would keep at least 20 percent of the combined company&#8217;s research and development workers and substantial manufacturing facilities in the U.K. for at least five years to win support for the deal. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Read&#8217;s U.K. commitment may boost pressure on Pfizer to reduce U.S. costs to obtain the savings needed from the deal. Since buying Wyeth in 2009, Pfizer has cut $4.6 billion in research spending, announced plans to close at least seven labs and narrowed its scientific focus to six areas of medicine. During the past three years, the company lost patent protection on its best-selling drug Lipitor, divested its animal health business and reduced its workforce 25 percent to 77,700 employees by the end of 2013, according to filings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The letter from the governors asked Read to detail potential job losses in the AstraZeneca deal and commit to continued investments in their states. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;No Assurances &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Despite our requests, we have received no corresponding assurances about retaining jobs and research and development in our states,&#8221; Maryland Governor Martin O&#8217;Malley and Delaware Governor Jack Markell, both Democrats, wrote in a letter obtained by Bloomberg News. &#8220;Our concern is exacerbated by Pfizer&#8217;s history of closing U.S. research facilities, including sites in Michigan and Illinois, after closing on previous corporate transactions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pfizer officials have spoken to the governors and understand their concerns, said Mackay Jimeson, a company spokesman. Bringing together the two companies would help create a leader in the pharmaceutical industry, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe a potential combination with AstraZeneca would build a stronger company by bringing together our assets, people and scientific expertise to create vibrant businesses with new potential growth and opportunities to meet patients&#8217; needs,&#8221; Jimeson said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In their letter, the governors included six questions, saying they wanted information to better understand how Pfizer&#8217;s potential merger would affect their states and the role they play in the pharmaceutical industry. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Good People&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have 2,600 very good people in Delaware and 3,100 in Maryland,&#8221; Markell said by telephone. &#8220;My job is to do everything I can do to make sure they have continued career opportunities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca&#8217;s North America headquarters are located in Wilmington, Delaware. The company has a research center in Gaithersburg, Maryland, and a manufacturing facility in Newark, Delaware. About 22 percent of 51,500 people London-based AstraZeneca employs worldwide work in the U.S., according to the company&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also today, Democrats in the U.S. Senate said they may push legislation that would block companies from shifting their legal addresses overseas to reduce their tax bills. That effort runs counter to Read&#8217;s April 28 statement that he didn&#8217;t believe an acquisition allowing the New York-based company to move its legal resident to the U.K. would &#8220;create a conflict with the interest of the U.S. government.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Hollowing Out&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said he is looking for a way to move quickly to prevent companies from &#8220;hollowing out&#8221; the tax base by moving overseas in name only, while keeping their operating headquarters in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The response from the governors and lawmakers isn&#8217;t surprising, Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University in New Jersey, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;These tax inversions, they are like a 2x4 into the face of Congress, saying pay attention to this,&#8221; Reinhardt said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The governors decided to act after reading the past week about the assurances Read had provided to the British government, Markell said. Their list included questions about how many jobs would be cut or relocated from Maryland and Delaware as a result of any transaction, about future investment in the states and plans for splitting a merged company into different businesses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Substantial Investment &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Delaware and Maryland have &#8220;invested substantially&#8221; in AstraZeneca&#8217;s success and have a right to know what Pfizer&#8217;s intentions are, the governors wrote. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is also concerning that Pfizer is seeking to complete an acquisition involving jobs supporting thousands of families in our states in order to achieve tax advantages,&#8221; they wrote. &#8220;We while we understand your desire to operate efficiently, relocating your corporate and tax residence outside of the United States is not only detrimental to the United States, but potentially comes at a direct cost to our states and our constituents.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maryland and Delaware have lower unemployment rates than the rest of the nation, and rank in the top third of Bloomberg&#8217;s measure of economic health. In March, when U.S. unemployment was 6.7 percent, the jobless rate was 5.9 percent in Delaware and 5.6 percent in Maryland, according to the U.S. Labor Department. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The governors, who didn&#8217;t discuss the letter or operations with officials at AstraZeneca, asked Pfizer to respond promptly to their request. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Markell said he received a polite phone call from a senior leader at Pfizer, who said the company would keep the governor informed of the company&#8217;s progress with the acquisition. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Keeping us informed is very different from the kind of jobs they have committed to in the U.K.,&#8221; Markell said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(An earlier version of this story corrected the spelling of AstraZeneca.) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Michelle Fay Cortez in Minneapolis at mcortez@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editors responsible for this story: Reg Gale at rgale5@bloomberg.net Andrew Pollack &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A potential raised bid for AstraZeneca
Plc (AZN) means that Pfizer Inc. (PFE) would have to generate more than $2
billion in annual savings from the deal, and that job cuts are
more likely to happen outside the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca, the U.K.&#8217;s second-biggest drugmaker, rejected
Pfizer&#8217;s offer last week of more than $106 billion, about 50
pounds a share, some 32 percent of which is in cash. At that
price, Pfizer would have to save at least $2 billion for the bid
to add to earnings in 2014 and 2015, according to an analysis by
Bloomberg Industries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That amount would rise to at least $3 billion if the New
York-based company raised its bid to 55 pounds a share, and
Pfizer may need to increase the cash portion to 40 percent,
Bloomberg Industries analyst Sam Fazeli said. If Pfizer sticks
to the current cash offer, the savings may have to exceed $3.5
billion, &#8220;approaching a prohibitive level&#8221; in terms of U.K.
job reductions, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Any cost savings are likely to come partly from RD in
Sweden and the U.S., as well as the global commercial
infrastructure,&#8221; Fazeli wrote. Pfizer&#8217;s pledge to Prime
Minister David Cameron suggests AstraZeneca&#8217;s 2,000 U.K.
research and development jobs should be &#8220;safe from cuts if a
deal goes ahead.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. drugmaker told Cameron last week that it
would keep at least 20 percent of the combined company&#8217;s
research and development workforce in the U.K. for at least five
years and retain &#8220;substantial&#8221; manufacturing facilities at
AstraZeneca&#8217;s site south of Manchester. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Swedish Workers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s global RD workforce totals about 10,880 and
AstraZeneca&#8217;s about 9,000, according to estimates by Bloomberg
Industries. With fewer than 20 percent of those jobs in the
U.K., job cuts may occur outside Britain, said Asthika Goonewardene, a London-based analyst at Bloomberg Industries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca employs about 5,900 people in Sweden, home of
predecessor company Astra AB. Sweden, unlike the U.K., hasn&#8217;t
received any promises on jobs from Pfizer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer may be more likely to cut its own RD operations
than eliminate jobs in the U.K. because of tax benefits, said
Fabian Wenner, an analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux in Zurich. Keeping
research operations in Britain enables Pfizer to say that
products were invented in the U.K., and use the country&#8217;s lower
tax rate, Wenner said. Pfizer&#8217;s tax rate is 27.4 percent, while
AstraZeneca&#8217;s is 21.3 percent, according to Fazeli. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lower Taxes &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They want to lower the tax rate for the overall group by
implementing transfer pricing, which you can only get when you
have sufficient RD in the lower tax regime,&#8221; Wenner said. &#8220;It
would make more sense to save 15 to 20 percent of Pfizer RD. It
would make sense from a both a political point of view and a tax
point of view.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing jobs in Britain could also be preserved in
this way, Wenner said. The most probable positions to be
eliminated would be in sales and administration, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, a merger results in cost reductions equivalent
to about 10 percent of the target&#8217;s global sales, Wenner said.
In this case, Pfizer may cut $3.3 billion in costs, which
include a 10 percent decrease in cost of goods sold, 20 percent
of sales and administrative costs and 20 percent of research and
development costs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patton Boggs LLP agreed to pay $15
million to settle Chevron Corp.&#8217;s (CVX) lawsuit over the law firm&#8217;s
involvement in obtaining a $9.5 billion judgment against the oil
company in Ecuador. Patton Boggs also agreed to withdraw from
the Ecuador litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in New York on March 4
ruled that an attorney from another firm, Steven Donziger, had
resorted to bribery and fraud in procuring the Chevron judgment
in Ecuador that held the oil company liable for polluting the
Amazon rain forest. Donziger is appealing the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaplan&#8217;s ruling &#8220;includes a number of factual findings
about matters which would have materially affected our firm&#8217;s
decision to become involved and stay involved as counsel,&#8221;
Patton Boggs said in a statement yesterday. &#8220;Patton Boggs
regrets its involvement in this matter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 29, Kaplan threw out Patton Boggs&#8217;s claim that San
Ramon, California-based Chevron maliciously sued the firm for
pursuing collection of the judgment. The law firm, which
provided as much as $15 million to finance the Ecuador
litigation, had sought access to $21.8 million Chevron had been
ordered to post as a bond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased that Patton Boggs is ending its
association with the fraudulent and extortionate Ecuador
litigation scheme,&#8221; Chevron General Counsel Hewitt Pate said in
yesterday&#8217;s statement. &#8220;Chevron encourages others to
disassociate themselves from this fraud.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law firm&#8217;s case is Patton Boggs LLP v. Chevron Corp.,
12-cv-09176, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). The racketeering case is Chevron Corp. v. Donziger,
11-cv-00691, in the same court. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Brookfield Loses Trial Bid Over $519,000 Arbitration Award &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brookfield Residential Properties Inc. (BRP), a land investor in
the U.S., lost a bid for a trial after having been ordered to
pay $519,000 to Zephyr Equities  Development LLC in an
arbitration for breach of contract, according to statements from
the companies and their lawyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zephyr accused Brookfield of violating a contract to
develop the 2,000-acre Natomas Project in Sacramento County,
California, according to a statement from Zephyr yesterday. An
arbitrator ruled in favor of Zephyr in April 2013, and a
California superior court judge signed the judgment in February,
according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bauer denied Brookfield&#8217;s request for a new court
proceeding and also awarded Zephyr the right to 3.1 percent of
gross sales from the Natomas development, Zephyr said.
Brookfield has appealed the ruling, the companies said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Fortunately, justice has prevailed,&#8221; Adina T. Stern, a
Zephyr attorney, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brookfield spokesman Andrew Willis said in a statement that
the company will appeal the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Zephyr v. Brookfield Natomas, 30-2013-00648089-CU-JR-CJC, Superior Court of California (Orange County). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;West Hollywood Fur-Sale Ban Survives Luxury Retailer&#8217;s Lawsuit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West Hollywood, California&#8217;s ban on fur sales, hailed by
the Humane Society of the United States as the first in the
nation, survived a federal court challenge by a luxury retailer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city&#8217;s ban doesn&#8217;t illegally discriminate against
retailers of new clothing by allowing sales of used fur by
private parties and second-hand stores, U.S. District Judge
George H. King in Los Angeles said in a ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ordinance went into effect last year and Mayfair House
Inc., a retailer of high-end clothing, sued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael O&#8217;Connor, a lawyer for Mayfair House, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Mayfair House Inc. v. City of West Hollywood,
13-cv-07112, U.S. District Court, Central District of California

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which wagered more than $300 billion last year on things like yen rates and bond spreads, just laid down a bet that guys like Nelson &#8220;Johnny&#8221; Aguilar can stay out of jail. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aguilar was at a Dunkin&#8217; Donuts near Boston on a Sunday night in March when a shooting outside left a 21-year-old man with a bullet wound to the gut, police said. They arrested Aguilar, a 19-year-old gang member with a criminal record and a tattoo that says &#8220;Life&#8217;s a Gamble.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Such crime-blotter moments are Goldman&#8217;s concern thanks to a financial product called a social-impact bond. Goldman is anchoring a $21 million plan to help a Boston-area nonprofit called Roca expand its efforts to steer young men like Aguilar away from dealing drugs, stealing cars or committing assaults and murders. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Under the deal, if men targeted by Roca spend 22 percent fewer days in jails and prisons than their peers, Massachusetts would save enough to repay Goldman&#8217;s $9 million loan. An even bigger drop in recidivism would hand Goldman as much as $1 million in profit. If Roca fails and too many men end up behind bars, Goldman will lose almost everything it ventured. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not that different than if you were looking at any company&#8221; to invest in, said Andrea Phillips, vice president of Goldman&#8217;s Urban Investment Group, who leads the bank&#8217;s social-impact bond transactions. &#8220;You&#8217;re relying on a management team. You&#8217;re relying on their human capital, their folks who work at the plant and deliver and do what they&#8217;re supposed to do.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Bottom Line &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Young men like Aguilar are part of the bottom line: Each participant Roca keeps out of jail for a year saves Massachusetts $12,400, the state calculated. If it can close a 300-person facility and keep from expanding jail space, it could save $47,500 per person per year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S.
bank, bought $2.8 billion of Argentine bonds at a discount from
Repsol SA (REP) two days after the oil company received them as
compensation for the government&#8217;s seizure of its local unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bonds, due in 2024, have a nominal value of $3.25
billion, the Spanish oil producer said in a regulatory filing in
Madrid. The transaction is expected to close by May 13, and for
seven days Repsol will refrain from selling its remaining
Argentine bonds to other parties except under certain
unspecified conditions, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repsol, Spain&#8217;s largest oil producer, is reducing its ties
to Argentina after receiving $5.32 billion of bonds as payment
for the government&#8217;s April 2012 nationalization of the company&#8217;s
51 percent stake in local oil producer YPF. JPMorgan probably
believes it can resell the bonds to investors in the market,
said Fernando Recalde, portfolio manager at Galileo Argentina SG
FCI SA in Buenos Aires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This was a way for Argentina to sell bonds indirectly,&#8221;
Recalde said. &#8220;It shows there&#8217;s appetite for Argentine risk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argentine bonds have returned 11.7 percent this year,
double the emerging-market average. South America&#8217;s second-biggest economy hasn&#8217;t sold bonds in international markets since
its $95 billion default in 2001, and is locked in a dispute with
some creditors in a case that is now before the U.S. Supreme
Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veronica Navarro Espinosa, a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan, declined to comment on Repsol&#8217;s announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;No Hurry&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argentina&#8217;s global 8.75 percent bonds due 2017, the closest
in maturity to the 2024 notes, rallied 2.8 cents on the dollar
today to 93.66 cents, bringing yields down to 11.26 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Repsol disclosed that it had sold its
remaining 12 percent equity stake in YPF for $1.3 billion
through Morgan Stanley, another New York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antonio Brufau, who was Repsol&#8217;s chief executive officer,
said Feb. 26 said that the company probably would sell the
Argentine bonds after receiving them, though it was in no hurry
to do so. In addition to the 2024 bonds, the Madrid-based
company received bonds due in 2015, 2017 and 2033. Brufau
stepped down as CEO last week and is now executive chairman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said yesterday in a filing that the bonds have
a market value of $4.67 billion, or $650 million below their
nominal value. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s record of job cuts after acquisitions is now drawing heat from both sides of the Atlantic. U.S. and state politicians have joined their U.K. counterparts in questioning the economic impact of the drugmaker&#8217;s push to buy AstraZeneca Plc. (AZN) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. Senators Carl Levin and Ron Wyden are proposing legislation that would make it harder for U.S. companies to shift their legal addresses overseas to avoid U.S. taxes, a move Pfizer has proposed as part of the transaction. Maryland Governor Martin O&#8217;Malley and Delaware Governor Jack Markell said yesterday they were concerned the deal will lead to job losses in their states in a letter to Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. backlash follows Read&#8217;s commitment to U.K. officials that Pfizer would keep at least 20 percent of the combined company&#8217;s research-and-development workers and substantial manufacturing plants in the U.K. for at least five years. The governors wrote that they want assurances as well. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Despite our requests, we have received no corresponding assurances about retaining jobs and research and development in our states,&#8221; O&#8217;Malley and Markell, both Democrats, wrote in a letter obtained by Bloomberg News. &#8220;Our concern is exacerbated by Pfizer&#8217;s history of closing U.S. research facilities, including sites in Michigan and Illinois, after closing on previous corporate transactions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Todd Vitale, a personal trainer who opened his own gym last year, said he was having difficulty getting a mortgage of more than $700,000 to buy a home in Greenwich, Connecticut, because his new business was untested. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vitale then tried Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), the biggest U.S. home lender, where he kept most of his savings in an account he opened more than a decade ago, he said. He worked with the bank&#8217;s private mortgage unit, whose clients are entitled to loans of up to $6 million and personalized service, and had the opportunity to explain that he had already run a similar business and could make the gym succeed. Wells Fargo approved his 30-year fixed-rate mortgage of more than $700,000, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I would have gotten a loan unless Wells Fargo private mortgage gave me a shot,&#8221; said Vitale, 38, who moved in to his new 3,000 square-foot home in February. &#8220;I would have had to walk away from the home.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jumbos, or loans of at least $417,000 in most areas, are one of the few thriving pieces of an otherwise shrinking mortgage market. The biggest banks, including San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Bank of America Corp., are ratcheting up efforts to win wealthier borrowers while keeping credit tight for almost everyone else. Lenders are allowing assets in accounts to serve as collateral in lieu of down payments, cutting rates if customers have or set up investment accounts, rolling out new adjustable-rate jumbo mortgages, and accepting lower down payments. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Applications Increase &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Jumbos are growing while almost everything else is dead,&#8221; said Paul Miller, a banking analyst at FBR Capital Markets Corp. based in Arlington, Virginia. &#8220;Big banks need loan growth. If they were getting decent commercial loan growth, they wouldn&#8217;t be so aggressive on competing for jumbos.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Applications for jumbo mortgages of at least $729,000 increased 4.9 percent in March from a year earlier, while requests for loans of less than $150,000 fell by 21 percent, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The average purchase application loan amount reached $280,500 in the week ended April 18, the highest since the survey started in January 1990, the MBA said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jumbos, also called non-conforming loans because they exceed the limit for government-backed Fannie Mae (FMCC) and Freddie Mac to guarantee, are loans of more than $625,500 in pricier markets such as Manhattan and Los Angeles. They&#8217;re generally made to the most creditworthy borrowers with FICO scores of 760 on average and held by banks instead of being packaged into securities and sold to investors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Job Cuts &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Plunging mortgage lending at Wells Fargo and JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. mortgage lender, dragged down their first-quarter earnings. Both banks are paring staff, with New York-based JPMorgan reducing the number of jobs at its mortgage unit by 30 percent, or 14,000 positions, since the start of last year. Wells Fargo got rid of 1,100 jobs in its residential mortgage business in the first quarter to keep expenses in line with demand for loans. Bank of America, the fourth-largest mortgage lender, swung to a surprise loss in the first quarter on costs tied to mortgage disputes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Refinancing, which drove lenders&#8217; profits last year, fell in the week ended April 25 to the lowest level since 2008, according to the MBA, after increases in borrowing rates. While the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage declined to 4.21 percent this week, it&#8217;s still up almost a full percentage point from a near-record low last May, data from Freddie Mac show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Lower Rates &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;That level of drop sends everyone everywhere looking for business,&#8221; said Joel Kan, director of economic forecasting at Washington-based MBA. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lenders are also vying for jumbos since they don&#8217;t have to pay higher guarantee fees charged by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to insure the bonds, as they do with conforming loans, said Richard Lepre, an Alamo, California-based loan officer with RPM Mortgage. That means they can charge lower rates on jumbos, making them more attractive than traditional loans. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The rate at Wells Fargo for a 30-year fixed jumbo mortgage was 4.13 percent as of yesterday, compared with 4.25 percent for a conventional 30-year fixed loan. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan modified its guidelines in the third quarter for making jumbo loans to take into account a client&#8217;s total assets at the bank. The bank made the change after seeing that customers who had long-term relationships with JPMorgan were less likely to default on their loans. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Leverage Relationships &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lender created a separate process last year to review all declined loans to ensure those decisions made sense. It also set up a group that works with wealthy clients who have more complex financial situations, such as self-employed borrowers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We leverage relationships to let the customers know we really want to do business with them,&#8221; said Lesley Corydon, a senior vice president in the private client mortgage group at JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s jumbo mortgage originations represented 21 percent of its total originations in the first quarter of 2014 compared with 10 percent a year earlier, according to the bank. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Customers of Chase Private Client, who have assets ranging from about $500,000 to $5 million in total wealth, increasingly are opting to use their deposits and investments as collateral when borrowing. Some clients use the credit as bridge loans or to make larger down payments. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vitale, the trainer who works with high school and college athletes at his Division 1 Prep gym, said he considered going to a non-bank, such as a hedge fund, for his home loan. He said he was dissuaded by the high rates and hoops he would have had to jump through to get the loan, compared with getting his Wells Fargo mortgage. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;100% Financing &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased to know that Mr. Vitale received assistance with his home lending needs,&#8221; said Emmanuel Vuillequez, product manager for non-conforming mortgages at Wells Fargo. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last year, Wells Fargo created a team of 400 underwriters spread across six U.S. locations who just focus on jumbo loans. The bank is trying to win more jumbo business through better execution, deploying specially trained underwriters who can handle complicated deals and complete them by the closing date, Vuillequez said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Jumbo lenders are looking for ways to distinguish themselves from other jumbo lenders,&#8221; said Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance, a trade publication in Bethesda, Maryland. &#8220;Jumbo lending was the bright star of the mortgage market last year, so everyone is looking to ride that momentum into 2014.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At Bank of New York Mellon Corp., where the average size of a mortgage is $1 million, clients can get 100 percent financing. They don&#8217;t have to put any money down and can instead pledge assets in investment accounts as collateral, said Bill Sappington, head of private banking at the New York-based firm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Smaller Deposits &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;BNY Mellon earlier this year started offering customers the option to lock in mortgage rates for 90 days, instead of the typical 30-day term. The additional days give them more time to close knowing the rate is secure. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bank of America in October reduced the down payment to 15 percent from 20 percent for most jumbos of less than $1 million. Existing customers at the bank may receive discounts on their mortgages based on their level of business with the firm, said Susan Atran, a Bank of America spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank, nonconforming mortgage originations were 37 percent of overall loans made during the first quarter compared with 22 percent a year earlier, according to the firm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;RPM Mortgage this year began offering new jumbo adjustable-rate mortgages with initial low rates. One of their loan products provides a fixed rate for five years at a maximum of 2.63 percent, and then resets once during the next five years to no more than 4.63 percent, Lepre said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Jumbo Defaults &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jumbo originations are still lower than they were before the financial crisis. A decade ago, jumbo ARMs helped fuel the housing bubble by letting buyers qualify for homes they could only afford at the low rates before they reset. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When home prices stopped climbing in mid-2006, both jumbo and conventional ARM borrowers began defaulting in higher numbers, contributing to the collapse of the mortgage market that in turn led to the most severe financial crisis in decades. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, demand for jumbos is growing as borrowers resume buying second homes or investment properties, according to Chase&#8217;s Corydon. Banks are often fighting for loans in the $1 million to $2 million range, said Mike McPartland, head of lending for Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s (C) private bank in North America. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;If in the past, I was competing with two private banks, now it feels like I&#8217;m competing with two private banks and two regional lenders for that $2 million mortgage,&#8221; said McPartland, whose clients generally have at least $25 million in net worth. &#8220;The benefit to working with a bank that knows you is we don&#8217;t treat a mortgage like an isolated financial transaction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Alexis Leondis in Washington at aleondis@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editors responsible for this story: Vincent Bielski at vbielski@bloomberg.net Rob Urban &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the U.S. drugmaker
seeking to acquire AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), advanced its U.K. charm
offensive with a series of videos extolling the scientific
benefits, while downplaying the potential tax advantages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It really meets the scientific needs,&#8221; Chief Executive
Officer Ian Read said today in a video and statement on Pfizer&#8217;s
website. &#8220;It meets needs of efficiency, it meets needs of
strengthening our balance sheet and strengthening our fiscal
position.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca rejected the bid of about $106 billion from
Pfizer earlier this month. Buying the company would give Pfizer
a lower tax rate and a portfolio of experimental cancer drugs.
Read and Pascal Soriot, CEO of London-based AstraZeneca, will
testify to U.K. lawmakers next week amid political tension over
public-interest issues related to the takeover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said on BBC
Radio 4 today that the government wants to clarify what a deal
would mean for British scientific research and jobs. Lawmakers
are prepared to negotiate hard as they engage both companies, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca shareholders will &#8220;get an immediate benefit
from the cash that we would pay them,&#8221; Pfizer&#8217;s Read said. &#8220;It
allows them to participate in a very strong combined company
with great cash flows and a great portfolio, and it allows a
very efficient allocation of capital.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Improving the efficiency of the organization&#8221; and the
ability to &#8220;liberate the balance sheet and tax of the combined
companies&#8221; are the key reasons for the takeover, Read said.
&#8220;We liked where their science is being done, which is in the
U.K. We liked the complementary nature of the portfolio.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read may soon also face government inquiries in the U.S.
Pfizer has said it plans to keep the company&#8217;s operating
headquarters in the U.S., even as its legal address shifts to
the U.K. for the lower tax rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no immediate reply to two telephone messages and
an e-mail sent to AstraZeneca&#8217;s London offices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chief Executive Officer
Ian Read faces heightened public scrutiny of his bid for
AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) this week when he&#8217;ll be questioned by lawmakers
on his commitment to the U.K. in hearings broadcast live. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read has been summoned by separate parliamentary committees
to testify on the U.S. company&#8217;s offer of about $106 billion for
London-based AstraZeneca, the biggest takeover bid in U.K.
history. He and AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot are scheduled to
appear before the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee
tomorrow and the Science and Technology Committee on May 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hearings in London provide a first opportunity for
lawmakers to question the pharmaceutical executives amid growing
public and political concern that a takeover would mean job
losses and cuts to research. As executives from Rupert Murdoch
to Robert Diamond have learned, lawmakers acting in the name of
British taxpayers can force company changes to assuage public
concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The entire political class and media will be spending a
couple of hours listening to Pfizer&#8217;s business and intellectual
case&#8221; for the takeover, said Richard Berry, managing director
of Democratic Audit, a charity that has studied the work of
parliamentary committees. &#8220;Sessions where people get a grilling
get a lot of attention and I&#8217;m sure the media will highlight the
most aggressive part.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Video Appearances &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read may have pre-empted some of the questions he is likely
to face with videos posted on Pfizer&#8217;s website over the weekend
in which he outlined the case for the bid, stressing his
company&#8217;s commitment to research and explaining its decision to
shutter a plant in Sandwich, England, in 2011. Pfizer&#8217;s
commitment to the new AstraZeneca headquarters being built in
Cambridge, eastern England, fits the company&#8217;s record of
bringing together scientists at its research hub in the U.S.,
Read said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the U.K. I see great similarities with Cambridge,
Massachusetts, where you have this hub of innovation, this hub
of young scientists,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The strategy to build a center
in Cambridge in fact is in line with our strategy as we&#8217;ve shown
by what we&#8217;ve done in Massachusetts.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Read first approached ministers after announcing the
bid, Conservatives including Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne welcomed it as a vote of confidence in the U.K. Since
then, ministers have grown more cautious, demanding assurances
about jobs and research spending. According to one person
familiar with the company&#8217;s plans, Pfizer won&#8217;t proceed with the
bid if the U.K. government is hostile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Bitter Experience&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Bitter experience in other contexts has taught us about
the importance of really pinning these commitments down and not
just allowing them to rest as aspirations but to make sure they
are exacting, binding commitments,&#8221; Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said in an interview with Sky News broadcast yesterday.
&#8220;There are various ways that they could be made more solid and
that&#8217;s exactly the kind of thing we&#8217;re discussing with Pfizer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most hostile questioning may come from members of the
opposition Labour Party, whose leader Ed Miliband has accused
Prime Minister David Cameron of being a cheerleader for the
takeover. Conservatives will also want to be seen to be asking
tough questions to demonstrate they are pursuing due diligence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Frankly, we have not seen any guarantees from Pfizer that
they have an investment plan that is equal to what AstraZeneca
are putting into the science base over the next 10 years,&#8221;
William Bain, a Labour lawmaker on the Business Committee, said
in an interview. &#8220;Pfizer does have a record of launching
takeovers for other pharmaceutical companies and then seeing a
reduction in investment in research and development.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Executive Roll-call &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow&#8217;s session will begin at 9:30 a.m. in London with
evidence from union officials. At 10 a.m., Read will be joined
by Frank D&#8217;Amelio, the company&#8217;s chief financial officer, and
Jonathan Emms, its U.K. managing director. Their testimony is
scheduled to end at 11:15 a.m., when Soriot, flanked by Mene Pangalos, AstraZeneca&#8217;s executive vice president, and Ian Brimicombe, vice president in charge of corporate finance, will
make the case against the takeover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The main issue is to understand what Pfizer&#8217;s commitments
to the U.K. are and how binding they are,&#8221; Julian Huppert, a
lawmaker who represents Cambridge, said in an interview. &#8220;The
deal is driven by their desire to avoid paying tax in the U.S.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The British government&#8217;s &#8220;patent box&#8221; allows companies to
pay reduced tax on products spun out of research done in the
U.K. For Huppert, it makes Pfizer&#8217;s attachment to Britain shaky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.S. Pressure &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is also facing political pressure in the U.S., where
the New York-based company has said it plans to keep its
operating headquarters even as it moves its legal address to the
U.K. for a lower tax rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the videos at the weekend, Read sought to shift the
emphasis away from tax and onto the business case for the
takeover, which AstraZeneca&#8217;s board has rejected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We liked where their science is being done, which is in
the U.K. We liked the complementary nature of the portfolio,&#8221;
he said. The approach was, he said, &#8220;a win-win for society, a
win-win for shareholders, and a win-win for stakeholders.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;British parliamentary committees, originally introduced to
scrutinize the work of government, have become increasingly
willing to intervene in matters of more general interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012, the Treasury Committee summoned Diamond, then CEO
of Barclays Plc, to explain the Libor-rigging scandal. He
resigned before he got there, despite investor support, after
politicians on all sides made him a target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Foam Pie &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Murdoch, chairman of News Corp., made it through three
hours of testimony to parliament&#8217;s culture committee on the
phone-hacking scandal in 2011. He emerged unscathed barring a
foam-pie assault by a member of the public after telling members
that his appearance was &#8220;the most humble day of my life.&#8221; His
son James wasn&#8217;t so lucky, with his account of events disputed
by two former executives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first sign of whether the U.K. government&#8217;s view on
Pfizer and AstraZeneca has shifted as a result of the testimony
will come at 1 p.m. tomorrow, when Business Secretary Vince Cable responds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cable has been examining how Pfizer&#8217;s proposed takeover
could be blocked on public-interest grounds, including the
possibility of referring the case to the European Commission or
proposing a change to the Enterprise Act that would widen the
public-interest test for takeovers, a person familiar with
discussions in government said on May 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I will do whatever is right for Britain, I will always
stand up for British jobs, British interests, British science,
British RD,&#8221; Cameron said when asked on BBC TV yesterday about
toughening up the law on takeovers. &#8220;But when we think of that,
it is important to make the point that Britain benefits
massively by being an economy that&#8217;s open to overseas
investment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Elisabeth Behrmann" date="May 11, 2014 10:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-11/rio-bond-risk-withstands-goldman-iron-ore-dusk.html"><headline>Rio Bond Risk Withstands Goldman Iron Ore Dusk</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Debt investors are betting
Australia&#8217;s iron-ore producers will survive what Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. has described as the dusk of a bull market as they
improve balance sheets and cut production costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bond risk for BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) and Rio Tinto Group fell
this quarter even as prices of the steelmaking ingredient
slumped 11 percent, according to CMA credit-default swap
pricing. Contracts for Rio, which last year got 87 percent of
its profit from iron ore, were at 93 basis points on May 8, 12
below this year&#8217;s high. Those for BHP dropped to 61 basis points
from as high as 71. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;BHP and Rio have been lifting production while also
taking out costs,&#8221; Ben Byrne, a credit sector specialist at
Citigroup Inc. in Sydney, said by phone May 9. &#8220;These efforts
have offset weaker commodity prices to some degree.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman wrote in a May 7 report that over-investment in new
supply means dusk is settling on the iron-ore bull market from
2004 to 2013, which will force mine closures among high-cost
producers. BHP and Rio, the world&#8217;s two biggest mining
companies, are reining in investment and cutting debt after a
decade-long boom in metal prices slowed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rio plans to reduce spending on new operations to about $8
billion in 2015, less than half its outlay in 2012. BHP is
focusing on the highest-returning projects and plans to spend
$16 billion during fiscal 2014 on new projects and exploration,
down from $22 billion the previous year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bond Dearth &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The austerity drive, which includes slashing operating
costs, is set to reduce net debt for both companies. Rio&#8217;s may
fall 21 percent to $14.2 billion in 2015 compared with this
year, RBC Capital Markets forecast this month. BHP&#8217;s net debt
may fall 45 percent to $13.7 billion in fiscal 2015, RBC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The savings drive by the miners means there&#8217;s a smaller
pool of debt for bond investors to choose from, said Chris Walter, a credit analyst in Sydney at Westpac Banking Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s little to no supply of cash bonds in the near
term&#8221; from mining companies, Walter said. &#8220;Credit investors
still need to put their money to work in a low-yield
environment, so it&#8217;s not surprising we&#8217;re seeing further spread
tightening&#8221; in CDS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BHP and Rio have both predicted lower iron-ore prices this
year after producers in Australia and Brazil spent billions of
dollars to expand output. After a balanced export market in 2013
totaling 1.2 billion metric tons, Goldman Sachs forecasts a
surplus of about 77 million tons this year, rising to about 145
million tons next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Metrics Strained &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. dollar debt issued by Rio returned 1.7 percent this
quarter through May 8 while BHP&#8217;s gained 1.6 percent, according
to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Metals, Mining  Steel
Index. The gauge advanced 2.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia&#8217;s 10-year bond yield fell to an seven-month low
of 3.80 percent last week, before closing at 3.82 percent. It
offered a 1.21 percentage point pick-up over similar-maturity
U.S. Treasuries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Aussie dollar, the world&#8217;s fifth most-traded currency,
fetched 93.56 U.S. cents as of 5 p.m. in Sydney on May 9, having
gained 4.9 percent since Dec. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth in China, the biggest buyer of iron ore, is slowing
after the government reined in a credit boom and toughened
regulation to combat pollution. The economy expanded 7.4 percent
in the first quarter from a year earlier, matching the weakest
pace since 2009. Premier Li Keqiang is targeting growth of 7.5
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron ore entered a bear market in March and fell to $103.70
a ton on May 8, the lowest level since September 2012, taking
this year&#8217;s price drop to 23 percent. The average annual price
is forecast to decline each year until at least 2017, according
to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If iron ore fell to $80 or $90 a ton in the next couple
of years, Rio&#8217;s credit metrics could become strained for its
current A- and A3 ratings,&#8221; said Byrne. &#8220;However there is
little risk of a credit event given the company&#8217;s scale and
strong liquidity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.K. signaled it wants more
guarantees from Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the U.S. drugmaker seeking to
acquire AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), and held open the possibility of
blocking the deal using a &#8220;public interest&#8221; defense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister David Cameron reiterated today that he wants
&#8220;more&#8221; from the company, while his deputy Nick Clegg said he
wants &#8220;exacting, binding commitments&#8221; rather than
&#8220;aspirations.&#8221; Their comments came after Pfizer yesterday
issued a series of videos extolling the scientific benefits of a
deal, while downplaying the potential tax advantages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I will always stand up for British jobs, British
interests, British science, British RD,&#8221; Cameron said in an
interview with the BBC&#8217;s &#8220;Andrew Marr&#8221; program. Business
secretary Vince Cable &#8220;is looking at this issue of public
interest defense and he will report back to parliament on
that,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca rejected a bid of about $106 billion from
Pfizer earlier this month. Buying the company would give Pfizer
a lower tax rate and a portfolio of experimental cancer drugs.

of London-based AstraZeneca, will testify to U.K. lawmakers this
week amid political tension over public-interest issues related
to the takeover. &lt;/p&gt;

U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron initially described the assurances on jobs and research investment that Pfizer Inc. gave on May 2 as &#8220;robust,&#8221; before telling parliament on May 7 that the company &#8220;must do more.&#8221; Close

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the U.S. drugmaker
seeking to acquire AstraZeneca (AZN) Plc, sold $4.5 billion of bonds
to repay securities that mature within a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offering, which was increased from $4.25 billion,
included $1.5 billion of 2.1 percent, five-year notes that
yielded 48 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proceeds of the issue will be used to repay 900 million
euros ($1.2 billion) of 4.75 percent notes due in December, and
a portion of the company&#8217;s $3 billion of 5.35 percent notes due
March 2015, according to a regulatory filing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bond sale comes as the biggest U.S. drugmaker is
offering about $106 billion for London-based AstraZeneca. Along
with the lower tax rate linked to AstraZeneca&#8217;s U.K. base, Chief
Executive Officer Ian Read has said the acquisition would give
New York-based Pfizer a promising new generation of experimental
cancer drugs that use the body&#8217;s own immune system to attack the
disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read has been summoned by separate parliamentary committees
to testify on the U.S. company&#8217;s offer for AstraZeneca, amid
growing public and political concern that a takeover would mean
job losses and cuts to research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one potential scenario, a successful acquisition would
entail borrowing &#8220;more than $30 billion,&#8221; Carol Levenson, a
New York-based analyst at Gimme Credit LLC, wrote in a report
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer also sold $1 billion of 1.1 percent, three-year
notes at 25 basis points more than benchmarks, $1 billion of 3.4
percent, 10-year bonds at a relative yield of 80 basis points,
and $500 million of 4.4 percent, 30-year debentures with a 95
basis-point spread, Bloomberg data show. The company also issued
$500 million of three-year, floating-rate securities at 15 basis
points more than the London interbank offered rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s $1 billion of 3 percent notes due 2023 fell
0.4 cent to 97.7 cents on the dollar for a yield of 3.3 percent
on May 9, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) plans to hold
some of the $3.25 billion of Argentine bonds it bought from
Repsol SA as a wager the securities will rally and hasn&#8217;t hedged
them, according to a person with direct knowledge of the bank&#8217;s
strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan paid $2.8 billion for the 10-year notes -- about
86.6 cents on the dollar -- with the intent to sell them at a
profit in the secondary market, said the person, who asked not
to be identified because he isn&#8217;t authorized to speak publicly
about the matter. The bank sold some of the notes today and will
keep some of the securities longer term, the person said,
without giving amounts. Veronica Espinosa, a spokeswoman at the
New York-based bank, declined to comment on the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;ve moved about half of the bonds to large emerging-market dedicated investors,&#8221; Michael Roche, a strategist at
Seaport Global Holdings LLC, said in a telephone interview,
citing trades he&#8217;s observed. &#8220;There&#8217;s just a growing desire to
gain exposure to Argentina.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argentina gave the so-called Bonar bonds due 2024 to
Spanish oil company Repsol in compensation for the takeover of
51 percent of YPF SA (YPF) two years ago, in addition to bonds
maturing in 2015, 2017 and 2033 for a total face value of $5.32
billion. Repsol sold the 2024 bonds to JPMorgan and agreed not
to sell the remaining notes for seven days after the transaction
closes, according to a May 9 regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nortel Networks Corp. (NRTLQ)&#8217;s warring
creditors aren&#8217;t the only ones focused on a trial to divide the
more than $7 billion remaining after the Canadian telecom giant
was liquidated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will also have lawyers on hand to guard
secrets surrounding more than 6,000 patents that it teamed up
with Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Sony Corp. (6758) to buy for $4.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a trial that began today, U.S., Canadian and European
creditors are fighting over how to divide cash raised through a
series of auctions after what was once North America&#8217;s largest
telephone-equipment maker went bankrupt in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European creditors, including British pensioners, said
the Canadians are seeking 82 percent and the Americans are after
73 percent of the $7 billion under their respective proposals.
The division of the $4.5 billion raised in the patent sale has
been a key sticking point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The U.S.-Canada fight on the patents will be the main
part of the trial,&#8221; Kevin Starke, a senior analyst with CRT
Capital Group Inc. in Stamford, Connecticut, said in a phone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Canadian creditors, including Nortel&#8217;s pension system,
said that because the company was based in Ontario and owned the
patents, it deserves the cash that was paid for them by the
technology company group, according to Starke. Canada is seeking
everything from the patent sale and 90 percent of all IP
proceeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.S. Licenses &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. creditors, including bondholders seeking full
interest payments, said U.S. businesses held licenses for the
patents, so they deserve the money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judges in Wilmington, Delaware, and Toronto are presiding
over the video-linked proceeding. The tech companies that now
own the patents said they fear valuable secrets may accidentally
leak out during 25 days of testimony and argument and want the
court to shield information concerning license agreements,
potential litigation targets and other matters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nortel&#8217;s U.S. unit contributed about $5.3 billion in assets
to the bankruptcy sales, said Sheila R. Block, a lawyer for the
U.S. estate speaking in Toronto. That unit also contributed
about 70 percent of revenue from 2001 to 2009. As of 2001, every
unit had a fully paid up license for the patents in their
geographic region in perpetuity, said James L. Bromley, a lawyer
for the U.S. unit in Wilmington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Administrative Simplicity&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European group dismissed Canada&#8217;s bid for sole right to
the patent proceeds, saying the parent held legal ownership only
for &#8220;administrative simplicity,&#8221; according to Bill Maguire, a
lawyer for the unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proper way to make distributions is based on each
unit&#8217;s financial contribution in creating the patents, Maguire
said. Investments in research and development are used to
establish economic ownership of the intellectual property, which
is how Nortel calculated distributions when it sold assets to
Alcatel-Lucent in 2006, according to Maguire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You reap what you sow,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. creditors would get about 73 percent of the $7
billion under their approach, with Canada getting about 11
percent and Europe the rest, according to an exhibit presented
by the European creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada&#8217;s model would give its creditors more than 82
percent, while the U.S. and European creditors would get about
14 percent and 4 percent, respectively. The European model would
give U.S. creditors 50 percent, the Canadians about 32 percent
and its own creditors the remainder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1,000 Documents &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 1,000 documents may be used that Nortel&#8217;s U.S.
attorneys say potentially contain confidential information. As
the papers are presented to witnesses, they might become public
as part of the court record. And while other documents may be
safe to disclose in public, the patent holders still want to be
able to review them before they are introduced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Canadian and U.S. creditors have said that without
clear rules, the trial could be disrupted by the need to keep so
many documents secret. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Gross has agreed to allow
sensitive material to be blacked out. With so many documents
involved, however, decisions on what to keep secret may have to
be made while court is in session. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the joint venture that Microsoft, Apple and
Sony formed to buy the patents in 2011, Rockstar Consortium
Inc., will be following the trial along with Ericsson AB, which
bought Nortel&#8217;s wireless unit for $1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Show Why &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross said that on certain patent-related documents, he
would defer to Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft and the other
companies about whether something should be kept secret. Anyone
challenging the need to keep a document confidential would have
to show why it should be made public, Gross said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nortel filed for bankruptcy after losing almost $7 billion
since 2005. At its height in 2000, it reported $30 billion in
annual revenue, had a market capitalization of $250 billion and
employed almost 93,000 people, the company said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Today it&#8217;s every debtor for itself making a territorial
grab&#8221; for the sale proceeds, said Brian E. O&#8217;Connor, a lawyer
representing about 36,000 U.K. pension claimants. &#8220;While they
fight like jackals over the decaying carcass,&#8221; the pensioners
are being harmed, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Nortel Networks Inc., 09-bk-10138, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For at least a decade, International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) gave fired employees information detailing a severance package that asked them to waive age-discrimination claims and also included a page listing the job titles and ages of workers being let go. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This disclosure helps fired employees determine if they have an age-discrimination case, and it&#8217;s required by U.S. federal law for workers over 40 if a company wants the person to agree not to file such a lawsuit. Now IBM is withholding the information, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. It&#8217;s avoiding the disclosure requirement by offering workers the option of bringing claims in arbitration. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although employees are now able to accept a severance agreement and maintain their ability to bring an age-discrimination claim in arbitration, the strategy could make it harder and riskier for dismissed older employees to decide whether it&#8217;s worth taking on the cost of a legal battle, lawyers and labor law experts say. And many older workers are already feeling vulnerable in a still anemic economic recovery, said Ross Eisenbrey, vice president of the Economic Policy Institute, a nonprofit think tank affiliated with labor. IBM, considered a pioneer in employee benefits, may be one of the first major companies to make these changes in severance agreements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp., the world&#8217;s third-largest energy company by market value, became the first major
international oil producer to reveal partnership plans with
state-run Petroleos Mexicanos since Mexico signed landmark
legislation to reopen its doors to foreign producers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, (CVX) which operates several rigs on the U.S. side of
the Gulf of Mexico, is in talks with Mexico City-based Pemex for
exploration opportunities in deepwater, shallow water or shale,
Ali Moshiri, Chevron&#8217;s president of Latin America and Africa,
said today during a conference in Mexico City. Chevron produces
more crude in the U.S. section of the Gulf of Mexico than anyone
except Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc, according to the U.S.
Interior Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are not here to replace Pemex,&#8221; said Moshiri, who
oversees exploration and production projects from Argentina to
Angola. &#8220;We are not here to change their strategy. We are here
to complement what they are doing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, is waiting for the
passage of Mexico&#8217;s secondary energy legislation before deciding
the sites of the first partnerships in Mexico. The legislation,
which will determine Pemex&#8217;s participation in new projects and
the tax structure for private companies joining the newly opened
energy market, could be approved as soon as June, according to
Mexico&#8217;s two largest political parties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Investment Options &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico passed an energy law last year that ended Pemex&#8217;s
75-year production monopoly to allow for private firms to tap
the country&#8217;s 13.44 billion barrels of proven oil reserves.
Private investment is anticipated to generate an additional $30
billion annually and create as many as 2 million jobs, Mexico&#8217;s
energy ministry has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We look for the opportunity that brings the most value to
the Mexican government, the Mexican people, and our
shareholders,&#8221; Moshiri said. &#8220;We are a huge company. We can
invest money in conventional, deepwater, or shallow water. What
drives our decision is really to see what is the best for
everybody.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc are the world&#8217;s
first- and second-biggest energy companies by market value.
Pemex and Exxon signed a technical collaboration agreement last
year before the energy law was approved by President Enrique
Pena Nieto in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are going to align our strategic direction in Mexico
with Pemex,&#8221; Moshiri said. &#8220;Our future in Mexico is based on
building this exisiting partnership.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron added 0.2 percent to close $125.24 in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. hired
former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) partner Magid Shenouda as global
head of trading, the most senior ex-banker to join the Swiss
commodity firm, said a person with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shenouda, the former London-based co-head of Goldman&#8217;s
global commodities unit, will also join the fast-growing
trader&#8217;s board of directors, said the person, who asked not to
be identified because the decision hasn&#8217;t been made public. The
appointment was announced today in a memo to Mercuria staff seen
by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As investment banks pull back from commodities amid
heightened regulatory scrutiny, firms like Mercuria are snapping
up high-profile talent and assets. The company agreed in March
to buy JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s physical commodity business for
$3.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercuria has offered jobs to about 200 people from the
JPMorgan unit. Etienne Amic, managing director for European
energy trading at JPMorgan in London, will join the firm, said
people with knowledge of the matter. Raj Chawla, JPMorgan&#8217;s head
of China commodities, will become Asia Pacific chief operating
officer based in Singapore, two of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercuria spokesman Benoit Lioud declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shenouda will be the number three executive at the Geneva-based company after co-founders Marco Dunand and Daniel Jaeggi,
one of the people said. A 14-year veteran of Goldman Sachs, he
takes over the head trading role from Jaeggi, who will focus
more on strategy and the integration of the JPMorgan business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Top Sphere &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In less than a decade, the founders have transformed
Mercuria from a 10-person company supplying oil to a pair of
Polish refineries into the world&#8217;s fourth-largest independent
commodity trader with revenue topping $112 billion in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking to join the top sphere of independent trading firms
such as Vitol Group and Trafigura Beheer BV, Mercuria has hired
570 staff from 2011 to 2013 including key executives from
investment banks. It now has about 1,200 employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appointments included Houston-based Shameek Konar, a
former managing director at Goldman who is chief investment
officer overseeing Mercuria&#8217;s corporate development including
the JPMorgan acquisition. Victoria Attwood Scott, Mercuria&#8217;s
head of compliance, also joined from Goldman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Former Traders &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roger Jones, the ex-head of commodities at Barclays Plc (BARC) who
has spent more than a quarter-century trading, was hired in 2012
to lead its non-oil business and join the board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shenouda, whose recruitment by Mercuria was reported
earlier by the Wall Street Journal, left Goldman last year,
according to an internal memo confirmed by the bank on Oct. 29.
He joined New York-based Goldman in 1999 and became a partner in
2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before he was the co-head of Goldman&#8217;s global commodity
business, Shenouda ran the bank&#8217;s European crude oil and
products trading unit as well as its European gas and power
trading business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Goldman traders themselves, Dunand and Jaeggi will
significantly increase Mercuria&#8217;s gas and power trading with the
JPMorgan deal. The company has offered jobs to about 200
JPMorgan traders, or about half of the commodity business staff,
a person with knowledge of the matter said this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blythe Masters, head of JPMorgan&#8217;s commodity unit, will
leave the bank once the sale of the business is completed, the
firm said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks from Barclays to Morgan Stanley (MS) are exiting or
shrinking their commodities businesses as regulators crack down
on risk and as revenue falls. Sales for the 10 largest
investment-bank commodity businesses fell to $4.5 billion in
2013 from $14 billion in 2008, according to London-based
analytics company Coalition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the world&#8217;s
biggest securities firm by revenue, hired former Italian Finance
Minister Vittorio Grilli as chairman of its corporate and
investment bank in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grilli, 56, will be based in London and report to
investment-banking head Daniel Pinto, according to a memorandum
to employees sent by Pinto and obtained by Bloomberg News. A
spokeswoman for JPMorgan in London confirmed the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grilli, who has spent most of his career in the civil
service, will advise clients on European policy, markets and
economic developments, according to the memo. Pinto is creating
the position as he reorganizes the reporting lines after
becoming sole investment-banking chief in March. Grilli was
finance minister in Mario Monti&#8217;s caretaker government,
replacing Monti in that job in July 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He worked at the Italian Treasury from 1993 through 2000
before joining Credit Suisse First Boston in 2001 for a year as
head of Italian investment banking. After returning to Rome in
2002 to serve as Italy&#8217;s general accountant, he became head of
the Treasury under the governments of Silvio Berlusconi and
Romano Prodi. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan agreed to purchase Argentine bonds due in 2015,
2017 and 2033, Madrid-based Repsol said in a filing. The oil
company said last week that it agreed to sell Argentine
government bonds due in 2024 to JPMorgan for $2.8 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. bank is facilitating Repsol&#8217;s efforts to
reduce ties with the Argentine government, which nationalized
its 51 percent stake in local oil producer YPF SA in April 2012.
Under an agreement Repsol with the government reached earlier
this year, Repsol last week received $5.32 billion of bonds as
compensation for the seizure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction disclosed today is expected to be completed
by the end of this week, according to the filing. Repsol said it
sold all of its securities due in 2017 and 2033 and all but $117
million of those due in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repsol previously had said it received $500 million of the
2017 securities from Argentina, $1.25 billion of the 2033 bonds
and $317 million of those due in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which has already sold some of the Argentine
bonds received from the first purchase, is wagering that its
remaining holdings will gain in value, a person with direct
knowledge of the bank&#8217;s strategy said earlier this week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO) will become Keurig
Green Mountain Inc. (GMCR)&#8217;s largest shareholder after raising its
stake to 16 percent, doubling down on the maker of Keurig coffee
brewers at a time when consumers are increasingly shunning
sugary sodas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keurig jumped 7.6 percent to $119.07 after Coca-Cola
announced the plan in a filing today. The soft-drink company
will own about 26 million shares within nine months after it
exercises an option to add additional stock. It had bought an
initial stake of 10 percent in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment fits into Coca-Cola&#8217;s strategy of taking
equity stakes in promising new brands and technologies as
healthier habits hits its main revenue growth. The companies are
working together on the Keurig Cold single-cup beverage system
that will be sold in Keurig&#8217;s fiscal 2015, starting later this
year. The coffee maker will also produce and sell Coca-Cola-branded pods to go with the machine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;purchases demonstrate our continued belief that
Keurig Green Mountain has substantial growth potential,&#8221;
Atlanta-based Coca-Cola said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Waterbury, Vermont-based Keurig have jumped 47
percent since Feb. 5, the day Coca-Cola announced it was the
buying the stake. Coca-Cola&#8217;s stock advanced 0.7 percent to
$41.11 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SodaStream Competition &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under today&#8217;s agreement, Coca-Cola owns about 19.5 million
shares and has the right to buy as much as 6.5 million more. The
company signed a pact with Credit Suisse Group AG to purchase
the balance of the stake by Feb. 13, 2015. The bank will set the
price, determined by timing and an agreed-upon formula,
according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partnership between Coca-Cola and Keurig will ratchet
up competition for SodaStream International Ltd., a Lod, Israel-based company that makes home carbonation appliances and soft-drink syrups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February, Coca-Cola bought 16.7 million newly issued
shares in Keurig for about $1.25 billion and said it had the
option to raise the stake to as much as 16 percent during the
first 36 months. Amanda Rosseter, a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola,
declined to elaborate on the timing of the agreement beyond the
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola previously took equity stakes in Zico coconut
water and Honest Tea, and helped incubate them. Coca-Cola
eventually acquired all of Zico and Honest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola&#8217;s investment in Keurig could be seen as a
precursor to an eventual acquisition, though not right away, Ali Dibadj, a New York-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co.,
said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keurig, which changed its name from Green Mountain Coffee
Roasters Inc. in March, has been speculated as a takeover
candidate for at least three years, in part because of its rapid
growth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines (IBM) Corp.
Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty will face a skeptical
audience when she speaks to Wall Street analysts tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she&#8217;s worked to revamp the company in a shifting
technology industry, Rometty has kept herself bound to IBM&#8217;s
target of at least $18 a share in adjusted earnings this year --
a number that 60 percent of analysts anticipate the company will
miss. After eight consecutive quarters of revenue declines, she
must start increasing sales or reduce expenses further to avoid
missing the profit goals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a daylong conference in New York, Rometty, 56, will
probably lay out her plan to use newer technology, such as data
analytics and cloud computing, to mount a strong comeback in the
coming quarters. The question is whether those lines of business
can expand quickly enough to make up for falling sales in IBM&#8217;s
hardware unit and in emerging markets like China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There has to be intense pressure on her to carry out the
execution of the plan,&#8221; Bill Kreher, an analyst at Edward Jones
 Co., said in an interview from St. Louis. &#8220;The concern is
largely about the way to get there.&#8221; He advises buying the
shares and estimates IBM will hit the $18 target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike Fay, an IBM spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re transitioning to key growth areas and transforming
parts of the business,&#8221; Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter said on a conference call last month. &#8220;We&#8217;re
continuing to make investments in key growth areas such as
mobility, security and cloud, and these initiatives are gaining
traction but are not yet at scale.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abandon Roadmap? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those changes need to happen more quickly, and Rometty
should consider dropping her earnings targets so she can focus
on the transition, said Ben Reitzes, an analyst at Barclays Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given the deterioration in earnings quality and revenue
challenges, we believe it makes sense for IBM to abandon its
roadmap and change its business model,&#8221; he said in a research
note. The company needs to more aggressively shift to providing
technology as a service rather than a product, he said. He has
the equivalent of a neutral rating and estimates IBM will report
adjusted earnings of $17.80 this year, short of its target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM shares are up 2.5 percent this year, in line with the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. They fell less than 1 percent to
$192.19 at the close today in New York. Eight analysts advise
buying the stock, while 24 say to hold and three recommend
selling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a 30-year career at IBM, Rometty stepped into the
role of CEO in 2012 amid sweeping changes in the industry. Her
company is still adjusting to the upheaval in the technology
world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology customers are increasingly storing data and
software on cloud-computing networks, rather than on site,
limiting their need for servers and mainframes and the IBM
consultants needed to install and maintain them. While the
company has shifted its focus to cloud services and data
analytics to keep up, the effort has not been enough to
reinvigorate sales growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hardware Slump &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lagging demand for IBM&#8217;s hardware division continues to
drag down revenue, with the unit&#8217;s sales falling 23 percent to
$2.4 billion in the first quarter. Revenue in developing
countries slid 11 percent, or 5 percent when adjusting for
currency fluctuations. Revenue from China fell 20 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow&#8217;s meeting with analysts gives Rometty and her
executive team a chance to show how their more recent
investments will produce more revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;IBM has implemented significant actions as it shifts
toward a higher valued-added mix; by no means is the company
standing still,&#8221; Jim Kelleher, an analyst at Argus Research in
New York, said in a note. &#8220;IBM has also shown an ability to
align costs in periods of challenging revenue growth.&#8221; He has a
hold rating on the shares and estimates IBM will fall short of
its target with earnings of $17.96 a share this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Products &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will probably highlight newer products tomorrow
like the cloud offerings from SoftLayer Technologies Inc., which
it acquired last year, or the Watson cognitive-computing tool,
said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co.
In a note to investors, he questioned whether those initiatives
are incremental for the company or can actually help boost sales
growth. He has the equivalent of a hold rating on the shares and
estimates IBM will hit its $18 target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cloud Promise &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has held up cloud computing as one of its biggest
opportunities for growth. Cloud revenue grew more than 50
percent last quarter, and cloud offerings delivered as a service
are now on pace to generate about $2.3 billion a year. That&#8217;s
still a fraction of IBM&#8217;s total $100 billion in annual sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it searches for growth, IBM is also cutting expenses
and shedding less profitable businesses. Earlier this year,
China&#8217;s Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) agreed to buy IBM&#8217;s low-end server
business for $2.3 billion. The deal is awaiting government
review before closing, and the companies must convince U.S.
officials that the transaction won&#8217;t give China back-door access
to secrets and infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Job Cuts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower tax rates have also helped profits continue to grow,
and a surge in buybacks has helped IBM hit its targets for
earnings per share. It also took an $870 million charge last
quarter to cut jobs, and has changed the information it provides
in U.S. severance packages in a way that may help reduce age-discrimination lawsuits, according to lawyers and labor law
experts. IBM said the changes were made to protect worker
privacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s cost-cutting moves helped lift adjusted
profit to $16.28 a share last year, up 40 percent from 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this year, the average estimate of 25 analysts is for
$17.88 a share in adjusted earnings, less than the company&#8217;s $18
target. Next year&#8217;s average analyst estimate of $19.79 a share
also falls short of a $20 goal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has said it can meet its forecasts, even as costs mount
in its pursuit of the goals. IBM&#8217;s debt has climbed, and its
cash balance has dropped, partly because of spending on stock
repurchases -- spending that could have gone to acquisitions or
other investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Wall Street analysts, such as Morningstar Inc.&#8217;s Peter Wahlstrom, argue that Rometty shouldn&#8217;t be trying to hit the
targets. Yardsticks like revenue and free cash flow are more
important than earnings per share anyway, Wahlstrom said. He has
a hold rating and estimates IBM&#8217;s adjusted earnings will fall
short of the target at $17.47 a share this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Those are things that can be kind of managed,&#8221; he said
of earnings per share. &#8220;You don&#8217;t really give a company credit
for that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numbers to watch include: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Free cash flow: CFO Schroeter said last month that the company
expects at least $16 billion for the year, up from $15 billion
in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given that non-operating forces have a limited impact on
FCF vs. EPS (buybacks, tax rate, one-time gains, etc), we expect
investors to remain focused on this metric and to look for both
upside and downside risk at the analyst day,&#8221; Bernstein&#8217;s
Sacconaghi said in a note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Acquisitions: IBM said in 2010 it planned to spend $20 billion
on acquisitions through 2015. With revenue declining, some
analysts say a large acquisition could be warranted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given the ongoing challenges with weak organic revenue
(especially in hardware), IBM may need to do a large deal to
help stabilize the revenue,&#8221; Reitzes of Barclays said in a
note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Growth markets: IBM has said it expects emerging markets to
approach 30 percent of revenue in 2015. Last year, the markets
made up 23 percent of total sales after falling 4.9 percent
year-over-year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We also expect to hear about IBM&#8217;s growth markets and
what changes have been put in place to stimulate revenue
growth,&#8221; Reitzes said in a note. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chief Executive Officer Ian Read refused to be pinned down on his commitment to preserve jobs in the U.K. as skeptical lawmakers grilled him about the company&#8217;s unsolicited offer for AstraZeneca Plc. (AZN) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot followed Read, telling the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee he couldn&#8217;t rule out accepting an offer from Pfizer. The U.S. company plans to sweeten the 60.4-billion-pound ($101.9 billion) bid for a second time, people with knowledge of the matter said. Pfizer may wait until after the hearings to offer more, they said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Read faced members of Parliament who are concerned Pfizer will cut jobs and close facilities, which has been its pattern in previous takeovers. Pfizer reiterated its pledge to keep 20 percent of its global research and development workforce in the U.K. and maintain AstraZeneca&#8217;s factory in Macclesfield. The company would reduce employment after the acquisition, Read said, though when questioned he wouldn&#8217;t say if that means Pfizer could cut science jobs in the U.K. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The commitment of 20 percent of a global company&#8217;s RD is an unprecedented commitment,&#8221; said Read. &#8220;It&#8217;s a substantial commitment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.K. politicians, led by Prime Minister David Cameron, have said they want New York-based Pfizer to do more to ensure it will protect British jobs and science. Business Secretary Vince Cable told the committee the government is considering legislation that would allow it to intervene in the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anthony Noto, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc.&#8217;s head banker on Twitter Inc.&#8217;s initial public offering
last year, is leaving to join hedge-fund firm Coatue Management
LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan Dees, who became co-head of technology, media and
telecommunications banking with Noto earlier this year, will
become sole leader of the group, according to an internal memo.
David Wells, a spokesman for the New York-based firm, confirmed
the contents of the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was the top-ranked adviser on mergers and
acquisitions involving technology, media and telecommunications
companies last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Noto, 46, rejoined the firm in 2010 after leaving in 2008 to
become chief financial officer of the National Football League. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coatue, which manages about $9.2 billion, was founded in
1999 by Philippe Laffont, who worked for Julian Robertson at
Tiger Management LLC, according to a regulatory filing last
month. Coatue managed the 20th-most-profitable hedge fund in the
world last year, according to Bloomberg Rankings. The New York-based firm has made investments in technology companies such as
Snapchat Inc. and Flipboard Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Anthony is a key addition to our private investing
effort, helping us build on the momentum we have established,&#8221;
Laffont said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noto&#8217;s move was reported earlier today by website Re/Code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Big Personalities&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon Holden, Nick Giovanni and Michael Ronen will become
co-chief operating officers of the group at Goldman Sachs,
according to the memo. Holden runs the telecommunications sector
and leads the TMT group in Europe. Giovanni is head of the
Internet sector, while Ronen leads the media and
telecommunications MA business in the Americas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dees was co-head of the investment-banking division for
Asia Pacific ex-Japan before moving back to the U.S. to take the
TMT job. George Lee and Gene Sykes will remain co-chairmen of
the TMT group, according to a memo sent by investment banking
co-heads Richard Gnodde, David Solomon and John Weinberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Deals in technology, media and telecom are really
interesting to the world, they involve really big
personalities,&#8221; Lee said in a March interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s a big
revenue and profit contributor, and it&#8217;s so high-profile that
our success there has an overweight impact on the way people
perceive our overall franchise.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;West Point &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noto, a football player at the U.S. Military Academy at
West Point, New York, trained to be a member of the Army Rangers
and spent time in the Middle East while serving as a signal
officer in the infantry. He was a research analyst covering
Internet companies in his first stint at Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since returning to the firm, Noto has competed with Morgan
Stanley (MS) for the lead spot on a string of high-profile IPOs.
Goldman Sachs led the offerings for Yelp Inc. and Twitter, while
Morgan Stanley won the prime spot on LinkedIn Corp. and Facebook
Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My last four years at Goldman Sachs have been as equally
rewarding as the first nine years,&#8221; Noto said in an e-mailed
statement. &#8220;The TMT franchise has never been stronger and I
look forward to seeing the continued success of such a fantastic
team and to working with the firm as a client.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) introduced a lower-priced option for its Xbox One, seeking to take back the lead in
video-game console sales from Sony Corp. (6758) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new version, which will cost $399 and won&#8217;t include the
Kinect motion-sensing camera, will be available on June 9 in all
markets where Xbox One is available, the Redmond, Washington-based company said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move reverses a controversial decision by Microsoft to
bundle Xbox One with Kinect, increasing the price of the console
to $499, or $100 more than Sony&#8217;s PlayStation 4. Although
Microsoft had insisted it needed Kinect to convince game
developers to write software for the motion sensor, Sony&#8217;s big
lead is prompting Microsoft to change its strategy. The
PlayStation 4 outsold Xbox One consoles in the U.S. in March,
holding the lead for a third month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The vision we have had for Xbox One continues, and that
is that the premium experience is with Kinect,&#8221; Yusuf Mehdi,
Xbox vice president for strategy and marketing, said in an
interview. &#8220;We did get a lot of customer feedback since launch
from people saying &#8216;I&#8217;d like more choices,&#8217; and for some people
$399 is an important price point,&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will also start giving users more access to
entertainment applications such as YouTube, Netflix and HBO GO,
changing another policy that annoyed customers. The company had
required users to pay for an Xbox Live Gold subscription to use
such apps. Starting in June, anyone with an Xbox One and Xbox
360 can use those apps. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. Chief Executive Officer Ian Read faced increasingly hostile questioning from U.K. lawmakers today over his takeover bid for AstraZeneca Plc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a standing-room-only hearing, Read&#8217;s job was to convince Parliament&#8217;s skeptical Business, Innovation  Skills Committee that he plans to keep science jobs in Britain if the deal goes ahead. He was preceded by union representatives who said their legal advice was there was no way Pfizer could be held to any of its promises. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m here to make those commitments, I intend to honor those commitments,&#8221; Read told an opposition Labour Party lawmaker who&#8217;d asked how he could be trusted. He went on to confirm he plans job cuts. &#8220;That&#8217;s part of being efficient.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In response, committee members from both the governing Conservative Party and Labour interrupted him, accused him of being coached in advance of the hearing and told him he was holding back information. They asked for solid numbers on jobs, and Read told them he couldn&#8217;t give them. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pfizer plans to sweeten the 60.4-billion-pound ($101.9 billion) bid for AstraZeneca for a second time, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Prime Minister David Cameron has said he wants it to do more to protect British jobs and science. Business Secretary Vince Cable is investigating whether the government can legally block the bid. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is betting the
world&#8217;s biggest bond gains are far from over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank bought $3.25 billion of Argentine
bonds from Repsol SA (REP) as a wager the notes will rally and hasn&#8217;t
hedged them, according to a person with direct knowledge of the
bank&#8217;s strategy. It paid $2.8 billion for the 10-year debt, or
about 86.6 cents on the dollar, and will keep some of the bonds
longer-term, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because he wasn&#8217;t authorized to speak publicly about the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argentina&#8217;s bonds, rated seven levels below investment
grade, have soared 46 percent in the past year, the most among
emerging-market government debt, as the country repairs ties
with the International Monetary Fund and seeks to stem a drop in
the foreign reserves it uses to pay debt. The government gave
the Bonar notes due in 2024 to Madrid-based Repsol as
compensation after seizing 51 percent of YPF SA two years ago,
as part of a package with a total face value of $5.32 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People were aching to be a part of the Argentine story,&#8221;
Patrick Esteruelas, senior sovereign analyst at Emso Partners
Ltd., which oversees about $2 billion, said in an interview in
New York. &#8220;It&#8217;s a junk credit, but it&#8217;s a credit that people
are evaluating as part of a broad convergence play.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Repsol Deal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan sold some of the notes and will keep some with the
intent to sell at a profit, the person said, without giving
amounts. Veronica Espinosa, a spokeswoman for the bank, declined
to comment on the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repsol sold the 2024 bonds to JPMorgan and agreed not to
sell the remaining notes for seven days after the transaction
closes, according to a May 9 regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan sold some of the 2024 securities for about 86.75
cents on the dollar to at least two investment firms, according
to two people familiar with the transactions. The 8.75 percent
notes were trading late yesterday at 88.35 cents on the dollar,
with a yield of 10.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given prices on other Argentine government bonds, the 2024
notes should be about 8 cents higher at 96.5 cents on the dollar
with a yield of 9.4 percent, according to a May 12 report by
Citigroup Inc. strategists Jeff Williams and Guillermo Mondino. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argentina&#8217;s notes due in 2017 traded at 92.4 cents on the
dollar with a 10.3 percent yield. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Steady Increase&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which opened its first office in Buenos Aires in
1978, sold about half of the bonds, according to Michael Roche,
a strategist at Seaport Global Holdings LLC, citing trades he&#8217;s
observed. The country hasn&#8217;t issued international bonds since it
defaulted on $95 billion of debt in 2001. It restructured 93
percent of the debt in swaps in 2005 and 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;ve demonstrated that they&#8217;re able to access
international capital markets,&#8221; Roche said in a telephone
interview from New York. &#8220;We&#8217;re continuing to see a steady
increase in the breadth of investors interested in getting
exposure to Argentina.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joshua Rosner, managing director and bank analyst at Graham
Fisher  Co., said JPMorgan is making a risky bet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They may be betting that the government will ultimately
act rationally,&#8221; he said in a telephone interview from New
York. &#8220;If they didn&#8217;t hedge it, and are holding this for their
own portfolios, it&#8217;s a wildly risky thing to do especially given
the statements and actions of the government.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Regime Change &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since taking office in 2007, President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has also seized $24 billion of private pension funds
and flagship airline Aerolineas Argentinas SA. The country still
hasn&#8217;t settled claims with defaulted-debt creditors demanding
full payment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fernandez&#8217;s efforts to mend ties with overseas creditors
and the prospect of a new government after elections next year
will spark further bond gains, Seaport Global&#8217;s Roche said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argentina revamped its economic data indexes earlier this
year at the behest of the IMF, which had censured the country
for inaccurate inflation and growth figures in 2013. It has also
settled with five companies in the World Bank&#8217;s arbitration arm
and is in negotiations with the Paris Club of creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors are pretty convinced that a new political force
at the new elections will continue to normalize the country&#8217;s
relations with international investors,&#8221; Roche said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) pressed its case for
buying AstraZeneca hours before the chief executives of both
companies are scheduled to appear before U.K. lawmakers to
discuss Pfizer&#8217;s pursuit of the country&#8217;s second-biggest
drugmaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a presentation to AstraZeneca shareholders published
today, Pfizer repeated its rationale for the deal, saying a deal
would create an industry leader with scale and operational
efficiency as well as a broader portfolio of experimental
medicines. AstraZeneca faces challenges as a standalone company,
including the declining revenue from products losing patent
protection, Pfizer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offer proposed by Pfizer on May 2, which AstraZeneca
rejected as undervaluing the company, was based solely on public
information, Pfizer said today in a statement. Talks between the
companies would enable AstraZeneca&#8217;s management to provide
Pfizer with a better understanding of the company, Pfizer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Constructive engagement may lead to a transaction that
AstraZeneca can recommend,&#8221; Pfizer said. &#8220;Pfizer will continue
to be disciplined on price.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s rupee rose by the most in two
weeks on speculation the main opposition party will win national
elections and unveil policies to spur economic growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies probably won 249
to 340 seats, according to six exit polls, with 272 needed for a
majority. The Indian currency pared gains on speculation the
Reserve Bank of India bought the greenback to contain volatility
in the exchange rate, according to five traders, who asked not
to be identified as the information isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rupee gained 0.5 percent, the most since April 25, to
59.7725 per dollar as of 10:40 a.m. in Mumbai, according to
prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. The SP BSE
Sensex (SENSEX) of local shares rose to a record. The rupee touched
59.5175 yesterday, the strongest since July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The rupee is buoyed by the outcome of the exit polls,&#8221;
said Paresh Nayar, head of currency and money markets in Mumbai
at FirstRand Ltd. &#8220;The jump in stocks is also aiding it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voting in the world&#8217;s biggest election ever was completed
yesterday and results will be announced on May 16. Exit polls
indicate the ruling Congress party and its allies probably won
70 to 148 seats as voters seek to punish them for corruption
scandals and the slowest growth in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One-month implied volatility in the rupee, a gauge of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options,
declined 41 basis points, or 0.41 percentage point, to 11.32
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three-month offshore non-deliverable forwards on the rupee
were little changed at 60.80 per dollar, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in the U.S. currency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chief Executive Officer
Ian Read told the governors of Maryland and Delaware it&#8217;s too
soon to determine what effect the company&#8217;s bid for AstraZeneca
Plc (AZN) will have on jobs and manufacturing in their states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca, the U.K.&#8217;s second-biggest drugmaker, rejected
an offer of about $106 billion from Pfizer earlier this month,
saying the New York-based pharmaceutical company wasn&#8217;t offering
enough. Pfizer is planning to increase its bid, said people with
knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified because
the information is private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the biggest U.S.-based drugmaker, said it would
shift its legal address to the U.K. to reap tax benefits if the
deal goes through. Maryland Governor Martin O&#8217;Malley and
Delaware Governor Jack Markell wrote Read last week asking what
assurances he could give them for the 5,700 AstraZeneca workers
in their states. Pfizer already has pledged to keep at least
one-fifth of the companies&#8217; research units and a substantial
manufacturing presence in the U.K. for at least five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Because we are in the very early stages of our proposal
and are not in direct discussions, it is premature to speculate
on any specific impact this would have on jobs and facilities in
any given state,&#8221; Read said in letters dated yesterday to the
two Democratic governors. &#8220;I can tell you that Pfizer will
continue to perform operational, research and manufacturing
activity and will continue to have a significant number of
employees in the U.S.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maryland&#8217;s U.S. congressional delegation sent its own
letter to Read yesterday expressing concern that there may be
job losses among AstraZeneca&#8217;s 3,000-plus employees in the
state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Similar Assurances&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As you evaluate your next steps, we ask you to extend
similar assurances to those you gave in the U.K. to the research
and development workforce in Maryland,&#8221; wrote U.S. Senators
Barbara Mikulski and Benjamin Cardin and Representatives C.A. &#8216;Dutch&#8217; Ruppersberger, Chris Van Hollen, John Sarbanes and John Delaney. &#8220;AstraZeneca and its MedImmune subsidiary have strong
presences in the state, and their workforces are highly skilled
and extremely effective.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer hasn&#8217;t had access to any proprietary information
from London-based AstraZeneca and the company still needs to
collect additional details on its business and prospects, Read
wrote to the two governors. He said Ken Cole, Pfizer&#8217;s senior
vice president of government relations, would schedule a meeting
to give them an update on the status of the discussions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markell said last week that updates on the status of the
discussions wouldn&#8217;t be enough to assuage his concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Keeping us informed is very different from the kind of
jobs they have committed to in the U.K.,&#8221; Markell said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects age of Sago in second paragraph of story
published May 14.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katsunori Sago, deputy president of
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s Japanese unit, will leave the firm
where he began his career 22 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sago, 46, will resign from his post in June and serve as an
advisory director and vice chairman until he departs by March
31, Hiroko Matsumoto, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman, said by phone
today. The company has no plan to fill the deputy president
position, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among his roles, Sago served as co-chairman of the bank&#8217;s
diversity committee in Asia. Goldman Sachs formed a daycare
center in Tokyo in 2009 and has been running a campaign under
the banner &#8220;Womenomics&#8221; to urge Japan&#8217;s government and
companies to promote women in the workplace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two women were among nine Japan employees who were promoted
to managing director in January, according to the Wall Street
firm&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sago is also head of the company&#8217;s securities division in
Japan. That post will be filled by Mark Agne and Hidehiro Imatsu, according to an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg
News. Matsumoto confirmed the contents of the document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sago joined Goldman Sachs in Tokyo in 1992 after graduating
from the University of Tokyo&#8217;s engineering school. He worked in
fixed-income trading and became a managing director in 1999
before joining the Japan unit&#8217;s board in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deleting personal information online
is costly and time-consuming for Web companies. Those
difficulties are now set to be magnified in Europe for Google
Inc. (GOOG), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union&#8217;s top court yesterday ruled citizens
have a &#8220;right to be forgotten&#8221; online, meaning people may ask
search-engine owners to remove personal information and request
that a court or data-protection authority step in if a company
doesn&#8217;t comply. The EU decision doesn&#8217;t spell out what types of
information must be removed and doesn&#8217;t provide exemptions for
data that are true or from a reputable source. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of that is set to create new headaches for U.S. Web
companies, which have businesses based on handling tremendous
amounts of data that often aren&#8217;t touched by humans. The ruling
opens the way for European users to flood the firms with Web
takedown requests, adding costs and time to what they already do
in content removal. Many of the companies already deal with
compliance for different data laws in various geographies,
subjecting requests to shed content to thorough legal analyses
before making the information unavailable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s just such a mind-bogglingly impossible decision,&#8221;
said Fred Cate, distinguished professor at the Indiana
University Maurer School of Law. &#8220;Courts aren&#8217;t responsible for
the practical implications of rulings but this really staggers
the imagination.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) said an experimental
cancer drug shrank tumors in half of patients in an early-stage
study, a result that may help its case that Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s
takeover bid substantially undervalues the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug, called AZD9291, is designed to help patients with
a gene mutation found in 15 percent of Caucasian patients with
non-small cell lung cancer, and 40 percent of Asians. If
approved, it could generate more than $2.2 billion by 2025, said
Seamus Fernandez, a Leerink Partners analyst in Boston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings were released in connection with the American
Society of Clinical Oncology meeting that will start May 30 in
Chicago. AstraZeneca Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot said
data from the meeting, combined with other pipeline findings
coming later this year, should convince investors that Pfizer&#8217;s
bid of about 48 pounds ($81) a share sells the company short. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;ASCO is important but it&#8217;s one step,&#8221; Soriot said in a
telephone interview yesterday. &#8220;We hope as we progress this
year, investors will become more convinced there is more value
in this company than what is offered to us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data from a trial on a separate AstraZeneca lung cancer
medicine, called MEDI4736, will also be presented at the
meeting. That experimental drug is an antibody designed to
inhibit a protein, called PD-L1, that helps some cancers avoid
being detected and attacked by the immune system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is akin to Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac because taxpayers would shoulder the burden of its
rescue in an emergency, rather than let it collapse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, is an example of implicit 
government guarantees not measured in the nation&#8217;s official 
public-debt statistics, Greenspan, 88, said today at a forum in 
Washington organized by the Peter G. Peterson Foundation. The 
reality is that the government would prop up many financial 
firms and other companies if needed, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPMorgan is a Fannie Mae-, Freddie Mac-type of
institution, because they are indeed too big to fail, and
taxpayer monies will come in behind them to hold them up if
necessary,&#8221; said Greenspan. He sat on New York-based JPMorgan&#8217;s
board before his appointment to Fed chairman in 1987. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Housing financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which buy
loans and package them into securities, were taken into
government conservatorship during the financial crisis and
received $187.5 billion in taxpayer funds to stay afloat before
a market turnaround propelled them to record profits. The pair
now back about two-thirds of new U.S. home-loan originations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty said she remains confident in the company&#8217;s 2015 profit forecast despite tumbling sales in hardware and in emerging markets like China. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At a meeting with analysts and investors in New York today, Rometty compared the company&#8217;s current five-year financial goal to the prior four-year projection, when IBM still reached its earnings forecasts amid a global financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I view both periods somewhat similar with unforecasted things that have happened,&#8221; Rometty said. &#8220;This time, we didn&#8217;t expect, and obviously didn&#8217;t plan for, some of the variability in the growth markets as well as our hardware business. You always have things you didn&#8217;t plan for.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM is coping with an industrywide shift of technology customers increasingly storing data and software on cloud-computing networks, rather than on site. That&#8217;s limited customers&#8217; need for servers and mainframes. While IBM (IBM) has shifted its focus to cloud services and data analytics to keep up, the effort hasn&#8217;t been enough to reinvigorate sales growth. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s main opposition Bharatiya
Janata Party was divided a year ago, with Narendra Modi&#8217;s rise
prompting its biggest ally to part ways. Now, it&#8217;s poised for
India&#8217;s biggest election victory in three decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exit polls project Modi&#8217;s party will secure its best result
ever when votes are counted tomorrow, possibly making him the
first Indian leader since 1984 to rule with a majority in
parliament. They also show the ruling Congress party, led by the
Gandhi political dynasty, headed for its worst defeat since
India became an independent country 67 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modi, 63, has turned around the BJP&#8217;s fortunes with a
presidential-style campaign unseen before in the world&#8217;s largest
democracy, addressing 437 rallies in person since September.
While BJP doubters are now rallying behind him, opponents warn
that Modi will exploit a clear mandate to further his party&#8217;s
pro-Hindu agenda rather than focus on reviving Asia&#8217;s third-biggest economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The party&#8217;s fortunes have undergone a stunning
transformation under Modi&#8217;s leadership, despite the resistance
from within the ranks,&#8221; said Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, the author
of &#8220;Narendra Modi: The Man, The Times.&#8221; &#8220;If he wasn&#8217;t the

opposition Labour Party refused calls to apologize for comparing
the proposed Pfizer Inc. (PFE) takeover of AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) to rape by
the U.S. company. &lt;/p&gt;

not offend the U.S. in any way. Roll up rapists.&#8221; His comments
followed heated exchanges in the House of Commons between
Cameron and Miliband over the deal today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mitchell was later invited on to LBC radio and asked to

countryside by HS2,&#8221; he said, referring to the planned north-south high speed rail link. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s a word that&#8217;s used in
other contexts too. I think this row is frankly entirely
artificial. I think the storm is really a very defensive one by
people who don&#8217;t like the takeover but don&#8217;t think they can stop
it and therefore they&#8217;d rather turn the heat on something
else.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The prime minister thinks that analogy is quite wrong,&#8221;
Cameron&#8217;s spokesman Jean-Christophe Gray told reporters in
London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labour&#8217;s treasury spokesman Ed Balls said in a later
interview with LBC that Mitchell should apologize. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) Chief Executive
Officer Pascal Soriot said a sale of the U.K. drugmaker is &#8220;not
inevitable,&#8221; increasing pressure on Pfizer Inc. to raise its
60.4 billion-pound ($101 billion) offer to kick-start talks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The price is really far from what we think the value of
the company is,&#8221; Soriot said today in a telephone interview.
Because Pfizer is offering stock as part of the deal,
AstraZeneca would also need assurances about the future of the
new company before agreeing to negotiate, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soriot&#8217;s comments may increase speculation that New York-based Pfizer will take its offer directly to AstraZeneca
shareholders. The proposed takeover is facing skepticism from
U.K. lawmakers concerned about possible job cuts and Pfizer (PFE)&#8217;s
unwillingness to commit to preserving the workforce of the
country&#8217;s second-biggest drugmaker. Pfizer CEO Ian Read said it
was difficult to make more specific guarantees because
AstraZeneca hasn&#8217;t engaged in talks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read and Soriot both appeared before parliamentary
committees yesterday and today to answer questions about
consequences of the acquisition. With their testimony behind
them, the focus is shifting to Pfizer&#8217;s next move. Pfizer plans
to raise its offer, people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A takeover could distract London-based AstraZeneca from
advancing its pipeline of experimental drugs, and even more so
were Pfizer to make a hostile bid, Soriot said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Drug Pipeline &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The risks are exacerbated in a hostile situation,&#8221; he
said in the interview. &#8220;Any merger of this magnitude is
disruptive and that&#8217;s why we would want to discuss strategy, the
operating model and how we would go about merging these
companies, if we ever get to this.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer would try to protect AstraZeneca&#8217;s most valuable
products in a takeover and wouldn&#8217;t jeopardize the pipeline,
Read said to the Science and Technology committee today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s no truth that products of a critical nature would
be delayed getting to patients,&#8221; Read said. &#8220;If anything, we
would accelerate those products.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer urged AstraZeneca to engage in talks so that the two
companies could reach an agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer contacted AstraZeneca last year to discuss a
purchase, and Chairman Leif Johansson and Soriot flew to New
York to meet with Pfizer, which made the initial bid of about
46.61 pounds a share, Soriot said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lower Offer &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subsequent cash-and-stock offer initially valued the
company at about 50 pounds a share and now has a value of 47.83
pounds a share. AstraZeneca rose 0.3 percent to 46.54 pounds at
the close of trading in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The offer today is 48 pounds,&#8221; Soriot said. &#8220;The offer
is hardly different from the January price, but in the meantime,
our pipeline has progressed quite a lot. I don&#8217;t see why we
would accept today what we didn&#8217;t think was the right price in
January.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of AstraZeneca&#8217;s shareholders have pressed him to
accept the current offer, said Soriot, who is on the company&#8217;s
board of directors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Of course, shareholders will tell us, but they don&#8217;t even
need to tell us, that if the appropriate offer was made, we
should consider the offer,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But we know this and we
certainly agree.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three oil fields operated by Exxon
Mobil (XOM) Corp. in the Norwegian North Sea could be shut by a strike
if mediation with a union over pensions fails, cutting about
50,000 barrels of crude output a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Safe union will order as many as 154 offshore-platform
workers to walk out if the talks fail, paralyzing production at
the Ringhorne, Jotun and Balder fields, the group&#8217;s leader
Hilde-Marit Rysst said by phone. Though the date for a possible
walkout has been set at June 16, a strike could start earlier or
later, depending on the date of the mediation, which has yet to
be scheduled, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect Exxon to take the hint,&#8221; Rysst said. &#8220;We
expect this to be dealt with either before or during the
mediation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safe and another oil-worker union broke off talks over
pensions last week, raising the risk of a strike two years after
the same issue triggered the longest ever labor action by
platform employees and reduced output by western Europe&#8217;s
biggest oil and gas producer. The government used its power to
stop the strike as a lockout by oil companies threatened to shut
production entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three Exxon fields, including satellite Ringhorne East,
produced about 50,000 barrels of oil a day in 2013, according to
figures from the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon has a 100 percent stake in the Balder and Ringhorne
fields, while it holds 77.4 percent in Ringhorne East, which is
tied in to the Balder and Jotun installations. Exxon holds 45
percent in Jotun, where other partners include Dana Petroleum
Plc with 45 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safe is targeting Exxon specifically because the company
has yet to implement an early-pension plan for 31 employees that
are members of the union, it said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pension plan isn&#8217;t an issue that should be discussed in
wage talks, Exxon spokesman Knut Riple said by phone, echoing
the position held by the organization representing employers,
the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association. Exxon declined to say
whether there was room to meet Safe&#8217;s demands, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) agreed to buy
Argentine government bonds from oil producer Repsol SA (REP) for $2
billion, bringing its purchases of the Latin American country&#8217;s
securities to almost $5 billion in the past week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank will buy Argentine bonds due in 2015, 2017 and
2033, Madrid-based Repsol said yesterday in a regulatory filing.
The oil company agreed last week to sell new Argentine bonds due
in 2024 to JPMorgan for $2.8 billion. Those bonds have since
rallied 1.7 cents on the dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. bank is facilitating Repsol&#8217;s efforts to
reduce ties with the Argentine government, which nationalized
its 51 percent stake in local oil producer YPF SA in April 2012.
Under an agreement reached with the government earlier this
year, Repsol received bonds last week with a face value of $5.32
billion as compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has now bought almost all of that. The New York-based bank, which has already sold some of the Argentine bonds
received from the first purchase, is wagering that the remaining
holdings will gain in value, a person with direct knowledge of
the bank&#8217;s strategy said earlier this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veronica Navarro Espinosa, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argentina&#8217;s bonds, rated seven levels below investment
grade, have soared 46 percent in the past year, the most in
emerging markets, as the country took steps to repair ties with
international investors, including Repsol and the International
Monetary Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Riskiest Debt &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country&#8217;s debt is still considered risky, with the cost
of five-year protection in the credit-default swaps market at
1,567 basis points, according to CMA, the highest in the world.
The country hasn&#8217;t sold bonds directly to international markets
since a $95 billion default in 2001, and it&#8217;s locked in a
dispute with some creditors in a case now before the U.S.
Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction disclosed yesterday is expected to be
completed by May 16, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale included all of Repsol&#8217;s Argentine securities due
in 2017 and 2033 and all except $117 million of those due in
2015, known as Bodens, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boden bonds maturing 2015 gained 0.20 cent to 97.65 cents
on the dollar at 9:31 a.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repsol previously said it had $500 million of the 2017
securities, $1.25 billion of the 2033 bonds and $317 million of
the 2015 debt. All the securities are governed by Argentine law. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delek Group Ltd. (DLEKG), the Israeli
conglomerate with interests from energy to insurance, picked
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. to set up a company
to hold its energy activities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks will also manage the new unit&#8217;s listing abroad,
Itay Gore, a spokesman for the Netanya-based Delek, confirmed. A
time frame hasn&#8217;t been set for the spinoff or the share sale,
which will probably be in London, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delek&#8217;s structural change, announced in December, will
enable a larger and more varied group of investors to access the
company&#8217;s activities, Asaf Bartfeld, the group&#8217;s chief executive
officer, said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delek shares have advanced more than 50 percent in the past
12 months, making them the best performers on the TA-25
benchmark index. The company has been selling non-energy assets
to focus on its oil and gas business, and the offshore Tamar
natural gas field, in which it holds stakes via units, started
production in March last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a rough ride in front of the
U.K. Parliament&#8217;s Business Committee yesterday, Pfizer Inc. (PFE)
Chief Executive Officer Ian Read got gentler treatment from its
science and technology panel today over his plan to take over
AstraZeneca Plc. (AZN) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a smaller audience for the hearing in London,
with empty seats compared with the standing-room-only session
the previous day. It was still a larger one than the committee
chairman, Andrew Miller, was used to. &#8220;A lot of people are
interested,&#8221; he commented, looking around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the questioning focused on how a merged company
would look. Read said it would &#8220;enable us to be competitive.&#8221;
Testifying separately later for AstraZeneca, CEO Pascal Soriot
argued it was &#8220;a little bit more complicated than putting two
pieces of paper together.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While neither committee has any formal influence over a
possible takeover, both show how much Pfizer is operating in an
atmosphere of anxiety about its offer of more than $100 billion,
which AstraZeneca has rebuffed. With European and local
elections next week, the bid has been pushed to the center of
British political debate and dominated Prime Minister David Cameron&#8217;s questions session in the House of Commons today for
the second week running. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was little fresh argument today from either side.
Read said there was &#8220;no truth&#8221; in yesterday&#8217;s suggestion from
AstraZeneca that a merger would delay the development of life-saving drugs. Such work would be &#8220;ring-fenced,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Lose Momentum&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soriot replied that mergers cause anxiety, with scientists
&#8220;not sure if their job will exist tomorrow.&#8221; In such a
situation, he said, &#8220;you can quickly lose momentum.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim Dowd, a lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party,
which has opposed the takeover, again raised Pfizer&#8217;s record in
Sweden, where it closed a research center after a takeover.
&#8220;Why do people say your word&#8217;s not to be trusted?&#8221; he asked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People who talk to me don&#8217;t say my word&#8217;s not to be
trusted,&#8221; Read replied. &#8220;I&#8217;d like people to tell me a
commitment Pfizer hasn&#8217;t met.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soriot was questioned by Miller about why a merger would be
more disruptive than his own plan to move research from
Manchester, in England&#8217;s northwest, to Cambridge in the east.
Mene Pangalos, AstraZeneca&#8217;s vice president in charge of
development and a former Pfizer executive, said the two
companies had entirely different research structures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soriot declined to say whether the government should
intervene to block the takeover. &#8220;I&#8217;m a biologist, I just try
to do my job,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not a policy maker.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last to appear before the panel was Science Minister David Willetts, who insisted he was optimistic about the future,
whatever the outcome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sandwich Success &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked about Pfizer&#8217;s 2011 decision to close its Sandwich
plant in southeast England, he said it had worked out well
thanks to government intervention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There was a nightmare scenario where that would end up as
an empty building, with a padlock swinging in the wind,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve ended up instead with a discovery park with 40
tenants.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Willetts argued that while the government was &#8220;pressing
very hard&#8221; for Pfizer commitments, there was no need for
&#8220;national pessimism&#8221; because Britain was known as a great
place for science. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;d be idiotic if you weren&#8217;t doing research and
development in the U.K. -- it&#8217;s a great place,&#8221; Willetts told
the committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re all proud,&#8221; Tory lawmaker Sarah Newton replied. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chief Executive Officer
Ian Read fought back against accusations that his bid for
AstraZeneca Plc would harm patients and damage science in the
U.K. as he faced Parliament for a second day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca has resisted the 60.4-billion-pound ($101.9
billion) offer, and said yesterday that the disruption of a
buyout could jeopardize its pipeline of experimental drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s no truth that products of a critical nature would
be delayed getting to patients,&#8221; Read told the Science and
Technology Committee. &#8220;If anything, we would accelerate those
products.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s proposed takeover is facing skepticism from U.K.
lawmakers concerned by possible job cuts and the company&#8217;s
unwillingness to commit to preserving AstraZeneca&#8217;s workforce.
Pfizer said it would maintain 20 percent of its global research
and development employees in the U.K. for five years, without
specifying the number of jobs. Read said the merger would result
in job cuts and a reduction in total RD spending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I suspect the combined research budget will go down,&#8221;
Read said. &#8220;I suspect there will be less scientists than the
natural arithmetic combination of the two.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combined company would be more efficient and more
productive, and reflects the changing shape of the industry as
governments pressure drug companies to reduce costs, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil Search Ltd. (OSH), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s
partner in a $19 billion liquefied natural gas export project in
Papua New Guinea, expects shipments to Asia to start shortly
with the initial cargoes sold on the spot market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process to load the first LNG tanker has begun, with a
decision on when the ship will leave to be made over the next
few days, Managing Director Peter Botten said today by phone
from Port Moresby, the Pacific nation&#8217;s capital. The first gas
is expected to go to Tokyo Electric Power Co., he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The project is a platform for a significant corporate
transformation for Oil Search,&#8221; he said. On the timing for the
first ship to leave PNG, &#8220;we&#8217;re being cautious about the date
but at the end of the day it will take place shortly,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gas project in Papua New Guinea will allow Oil Search
to fund expansion opportunities and pay higher dividends, the
Port Moresby-based company has said. Seven other LNG ventures
are going ahead in neighboring Australia to meet Asian demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, whose Australian project started producing LNG last
month and ahead of schedule, expects the Papua New Guinea
development to spur more foreign investment in the country,
Peter Graham, Exxon Mobil PNG Ltd.&#8217;s managing director, said
today in an e-mailed copy of a speech he gave in the Pacific
nation. The departure of the first LNG vessel, the Spirit of
Hela, is just days away, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first series of LNG cargoes from the project will be
sold at spot prices, with the development progressively moving
into contract deliveries, Oil Search&#8217;s Botten said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spot Pricing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Spot pricing at the moment is pretty healthy,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;That could change over the coming months, but we are seeing
good pricing achievable at spot.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Northeast Asia spot LNG was at $14.15 per million British
thermal units in the week ended May 5, the New York-based Energy
Intelligence Group said on the website of its World Gas
Intelligence publication. Prices earlier this year had more than
doubled since the Fukushima accident of March 2011, as Japanese
utilities rely on other fuel such as LNG to help replace lost
nuclear power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil Search is also moving ahead with drilling in Iraq&#8217;s
Kurdistan region at its Taza oil project, which has attracted
interest from potential partners, Botten said. The company
expects to complete its evaluation of the size of that resource,
in which it has a 60 percent holding, by the second half of next
year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There has been strong interest from a number of parties
to potentially join us in Taza,&#8221; Botten said. &#8220;Our view is we
would like to understand what the resource base is before
looking potentially at crystallizing any further value.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commodities as an asset class remain
appealing as the global economic recovery extends into 2015,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank raised its 12-month allocation for commodities to
neutral from underweight, analysts led by Jeffrey Currie and
Damien Courvalin wrote in a report dated yesterday. They
increased their three and six-month price forecasts for nickel
and rolled the 12-month predictions for aluminum and zinc
forward to higher levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raw materials as measured by total returns on the Standard
 Poor&#8217;s GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index added 4.2 percent this
year as global equities increased 2.3 percent and the Bloomberg
U.S. Treasury Bond Index rose 2.7 percent. Citigroup Inc. said
last month it was time to take commodities seriously again to
diversify investment portfolios after they beat equities and
bonds in the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Commodities have been caught in a tug of war,&#8221; the
Goldman Sachs analysts wrote. &#8220;As the global business cycle
shifts into an expansion phase over the next few years we expect
commodity performance to improve.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total returns for the enhanced index may be zero percent
over the next three months and decline 2.2 percent over 12
months, according to the bank. It expected the gauge to drop 4
percent over 12 months in an April 13 note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Asset Market &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to believe the commodity super cycle is
over,&#8221; Aakash Doshi, a Citigroup Global Markets vice president
in New York, said in a telephone interview on March 28. &#8220;That
doesn&#8217;t mean that there is going to be an absence of seasonality
and cyclical turns in the asset market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Barclays survey published in an April 4 report showed 54
percent of investors planned to boost their stake in commodities
in the next 12 months versus 27 percent who did in the preceding
year, according to analysts led by Kevin Norrish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been little clear directionality in commodity
markets over the past month, the Goldman analysts said. Tension
in Ukraine has supported corn and wheat even as global
agriculture stockpiles remain elevated, while weakness in the
Chinese property sector weighed on copper amid a seasonal pick-up in demand, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As growth accelerates, supply and demand fundamentals in
base metals are expected to tighten by the middle of next year,
the bank said. It raised its six-month forecast for nickel to
$22,000 a metric ton from $20,000 amid supply disruptions at
Vale SA&#8217;s New Caledonia plant, Indonesia&#8217;s ban on ore exports
and tension between Russia and Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman kept its 12-month nickel target at $16,000 as
Chinese producers will probably increase blast furnace nickel
pig iron capacity in Indonesia over the next one to two years.
Nickel for three-month delivery on the London Metal Exchange has
climbed 49 percent this year to $20,728 by 4:33 p.m. in
Singapore today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nickel&#8217;s roller-coaster ride this
year isn&#8217;t over, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which
expects the highest prices in two years to prompt expanded
capacity for smelting and discourage purchases by steelmakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices plunged 11 percent the previous two days, and
probably will fall 15 percent further in 12 months to $16,000 a
metric ton, Goldman forecasts. Nickel had surged this year
following a January ban on ore exports by Indonesia, the world&#8217;s
largest supplier from mines, and as threats increased for
economic sanctions against Russia, home to OAO GMK Norilsk
Nickel, the biggest producer of refined metal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, exchange-tracked inventories rose, prompting some
investors to judge the rally was exaggerated. China will
&#8220;aggressively&#8221; build blast-furnace capacity in Indonesia to
produce nickel pig iron, a low-grade alternative to refined
metal, Goldman said in a report dated May 14 and e-mailed
yesterday. Waning demand for the metal from makers of stainless
steel is another &#8220;downside risk&#8221; for prices, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;High prices will incentivize a substantial build out of
blast furnace and other smelting capacity in Indonesia,&#8221;
Goldman analysts Roger Yuan, Max Layton and Jeffrey Currie wrote
in the report. &#8220;Demand destruction could also help to balance
the global market in 2015 if the ban is not relaxed during the
smelter construction period.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nickel for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange rose 0.7 percent to $18,888 at 12:36 p.m. in Tokyo,
trimming its weekly drop to 5.1 percent, the biggest such loss
since February 2013. On May 13, the price reached $21,625, the
highest since February 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Processing Plants &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With construction taking about 12 months, the effects of
&#8220;de-bottlenecking&#8221; will be seen in mid-2015, the Goldman
analysts wrote. Nine nickel-processing plants may be completed
this year in Indonesia, and as many as 40 more by 2017,
according to the Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry. The
country imposed the ban in a bid to transform the mineral
industry away from raw-ore sales into higher-value processed
products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year&#8217;s rally could shrink profits in the stainless
steel industry, encouraging substitution, Goldman said. A 5
percent substitution would be equal to a reduction of as much as
150,000 tons of nickel demand, the bank estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Goldman expects prices to fall in 12 months, the bank
predicts a gain to $22,000 in three months and six months, as
the risk from demand destruction is in the &#8220;medium term,&#8221; the
analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Steel Products &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stainless-steel products are made with certain
specifications that can&#8217;t be altered, making it impossible to
replace nickel in the mix, Jason Martineau, the national sales
manager at Penn Stainless Steel Products Inc. in Quakertown,
Pennsylvania, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nickel&#8217;s open interest, or the number of contracts yet to
be closed, liquidated or delivered, has surged for five straight
months to a record 319,422. The jump is &#8220;reflecting the extreme
nature of change that the nickel market is facing with the
Indonesian export ban,&#8221; David Wilson, an analyst at Citigroup
Inc. in London, said in a telephone interview this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices may top $30,000 in 2015, according to Citigroup,
which last year correctly predicted that Indonesia would
implement the export ban. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;China Demand &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese stainless-steel demand is weak and few expect a
recovery in prices until next year, Credit Suisse Group AG said
in a report today. Most producers lost money in the first
quarter, according to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price gap between locally produced nickel in China and
LME futures narrowed this week, indicating that further
increases in imports of the refined metal are likely, according
to Beijing Antaike Information Development Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as the U.S. and Europe threatened more sanctions after
Vladimir Putin&#8217;s incursion into Ukraine and the international
condemnation that followed, it didn&#8217;t put a dent in Russia&#8217;s
exports of raw materials. The country exported 51,600 tons of
nickel in the first quarter, similar to the same period last
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plunge &#8220;illustrates the extent to which speculation
was apparently responsible for driving up the nickel price,&#8221;
Daniel Briesemann, an analyst at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt,
said in a report. &#8220;The correction process could well continue
for the time being.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper in London was little changed at $6,878 a ton,
heading for a second weekly gain. The contract for delivery in
July on the Comex in New York was little changed at $3.146 a
pound. In Shanghai, futures for delivery in August slid 0.6
percent to 48,390 yuan ($7,765) a ton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the LME, zinc climbed, while lead and tin dropped.
Aluminum was little changed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sony Corp. (6758)&#8217;s PlayStation 4 beat Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s Xbox One to first place in U.S. console sales, extending its lead for a fourth month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;PlayStation 4 was the No. 1 platform for hardware sales in April,&#8221; followed by Xbox One, Liam Callahan, an analyst at NPD Group Inc., said in an e-mailed statement today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Customers continue to snap up the newest generation of consoles, according to Port Washington, New York-based NPD. The gain in hardware revenue in April boosted overall U.S. video-game sales even as software sales dropped. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft will start selling a cheaper version of its Xbox One in June, shaving $100 off the $499 price to match Sony&#8217;s PlayStation 4, as it tries to claw back the Tokyo-based company&#8217;s lead. For the Sony, the success of the PS4 is a bright spot for the company that forecast its sixth annual loss in seven years this week as it contends with slumping sales of TVs and PCs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. hardware sales in April rose 76 percent to $192.8 million from a year earlier, while software excluding titles for PCs fell 10 percent to $227.9 million, as consumers held out for games for the new machines. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft sold 115,000 Xbox One machines in April, the Redmond, Washington-based company said in a separate e-mail. Sony didn&#8217;t release its monthly sales figure, saying in an e-mail only that it has sold &#8220;over 7 million&#8221; PlayStation 4s worldwide, reiterating a statement last month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks are issuing lower-ranked bonds
and preferred securities in the U.S. at the fastest pace since
the financial crisis, capitalizing on yield-starved investors to
satisfy regulatory requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial institutions including JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and
Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) are meeting demands to raise more capital by
selling $31.8 billion of subordinated debt and preferred shares
this year, with $22.7 billion in March and April alone,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The pace of issuance is
the fastest since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders need to sell the notes in part because new
regulations designed to make banks safer have rendered a
previously popular form -- called trust-preferred securities --
useless for capital purposes, ruling it must be replaced by
2016. Now that banks&#8217; creditworthiness has improved, investors
are snapping up the offerings because they can pay more than one
percentage point of extra interest over senior bonds that rank
higher for repayment in a bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;From an investor perspective, it is incremental yield in
a historically low-rate environment,&#8221; Pri de Silva, an analyst
at New York-based CreditSights Inc., said in a May 6 telephone
interview. &#8220;The credit profiles of banks are a lot better now
than they were in the pre-crisis days.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Losing Funding &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo in April sold $2 billion of 5.9 percent
perpetual securities after initially marketing the debt with a
higher coupon of as much as 6.125 percent, Bloomberg data show.
The notes offered interest payments of more than two percentage
points above the 3 percent senior notes due in 2021 that the San
Francisco-based bank sold in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subordinated debt and preferred shares are replacing trust-preferred securities, known as TruPS, which were popular before
the crisis in part because interest payments were tax-deductible. About $149 billion were outstanding at the end of
2008, according to Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks could also count TruPS as Tier 1 capital because they
allowed issuers to stop paying interest and were supposed to act
as a buffer against potential losses. Lenders proved reluctant
to suspend payments during the crisis because those that did
risked losing other funding on concerns about their solvency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Regulations &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators, implementing the international Basel III
accord and U.S. Dodd-Frank Act, have ruled that banks with
assets of more than $15 billion can&#8217;t count TruPS as Tier 1
capital anymore. They have until 2016 to replace the securities,
and common equity and preferred shares are the main types that
count as Tier 1 capital. Subordinated debt counts as Tier 2
capital, which banks are also required to maintain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attention in Europe has focused on additional Tier 1 notes,
a similar-level as preferred shares in the U.S., where issuance
has soared this year to $25.7 billion, Bloomberg data show. A
total of $36.5 billion of the debt is outstanding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Under the new rules, there is a space in the capital
structure that could be filled with subordinated debt, common
equity or preferred equity,&#8221; de Silva said. The latter two
&#8220;are generally more expensive, so in order to meet that capital
need cost-effectively, they have been issuing subordinated
debt.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bank Safety &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issuance comes as confidence in bank creditworthiness
improves. The average cost to protect against defaults by the
six-largest U.S. banks fell this week to the lowest level since
the end of 2007, according to credit-default swaps prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts, a gauge of the banks&#8217;
risk, are used to hedge against losses or to speculate on the
ability of companies to meet their obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Without question, the banks are more stable,&#8221; said
Arthur Tetyevsky, a credit strategist at Imperial Capital LLC.
&#8220;Even under the most extreme economic scenarios, banks should
have enough capital to withstand a shock, so investors are more
comfortable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While subordinated debtholders may not be bailed out in
another crisis, &#8220;people are not particularly worried about that
right now,&#8221; said Kathleen Shanley, a New York-based analyst at
Gimme Credit LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emboldened by improving bank creditworthiness, investors
are eager to buy their higher-yielding debt after more than five
years of near-zero interest rates from the Fed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is this year&#8217;s biggest bank issuer of the
securities, selling $3.9 billion, according to Bloomberg data.
The New York-based lender sold $1 billion of perpetual
securities on March 5 that pay interest of 6.125 percent for a
decade and then switch to a floating-rate coupon. The notes were
initially marketed with a coupon of as much as 6.25 percent,
according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They climbed about 0.1 cent to 101.3 cents on the dollar at
9:18 a.m. in New York, rising for the sixth consecutive day,
Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The way the credit markets have been running, almost
everything that comes is well oversubscribed,&#8221; said Thomas Urano, a money manager at Austin, Texas-based Sage Advisory
Services Ltd., which oversees about $10 billion. &#8220;The trends
have been favorable for banks to be able to place it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.K. lawmakers who questioned Pfizer
Inc. executives yesterday have written to the government urging
it to hold the company to account for promises over the future
of AstraZeneca Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parliament&#8217;s Science and Technology Committee said its
members want Pfizer to &#8220;voluntarily strengthen and lengthen&#8221;
its promises to keep jobs and research and development in
Britain if the $101 billion proposed takeover goes ahead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Science is a long-term enterprise and it requires a
genuinely long-term commitment,&#8221; committee chairman, Andrew
Miller, said in a May 14 letter to Science Minister David Willetts made public today. &#8220;We are not yet convinced that 
this is what Pfizer is offering. The government must be willing
-- and, crucially, able -- to hold Pfizer to account if
necessary.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel questioned Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read and AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot along with other
executives and Willets. They focused on Pfizer&#8217;s pledges on RD
and jobs in Britain and the implications for the two companies&#8217;
drug pipelines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five-year limit on Pfizer&#8217;s commitments is not long
enough as the pharmaceutical industry &#8220;measures progress by
decades rather than years,&#8221; Miller said in the letter. He said
the committee wanted more detail on the promises as there could
still be cuts in research by a combined company in which
AstraZeneca would be the junior partner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Any threat to AstraZeneca&#8217;s research capacity must, to an
extent, be considered a threat to U.K. science,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Further, longer-term guarantees need to be obtained before we
can be confident of Pfizer&#8217;s commitment to the U.K.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter also questioned the wisdom of creating such a
large company when the trend in pharmaceuticals is for
&#8220;smaller, more agile operations.&#8221; The merger of the two
companies would also cause disruption and uncertainty in both
companies, it said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s rupee rose to the highest
level in more than nine months on optimism that federal election
results to be announced tomorrow will show a clear winner,
allowing for stable economic growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies
probably won 249 to 340 parliamentary seats, according to six
exit polls, with 272 needed for a majority. The ruling Congress
and its partners got between 70 and 148 places, the surveys
showed. The rupee&#8217;s rise was limited on speculation the Reserve
Bank of India bought dollars, according to three traders who
asked not to be identified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The currency gained 0.2 percent from May 13 to 59.55 per
dollar as of 10:07 a.m. in Mumbai, according to prices from
local banks compiled by Bloomberg. It rose as much as 0.4
percent to 59.46, the strongest level since July 29. Local bond
and currency markets were shut yesterday for a holiday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rupee advanced &#8220;on the back of exit polls expectations
that the BJP and its allies will win elections with a
majority,&#8221; analysts at Angel Broking Ltd. including Anish Vyas
in Mumbai wrote in a research report today. &#8220;However, sharp
upside in the currency will be capped or reversal can be seen
due to dollar demand from oil importers and central bank.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s Commerce Ministry will release wholesale-price
inflation data later today. The index probably rose 5.7 percent
in April from a year earlier, according to a Bloomberg survey.
The consumer-price index accelerated to 8.59 percent from 8.31
percent in March, official data showed May 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One-month implied volatility in the rupee, a gauge of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options,
declined 21 basis points, or 0.21 percentage point, to 10.18
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three-month offshore non-deliverable forwards were little
changed at 60.47 per dollar, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) isn&#8217;t responsible
for alligators overrunning a rural dump site it owns in
Mississippi, the state supreme court ruled, because the global
oil explorer can&#8217;t control wild animals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family that felt menaced by the scaly reptiles
infesting a plot next door to their 35-acre property couldn&#8217;t
prove where the gators originated, Justice Ann Lamar wrote for
the majority in the court&#8217;s 5-4 decision yesterday. The family
had alleged the alligators were brought to the site from
Louisiana by a previous owner who later sold the land to Exxon,
according to the court document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mississippi Supreme Court threw out the family&#8217;s 2008
lawsuit, citing a 1950 ruling that no one can be held
responsible for animals &#8220;in a state of nature.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court ruled the alligators -- which numbered 84 when
the state&#8217;s wildlife agency counted them in 2007 -- were wild
animals and, as such, not under Exxon&#8217;s control. Even if Exxon
had wanted to cull the congregation, it would have been
prevented by state law that designates alligators as a protected
species, making it illegal to hunt or disturb them, according to
the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision reinstates a lower-court ruling in Exxon&#8217;s
favor that had been reversed on appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state supreme court didn&#8217;t say what sort of waste was
disposed of at the dump. Exxon was the sole customer of the site
from 1984 to 2001, when the Irving, Texas-based company
purchased it from Rogers Rental  Landfill Company, according to
the court document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Horse Incident &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom and Consandra Christmas bought the adjacent tract in
2003, even after their real estate agent warned them his horse
had been injured in a suspected alligator encounter, the court
said in yesterday&#8217;s decision. The couple said they didn&#8217;t
realize the Exxon land was crawling with gators until 2007, when
Tom Christmas went to retrieve a dog that had wandered onto the
site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christmas testified that he lost two calves and one dog and
suspected that alligators were responsible, according to the
opinion. He said he was afraid to fish in the ponds due to the
alligators. The couple asked for monetary damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four justices dissented from the ruling, citing testimony
that Exxon assigned staff to feed the 6- to-10 foot reptiles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dick Keil, an Exxon spokesman, said the company hadn&#8217;t yet
had an opportunity to peruse the ruling and declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Christmas v. Exxon Mobil, 2011-CT-01311-SCT,
Supreme Court of Mississippi. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Jersey awarded JPMorgan Chase (JPM) 
Co. and RBC Capital Markets $300 million of tax credits over 10
years after the companies pledged to create 1,900 new jobs in
Jersey City, across the Hudson River from Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Economic Development Authority approved annual grants
of $22.5 million for JPMorgan and $7.9 million for RBC at a
meeting today in Trenton. JPMorgan&#8217;s project would add 1,000
jobs and retain 2,612, while RBC&#8217;s would add 900 positions,
according to their applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, in its application, said it has been evaluating
the location of its expanding regional technology and operations
hub. Its options included consolidating multiple New Jersey
facilities into one in Jersey City or relocating most of those
operations to lower-cost locations in Delaware and Ohio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBC leases space in five locations in Manhattan with about
2,700 employees. With leases expiring at One Liberty Plaza and
the World Financial Center, it began evaluating options,
including renovating and expanding space in Jersey City and in
Minnesota. While the one-time cost of expanding would be greater
in Minnesota, annual operating costs would be higher in New
Jersey, according to its application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Financial services up in the Jersey City and Hoboken area
has always been a sweet spot for us,&#8221; Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno, the state&#8217;s top economic-development official, said in
an interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s a perfect story: As New York&#8217;s financial-services sector looks for other places to go, they want to look
some place convenient to New York.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;High Earners &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The median salary of $120,000 for the covered positions at
JPMorgan, listed on its application, is more than triple New
Jersey&#8217;s median of $35,928, according to the Census Bureau. RBC
listed the median salary at $126,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial positions have become increasingly coveted as
states look to poach jobs from neighbors and even far-away
locales. Texas Governor Rick Perry, a Republican, today said his
state is actively recruiting New York companies to move there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This would not impact the location of our U.S.
headquarters, which remains in lower Manhattan and will continue
to house the majority of our employees,&#8221; RBC spokeswoman Elisa
Barsotti said in a statement. &#8220;We are exploring an upgraded
location to relocate our data center from our ancillary location
at One Liberty Plaza and support function positions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two Centuries &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan project is expected to bring a net benefit to
the state of $1.1 billion over the life of the package and will
enlarge the company&#8217;s space in Jersey City to more than 1
million square feet, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve invested in this community for nearly two
centuries, and this agreement only deepens that commitment for
the long term,&#8221; JPMorgan Chief Operating Officer Matt Zames
said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guadagno, a Republican who serves as the state&#8217;s economic
development chief, said New Jersey has aggressively courted
financial-services jobs with a message to decision makers to
keep their New York address and move support jobs to New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jersey City, a community of 254,000 one stop from Manhattan
by train, has worked in the past decade to re-craft itself as
Wall Street West. Mayor Steven Fulop, 37, worked at Citigroup
Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., leaving after the 2001 World
Trade Center attacks to join the U.S. Marine Corps and serve in
Iraq. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lifting State &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Jersey City is leading the state economy in terms of job
creation and is the driving force in lifting New Jersey out of
the recession,&#8221; he said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Jersey has struggled to shake off the lingering effects
of the U.S. recession that ended in 2009. Governor Chris Christie&#8217;s administration said yesterday that the jobless rate
slid to 6.9 percent in April, the first time it has dipped under
7 percent since November 2008. The national level was 6.3
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state has regained 125,700 jobs, or about half of those
lost during the slump. Nancy Mantell, director of the Rutgers
Economic Advisory Service, said this month that the state isn&#8217;t
expected to recover all of them until 2018. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sales of corporate bonds in the U.S.
are capping the busiest week this month as companies seized on
borrowing costs that dropped to the lowest in a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the biggest U.S. drugmaker, issued $4.5
billion and Wolfsburg, Germany-based Volkswagen AG raised $3.5
billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Offerings of
about $41 billion were the most since $47.3 billion in the five
days ended April 25 and compare with a weekly average of $29.1
billion over the past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issuance rose as yields decreased amid signs U.S. economic
growth is faltering. Industrial production unexpectedly declined
in April and consumer confidence fell in May from a nine-month
high. David Tepper, founder of $20 billion hedge-fund firm
Appaloosa Management LP, said he&#8217;s nervous about markets as the
economy isn&#8217;t growing fast enough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The rates environment has changed a bit from where it was
a couple weeks ago, and that has provided a lot of companies the
opportunity to come to market,&#8221; Jody Lurie, a corporate credit
analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia, said in
a telephone interview. &#8220;It has let them access the debt market
more attractively.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to own corporate bonds
rather than government debentures widened by 1 basis point this
week to 170 basis points yesterday, up from an almost seven-year
low of 167 basis points on April 22, according to the Bank of
America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate  High Yield Index. Yields
fell to 3.62 percent, the least since May 2013 and down from 3.7
percent on May 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pfizer, Volkswagen &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s sale included $1.5 billion of 2.1 percent, five-year notes that yielded 48 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. Proceeds from the
deal, its first since last May, will be used by the New York-based company to repay debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volkswagen, Europe&#8217;s largest automaker, issued debt in five
parts including $1.45 billion of 1.25 percent, three-year notes
with a relative yield of 47 basis points, Bloomberg data show.
The sale was its biggest dollar-denominated offering ever, the
data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of investment-grade debentures rose to $32.2 billion
from $21.7 billion last week and compared with a weekly average
of $22.2 billion over the past 12 months, Bloomberg data show.
Offerings of speculative-grade bonds fell to $9 billion, from
$10.9 billion last week and compared with a weekly average of
$6.8 billion over the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-risk, high-yield bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service and lower than BBB- at Standard  Poor&#8217;s. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) has expanded
its workforce outside New York and San Francisco mainly to cut
costs. Its office in Irving, Texas, also aims to boost revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The office, among the firm&#8217;s largest in the nation with
about 650 employees, hosted the investment bank&#8217;s annual
shareholders meeting today with Texas Governor Rick Perry giving
a speech. In addition to typical back-office functions such as
accounting and information security, the location houses a
commercial real estate lending group and is the headquarters for
the realty-management division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That group is the descendant of a joint venture named
Archon that Goldman Sachs set up in 1991 with J.E. Robert Cos.
to buy distressed assets from the Resolution Trust Corp. after
the savings and loan crisis. The division, led by partner Tom Dowling, now sources deals and manages real estate investments
for the bank&#8217;s special-situations group and property funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the division doesn&#8217;t have its own balance sheet, and
instead aids deals by the firm&#8217;s revenue-producing units, it
deployed about $7 billion in loans and investments last year,
according to a person with knowledge of its operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs acquired all of Archon in 2000, and the
business operated as an independent subsidiary for years. It
purchased more than $1 billion of property in the U.S. in some
years, mostly for the bank&#8217;s Whitehall real estate funds,
according to a former employee. That activity dropped as the
U.S. property market plunged, and the last Whitehall fund was
raised in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dallas, Bangalore &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irving, in Dallas&#8217;s shadow with a population of about
225,500, is home to businesses including Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the
world&#8217;s second most valuable company, and CEC Entertainment
Inc., owner of the Chuck E. Cheese pizza chain. Goldman Sachs
also has an office in Dallas with several private wealth
management advisers and one investment banker, managing director
Peter Brundage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 59, said in
November that a quarter of the firm&#8217;s employees were located
near Dallas, Salt Lake City, Singapore and Bangalore, India.
That&#8217;s increased from 10 percent in 2007 as the bank looks to
cut expenses, he said. The firm hosted its annual meeting in
Salt Lake City last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pay Approved &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholders elected all of the firm&#8217;s nominees for the
board of directors, General Counsel Greg Palm said today,
announcing a preliminary count of the votes. About 83 percent of
votes approved the bank&#8217;s executive pay plan, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Morgan Stanley&#8217;s annual meeting earlier this week,
today&#8217;s gathering featured no questions from shareholders and
lasted fewer than 40 minutes. About half the meeting was taken
up by Perry&#8217;s speech, which extolled the benefits of companies
moving to Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein thanked Perry for his support of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
businesses in the state. The CEO didn&#8217;t accept a shareholder&#8217;s
invitation to move the firm&#8217;s headquarters to Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think there&#8217;s a lot of compelling reasons to move to
Texas and a lot of compelling reasons to stay where we are,
including Newton&#8217;s first law of inertia,&#8221; Blankfein said in an
interview after the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the meeting, Goldman Sachs is trying to cement ties
to the area. Dina H. Powell, a partner who leads the firm&#8217;s
charitable efforts, announced this week the start of the bank&#8217;s
10,000 Small Businesses education and funding program in Dallas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Central Bank is unlikely
to begin large-scale asset purchases to stimulate inflation and
such a plan would have limited effect as nations&#8217; borrowing
costs are already low, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We doubt that a large-scale asset-purchase program would
have a meaningful impact on yields,&#8221; Goldman Sachs analysts,
including London-based chief European economist Huw Pill, wrote
in a client report. &#8220;With rates at such low levels, it is
unclear how attractive euro-area government yields will look for
investors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ECB President Mario Draghi said on May 8 that the Governing
Council was ready to act at its meeting next month to boost the
currency bloc&#8217;s economy. He had previously indicated stimulus
measures being considered included quantitative easing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a rally in the region&#8217;s sovereign bonds leaving
borrowing costs in the most-indebted nations near record lows,
&#8220;the likelihood of a large-scale asset-purchase program remains
small,&#8221; the Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in the report, dated
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on Spanish 10-year bonds was at 2.95 percent as
of 2:52 p.m. London time after falling to 2.83 percent
yesterday, the least since Bloomberg began collecting the data
in 1993. The rates on similar maturity Italian debt were at 3.05
percent, from a euro-era low of 2.89 percent yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer prices in the euro area rose an annualized 0.7
percent in April, below half the central bank&#8217;s goal of just
under 2 percent for a seventh month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C) and JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) were shortlisted to advise Slovakia on a 1 billion-euro
($1.4 billion) sale of the country&#8217;s largest phone company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government&#8217;s National Property Fund, which oversees
state-asset sales, will by the end of May pick one or both banks
to advise on the sale of a 49 percent stake in Slovak Telekom
AS, Miriam Ziakova, a spokeswoman for the fund, said by phone
today. The sale will be completed by the end of the year, she
said. Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) owns 51 percent of the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slovakia is selling assets to raise funds for cutting
public debt, which last year exceeded 55 percent of gross
domestic product. The Finance Ministry estimates that Slovak
Telekom&#8217;s sale will bring in the equivalent of 1.3 percent of
GDP next year, according to its budgetary framework for 2015
posted on the government&#8217;s website last month. The ministry
forecasts 2015 nominal GDP at 77.8 billion euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government prefers to sell its shares in an initial
public offering, according to a memorandum between the state and
Deutsche Telekom. The German operator, which bought its stake in
the former fixed-line monopoly in 2000, has a pre-purchase right
if a direct sale to an investor is chosen, the memorandum says. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rupee surged more than 2 percent
this week, the biggest rally since September, on optimism Indian
election results today will show a clear winner capable of
reviving the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies led in
263 seats and the ruling Congress-led bloc in 75 in the world&#8217;s
biggest-ever vote, according to NDTV television channel&#8217;s tally
of count as of 9:30 a.m. in Mumbai. There are 543 parliamentary
seats up for grabs, with 272 needed for a majority. The SP BSE
Sensex (SENSEX) of local shares jumped 5.2 percent, the most in five
years, to a record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Counting shows the BJP is poised for a majority win,
which has boosted the rupee,&#8221; said Manis Thanawala, a director
at Greenback Forex Services Pvt. in Mumbai. &#8220;The sharp surge in
local stock indexes is also a positive for the rupee.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The currency gained 2.3 percent this week and 1 percent
today to 58.685 per dollar as of 10:21 a.m. in Mumbai, according
to prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. That&#8217;s the
biggest five-day advance since Sept. 13. It touched 58.62, the
strongest level since June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Reserve Bank of India intervened in the foreign-exchange market to curb currency volatility, limiting gains in
the rupee, according to four dealers who declined to be
identified because the information isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One-month implied volatility in the rupee, a gauge of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options, fell
108 basis points, or 1.08 percentage point, today and 227 basis
points from May 9 to 8.94 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three-month offshore non-deliverable forwards rose 1.9
percent this week and 0.8 percent today to 59.67 per dollar,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Forwards are agreements
to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable
contracts are settled in dollars. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s 10-year bonds jumped the most
in almost a month as the main opposition alliance looked set to
win enough seats to command a parliamentary majority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies were ahead in 281
of the 500 seats where results are available, more than the 272
needed for a majority, a tally by the local NDTV news channel
shows. Voting began April 7 and ended May 12. The rupee gained
past the 59-per dollar mark for the first time since July 2013
today. A stronger currency helps cool inflation as India imports
about 80 percent of its oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on the 8.83 percent notes due November 2023 slid
nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 8.70 percent as
of 10:10 a.m in Mumbai, prices from the central bank&#8217;s trading
system show. That was the biggest drop since April 17 and the
lowest level in three months. The yield has declined five basis
points this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The positive sentiment around the election results is
aiding gains in the bond market,&#8221; said Debendra Kumar Dash, a
fixed-income trader at DCB Bank Ltd. in Mumbai. &#8220;Investors hope
a stable government would show fiscal prudence and control
inflation, helping cap yields.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India plans to sell 200 billion rupees ($3.4 billion) of
bonds due from 2022 to 2043 today and the central bank will hold
a 14-day term repurchase auction for 610 billion rupees,
according to statements from the monetary authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One-year interest-rate swaps, derivative contracts used to
guard against swings in funding costs, dropped three basis
points to 8.49 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
contracts fell four basis points this week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) Chairman Leif Johansson got off the phone last night thinking Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s offer of 53.50 pounds a share for the second-largest U.K. drugmaker was its best and final offer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So Johansson was &#8220;surprised&#8221; to see Pfizer raise its bid to 55 pounds in a press release. The new offer of 69.4 billion pounds ($117 billion) may be a maneuver around AstraZeneca&#8217;s management, pitched publicly to pressure the company to enter formal negotiations. AstraZeneca rejected it today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Johansson wouldn&#8217;t say the surprise proposal was hostile, he said today in a telephone interview, &#8220;I certainly will not call it super-friendly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related: AstraZeneca Rejects Pfizer's $117 Billion Offer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s offer late yesterday, which the company said was final, is the latest salvo in a battle of wills between the companies. Pfizer has offered more cash and stock, although London-based AstraZeneca said it won&#8217;t talk until its concerns about regulatory risk and the future of the combined company are addressed. New York-based Pfizer would also need to increase its offer to at least 58.85 pounds before the board could recommend a deal to shareholders, Johansson said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;What the board would need to do is look at overall value, including the transaction risk, the execution risk, and we would try to put together a package, holistic view of what that value is,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Robert Hutton" date="May 19, 2014  9:41 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-19/u-k-labour-party-says-astrazeneca-right-to-reject-pfizer.html"><headline>U.K. Labour Party Says AstraZeneca Right to Reject Pfizer</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. opposition Labour Party&#8217;s
business spokesman, Chuka Umunna, took sides in the battle for
AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), saying the company&#8217;s board was right to reject
Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s increased takeover offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sign of how a possible future Labour government led by
Ed Miliband would be more willing to intervene in takeovers,
Umunna characterized Pfizer as principally interested in
&#8220;financial engineering&#8221; and cutting its tax bill, and said
this was a reason to block a takeover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca shares plunged the most in more than 16 years
today after the company dismissed as too low a 69.4 billion-pound ($117 billion) offer that New York-based Pfizer said was
final. A deal would create the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker. The
offer failed to account for the value of the U.K. company&#8217;s
pipeline of experimental medicines and presents risks for
shareholders, AstraZeneca said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is welcome the AstraZeneca board has remained resolute
and sought to act in the best long-term interests of the company
and its vital work in developing new life-saving drugs,&#8221; Umunna
said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;Pfizer has said today that it
will not seek to launch a hostile bid and must not renege on
this promise.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until May 16, Labour restricted itself to calling for an
examination of whether a takeover would be in the public
interest. Then, in an interview with Bloomberg Television,
Umunna said that if he became business secretary after the May
2015 election and a deal were still going through, he would look
for a way to block it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Government Stance &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vince Cable, who&#8217;s business secretary in the current
coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, said today the
government is keeping its options open on the Pfizer offer.
Prime Minister David Cameron said it was a matter for the
companies to resolve themselves and the government should be
neutral. The premier said last week he wants &#8220;further
assurances&#8221; from Pfizer that a deal wouldn&#8217;t hit jobs and

&lt;p&gt;Miliband said in 2011 Labour should distinguish between
&#8220;predator&#8221; businesses and &#8220;producers.&#8221; Umunna later tried to

or bad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France&#8217;s privacy watchdog said more
citizens are asking for help getting their personal information
removed from search engines such as those run by Google Inc. (GOOG) and
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), less than a week after the European Union&#8217;s top
court ruled on a &#8220;right to be forgotten&#8221; online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;France&#8217;s CNIL and Europe&#8217;s other privacy watchdogs will
discuss in a June meeting how they can enforce the ruling,
President Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin said today in a conference.
The EU&#8217;s top court last week said citizens may ask search-engine
owners to remove information and request that a court or data-protection authority step in if a company doesn&#8217;t comply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve already received complaints citing the court
decision,&#8221; Falque-Pierrotin said. &#8220;The idea that companies
like Google are too powerful to respect European rules -- we&#8217;ve
proven that idea wrong. It&#8217;s prompting citizen reactions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it&#8217;s too early to say how the court ruling will be
enforced, more users may ask CNIL to intervene, Falque-Pierrotin
said. Complaints relating to the &#8220;right to be forgotten&#8221; made
up about a third of the requests received last year, she said.
CNIL dealt with 5,640 complaints and 92,351 broader requests
last year, according to its annual report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CNIL has asked the French government to increase the
maximum amount it can fine for privacy violations, which
currently run from 150,000 euros ($206,000) to 300,000 euros for
repeated offenses, Falque-Pierrotin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past year, Google has faced privacy problems in
Germany and Italy. France&#8217;s CNIL has been among the region&#8217;s
more vocal authorities in getting international Internet players
to respect local and European privacy laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lead Role &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French watchdog took the lead role for EU authorities
debating measures directed at companies that violate privacy
laws. It fined Google 150,000 euros in January for failing to
give people enough details about how and why it uses their
personal data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Privacy regulators want to play a bigger role beyond
punitive intervention, she said. CNIL and other European
regulators are in talks with Google on a possible accord over
its privacy policy, with details to be announced &#8220;before
summer,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s rupee climbed to an 11-month
high, after last week&#8217;s 2.1 percent rally that was the world&#8217;s
best performance, as the nation&#8217;s clearest election results in
three decades boosted investor confidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narendra Modi&#8217;s Bharatiya Janata Party won 282 of 543
parliamentary seats, more than the 272 needed to form a
government, according to the Election Commission. The BJP has
garnered the nation&#8217;s first single-party majority since 1984 and
that&#8217;s boosting bets the new administration will pursue policies
to improve the economy without being constrained by coalition
politics, according to Deutsche Bank AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rupee rose &#8220;on the back of victory for the BJP with a
majority,&#8221; analysts at Angel Broking Ltd., including Anish Vyas
in Mumbai, wrote in a research report today. Any &#8220;sharp upside
in the currency will be capped due to dollar demand from oil
importers and the central bank,&#8221; they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The currency rose 0.5 percent today to 58.4975 per dollar
as of 9:35 a.m. in Mumbai, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 58.4750 earlier, the strongest
level since June 18. Last week&#8217;s gain in the rupee was the
biggest five-day advance since September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
the exchange rate used to price options, fell 31 basis points,
or 0.31 percentage point, today to 8.34 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. That&#8217;s the lowest since March 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rupee Forecasts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nomura Holdings Inc., the second-most accurate rupee
forecaster in the last four quarters, sees the currency rising
toward 57 per dollar by year-end, while Mirae Asset Management
Co. predicts a rally to 55. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The election result was clearly better than we
expected,&#8221; Craig Chan, Nomura&#8217;s Singapore-based head of
currency strategy for Asia ex-Japan, said in a May 16 e-mail
interview. &#8220;The outlook for reforms, potential foreign inflows
and growth prospects will be even more positive now.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the election results have buoyed optimism about
India&#8217;s policies, the central bank may restrain exchange-rate
gains that would threaten the nation&#8217;s exports, Sameer Goel,
Deutsche Bank&#8217;s head of Asian interest-rate and foreign-exchange
research in Singapore, said in a telephone interview on May 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three-month offshore non-deliverable forwards rose 0.3
percent to 59.37 per dollar, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there were three: Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Macquarie Group Ltd.
are sticking to bets the Reserve Bank of Australia will resume
lowering interest rates as others ditch their rate-cut calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Westpac Banking Corp., National Australia Bank Ltd. and
Bank of America Merrill Lynch economists -- with a century in
combined experience -- now expect the RBA will maintain the
record-low 2.5 percent cash rate. While keeping expectations for
sub-par growth, they&#8217;ve bowed to Governor Glenn Stevens&#8217;s
insistence borrowing costs are on hold for &#8220;some time yet.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s Tim Toohey, JPMorgan&#8217;s Stephen Walters and
Macquarie&#8217;s Richard Gibbs think Stevens is wrong, with subdued
prices, a forecast rise in unemployment, an elevated currency
and government budget cuts seen forcing further reductions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;ve got fiscal tightening being accelerated, so
there&#8217;s absolutely no scope for the Reserve Bank to be
considering hiking rates,&#8221; Sydney-based Gibbs said in a May 19
interview. On the same day, Walters said he sees unemployment
rising, the currency too high and the budget weighing on growth,
while recognizing  &#8220;something will have to change&#8221; to prompt
the RBA to overcome its reluctance to lower rates again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia&#8217;s treasurer last week announced cuts to spending
on welfare and the public service and a new tax on the highest
paid, adding fiscal consolidation to a slump in mining
investment as brakes on growth. At stake: the survival of a
domestic demand revival that&#8217;s seen the jobless rate drop, house
prices surge, and most economists and financial markets abandon
any expectation of further monetary policy easing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fiscal Grind &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer sentiment plunged 6.8 percent to 92.9 in May from
a month earlier, an index from Westpac and the Melbourne
Institute showed today. That&#8217;s the lowest level since August
2011, prior to the central bank&#8217;s most recent easing cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In an environment where domestic demand is already
fragile and significant risks remain in the handover from mining
led economic growth, this budget does pose a risk to the near
term outlook,&#8221; Goldman&#8217;s Melbourne-based Chief Australia
Economist Toohey wrote in a note to clients dated May 14. &#8220;A
return to the grind of fiscal repair looms large.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walters and Gibbs say the budget cuts and resulting hit to
consumer confidence from the measures, a stubbornly high
currency, rising unemployment as growth remains below trend and
incomplete transition from mining investment will prompt another
move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Gee, that&#8217;s positive for the Aussie dollar,&#8221; Gibbs cited
foreign investors as saying after the budget release forecast
narrowing deficits, meaning the elevated Aussie will remain a
drag on growth. &#8220;It&#8217;s the tightening of conditions leading to
probably another round of job losses and pressure on domestic
demand&#8221; that will drive the RBA to cut again, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Aussie Dollar &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Australian dollar has firmed since Stevens switched to
a neutral bias in February, curbing exporters&#8217; competitiveness.
It traded at 92.38 U.S. cents at 12:16 p.m. in Sydney. Swaps
traders see the cash rate moving 3 basis points higher in a
year, according to a Credit Suisse Group AG index, down from 8
points yesterday and from 3 points in cuts on March 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even those economists who have abandoned rate-cut calls
recently and now see the central bank remaining on hold for an
extended period don&#8217;t necessarily believe it should be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t reflect any change of view on our part about
the outlook,&#8221; said Merrill Lynch&#8217;s Chief Australia Economist
Saul Eslake, who on May 16 switched his rate call to on hold.
&#8220;Dropping it doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;ve become a lot more optimistic or
less pessimistic about the economy, just that we now accept the
Reserve Bank is reading things differently from us and it&#8217;s
their view that counts, not ours.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Sharp Fall&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Westpac&#8217;s Bill Evans, who called the most recent easing
cycle, abandoned his prediction of further rate cuts in March
after stronger-than-expected jobs data and said the central bank
was indicating a &#8220;high hurdle&#8221; for easier policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The sharp fall in the index is clearly indicating an
unfavorable response to the recent federal budget,&#8221; Evans said
today of the sentiment slump. &#8220;Respondents were particularly
concerned about the impact of the budget on their own
finances.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NAB&#8217;s Alan Oster announced he had dropped his reduction
call on May 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low rates have spurred property prices. House and apartment
prices in the largest cities climbed 11.5 percent in April from
a year earlier, led by a 16.7 percent increase in Sydney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Export Boom &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government data released this month showed Australia&#8217;s
exports to China, its biggest trading partner, climbed to a
record A$9.5 billion ($8.8 billion) in March, even as the trade
surplus narrowed to A$731 million for the month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RBA maintained its steady view in minutes of the May 6
meeting released yesterday in Sydney. &#8220;Overall growth in coming
quarters was likely to be below trend given expected slower
growth in exports, the decline in mining investment and the
planned fiscal consolidation,&#8221; it said. &#8220;The current
accommodative stance of policy was likely to be appropriate for
some time yet.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nation&#8217;s Secretary to the Treasury Martin Parkinson, in
his traditional speech after the budget, said non-mining
industries need to grow more rapidly to keep unemployment low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are seeing some positive signs, particularly in the
household sector,&#8221; he said in Sydney yesterday. &#8220;But with
businesses in the non-resources sectors continuing to exercise
caution in their investment and hiring decisions, the forward
indicators suggest that it will be at least another year or two
before strong broad-based growth takes hold.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evans, when he made his call for the RBA to cut rates in
July 2011, was Australia&#8217;s loneliest forecaster at the time. Yet
within a few weeks markets swung to his view. In 2009,
JPMorgan&#8217;s Walters was alone in picking Stevens&#8217;s decision to
become the first Group of 20 policy maker to boost rates after
the height of the global recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our job is to forecast what the Reserve Bank will do, not
preach as to what they should do,&#8221; Eslake said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jay Rasulo, seen as one of two
possible successors to Walt Disney (DIS) Co. Chief Executive Officer
Robert Iger, invokes his company&#8217;s well-known characters when
discussing his role as chief financial officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I gotta have a big heart, I gotta love everybody, I&#8217;ve
gotta reach out to the world as Woody does in our stories,&#8221;
Rasulo said today at the Bloomberg CFO Conference when asked why
he sometimes compares himself to the &#8220;Toy Story&#8221; hero. &#8220;But
on the other hand I&#8217;m still counting the money like Scrooge
McDuck.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rasulo said Disney often faces decisions that cost in the
short run and yet build stronger ties with consumers, such as
policing foreign makers of licensed goods. He became finance
chief in 2009, after leading Disney&#8217;s parks for about seven
years, when Iger asked him and then-CFO Tom Staggs to switch
jobs. Both men are seen as possible successors when Iger steps
down in 2016. Rasulo didn&#8217;t address that issue today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It has been an incredible learning and broadening
experience, certainly for me, I&#8217;m sure on both sides of it,&#8221;
said Rasulo, 58. &#8220;In this role you get to experience the
breadth of the Walt Disney Co.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rasulo, a Columbia University economics graduate who
started out with the company in strategic planning in 1986, said
part of Disney&#8217;s success lies in how it deploys capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 65 percent is reinvested in the businesses, such as
theme-park rides, movies or sports rights for the ESPN network,
among the largest contributors to Disney profit, he said. The
company also pays dividends, buys back stock, and seeks
acquisitions that add to its character library or provide new
distribution outlets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cost-Cutting &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, Rasulo, who also has master&#8217;s degrees from the
University of Chicago, supervised a company-wide cost-cutting
initiative, designed to make sure the company was adapting to
technological changes in its businesses. That led to hundreds
firings across several divisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, Rasulo&#8217;s boss appointed him to oversee Disney&#8217;s
$500 million acquisition of Maker Studios, the money-losing
provider of online short-form videos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rasulo often speaks to Disney employees about career
planning, including his own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I advise people, just do what&#8217;s right in front of you and
good things happen rather than trying to be Machiavellian in
planning the next five steps of your career,&#8221; Rasulo said. &#8220;It
will never turn out the way you think.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rasulo sits about 40 feet from Iger and the two chat all
the time, along with communicating by e-mail, and when traveling
together, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s not a lot of formality to Bob,&#8221; Rasulo said.
&#8220;He&#8217;s a very free and easy, casual interactor.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;28 Years &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Rasulo joined Disney 28 years ago, the company had
about $2 billion in annual sales and earned most of its profit
from theme parks. The studio, established by Walt Disney in
1923, was struggling, the Disney Channel had fewer than 3
million subscribers, and Rasulo described the consumer products
business as &#8220;fledgling.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We used to get this check from Europe, we never knew what
it was for,&#8221; Rasulo recalled. &#8220;Presumably it was from people
selling consumer products. We never audited anybody.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Disney is the world&#8217;s largest entertainment company,
with more than $45 billion in sales. More than half its profit
comes from television, including ESPN, the Disney channels and
the ABC television network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his free time, Rasulo said he likes to fly fish, a hobby
that provides lessons for life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The reason I love fly fishing is because you focus right
on the here and now, and put away all other distractions,&#8221;
Rasulo said. &#8220;Otherwise you basically just get cold and wet and
come home with no fish.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said it has
begun the process to sell Metro International Trade Services
LLC, the metals warehouse business purchased by the bank in
2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Metro is not strategic to our client activities, and the
firm has concluded that this is the right time to explore a
sale, given recent interest by potential buyers,&#8221; Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, said in an e-mailed
statement today. &#8220;A formal sales process has begun.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc, JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Morgan Stanley are
scaling back their raw-material businesses. Commodity revenue at
the 10 largest banks fell 18 percent last year amid reduced
volatility, Coalition, a London-based analytics company, said in
February. Regulators are concerned that lenders might be able to
wield control over prices, or suffer losses that would endanger
the financial system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities
posted its worst year in five in 2013 as gold fell the most
since 1981 and corn, arabica coffee and wheat slid at least 20
percent. Commodity-related assets under management shrank by
about $100 billion, or about 25 percent of the total held at the
year&#8217;s start, Barclays estimated in February. The GSCI index
rose 3.5 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman received inquiries from potential buyers in
November after the London Metal Exchange proposed new rules on
how storage facilities operate, a person briefed on the matter
said at the time. The LME postponed implementation after the
plan, intended to ease aluminum bottlenecks at warehouses, was
tossed out by a judge. This month, the LME was granted
permission to appeal the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers of metals including brewer MillerCoors LLC
complained that lengthy waits for stockpiled supplies inflated
costs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), struggling to break
into the tablet market, backed off plans to introduce a smaller
version of its Surface tablet based on Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) processors,
people with knowledge of the decision said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella and
Executive Vice President Stephen Elop decided that the product
in development wasn&#8217;t different enough from rivals and probably
wouldn&#8217;t be a hit, said one of the people, who asked not to be
identified because the plans weren&#8217;t public. Engineers had been
working on the device and had planned to unveil it as early as
today at an event in New York, two of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, the company removed any references to Surface
devices based on Qualcomm&#8217;s processors from the event and
unveiled Surface Pro 3, an upgraded version of its pricier
Windows-based tablet, which uses chips from Intel Corp. (INTC) and
features a larger 12-inch screen. Microsoft is still working on
smaller versions, Panos Panay, who runs the Surface business,
said in an interview after the event. Panay declined to provide
details on future products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s Surface had just 1.3 percent share of the
market in the first quarter, while smaller-size tablets
accounted for 53 percent of sales in the period, according to
researcher IDC. Nadella has said he wants to turn the Redmond,
Washington-based company into one that focuses on &#8220;mobile
first, cloud first.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs Group Inc.-backed
company and American Tower Corp. (AMT) are among those seeking to buy
Telecom Italia SpA (TIT)&#8217;s mobile-phone towers in Brazil, according to
people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s Cell Site Solutions Cessao de Infraestruturas SA
and American Tower are among potential buyers that have sent
letters of interest to the Italian carrier, said the people,
asking not to be named because the talks are private. Telecom
Italia, which is working with Morgan Stanley to sell the assets,
values them at about 750 million euros ($1 billion), one of the
people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian mobile carriers are farming out the ownership and
maintenance of towers, then leasing space on them, to focus on
adding network capacity as demand for wireless Internet access
increases. Telecom Italia, which is selling about 6,000 towers
in Brazil, has also disposed of other assets and scrapped
dividends to cut debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Wireless-tower divestitures are a necessary tactic for
all phone carriers, which need to recover cash and focus
investments on stronger fiber, fixed-line networks,&#8221; said
Massimiliano Trovato, a media and telecommunications analyst at
Bruno Leoni Institute, an economic think tank. &#8220;This move makes
even more sense for Telecom Italia since I remain convinced the
Italian operator sooner or later will exit the Brazilian market,
and this is a potential first step in that direction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Expanding Investments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telecom Italia, based in Milan, said last week it expects
non-binding offers for the Brazil towers by the end of May. The
company owns a total of about 8,500 towers through its Tim
Participacoes SA (TIMP3) unit. Tim Chief Executive Officer Rodrigo Abreu
said the tower sale process is ongoing, and there aren&#8217;t plans
to sell the company itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is no offer of any kind to buy Tim,&#8221; Abreu said to
reporters in Brasilia today. &#8220;There has been no solicitation
and there are no negotiations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman and JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Gavea Investimentos
Ltda., the Brazilian hedge-fund firm founded by former central
bank president Arminio Fraga, unveiled tower-investment company
Cell Site Solutions last year. Tower companies such as SBA
Communications Corp. (SBAC) and Boston-based American Tower have also
been expanding in the past two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives of Telecom Italia, Cell Site Solutions,
American Tower and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telecom Italia shares fell 1.6 percent to 84 cents at the
close in Milan, giving the company a market value of 15.2
billion euros. The shares briefly recovered their losses after
Bloomberg&#8217;s report on the interest in the towers before
declining again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Towers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SBA, based in Boca Raton, Florida, agreed in December to
pay 1.53 billion reais ($693 million) for 2,007 Oi SA towers, or
about 760,000 reais per tower -- more than twice the price it
paid for a previous acquisition of other Oi towers, according to
Wells Fargo  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;SBA would be interested in evaluating the potential to
increase its Brazilian portfolio through additional MA,&#8221; the
company said in an e-mailed response to questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional capacity is also needed as demand for mobile
services soars, with one tower builder estimating that 6,680 new
units are required this year alone. Goldman, Patria
Investimentos SA -- a firm that includes Blackstone Group LP
among its investors -- and at least six other private-equity
firms are backing five local tower builders to benefit from the
rising demand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) plans to invest
$100 million to revitalize Detroit, the Detroit News reported,
citing three people with knowledge of the plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest investment bank by revenue, plans to
back firms that promise to provide jobs and invest in the city,
which is going through the largest U.S. municipal bankruptcy,
the newspaper reported today. The investment, over five years,
will include loans and grants, the Detroit Free Press reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move follows as much as $15 million in loans to Detroit
small businesses by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), and signals Wall
Street&#8217;s rising interest in Michigan&#8217;s largest city, which faces
$18 billion in long-term debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon, chairman of New York-based JPMorgan, is
expected to meet with Mayor Mike Duggan, a representative of
Republican Governor Rick Snyder&#8217;s office, and possibly
billionaire Warren Buffett before the plan is detailed on NBC&#8217;s
&#8220;Today Show&#8221; tomorrow, according to the Detroit News. Dimon
discussed the plan with Snyder in April in New York, the
newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s program would provide guidance and services
including consulting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duggan and Steve O&#8217;Halloran, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined
to comment on the report. Buffett didn&#8217;t immediately respond to
a request for comment sent to an assistant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein said in November that the New
York-based bank would make loans to small businesses in the
Detroit area and provide education and other assistance as part
of its 10,000 Small Businesses initiative with Buffett. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) introduced a larger-screen Surface tablet that is thinner and faster than the previous Surface Pro model, its latest attempt to gain share in the market dominated by Google Inc. and Apple Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is the tablet that can replace your laptop,&#8221; Panos Panay, Surface vice president, said at an event in New York to unveil the new device. The product has a 12-inch screen, up from the previous version&#8217;s 10.6 inches, and runs an Intel Corp. processor. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Surface had 1.3 percent of the tablet market in the first quarter, according to researcher IDC. The device hasn&#8217;t made significant inroads in the 20 months since Microsoft introduced its first computer-hardware product, as consumers opt for Apple&#8217;s iPad and tablets based on Google&#8217;s Android software. Another challenge facing Microsoft is slowing growth in the touchscreen-device market, which IDC predicts will grow 19 percent this year, compared with 52 percent in 2013. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;They need to clear up their messaging, they need to unify their apps so you can have the same apps run across multiple devices and form factors,&#8221; said Jitesh Ubrani, an analyst at Framingham, Massachusetts-based IDC. &#8220;These are all things they are working on but not fast enough. There&#8217;s also a certain level of beauty and polish on the iPad and the Surface isn&#8217;t quite there yet.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Google&#8217;s Android, which powers tablets such as Samsung Electronics Co.&#8217;s Galaxy and Amazon.com Inc.&#8217;s Kindle Fire, ran 63 percent of the tablets sold in the first quarter, according to IDC. Apple&#8217;s iOS had 33 percent share. Windows, which includes Surface and tablets from companies like Dell Inc., had 4.5 percent. Dell, Toshiba Corp. and others have already released smaller tablets running Windows. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Mobile, Cloud &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since taking the helm as chief executive officer in February, Satya Nadella has said he wants to turn the Redmond, Washington-based company into one that focuses on &#8220;mobile first, cloud first.&#8221; His initial efforts have included rolling out its Office productivity software for Apple&#8217;s (AAPL) iPad and updating Windows Phone mobile software. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fewer consumer purchases in developed markets are behind slowing growth in the tablet market, according to IDC. The slowdown is already being seen -- Apple said iPad sales fell 16 percent, the largest drop on record, in the quarter that ended in March. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, Microsoft is counting on tablets and mobile computing for growth amid a persistent decline in the personal-computer market, where about 90 percent of machines run on the company&#8217;s software. In April, IDC said first-quarter PC shipments fell 4.4 percent worldwide. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft still has room to gain ground in tablets, Ubrani said, though the company will need to connect with customers soon. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s tough to say how many chances they will have,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But they are certainly running out of time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Dina Bass in Seattle at dbass2@bloomberg.net; Serena Saitto in New York at ssaitto@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editors responsible for this story: Pui-Wing Tam at ptam13@bloomberg.net Reed Stevenson &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) is evaluating how the
planned merger of ATT Inc. (T) and DirecTV will affect its
business, according to Jay Rasulo, chief financial officer of
the world&#8217;s biggest entertainment company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Whether it&#8217;s that merger or Comcast-Time Warner Cable (TWC),
it&#8217;s no surprise to us that there is consolidation,&#8221; Rasulo
said today at the Bloomberg CFO Conference in New York. &#8220;We
have strong relationships with all of those companies. We are
analyzing how that will affect the ecosystem. This is early
days.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, owner of ESPN, the Disney Channel and the ABC
broadcast network, is one of the biggest suppliers of
programming to cable and satellite TV providers. Like other
content producers, the company has been selling more of its
shows to online networks such as Netflix Inc. (NFLX), which represent a
threat to pay-TV distributors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $48.5 billion ATT-DirecTV deal, announced this week,
and Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)&#8217;s $45 billion plan to acquire Time Warner
Cable Inc., involve four of the biggest buyers, potentially
giving them more clout in content negotiations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We recognize there is a change in the landscape from what
has been a very valuable and profitable landscape,&#8221; Rasulo
said. &#8220;The world is evolving toward more content being
distributed over the top. Netflix is a great example. There will
be more.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life is looking up for Marco Ruiz, whose four months of unemployment ended in December when a landscaping company in Dallas hired him at $9.50 an hour, with small raises since then and a promotion two weeks ago. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Things have gotten better,&#8221; said the 44-year-old, a maintenance supervisor at The Grounds Guys, which also added a part-time worker this year as sales are climbing. &#8220;This is a good job. I&#8217;m making $12 an hour.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Five years into the economic recovery, better days are finally arriving at the bottom of the job market. Since late 2013, unemployment has declined more rapidly for workers with a high school education than those with some college, and incomes for less-skilled and lower-paid employees have grown faster than for those near the top of the ladder, according to government data analyzed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

Graphic: Yellen's Labor Market Dashboard

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It looks like things are turning,&#8221; said Jan Hatzius, chief economist for Goldman Sachs in New York. The pickup is &#8220;looking a bit stronger for less skilled, lower paid workers. There&#8217;s been a little bit of the closing of the gap over the last year or so.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Better performance at the low end of the labor market, while helpful to the economy, hardly makes a dent in income inequality. The chasm between the richest 1 percent and remaining 99 percent is the widest since the 1920s, according to research by economists Emmanuel Saez of the University of California at Berkeley and Thomas Piketty of the Paris School of Economics. Nonetheless, economists at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase  Co. say the data on Americans at the low end of the wage and skills spectrum are looking more encouraging. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Education Levels &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unemployment among workers with a high school education or less fell to 6.3 percent in April, down about one percentage point from December, according to Labor Department data cited by Hatzius. In the same period, workers with at least some college saw a smaller drop, to 5.7 percent from 6.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) hired
Jonathan Strain as a managing director in its commercial-mortgage bond business, according to two people familiar with
the move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strain, previously at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), will be co-head
of the U.S. real estate finance group alongside Ted Borter, said
one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the
move hasn&#8217;t been announced. He will be based at the lender&#8217;s New
York headquarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is bolstering the team that underwrites bond
deals linked to everything from skyscrapers to strip malls as
Wall Street banks vie for the most lucrative lending assignments
amid growing competition. The number of firms originating
property loans to be packaged into securities has almost tripled
to 27 since issuance revived in 2010 following the financial
crisis, according to Standard  Poor&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strain, who started at JPMorgan in 2007, is joining Goldman
Sachs after the departure earlier this year of Dan Bennett, who
held a similar position. Justin Perras, a spokesman for
JPMorgan, and Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, said
they couldn&#8217;t comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issuance of commercial-mortgage backed securities is
falling short of predictions of a banner year, pushing
underwriters to be more aggressive to meet their origination
goals. Banks have arranged about $25 billion of CMBS this year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg, on track to disappoint
Wall Street forecasts for as much as $100 billion in 2014
issuance after sales doubled to $80 billion in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was the fourth-ranked underwriter of U.S.
CMBS last year, according to industry newsletter Commercial
Mortgage Alert. JPMorgan was second, behind top-ranked Deutsche
Bank AG. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), HSBC Holdings
Plc (HSBA) and Credit Agricole SA (ACA) were accused today by the European
Union&#8217;s antitrust arm of colluding to manipulate interbank
lending rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trio received antitrust complaints alleging they
participated in a cartel to rig Euribor. The so-called statement
of objections is the next step in the EU enforcement process
after the lenders dropped out of settlement talks last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission &#8220;has concerns that the three banks
may have taken part in a collusive scheme which aimed at
distorting the normal course of pricing components for euro
interest rate derivatives,&#8221; it said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While six financial firms, including Societe Generale SA (GLE),
agreed in December to a combined record of 1.7 billion euros
($2.3 billion) in fines in the Euribor case and a similar yen
Libor probe, the regulator&#8217;s attempt to get a clean sweep of
settlements was ruined by the dropouts. The EU&#8217;s case was
further undermined when Societe Generale appealed its penalty in
the courts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC fell 1 percent in London trading as of 1:04 p.m. while
Credit Agricole slipped 0.5 percent in Paris. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Without Merit&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and HSBC said in separate statements that they
would defend themselves against the EU allegations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sweden&#8217;s Finance Minister Anders Borg
is urging Pfizer Inc. (PFE) to give up its efforts to take over
drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc, arguing the deal would destroy
research and development jobs in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borg, who is battling rising unemployment in Sweden ahead
of September elections, criticized the U.S. firm for adopting
what he described as an &#8220;aggressive strategy&#8221; to buy
AstraZeneca, which employs 5,900 people in Sweden. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It would be very wise of Pfizer to consider to withdraw
from this process,&#8221; he said yesterday in an interview in
Stockholm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borg last week urged shareholders to reject Pfizer&#8217;s bid,
which he characterized as a &#8220;hostile process&#8221; in part aimed at
cutting Pfizer&#8217;s tax burden. AstraZeneca, formed in a 1999
merger between Astra AB and Zeneca Plc, yesterday rejected a
sweetened $117 billion offer from Pfizer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The takeover bid is likely to fail because British law
prohibits the U.S. firm from improving its offer after declaring
it final, according to people familiar with the transaction.
Pfizer is expected to announce that it will not make a formal
bid by May 26, which is the deadline for the U.S. firm to make
an official offer, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Very Aggressive&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a very aggressive and raw strategy that Pfizer has
and I think that undermines Pfizer&#8217;s credibility in the long-term,&#8221; Borg said. &#8220;It may create risks for them. We&#8217;re very
worried about what this will mean to research and development in
Europe, in the U.K. and Sweden.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investcorp Bank BSC, the Bahrain-based investment firm, hired JPMorgan Chase  Co. to sell
Spanish ceramics-products maker Esmalglass SA, according to
people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction may value the Villarreal, Spain-based
company at about 800 million euros ($1.1 billion), the people
said, asking not to be identified because the talks are private.
Esmalglass wants to reach an agreement before year-end, they
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investcorp&#8217;s preferred option is a sale to a private-equity
firm or another manufacturer, the people said. An initial public
offering of Esmalglass is still a possibility, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investcorp agreed to buy a majority stake in Esmalglass
from 3i Group Plc (III) in August 2012 in a deal valued at about 200
million euros, the people said. Debt provider Intermediate
Capital Group Plc also took a minority equity stake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esmalglass, which was founded in 1978, employs about 1,000
people in eight countries, according to the company&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With prospects for an AstraZeneca Plc deal falling apart, Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chief Executive Officer Ian Read is facing a new question from investors: What now? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There aren&#8217;t other ripe targets offering the triple benefits of a lower tax rate in the U.K., cost savings and new cancer drugs, analysts say. Without AstraZeneca&#8217;s promise of new growth, Read, 60, will likely return to an earlier plan to further break up what was once the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Read has split Pfizer into at least two units internally, with the idea they may one day be spun off on their own, potentially giving investors a choice between one business stocked with brand-name drugs and a second with older products. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Read may have failed with AstraZeneca, he&#8217;s gained a reputation for doing what&#8217;s needed to please investors. Pfizer&#8217;s shares have gained 75 percent since he took over as CEO in December 2010. &#8220;He&#8217;ll do anything to get the stock price up,&#8221; said Jeff Jonas, an investor with Gabelli  Co. in Rye, New York. &#8220;As long as he continues to have that view, he&#8217;ll be fine.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca yesterday rejected New York-based Pfizer&#8217;s third takeover offer, for 69.4 billion pounds ($117 billion). At the same time, London-based AstraZeneca&#8217;s chairman, Leif Johansson, said the deal -- the largest ever in the industry -- was probably dead under U.K. takeover rules. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argentina is benefiting from the
experience of the world&#8217;s largest oil companies as it develops
shale deposits in a bid to gain energy independence, said a
board member of a provincial oil company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s Argentina unit and provincial-run Gas 
Petroleo del Neuquen SA, or GYP, yesterday reported their
largest shale discovery in southern Argentina&#8217;s Vaca Muerta
formation. The Bajo del Choique X-2 horizontal well is producing
770 barrels of oil a day in its first flow test, Exxon said in a
statement. Exxon operates the block and has an 85 percent stake
while GyP owns the remaining 15 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are betting on developing the horizontal technology
along with Exxon because we are convinced that is the way to get
greater output despite being costly,&#8221; said GyP Director Gustavo Nagel in an e-mailed response to Bloomberg questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaca Muerta&#8217;s oil production more than tripled in the first
quarter from a year earlier, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg Industries, boosted primarily by a joint venture
between YPF SA (YPF), Argentina&#8217;s largest company, and Chevron Corp. (CVX)
YPF&#8217;s output from the Loma Campana area in Vaca Muerta rose to
12,800 barrels a day from 4,200 barrels after investing $1.2
billion in a pilot year with San Ramon, California-based
Chevron. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Energy Deficit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GyP has partnerships with 18 additional foreign oil
companies to develop shale in Vaca Muerta, Nagel said. Vaca
Muerta is a mostly untapped 30,000 square-kilometer (11,600
square-mile) region, which holds at least 23 billion barrels of
oil, according to a survey by Ryder Scott. Vaca Muerta has 350
wells, of which 160 are commercially producing, Nagel said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argentina will need $300 billion to develop Vaca Muerta
over a six-year period to make the country energy independent
starting in 2020 and keep it producing for as many as 40 years,
Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) Argentine unit President Juan Aranguren
said on Dec. 10. Argentina posted a record $6.1 billion energy
deficit last year after 20 years of surpluses through 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell tripled its investment budget to $500 million this
year for Vaca Muerta, the world&#8217;s second-largest shale gas
formation and the world&#8217;s fourth-largest shale oil deposit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, Shell and Chevron are the three biggest oil
companies by market value. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, said it&#8217;s working with China&#8217;s government to
evaluate its Windows 8 operating system after the software was
excluded from a government purchasing order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which continues to provide Windows 7 to
government customers, was &#8220;surprised&#8221; to learn Windows 8 was
shut out of China&#8217;s purchase of energy-efficient computers,
Joanna Li, a Beijing-based spokeswoman for Microsoft, said in an
e-mailed response to questions. The company learned of the
decision in a notice from the China Central Government
Procurement Center yesterday, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notice from the procurement center gave no reason for
excluding Windows 8, yet China&#8217;s official Xinhua News Agency
yesterday reported it was &#8220;a move to ensure computer security&#8221;
after the company ended support for Windows XP. Microsoft
stopped support for XP, which has a 70 percent market share in
China, on April 8, Xinhua reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft has been working proactively with the Central
Government Procurement Center and other government agencies
through the evaluation process to ensure that our products and
services meet all government procurement requirements,&#8221; Li
said. &#8220;At the same time we are working on the Windows 8
evaluation with relevant government agencies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason for the exclusion order is concerns over
Internet safety, Xinhua reported, without citing anyone. The
news agency said that China must be careful after reports of
U.S. spying. Microsoft and other software makers have been
contending with customer concerns following leaks about the U.S.
National Security Agency&#8217;s data-collection programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hacker Threat &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows XP users in China are concerned about the threat
from hacker attacks following the end of Microsoft support for
the XP system, Xinhua reported. China&#8217;s Ministry of Industry and
Information Technology said last month the end of Windows XP
support brought risks to the nation&#8217;s communications networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has encouraged XP users to upgrade to Windows 7
and Windows 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s decision to exclude Windows 8 was announced in a
statement dated May 16. Procurements are often not immediately
posted online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenovo Group Ltd. (992), the world&#8217;s largest maker of personal
computers, will see no impact from China excluding Microsoft&#8217;s
Windows 8 from government procurement as the company has other
software options for customers, Chief Executive Officer Yang Yuanqing said on a conference call today. Lenovo, which has its
headquarters in Beijing and Morrisville, North Carolina, has no
plan to make its own operating system, Yang said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. indicted five Chinese military officials for
allegedly hacking into the computer networks of U.S. companies
to steal trade secrets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the indictments, China&#8217;s Defense Ministry accused
the U.S. of &#8220;hypocrisy and double standards on the issue of
network security.&#8221; China also suspended its involvement in a
cybersecurity working group with the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on whether you listen to
Morgan Stanley or JPMorgan Chase  Co., the imposition of
martial law in Thailand will either send the baht tumbling to
levels last seen in 2006 or put an end to its losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley yesterday reiterated its prediction that the
baht will weaken 12 percent by year-end to 37 per dollar as the
political crisis pushes the country toward a recession. JPMorgan
was more optimistic, confirming an overweight recommendation on
the currency, amid bets the army&#8217;s move will help end months of
street protests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disparity of opinion on the outlook for the currency
mirrors the mixed signals coming from Thailand&#8217;s economy. While
an official report this week showed gross domestic product
shrank in the first quarter, the nation has the biggest
cumulative trade surplus for more than three years, and exports
are rising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market tends to be complacent about Thai politics,
it&#8217;s not the first coup,&#8221; Paul McNamara, a London-based
investment director at GAM U.K. Ltd., which manages $129 billion
in assets, said yesterday by e-mail. &#8220;It&#8217;s not just noise, the
chances of something terrible happening are rising. But until we
see convincing spill-over to the real economy, I think the
fallout will be limited.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Paring Decline &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The baht is the only one of 12 Asian currencies tracked by
Bloomberg to drop versus the dollar this month, slipping 0.4
percent. It has retreated 4.3 percent since the anti-government
protests started at the end of October, the worst performance in
the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The currency fell as much as 0.6 percent yesterday to
32.660 per dollar, before paring its retreat amid speculation of
intervention by the central bank. It climbed 0.1 percent today
to 32.493 as of 1:06 p.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our target of 37 is very achievable,&#8221; Geoffrey Kendrick,
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s head of Asia currency and interest-rate
strategy in Hong Kong, said yesterday in a phone interview.
&#8220;The economy is in a massive hole. Thailand is certainly going
to have a technical recession in the first half.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thailand&#8217;s army chief declared martial law yesterday,
telling local television that the move wasn&#8217;t a coup and would
help end the street protests that led to Yingluck Shinawatra&#8217;s
removal as prime minister this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The violence has driven away tourists and hurt the economy,
with a May 19 report showing GDP shrank 2.1 percent in the first
quarter, after growing a revised 0.1 percent in the previous
three-month period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Airport Shutdown &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thailand&#8217;s last quarter-on-quarter recession was in 2009,
when anti-government protesters shut down Bangkok&#8217;s main
international airport for more than a week at the height of the
global financial meltdown. The baht tumbled 17 percent against
the dollar in the five quarters ending March 2009, the sharpest
decline since the Asian crisis of the late 1990s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money poured out of the country yesterday. Overseas
investors sold $256 million more Thai shares than they bought,
the heaviest net sales since November, and pulled $61 million
from bonds, exchange data show. Global funds have withdrawn
about $1 billion from local debt and equities in May, snapping
two months of inflows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others are optimistic about the baht&#8217;s prospects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m not worried about the baht, I&#8217;m looking for levels to
buy,&#8221; Rajeev De Mello, who manages $10 billion as the head of
Asian fixed income at Schroder Investment Management Ltd., said
by phone yesterday from Singapore. &#8220;The main support of the
baht in the past has really been the trade side. On the investor
side, the people who wanted to get out of Thailand have already
gotten out.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Baht Appreciation&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Westpac Banking Corp., Australia&#8217;s second-biggest lender by
market value, expects the baht to strengthen about 3 percent by
year-end to 31.4 per dollar. The median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of 24 strategists is for a decline to 33. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Foreigners are excessively underweight baht assets, and
covering this positioning on any reduction of political risk
would trigger baht appreciation,&#8221; Daniel Hui, the head of
emerging-Asia currency strategy at JPMorgan in Singapore, wrote
yesterday in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday marked the army&#8217;s most direct involvement in
Thailand&#8217;s politics since 2006, when then-premier Thaksin
Shinawatra, Yingluck&#8217;s brother, was removed in a coup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Surviving Coups &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thailand has had 11 coups since direct rule by kings ended
in 1932, and the currency has ridden out most of them. Martial
law was last invoked in April 2010, and a month later the baht
had risen 0.3 percent against the dollar, the best performance
in Asia. It was little changed in September 2006, when Thaksin
was ousted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country has been without a fully functioning government
since December, when Yingluck called snap elections in a bid to
ease the unrest. To Australia  New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.,
that will lead to a drop in the baht of about 4 percent this
year to 34 per dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Politics definitely is the biggest risk at present, and
there are negative effects on the economy,&#8221; Khoon Goh, a
Singapore-based senior strategist at ANZ, said in a May 19 phone
interview. &#8220;We&#8217;ve already seen portfolio outflows. The risk is
that foreign-direct investment slows down sharply if investor
concern over the political situation intensifies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is investing
$100 million over five years to revive bankrupt Detroit, marking
the bank&#8217;s largest commitment to a city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will provide funds for community development,
blight removal, job training, small-business support and other
growth programs, the biggest investment bank by revenue said
today in a statement. The move follows as much as $15 million in
loans to Detroit small businesses announced by Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) in November, and signals Wall Street&#8217;s rising
interest in the erstwhile auto-manufacturing capital, which
faces $18 billion in long-term debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe in Detroit&#8217;s future, and we want to see the
city recover its economic strength,&#8221; Jamie Dimon, chairman of
New York-based JPMorgan, said in the statement before a luncheon
with community and government leaders in Detroit today. &#8220;With
this investment, we are putting our resources and expertise to
work to help Detroit chart a course back to economic
prosperity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank&#8217;s commitment includes $40 million
in flexible, long-term debt capital and $10 million in grant
capital to two community-development lenders. Another $25
million will help end residential blight and restore properties,
and $12.5 million will go toward work-force training and
development. The investment also offers $7 million to support
small businesses and $5.5 million in strategic initiatives,
including investing in a new rail line. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Jasmine Ng" date="May 21, 2014  5:20 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-21/goldman-raises-iron-ore-surplus-forecast-on-china-steel-slowdown.html"><headline>Goldman Widens Iron Ore Surplus Forecast on Steel Output</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The global seaborne iron ore glut
will probably be 21 percent bigger than forecast next year as
steel production slows in China, the world&#8217;s largest consumer,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surplus will reach 175 million metric tons in 2015,
compared with a prior prediction of 145 million tons, Goldman
Sachs said in a report dated yesterday. The bank estimates that
output will exceed demand by 72 million tons and prices will
average $109 a ton in 2014, before dropping to $80 next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron ore has slumped 27 percent this year as economic
growth in China slowed and mining companies from BHP Billiton
Ltd. to Rio Tinto Group in Australia boosted output, shifting
the global seaborne market into a glut. Banks from Standard
Chartered Plc to Credit Suisse Group AG say more Chinese steel
mills will go bankrupt and hurt consumption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market is no longer in balance but in the early stage
of a structural surplus,&#8221; analysts including Christian Lelong
wrote in the report. &#8220;China will not act as the safety valve in
an oversupplied market for much longer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ore with 62 percent iron content delivered to the Chinese
port of Tianjin fell 1 percent to $97.50 a dry ton yesterday,
the lowest level since September 2012, according to data from
The Steel Index Ltd. The decline in iron ore, Australia&#8217;s
biggest export earner, pulled the country&#8217;s dollar today to the
weakest level since May 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Record Stockpiles &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the last decline below $100 in 2012 spurred buyers to
rebuild inventories, boosting prices to about $159 in four
months, this time around expectations of ample supply will
encourage users to keep reserves at a minimum, said Goldman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the current downturn could trigger another
destocking cycle of similar scale,&#8221; Lelong, Daniel Quigley and
Amber Cai wrote. &#8220;But the eventual rebound will be far less
robust than previously.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduced Chinese imports will also offset any impact of
expected supply disruptions in India and a possible strike at
Australia&#8217;s Port Hedland, the world&#8217;s largest bulk-export
terminal, the bank said. Maritime Union of Australia, which
represents tugboat deckhands at the port, approved unlimited
work stoppages of 24 hours, 48 hours and 7 days on May 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BHP, the third-largest exporter, won&#8217;t be able to make up
shipments lost during a strike, the company&#8217;s iron ore president
Jimmy Wilson said in a statement today. The union said May 12 it
hadn&#8217;t decided whether to take action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Port Strike &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Disruption in Port Hedland would be costly for the
producers affected and would drive a temporary price rally, but
it would ultimately be washed out by global market
fundamentals,&#8221; Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s inventory at ports rose 1.8 percent to a record
112.55 million tons in the week to May 16 from a week earlier,
according to Shanghai Steelhome Information Technology Co. As
much as 40 percent of inventory at ports may be tied up in
financing purposes, according to Daiwa Securities Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A meaningful amount of iron ore stockpiles in China is
tied to financing, which means an unwinding can be excessive,&#8221;
said Doug King, the London-based chief investment officer of the
Merchant Commodity Fund, which returned 15.4 percent from
January to April partly from iron ore. &#8220;Real demand will be
dampened when those stockpiles are sold into the market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s economy that creates demand for 69 percent of the
world&#8217;s seaborne ore will grow by 7.3 percent this year, the
lowest since 1990, according to a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Australian dollar touched 92.16 U.S. cents today. It
dropped 0.9 percent yesterday, the biggest loss since March 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Changes in spot iron ore prices affect the currency far
more quickly these days,&#8221; Gareth Berry, a foreign-exchange
strategist at UBS AG, wrote in a client note dated yesterday.
&#8220;That&#8217;s largely due to the demise of annual fixed price iron
ore contracts, and the subsequent shift to quarterly, then to
monthly, then to spot pricing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of BHP fell 0.8 percent to A$37.17 ($34.32) at the
close in Sydney today and Rio, the second-biggest exporter,
declined 1.1 percent to A$59.40. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italy will include prostitution and illegal drug sales in the gross domestic product calculation this year, a boost for its chronically stagnant economy and Prime Minister Matteo Renzi&#8217;s effort to meet deficit targets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Drugs, prostitution and smuggling will be part of GDP as of 2014 and prior-year figures will be adjusted to reflect the change in methodology, the Istat national statistics office said today. The revision was made to comply with European Union rules, it said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Renzi, 39, is committed to narrowing Italy&#8217;s deficit to 2.6 percent of GDP this year, a task that&#8217;s easier if output is boosted by portions of the underground economy that previously went uncounted. Four recessions in the last 13 years left Italy&#8217;s GDP at 1.56 trillion euros ($2.13 trillion) last year, 2 percent lower than in 2001 after adjusting for inflation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even if the impact is hard to quantify, it&#8217;s obvious it will have a positive impact on GDP,&#8221; said Giuseppe Di Taranto, economist and professor of financial history at Rome&#8217;s Luiss University. &#8220;Therefore Renzi will have a greater margin this year to spend&#8221; without breaching the deficit limit, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the Finance Ministry declined to comment on the new system. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The change in methodology will also bring research and development and arms into the GDP calculation. RD, now considered investment spending, was previously excluded because it was classified as an intermediate cost. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporters on this story: Andrew Frye in Rome at afrye@bloomberg.net; Chiara Vasarri in Rome at cvasarri@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editors responsible for this story: Alan Crawford at acrawford6@bloomberg.net; Jerrold Colten at jcolten@bloomberg.net Andrew Langley, James Kraus &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UBS AG (UBSN) hired Severin Brizay from
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) to oversee its mergers and acquisitions
team in Europe, the Middle East and Africa as Switzerland&#8217;s
largest bank overhauls management of the business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brizay spent 14 years working on deals at JPMorgan from
London and Paris, according to an employee memo obtained by
Bloomberg News. His hire follows James Hartop&#8217;s decision to work
directly with clients and step back from management after three
years leading coverage and advisory in corporate-client
solutions in the region, according to the memo written by
William Vereker, head of corporate-client solutions in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brizay will report to Vereker and build the deals business
in the region, working closely with the bank&#8217;s global head of
MA, Piero Novelli, according to the memo. Its contents were
confirmed by a company spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS also hired Glenn Rewick from Bank of America Corp. as a
managing director in EMEA advisory focusing on health-care
deals, according to the memo. Juan Monte will become head of
country coverage, managing teams for Continental Europe and for
Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa while
continuing to head corporate-client solutions in Spain. Diego Pignatelli will continue in his role as chairman of coverage and
advisory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Rowley will become chairman of UBS&#8217;s global
business-review group process while continuing as a senior MA
banker and chairman of the EMEA business-review group and the
EMEA fairness-opinion committee, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca Plc&#8217;s (AZN) biggest shareholder
says the drugmaker and its potential acquirer Pfizer Inc. (PFE) should
continue to talk, a person with knowledge of the matter said. A
second investor also pushed for negotiations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock Inc. (BLK), which owns 8 percent of London-based
AstraZeneca and 6.8 percent of Pfizer, is encouraging
discussions between the two companies, said the person, who
asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo  Co., which holds 1.3 percent
of AstraZeneca shares according to filings, said today it is in
favor of new talks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re very disappointed that AstraZeneca management has
not agreed to terms we think are beneficial to the
shareholders,&#8221; Thomas Hancock, co-head of Grantham, Mayo&#8217;s
Global Equity group, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money-management firms have been weighing in since
AstraZeneca spurned New York-based Pfizer&#8217;s 69 billion-pound
($116 billion) takeover proposal on May 19. The U.S. company has
until 5 p.m. London time on May 26 to make a firm offer. If it
doesn&#8217;t, Pfizer can&#8217;t come back with another bid for six months,
except in certain circumstances, according to U.K. takeover
rules. Pfizer can renew its effort after three months if it&#8217;s
invited to do so by AstraZeneca. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer on May 18 declared its sweetened offer, valued at 55
pounds a share, as final under the current process, so by U.K.
rules it can&#8217;t raise the bid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lauren Post, a spokeswoman for BlackRock in New York,
declined to comment. BlackRock, based in New York, is the
world&#8217;s largest money manager. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s biggest bond dealers,
including JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Morgan Stanley, failed to
properly report trades to the industry&#8217;s price-tracking system
more than 11,000 times. JPMorgan&#8217;s penalty: About three minutes
of its annual profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fines levied in settlements disclosed last month by the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority amounted to a fraction
of what the two New York-based firms generated from trading debt
during the two-year reviews. JPMorgan&#8217;s $95,000 penalty was the
biggest imposed by Finra as it cited at least three other
dealers in the past five months for similar types of violations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators are seeking to uphold the integrity of the bond-price reporting system known as Trace, the biggest window into a
market that&#8217;s grown about 78 percent since 2008 as investors
poured money into debt securities. Holding back information on
trades can give Wall Street dealers an advantage over customers
seeking a fair price, undermining Finra&#8217;s stated goal of equal
access for all participants to real-time data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If non-reporting is systemic, then that&#8217;s concerning
because the broader market looks to this data as the golden
source,&#8221; said Kevin McPartland, head of market-structure
research at consulting firm Greenwich Associates. &#8220;It&#8217;s the
best we&#8217;ve got when people try to understand who is doing what
in the bond market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) agreed to
sell its New York Stock Exchange market-making unit to IMC
Financial Markets, a high-frequency trading firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IMC Chicago LLC, a unit of Amsterdam-based IMC, will become
a designated market maker at the NYSE by acquiring Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s rights, the companies said in a statement today. The
transaction, which is expected to close in the third quarter,
makes IMC a designated market maker for more than 630 securities
and about 400 companies, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IntercontinentalExchange Group Inc. (ICE)&#8217;s NYSE relies on
traders known as designated market makers, or DMMs, to
facilitate the buying and selling of shares. Barclays Plc (BARC) and
KCG Holdings Inc. (KCG) are the biggest DMMs, followed by Goldman
Sachs and Virtu Financial Inc., a person with knowledge of the
matter said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s DMM employees are to join IMC as part of
the transaction, including floor traders and corporate-relations
staff, the companies said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terms of the transaction weren&#8217;t disclosed. New York-based
Goldman Sachs was seeking as much as $30 million for the
business, a person with knowledge of the matter said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closely held IMC stands for International Marketmakers
Combination and was founded in Amsterdam in 1989 by two traders
who worked on the open outcry floor of Europe&#8217;s first options
exchange, according to the company website. IMC is a market
maker in equities, bonds, commodities and currencies on 90
exchanges globally. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanrio Co., (8136) maker and licenser of
Hello Kitty goods, plunged in Tokyo trading after analysts
including Sho Kawano at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut targets for
the company, citing a waning outlook for U.S. sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares fell 16 percent, the most since 1995, to 2,598
yen at the close in Tokyo trading. The stock has declined 41
percent this year, compared with a 10 percent fall for the
broader Topix index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kawano at Goldman lowered the estimate for operating profit
in the year ending March by 7 percent, citing costs related to
the company&#8217;s shift back to merchandise sales from a focus on
licensing. Sanrio founder Shintaro Tsuji had previously sought
to reduce the reliance on marketing Hello Kitty goods by
licensing character rights to companies that make different
items based on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see little prospect of a rapid turnaround given that
this is a transition period,&#8221; Kawano wrote in a note to clients
dated yesterday. Kawano cut the price target for the Tokyo-based
company to 3,200 yen from 3,800 yen earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The licensing strategy had helped hold operating margins
above 25 percent since fiscal 2011, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Sanrio surged 61 percent last year, after dropping
31 percent in 2012 and more than doubling in the previous year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM), Glencore PLC (GLEN) and the London Metal Exchange were
sued by a company that claimed they conspired to restrict zinc
supplies and drive up prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duncan Galvanizing Corp. alleged that in 2010 Goldman
Sachs, JPMorgan and Glencore each acquired one of the world&#8217;s
three biggest metals warehouse operators, giving them control
over the London Metals Exchange, where 90 percent of zinc metals
futures are traded, according to a complaint filed today in
Manhattan federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duncan, based in Everett, Massachusetts, provides
protective coatings for steel. It claims the defendants
conspired to drive up prices by artificially limiting zinc
supplies. Duncan is seeking to represent a class of purchasers
of LME-grade zinc for physical delivery in the U.S., from May
24, 2010, to the present. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, said the firm intends to contest the lawsuit. Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for New York based JPMorgan Chase, and
Charles Watenphul, a spokesman for Glencore, based in Baar,
Switzerland, both declined to comment. Miriam Heywood, a
spokeswoman for the London Metal Exchange, didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to an e-mail sent after regular business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Manhattan courthouse where the zinc suit is filed has
become a hub of commodities price-fixing claims in recent
months. Suits have been filed over aluminum warehousing and oil
futures. U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni is overseeing 24
suits claiming manipulation of the benchmark used to set prices
in the $18 trillion global gold market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The zinc suit seeks unspecified damages, which may be
tripled under U.S. antitrust law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Duncan Galvanizing Corp. v. The London Metal
Exchange Ltd., 14-cv-03728, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) plan to
keep operating in Russia after President Vladimir Putin&#8217;s
government backed away from punishing the payments firms in
response to U.S. sanctions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa and MasterCard executives met with senior officials
including First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov and came
away &#8220;very positive&#8221; about finding a solution, Visa&#8217;s country
chief, Andrew Torre, said at the St. Petersburg International
Economic Forum yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia will consider easing new measures requiring the two
U.S. companies to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to
continue operating, MasterCard Russia chief Ilya Riaby said. At
stake is an estimated $403 million in combined annual revenue
for the two payments networks as well as their foothold in a
market that&#8217;s shifting from cash to electronic payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Visa and MasterCard stopped processing payments at
four Russian banks in response to U.S. sanctions over the crisis
in Ukraine, Russia passed a law creating its own national
payments system and imposing rules for foreign firms that
include fines for denying services and a mandatory security
deposit starting in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government is committed to working with Visa and
MasterCard, Deputy Finance Minister Alexey Moiseev said in an
interview with Bloomberg TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moiseev said the U.S. companies agreed to create a
&#8220;nationally important&#8221; operator within 18 months. Under the
new law, such operators are exempt from having to post
collateral with the central bank, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More Talks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies have not yet reached a formal agreement and
&#8220;look forward to continuing the dialog,&#8221; Paul Cohen, a
spokesman for Visa, said in a statement. MasterCard&#8217;s
suggestions on changes to the new law were &#8220;regarded
favorably&#8221; and the company expects a response soon, according
to Seth Eisen, a spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa and MasterCard have said they get about 2 percent of
their annual revenue from Russia, or about $167 million last
year for MasterCard and $236 million for Visa. The two control
about 95 percent of the payments market in Russia, according to
Morgan Stanley. Visa is based in Foster City, California, and
runs the world&#8217;s biggest payments network. MasterCard is based
in Purchase, New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bigger concern may not be the loss of revenue, &#8220;but
the risk of losing the opportunity for domestic processing in
Russia,&#8221; Darrin Peller, an analyst at Barclays Plc, said in a
research note, adding that 80 percent of transactions in Russia
are done using cash. &#8220;There will likely be a middle ground
reached.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(A previous version of this story was corrected to remove
an erroneous combined revenue estimate in the third paragraph.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Petroliam Nasional Bhd. is among a
group of producers looking to enter Argentina&#8217;s nascent shale
boom, according to state-owned oil company YPF SA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petronas, as Malaysia&#8217;s state oil and gas company is known,
is negotiating a binding deal with YPF to develop an area in
southwestern Argentina&#8217;s Vaca Muerta shale formation after
signing a preliminary accord Feb. 18, Doris Capurro, YPF&#8217;s
director of communications, said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are continuing conversations&#8221; with Petronas, Doris
Capurro, YPF&#8217;s communications director, said in an interview in
La Jolla, California yesterday. &#8220;They are very interested in
what we are doing in Vaca Muerta, like many other companies we
are holding talks with.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argentina is seeking partners to develop Vaca Muerta, an
area the size of Belgium that holds at least 23 billion barrels
of oil, according to a survey by Ryder Scott, in a bid to become
energy independent. YPF&#8217;s output from the Loma Campana area in
Vaca Muerta rose to 12,800 barrels a day from 4,200 after
investing $1.2 billion in a pilot year with Chevron Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner
expropriated from Spain&#8217;s Repsol SA in 2012, is also in
conversations with Petroleos Mexicanos, Capurro said, without
disclosing the subject of the talks. Mexico is pushing through
legislation to open up its oil and gas fields, including shale,
to foreign investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Find &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petronas&#8217;s preliminary deal is to develop a 187-square
kilometer (72 square-mile) area called La Amarga Chica in
Neuquen province, northwest of Loma Campana, where the Chevron
pilot may become a $16 billion project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YPF announced this week its first unconventional discovery
outside of Vaca Muerta at El Trebol in the D-129 formation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capurro called for changes to Argentina&#8217;s 1967 hydrocarbons
law to cater to offshore and unconventional operations and
greater environmental protection demands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The company thinks some rules of the game should be
revised to include shale,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) extended its
partnership with Russia&#8217;s state-controlled oil company even as
U.S. and European nations threaten additional sanctions to
punish Vladimir Putin&#8217;s regime for its actions in Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon signed the agreement with OAO Rosneft (ROSN) Chief Executive
Officer Igor Sechin at a forum in St. Petersburg today,
extending a pact that involves drilling for crude in the Arctic
and Siberia and liquefying natural gas for export in Russia&#8217;s
Far East, according to a statement on Moscow-based Rosneft&#8217;s
website. Exxon didn&#8217;t immediately return a phone message seeking
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon is among American oil producers that rebuffed U.S.
State Department pressure to skip the International Economic
Forum this week in Putin&#8217;s hometown. With at least $30 billion
already invested in Russia&#8217;s oil and gas sector, U.S. and
European explorers are betting the Ukraine crisis won&#8217;t derail
their aspirations to capture some of Russia&#8217;s 75 billion barrels
of reserves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among U.S. companies, Irving, Texas-based Exxon is the
biggest player in Russia, where it has a series of joint
ventures with Rosneft. (ROSN) It already produces oil in Russia&#8217;s Far
East with Rosneft and the two companies plan to start drilling
an exploration well in the Kara Sea this year. Together they
hold licenses to explore huge swathes of the Arctic Ocean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stronger Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While sanctions against Russia have targeted individuals --
including Sechin -- and avoided industrywide measures, the U.S.
has threatened stronger action if Putin&#8217;s government obstructs
the Ukraine presidential election scheduled for May 25.
Producers still plan to invest more in Russia, pursuing
exploration in the Arctic Ocean and drilling shale oil fields in
Siberia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Foreign companies are expected to invest billions of
dollars in Russian projects,&#8221; said Timur Salikhov, an oil and
gas analyst at BCS Financial Group. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think many of them
will do so until there is resolution to the ongoing standoff
with Ukraine.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. and European energy producers hold equity partnerships
in Russian oil and gas worth at least $30 billion, according to
Alexander Nazarov, an analyst at OAO Gazprombank in Moscow. The
investments are led by BP Plc (BP/)&#8217;s almost 20 percent stake in
Rosneft, Total SA (FP)&#8217;s stake in gas producer OAO Novatek (NVTK) and a gas
project operated by Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (RDSA) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some oil-industry leaders declined to attend this week&#8217;s
forum after U.S. officials called for a boycott. Others came
anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christophe de Margerie, CEO of France&#8217;s Total, was at the
forum, where he signed an agreement with OAO Lukoil to seek
shale oil in Western Siberia. BP CEO Bob Dudley attended the
meeting and said he had no plans to exit Russia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neil Duffin, president of Exxon&#8217;s development unit, signed
the agreement today at the forum, according to Rosneft. Exxon
has declined to say whether CEO Rex Tillerson will make an
appearance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian retailers may be best
positioned to crack open international credit markets as they&#8217;re
far removed from people blacklisted by the U.S. and Europe over
Ukraine, said Clemens Grafe, chief economist at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) in Russia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Russia&#8217;s retailers have eschewed dollar bonds, they
may find investor appetite internationally, Grafe said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There will eventually be some kind of separation whereby
those that are far away from sanctions can come back to the
market,&#8221; Grafe said in an interview at the St. Petersburg
International Economic Forum. &#8220;If one of the retailers said
they wanted to issue a bond, I think the market would react
pretty positively. It&#8217;s a question of how we move out of
there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian capital outflows rose to $50.6 billion in the first
quarter as President Vladimir Putin annexed Crimea and as
tensions with the U.S. and European Union rose before the May 25
presidential election in Ukraine. So far, the sanctions have
targeted politicians and businessmen with interests in energy,
construction and banking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If political uncertainty continues, Grafe said the &#8220;risk-adjusted cost of capital&#8221; will go higher and that affects
companies&#8217; credit ratings and has an impact on investment
decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market has rallied quite a bit but the problem is no
one really knows where the  sanctions are going,&#8221; Grafe said.
&#8220;It&#8217;s not black and white.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An asset management firm founded by
former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) partner Vishal Gupta sued UBS
AG (UBSN), saying investment banking cuts at the Swiss lender have
undermined a joint venture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decura IM Investments LLP is seeking to terminate a 2012
contract under which it would provide &#8220;managed accounts&#8221; and
&#8220;algorithmic strategies&#8221; for UBS customers, according to the
bank&#8217;s documents at a pre-trial hearing in London today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS has undertaken a &#8220;drastic downscaling and disposal of
its investment banking arm,&#8221; Decura&#8217;s lawyer Andrew Fulton told
a judge as he sought an accelerated trial in the dispute.
London-based Decura argues the bank is now &#8220;unable to market
the services we are providing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS, Switzerland&#8217;s biggest lender, has cut about 4,000 jobs
since late 2012 and is exiting most debt-trading activities
while focusing on its wealth management business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Swiss bank said in court documents it &#8220;has not exited
material product areas and maintains strong relationships in the
relevant client areas.&#8221; Gupta didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an
e-mail seeking comment and UBS spokeswoman Hana Dunn declined to
comment on the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS lawyer Adrian Beltrami told the court it was too soon
to set a timetable for the litigation and the bank needed more
details about the claim. &#8220;The appropriate course is for a
proper pleading of this case and a proper defense.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Richard Field said there should be another pre-trial
hearing in July, when the court would consider the possibility
of holding a trial in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Falling Out &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decura and UBS had &#8220;something of a falling out even before
the venture was up-and-running,&#8221; Fulton said at the hearing.
Hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue from the agreement
are at risk and Decura is in a &#8220;position of limbo&#8221; until the
issue is resolved, Fulton said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The venture isn&#8217;t generating any money and an exclusivity
arrangement means Decura can&#8217;t look elsewhere, according to its
court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decura Group was founded in 2012 by Gupta, who previously
worked at Goldman Sachs in a variety of roles including head of
credit and equity exotics and fund derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is: Decura Im Investments LLP  Ors v UBS AG
London Branch, High Court of Justice, Queen&#8217;s Bench Division
Commercial Court, 14-561 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Squire Sanders and Patton Boggs LLP
are merging to create a new law firm that will be among the 25
biggest in the world with about 1,600 lawyers in 21 countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement that the new firm will be called Squire
Patton Boggs comes two weeks after Patton Boggs agreed to pay
$15 million to settle Chevron Corp.&#8217;s (CVX) lawsuit over the firm&#8217;s
involvement in obtaining a $9.5 billion judgment against the oil
company in Ecuador. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination is part of a trend of &#8220;continuing robust
merger activity&#8221; in 2014 after a &#8220;banner year&#8221; in 2013,
according to data compiled by law firm consultancy Altman Weil.
The organization reported 88 law firm mergers last year, up from
60 in both 2011 and 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The merger will transform the brand of Squire Sanders
&#8220;from being an Ohio firm to being a Washington, D.C., firm,&#8221;
law firm consultant Peter Zeughauser said yesterday. While
Patton Boggs is known as a &#8220;lobby shop,&#8221; it also has a strong
practice advising Middle Eastern sovereign funds in their
investments around the globe, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue and profitability at Patton Boggs, which has about
400 lawyers, had declined consistently over the past five years,
Zeughauser said. Even after a restructuring improved its
prospects, it &#8220;needed to combine with a stronger firm to be
sustainable,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Failed Efforts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zeughauser said he advised Patton Boggs on the
restructuring and in other previous failed merger efforts,
though he hasn&#8217;t consulted the firm during the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim Maiwurm, Squire Sanders Chairman and Global Chief
Executive Officer, said yesterday in a statement that the
combination with Patton Boggs will create the &#8220;&#8216;go-to firm for
public policy work.&#8217;&#8217; The merger is expected to take effect by
June 1, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patton Boggs specializes in government relations, lobbying
and regulatory practices, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ed Newberry, Managing Partner of Patton Boggs, said Squire
Sanders&#8217;s financial markets expertise in North and South
America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East made it attractive.
Squire Sanders has about 1,300 lawyers in 39 offices across 19
countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patton Boggs entertained other offers. It announced in
December that merger talks were called off with Locke Lord LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dentons, a 2,600-lawyer international firm formed a year
ago through the combination of Salans LLP, Fraser Milner
Casgrain LLP and SNR Denton, said last month that it was
interested in expanding further through a combination with
Patton Boggs. Dentons expressed interest after Patton Boggs had
already announced merger discussions with Squire Sanders in
February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ecuador Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Ecuador case, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in
New York on March 4 ruled that an attorney from another firm,
Steven Donziger, had resorted to bribery and fraud in procuring
the Chevron judgment in Ecuador that held the oil company liable
for polluting the Amazon rain forest. Donziger is appealing the
decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaplan&#8217;s ruling &#8216;&#8216;includes a number of factual findings
about matters which would have materially affected our firm&#8217;s
decision to become involved and stay involved as counsel,&#8221;
Patton Boggs said in a statement. &#8220;Patton Boggs regrets its
involvement in this matter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 29, Kaplan threw out Patton Boggs&#8217;s claim that San
Ramon, California-based Chevron maliciously sued the firm for
pursuing collection of the judgment. The law firm, which
provided as much as $15 million to finance the Ecuador
litigation, had sought access to $21.8 million Chevron had been
ordered to post as a bond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chevron case is Patton Boggs LLP v. Chevron Corp., 12-cv-09176, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). The racketeering case is Chevron Corp. v. Donziger,
11-cv-00691, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 63 percent rally in Qiwi Plc (QIWI) in
less than four weeks may be just the beginning for the
electronic-payment processor as Russia eases restrictions that
could have crimped its revenue, according to OAO Gazprombank and
InvestCafe LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qiwi&#8217;s American depositary receipts have surged to $43.85
on May 23 from a nine-month low of $26.89 on April 28. The ADRs
plunged earlier this year as Russia moved to tighten control of
payment systems and imposed rules that could increase the cost
of doing business for U.S.-based credit card companies including
Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc. The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity
Index increased 4.5 percent in its fourth consecutive weekly
gain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers dropped some provisions that could have limited
online payments as they approved anti-money laundering
legislation last month. Visa and MasterCard said on May 23 that
they&#8217;ll keep working in Russia after the government agreed to
consider easing demands made on them after the U.S. imposed
sanctions linked to the country&#8217;s standoff with Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Traders are shifting their focus to Qiwi&#8217;s fundamentals
as the credit card companies&#8217; decision to remain in Russia
signals an improving business environment,&#8221; Sergey Vasin, an
analyst at Gazprombank, said by phone from Moscow on May 23.
&#8220;The trend is positive for Qiwi through the end of the year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vasin said he has begun covering Qiwi and expects to issue
a recommendation and target price next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company works in partnership with Visa, providing co-branded accounts marketed under the name Visa Qiwi Wallet. Those
accounts increased increased 20 percent in the first quarter to
15.6 million, Qiwi Chief Executive Officer Sergey Solonin said
on a May 21 conference call with analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Growth Forecast &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Visa and MasterCard stopped processing payments at
four Russian banks in March as the U.S. imposed sanctions,
Russia passed a law creating its own national payment system and
imposing rules for foreign companies that include fining them
for denying services. Solonin said Qiwi doesn&#8217;t expect any of
the new legislation to have much of an impact on its business in
Russia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qiwi, which had more than tripled after it was listed in
New York a year ago, expects net profit to increase between 27
percent and 29 percent in 2014, according to its May 21 earnings
statement. Adjusted net revenue increased 46 percent in the
first quarter to 1.9 billion rubles ($55.6 million). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors are focusing on Qiwi&#8217;s improved growth forecast
for this year and away from the fading geopolitical risks,&#8221;
Timur Nigmatullin, an analyst at Moscow-based research firm
InvestCafe, said by phone on May 22. He raised Qiwi to buy from
hold on May 23, setting a price target at $52.37 per share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Analyst Ratings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qiwi&#8217;s 14-day relative strength index reached a nine-month
high of 80.5 on May 22. When a security&#8217;s RSI rises above 70,
it&#8217;s a signal to some analysts that it is poised to fall. The
stock has seven buy ratings and three holds, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The 28 percent advance in the five days
ended May 23 was the biggest weekly gain since its initial
public offering a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg index of the most-traded Russian stocks in
the U.S. increased to 88.75 on May 23 to complete the longest
streak of weekly gains in 10 months. OAO RusHydro, the renewable
energy producer, led the advance, jumping 19 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;United Co. Rusal (486), a Moscow-based aluminum producer,
was little changed at HK$3.24 in Hong Kong trading as of
11:25 a.m. local time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.2
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Poroshenko Wins &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian stocks had gained as concern eased that Ukraine&#8217;s
presidential election would be disrupted. President Vladimir
Putin said on May 23 in St. Petersburg that Russia will work
with the next Ukrainian president, even though the vote won&#8217;t
meet international standards, after saying he&#8217;s withdrawing
troops from the border. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ukrainians elected billionaire Petro Poroshenko as
president, two exit polls showed yesterday, handing him the task
of stemming deadly separatist violence that&#8217;s threatening to rip
the former Soviet republic apart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poroshenko garnered more than half of the vote, avoiding a
runoff with as much as 57.3 percent support, according to the
surveys. Ex-Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko came second out of
21 candidates with 12-13 percent backing, the polls showed.
While most in Ukraine&#8217;s easternmost regions didn&#8217;t vote,
Poroshenko&#8217;s success was welcomed in the U.S. and Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drama in Ukraine will weigh on investors&#8217; risk appetite
and shareholders in Qiwi are exposed to regulatory changes,
according to David Riedel, founder of the Riedel Research Group
Inc. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Russian equities will continue to be shunned by most
investors other than the bravest and most adventurous,&#8221; he said
by e-mail on May 23. &#8220;I would be cautious on the enthusiasm for
Qiwi payment system as the regulations and control there can be
implemented very quickly if that avenue is being used to
transfer money to avoid scrutiny.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX), the biggest U.S. exchange-traded fund that holds Russian shares, jumped 5.4 percent last
week to $25.72, the highest level since February. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saudi Telecom Co. (STC) hired Standard
Chartered Plc, JPMorgan Chase  Co. and NCB Capital to market
its debut Islamic bond as companies in the oil-rich kingdom
increasingly tap the debt market for funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks will manage the potential sale under a 5-billion
riyal ($1.3 billion) sukuk program, Saudi Telecom said in a
statement today. The size of the private local placement will
depend on market conditions, it said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabian companies are diversifying their financing
sources as the Arab world&#8217;s biggest economy spends billions of
dollars to develop infrastructure. Banque Saudi Fransi, the
lender part owned by Credit Agricole SA, is planning to raise
about 2 billion riyals to bolster its capital base, while Saudi
airliner Flynas is considering a sukuk sale to fund its
expansion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While riyal-denominated local private placements have been
the preferred option for many companies, others have started to
venture into sales abroad. Saudi Electricity Co., (SECO) the state-owned utility, last month raised $2.5 billion from sale of two-part sukuk to international investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Telecom&#8217;s sukuk plan comes after Mohammad Al
Kharashi, the governor of the state-run Public Pension Agency,
earlier this month said he welcomed more sukuk offerings. The
power utility, majority owned by the government, reported a 54
percent increase in first-quarter profit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), operator of a $19
billion liquefied natural gas project in Papua New Guinea, is
talking to customers in Asia about selling cargoes on the spot
market as demand traditionally rises over summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon expects an LNG cargo from the project every four to
six days, Decie Autin, Exxon&#8217;s project executive in Papua New
Guinea, said today in a a phone interview. The next shipment
will go to CPC Corp. of Taiwan, she said. The first one has left
the country headed to Tokyo Electric Power Co. in Japan, Exxon
said earlier today in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are a few other customers we&#8217;re talking to, and
Asia is clearly the focus,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll sell on the spot
market until we&#8217;re comfortable we&#8217;ve got reliable, sustainable
sales. We&#8217;re not seeing any issues with placing our cargoes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spot LNG prices in northeast Asia fell to $13.50 a million
British thermal units, their lowest since October 2012, in the
week to May 19, according to World Gas Intelligence assessments
of cargoes for delivery in four to eight weeks published May 21.
They reached $19.70 in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon and its partners, including Oil Search Ltd. (OSH) and
Santos Ltd. (STO), are considering expansion of the development to tap
Asian demand. Exxon is focused on exploration to underpin an
expansion rather than trying to obtain gas from InterOil Corp.&#8217;s
Elk and Antelope gas discoveries, Autin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santos rose 1.1 percent to close at A$14.36 in Sydney
trading, while Oil Search climbed 1.1 percent to A$9.40. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Second Development &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total SA and InterOil want to build a second export
development in Papua New Guinea based on gas from the Elk and
Antelope fields. Oil Search also agreed earlier this year to
acquire part of those fields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It looks like they have a deal, it looks like they&#8217;re
building a greenfield facility, and to my knowledge, that&#8217;s a
go, and something that&#8217;s happening,&#8221; Autin said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know
of a lot of opportunity there&#8221; for Exxon, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil Search has contested Total&#8217;s agreement to buy part of
InterOil&#8217;s project, saying the deal breached its pre-emptive
rights. The possibility of Oil Search blocking Total sparked
speculation Exxon could enter the Elk and Antelope license. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LNG market will remain tight until at least 2015,
according to the International Energy Agency. Spot and short-term LNG trade increased to 27.4 percent of the total last year
from 25 percent in 2012, according to the International Group of
Liquefied Natural Gas Importers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importers typically purchase more spot shipments in June
through September to meet increased power needs amid hotter
weather during summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Exxon project is expected to reach full capacity in
four to six weeks, Autin said. The development has long-term
contracts with four major customers, Tokyo Electric Power, CPC,
Osaka Gas Co. and China Petroleum  Chemical Corp. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government is reviewing whether domestic banks&#8217; reliance on high-end servers from International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) compromises the nation&#8217;s financial security, people familiar with the matter said, in an escalation of the dispute with the U.S. over spying claims. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Government agencies, including the People&#8217;s Bank of China and the Ministry of Finance, are asking banks to remove the IBM servers and replace them with a local brand as part of a trial program, said the four people, who asked not to be identified because the review hasn&#8217;t been made public. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The review comes a week after American prosecutors indicted five Chinese military officers for allegedly hacking into the computers of U.S. companies and stealing secrets, while former contractor Edward Snowden&#8217;s revelations last June of a National Security Agency spying program already hurt U.S. technology sales in China. Last week, China&#8217;s government said it will vet technology companies operating in the country, while the Financial Times reported May 25 that China ordered state-owned companies to cut ties with U.S. consulting firms. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;IBM is not aware of any Chinese government policy recommending against the use of IBM servers within the country&#8217;s banking industry,&#8221; Jeff Cross, a spokesman for IBM, said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;In fact, news reports now state that China&#8217;s National Development and Reform Commission has not heard of any alleged directive to that effect. IBM is a trusted partner in China and has been for more than 30 years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fabrice Tourre, the former Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) vice president found liable for his part in
selling a pre-crisis mortgage security that lost value, said he
won&#8217;t file an appeal in the civil case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While my lawyers have advised me there are strong grounds
to appeal, I prefer to move forward with my education and close
this difficult chapter of my life,&#8221; Tourre said in a statement
today. &#8220;I look forward to finishing my Ph.D. in economics and
to making meaningful contributions to my field.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre, 35, was found liable Aug. 1 after a jury trial at
which the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission claimed he
intentionally misled investors in a subprime-mortgage vehicle
called Abacus 2007-AC1. In March, he was ordered to pay more
than $825,000 in penalties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was one of the government&#8217;s most prominent
efforts to fix responsibility for the housing market crash,
which helped precipitate the worst economic downturn since the
1930s. Critics have faulted the SEC for not doing more to police
the abuses that helped lead to the crisis or to pursue top
financial executives they say are responsible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which paid Tourre&#8217;s legal fees, settled SEC
claims over the Abacus transaction in July 2010 for $550
million, a record at the time. No senior Goldman Sachs
executives were questioned in Tourre&#8217;s trial. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest proposed deal in drug
industry history is dead. Or, dead for now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the largest U.S. drugmaker, yesterday
abandoned its effort to buy AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) for 69.4 billion
pounds ($117 billion), saying the public bid rejected by its
London-based competitor represented &#8220;full value.&#8221; AstraZeneca
said it welcomed &#8220;the opportunity to continue building on the
momentum we have already demonstrated.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under U.K. takeover rules, Pfizer had until 5 p.m. London
time yesterday to make a firm offer. The regulations now require
a cooling-off period of at least three months before talks can
restart, giving both drugmakers time to decide what happens
next. Pfizer hopes AstraZeneca&#8217;s investors will push the
company&#8217;s board to come to the table, while AstraZeneca faces
pressure to deliver on its promises of a productive roster of
experimental medicines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is quite a decent chance actually that there will
be a deal later this year, most likely I would say after three
months,&#8221; Erik Hultgard, an analyst with Nordea Bank AB in
Stockholm, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;There was quite a
small spread between what the board said they could accept and
what Pfizer actually wanted to pay. There are likely
shareholders on both sides that want this to happen.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the world&#8217;s
biggest investment bank by revenue, said a pair of wrong-way
bets made by clients at the start of the year is partly to blame
for Wall Street&#8217;s trading slowdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the biggest wagers included shorting Japan&#8217;s
currency and betting that U.S. interest rates would rise more
steeply than those in Europe, according to Daniel Pinto, head of
the New York-based firm&#8217;s corporate and investment bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Neither of those trades paid,&#8221; Pinto, 51, said today at
an investor conference in New York. &#8220;Essentially you start the
year with the wrong momentum, where you lose money at the very
beginning, and you ended up with probably a lower risk appetite
than you would have otherwise.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan warned investors earlier this month that second-quarter markets revenue will probably drop about 20 percent from
a year earlier, after a 21 percent tumble in fixed-income,
currencies and commodities trading in the first quarter. That
would amount to JPMorgan&#8217;s worst first half for trading since
the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason for the lackluster results is reduced
volatility, which has dropped to the lowest in 10 to 15 years
for rates, currencies and credit trading, Pinto said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &#8220;the market doesn&#8217;t move, it&#8217;s really difficult to
monetize your flows,&#8221; Pinto said. &#8220;It makes the market more
competitive and margins really tighten because it costs you very
little to provide liquidity, so you provide a lot.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Episodic Trades &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clients appear to be hesitating in placing the larger
hedges that typically happen earlier in the year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You have episodic trades, big hedges, big corporate
trades, that happen along the year,&#8221; Pinto said. &#8220;Particularly
in the first and part of the second, the amount of those trades,
even though the pipeline is very healthy, they haven&#8217;t happened.
It looks like they are going to happen later in the year, and
that is a big swing factor.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry&#8217;s shrinking results are being caused more by
low volatility and monetary policy than by new regulations, he
said, adding that investment banks may have to wait until 2016
before revenue improves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Probably we will have a flattish year next year, and then
probably with all that we talked about before -- markets will
grow, normalization of interest rates -- all that will sort of
bring revenues up again,&#8221; Pinto said. &#8220;It&#8217;s probably a bit
more down the line.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Democrats in Congress are trying to block companies from cutting their tax bills by moving their legal address outside the U.S. through a merger. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Companies are forging ahead anyway. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re working on a lot of deals that have this element to it,&#8221; said Robert Profusek, head of the mergers and acquisitions group at Jones Day in New York. &#8220;Nobody&#8217;s said, &#8216;Stop the music.&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lawmakers upset about so-called inversions are pledging that any limits they pass will be retroactive, to May 8. They haven&#8217;t attracted a single Republican supporter. That lack of bipartisanship has led companies and their advisers to shrug and keep planning similar transactions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since Jan. 1, 2012, 14 companies have completed or announced such deals. Investors are pressuring other companies such as Walgreen Co. to consider the idea at a pace that hasn&#8217;t slowed since Senators Carl Levin of Michigan and Ron Wyden of Oregon called for retroactive tax laws. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How U.S. Companies Buy Tax Breaks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed deal that piqued congressional interest this month was Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s bid to buy AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), take advantage of the lower U.K. tax rate and leave its top executives in New York. AstraZeneca rejected Pfizer&#8217;s offers, and Pfizer ended its bid yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

The U.S. Capitol stands surrounded by fog in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Thursday, March 20, 2014. Dozens of tax breaks that lapsed Dec. 31 would be revived in a plan to be presented soon by the new chairman of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee. The committee probably will hold a vote during the week of March 31, said a Democratic aide to the panel. Close

&lt;p&gt;Whelan Metals LLC, founded by a
former co-owner of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s warehouse company,
obtained approval from the London Metal Exchange to store
industrial metals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whelan&#8217;s first LME warehouse is in Detroit and will hold
aluminum, North American aluminum alloy, nickel, lead and zinc,
the LME said in a notice to members today. The Canton, Michigan-based company is part of W.F. Whelan Co., an automotive parts
warehousing and brokerage company in Detroit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman said last week it was exploring the sale of Metro,
joining JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Morgan Stanley in cutting back
in commodities as Mercuria Energy Trading SA and Gunvor Group
Ltd. expand. The Federal Reserve has said it&#8217;s considering new
limits on trading and warehousing of physical commodities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The uncertainty of the regulatory landscape, particularly
in the U.S., means you&#8217;re going to see more non-financial, more
lightly or not regulated companies perhaps like Whelan moving
into the warehousing space,&#8221; said Robin Bhar, an analyst at
Societe Generale SA in London. &#8220;There will always be companies
looking at warehousing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Whelan, the president of the company, founded Metro
International Trade Services LLC with Ed Schulak in 1991. Metro
stores most of the aluminum in Detroit LME-licensed warehouses,
according to exchange data. The wait time to withdraw aluminum
from Metro&#8217;s warehouses in the city was 683 days, or 98 weeks,
at the end of April, according to an LME report this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whelan Metals may expand beyond Detroit, Whelan said last
year. He wasn&#8217;t available for comment today and didn&#8217;t return an
e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTG Pactual Commodities Warehousing LLC was approved by the
LME to store metals in Detroit in April. Scale Distribution Ltd.
in Liverpool, England, added depots in Detroit in January. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., whose
contrarian call late last year that the yen would rally in the
first half of 2014 has proved prescient, is sticking with its
forecast for a second-half rout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tohru Sasaki, the company&#8217;s Tokyo-based head of Japan rates
and currency research, said he senses Prime Minister Shinzo Abe&#8217;s structural reforms, which include corporate tax cuts, will
bear fruit. That&#8217;s the last of the so-called three arrows of
Abe&#8217;s road map for breaking the economy free from persistent
deflation and slow growth. The first two are fiscal stimulus and
record monetary easing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Global investors are obviously very disappointed in
Abenomics right now, but the third arrow is still moving
forward,&#8221; Sasaki, 46, said by phone on May 23. &#8220;If the
Japanese economy is getting stronger, then Japanese investors
become more confident in the future and take more risks, and
invest more in foreign assets,&#8221; weakening the yen, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Betting on a lower yen has been one of the biggest losing
trades in global markets this year, along with calls for higher
bond yields, as the global economy failed to strengthen as much
as forecast and geopolitical events including Ukraine&#8217;s conflict
with Russia flared. The yen -- a haven in times of crisis --
gained 3.1 percent against 10 developed-nation peers tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes this year, while the
dollar and euro have fallen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Third Arrow &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yen failed to extend its almost 17 percent slide last
year versus the basket as the Bank of Japan refrained from
printing more money to expand 70 trillion yen ($687 billion)  of
annual asset purchases and as the impact of government spending
waned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abe has also been perceived as slow to reveal his
structural reforms. The nation&#8217;s economy will probably expand
1.35 percent this year, compared with 2.5 percent in the U.S.,
surveys by Bloomberg show. The Wall Street Journal quoted BOJ
Governor Haruhiko Kuroda as saying there are limits to the
central bank&#8217;s ability to spur growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There has been considerable disappointment in the third
arrow,&#8221; Steven Englander, the New York-based global head of
Group of 10 foreign-exchange strategy at Citigroup Inc., wrote
in a note to clients on May 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fell 0.2 percent today to 102.11 per dollar at 12:27
p.m. in New York, compared with this year&#8217;s weakest level of
105.44 on Jan. 2. In December, when the median estimate of
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for the currency to
depreciate to 104 by the end of June, Sasaki said it would
actually reach 100. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Easing Expectations &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sasaki, a former central-bank official, now expects the
currency to finish the year at 106, similar to his forecast in
December and a level unseen since October 2008. Analysts in the
latest Bloomberg survey see it dropping to 107 by Dec. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#8217;s still a chance the yen will extend gains in coming
weeks, according to Sasaki. While 44 percent of 32 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg forecast the BOJ will add to stimulus in
July, including those at JPMorgan, Sasaki said that will have
little power to weaken the currency. Instead, he sees potential
for a lack of action to boost the yen to 97. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Whatever comes from the BOJ will not be as powerful as
last year, so markets will probably be disappointed, and will be
forced to unwind yen short positions,&#8221; said Sasaki, who worked
at the central bank from 1992 to 2003. &#8220;Even if the BOJ does
something in July, it&#8217;s already priced in.&#8221; A short position is
a bet an asset will decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abe&#8217;s Ninja &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference in the number of wagers by hedge funds and
other large speculators on a drop in the yen versus the dollar
compared with those on a gain -- known as net shorts -- fell to
53,787 on May 20, the least since November 2012, figures from
the Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission show.
The net shorts reached 143,822 on Dec. 24. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BOJ has been buying about 7 trillion yen of sovereign
debt a month since Kuroda started the so-called quantitative and
qualitative easing program in April last year, and refrained
from adding stimulus in a meeting on May 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sasaki expects Abe to make progress on structural reforms,
such as a proposed corporate tax cut and relaxing regulations
for business, that he says will, over time, boost corporate
profits and improve investors&#8217; risk appetite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The first and second arrows were big injections of pain
killer but the third arrow is like acupuncture, with many small
needles,&#8221; Sasaki said. &#8220;It takes time and it&#8217;s hard to see the
effects but eventually it improves your health.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s a view shared by Societe Generale SA, which sees the
yen weakening to 110 per dollar in a year as Abe&#8217;s changes take
hold and the Federal Reserve reduces stimulus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The third arrow is like a ninja -- you cannot see it but
it&#8217;s there,&#8221; Takuji Aida, the French bank&#8217;s chief economist in
Tokyo, said in phone interview today. &#8220;The growth strategy is
something you will feel the impact of very gradually, over a
long period of time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia is urging lenders to
boost capital reserves, which are already above those of global
peers including JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Citigroup Inc, to
support lending growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lending in the oil-rich country is expected to increase
more than 10 percent a year until 2017, according to Arqaam
Capital Ltd. National Commercial Bank this year raised $1.3
billion through bonds, making it the strongest start to a year
for bank issuance since 2007, as Central Bank Governor Fahad Al Mubarak seeks higher capital ratios. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency continues to encourage
Saudi banks to build up higher levels of capital adequacy,&#8221; Al
Mubarak said May 21 in response to e-mailed questions. &#8220;Banks
should anticipate that current and future economic growth will
lead to increased credit demand.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kingdom&#8217;s economy is expanding about four times faster
than the euro area as the government spends $130 billion to
build new homes and boost the non-oil economy. Banque Saudi
Fransi is planning to raise about 2 billion riyals ($533
million) to bolster Tier 2 capital, used to cushion against
future losses, two people familiar with the matter said May 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Well Capitalized&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi British Bank, part-owned by HSBC Holdings Plc, and
Saudi Hollandi Bank have also sold Islamic bonds in the past six
months, taking advantage of lower funding costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average yield on Middle East sukuk declined 53 basis
points this year to 4.11 percent, the lowest since June,
according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. indexes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some banks &#8220;will raise more capital this year to fully
comply with new regulatory requirements,&#8221; Jamal Al Kishi, chief
executive officer of Deutsche Bank Securities Saudi Arabia, said
yesterday. &#8220;Broadly speaking, banks in Saudi Arabia are well
capitalized.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeddah-based Bank Al Jazira had a capital ratio of 15
percent at the end of 2013, the lowest of the 11 publicly traded
banks in the kingdom, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That was still higher than JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s at 14.5 percent and
Citigroup Inc. (C)&#8217;s at 12.3 percent at the end of March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia is following Sweden, which already imposes
some of the world&#8217;s strictest bank standards. The Swedish
Financial Services Authority will raise capital requirements
further in order to protect taxpayers from future financial
crises, it said earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;SAMA always prefers more capital and is a strong
proponent of countercyclical measures,&#8221; David Dew, managing
director at Saudi British Bank, said in an interview in Riyadh
on May 5. &#8220;Saudi banks are among the strongest in the world.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese server maker Inspur Group Ltd. started a campaign to lure customers from International Business Machines Corp. as the government studies if domestic banks&#8217; reliance on IBM technology threatens national security. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jinan-based Inspur this week unveiled its &#8220;IBM to Inspur&#8221; initiative aimed at taking the U.S. company&#8217;s market share in China, said a member of Inspur&#8217;s marketing department who asked not to be named citing company policy. Inspur hired more than 80 employees from IBM&#8217;s hardware arm, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The move may help Inspur capitalize on a growing dispute with the U.S. after prosecutors there charged five Chinese military officers with allegedly hacking American companies. Toppling IBM in China would be a major challenge for Inspur, whose reported 36.7 billion yuan ($5.9 billion) of revenue in 2011 was equivalent to 5.5 percent of IBM&#8217;s sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There aren&#8217;t that many alternatives for high-end banking servers, so it&#8217;s quite hard to find replacements,&#8221; Arthur Hsieh, an analyst at UBS in Taiwan, said by phone. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The People&#8217;s Bank of China, the Ministry of Finance and other government agencies are reviewing domestic banks&#8217; use of IBM servers and expanding a trial program to replace them with homegrown ones, four people familiar with the matter said May 27. China Postal Savings Bank Co. is using Inspur servers as part of the trial, which began in March 2013, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), which this month extended its partnership with Russia&#8217;s OAO Rosneft (ROSN), hasn&#8217;t had to change its business in the country amid Ukraine-related sanctions and said such steps are typically ineffective. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t find them to be effective unless they are very well implemented,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson said today during a shareholders meeting in Dallas. Authorities imposing the sanctions should consider &#8220;who are they really harming?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon is among American oil producers that ignored U.S. State Department recommendations to skip an energy forum in St. Petersburg last week as it extended a pact with Rosneft involving drilling for crude in the Arctic and Siberia. Exxon, through a 2011 deal with the state-run crude producer, owns drilling rights across 11.4 million acres of Russian land, including vast swaths of the Kara Sea. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. and European nations have imposed sanctions to punish Vladimir Putin&#8217;s regime for its actions in Ukraine. Among those targeted was Rosneft Chief Executive Officer Igor Sechin. Measures from President Barack Obama&#8217;s administration included asset freezes and bans on travel to the U.S. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Travel Ban &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The travel ban on Sechin has so far not affected collaboration with Exxon, which is currently working with Rosneft to drill an exploratory well in the Arctic this year, Tillerson said. The companies&#8217; partnership gives Rosneft the ability to buy stakes in Exxon&#8217;s North American projects in exchange for Exxon&#8217;s access to the Russian Arctic. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have plenty of meetings with them in Russia,&#8221; Tillerson said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not impacted our ability to carry on the other business activities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Irving, Texas-based producer is the biggest U.S. player in Russia, where it has a series of joint ventures with Rosneft. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Zain Shauk in Houston at zshauk@bloomberg.net &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the editors responsible for this story: Susan Warren at susanwarren@bloomberg.net; Tina Davis at tinadavis@bloomberg.net Carlos Caminada, Steven Frank &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&#8217;s the problem facing hedge funds investing in the stock market this year, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. chief equity strategist David Kostin: the sand box they like to play in has gotten a lot smaller. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, equity hedge fund managers tend to have about a quarter of their investments in consumer-discretionary stocks, Kostin told Erik Schatzker and Stephanie Ruhle on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;Market Makers&#8221; program today. The dispersion of returns within that group is too small for managers on the prowl for stocks to buy or short, Kostin said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The opportunity set, the sand box, the swimming pool is very, very small,&#8221; Kostin said. &#8220;It&#8217;s been a very difficult year from a stock-selection perspective.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The biggest gain among consumer-discretionary stocks over the past three months has been a 10 percent advance in Nordstrom Inc. and the biggest loss has been a 17 percent drop in International Game Technology. That 27 percentage point dispersion of returns compares with a 71 percentage point difference during the same period last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217; basket of the 50 stocks favored by hedge funds has underperformed the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index (SPX) by about 2 percentage points so far this year after beating the market for 13 straight years, according to Kostin. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Glamor Stocks&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some of the more richly valued &#8220;glamor stocks&#8221; have dropped down or off the list of hedge-fund ownership, according to Kostin, as managers become more value-oriented. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ), Walgreen Co., American Realty Capital Properties Inc., CF Industries Holdings Inc., Forest Laboratories Inc., Halliburton Co., Cheniere Energy Inc., News Corp. and SunEdison Inc. were added to the firm&#8217;s Hedge Fund VIP Basket, according to a May 21 report. Express Scripts Holding Co., Gilead Sciences Inc., Visa Inc., Cole Real Estate Investment Inc., Liberty Global Plc, MasterCard Inc. (MA), Ocwen Financial Corp., T-Mobile US Inc. and Vodafone Group Plc were dropped. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kostin said, as a whole, he believes the market is fairly valued currently as the SP 500 trades about 11 points above his year-end forecast. The median stock in the SP 500 sells for about 17 times estimated earnings over the next 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While &#8220;that&#8217;s expensive on a historical basis,&#8221; Kostin said growing profits will keep equities rising &#8220;modestly toward the upside.&#8221; The strategist expects the SP 500 to reach 2,100 by the end of next year and 2,200 by the end of 2016. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This should give everyone plenty to talk about if they run into Bill Ackman or David Einhorn in the sand box. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To contact the reporter on this story: Michael P.

&lt;p&gt;Ian Hannam, once a top JPMorgan Chase
 Co. (JPM) mining adviser, lost his bid to overturn a market-abuse
fine from British regulators in a win for the watchdog as it
attempts to go after senior bankers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hannam&#8217;s messages with a potential client &#8220;were not in the
proper course of the exercise of his employment,&#8221; the court
said in a ruling published yesterday, upholding the reasoning
behind a 450,000-pound ($752,000) fine levied by the U.K.
Financial Conduct Authority two years ago. The amount of the
penalty will be reviewed separately, the court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hannam, global chairman of equity capital markets at the
time, e-mailed a potential customer in 2008 with details of a
bid for his client, Heritage Oil Plc, as well as news of an oil
find. The Financial Conduct Authority, then known as the
Financial Services Authority, deemed the exchanges insider
information and fined the banker in April 2012 for market abuse,
prompting him to step down from his post in JPMorgan&#8217;s Cazenove
unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I am obviously disappointed that the tribunal has
rejected the explanation as to why the two e-mails sent in the
course of advising and assisting my client did not contravene
the rules,&#8221; Hannam, 58, said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;I was
indeed acting only in the interests of my client.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tribunal asked Hannam and the regulator to submit
arguments on how much the fine should be to determine whether or
not to change the amount of the penalty, the FCA said in an e-mailed statement today in response to the decision. Hannam can
appeal the court&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Looking Good&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hannam e-mailed Dr. Ashti Hawrami, the Kurdish Regional
Government&#8217;s natural resources minister, in September and
October 2008 informing him of a potential third party bid for
Heritage Oil and positive developments in the company&#8217;s oil
exploration. The e-mails were sent when Hawrami might have been
interested in taking a stake in Heritage, qualifying the
disclosures as inside information, according to the FCA&#8217;s
penalty notice from 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I thought I would update you on discussions that have
been going on with a potential acquirer,&#8221; Hannam told Hawrami
in the September e-mail, according to the judgment. &#8220;I believe
that the offer will come in in the current difficult market
conditions at &#163;3.50 - &#163;4.00 per share. I am not trying to force
your hand, just wanted to make you aware of what is happening.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hannam sent Hawrami another e-mail in October to tell him
Tony Buckingham, Heritage&#8217;s chief executive officer, has &#8220;just
found oil and it is looking good.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) President
Gary Cohn said low volatility and interest rates that are
holding in tight ranges have resulted in an &#8220;abnormal&#8221; trading
market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The environment for all the firms is quite difficult
right now,&#8221; Cohn, 53, said today at an investor conference in
New York. &#8220;What drives activity in our business is volatility.
If markets never move or don&#8217;t move, our clients really don&#8217;t
need to transact.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C) Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach, 60,
said yesterday that second-quarter trading revenue could fall as
much as 25 percent from year-earlier levels, and JPMorgan Chase
 Co. (JPM) estimated a 20 percent drop earlier this month. Cohn
stopped short of forecasting the decline for New York-based
Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think, at the end of the day, it&#8217;s economic in
nature,&#8221; Cohn said of the cause of lower client volume. &#8220;We
don&#8217;t have clear vision of economic growth or lack of growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohn said while his firm has been gaining market share
among clients in the trading business, the lack of activity has
kept that from translating into higher revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low interest rates and the Federal Reserve&#8217;s program of
quantitative easing have resulted in reduced volatility, Cohn
said. He pointed to the Chicago Board Options Exchange
Volatility Index, a gauge of U.S. stock volatility known as the
VIX, which is trading 40 percent below its historical average.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note traded over the past
three months in its narrowest band in the 35 years, Cohn said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buy Brazilian stocks because the country is going to win the World Cup, giving a boost to the local equity market. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., whose analysts said the host nation&#8217;s chances of winning the most-watched sports event this year are more than three times higher than the next most likely team, neighboring Argentina. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brazil will beat Argentina 3-1 in the final after they see off Germany and Spain in the semifinals, Goldman analysts including Jan Hatzius and Sven Jari Stehn said in a report. The host nation has a 48.5 percent probability of winning the FIFA tournament, followed by Argentina on 14.1 percent and Germany on 11.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More on the 2014 World Cup:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The win will boost the country&#8217;s stock markets in the weeks after the final, based on history, Peter Oppenheimer and other Goldman strategists wrote in the note. But investors may need to move fast as the gains won&#8217;t last, they said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The victor country&#8217;s equity markets outperform global stocks by 3.5 percent on average in the first month after winning, &#8220;although the outperformance fades significantly after three months,&#8221; according to the analysts. The winning nation sees its stock market underperform global markets by around 4 percent on average over the year following the final. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The message seems to be: enjoy the gains while they last,&#8221; Oppenheimer said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s benchmark Ibovespa index has fallen almost 7 percent in the past year, which compares with a 15 percent gain by the SP 500 and a 12 percent advance by Europe&#8217;s Stoxx 600. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Brazil Favored &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s top economic forecaster is
challenging calls from banks such as JPMorgan Chase  Co. and
Deutsche Bank that policy makers will end the world&#8217;s longest
tightening cycle, saying faster inflation will motivate them to
boost interest rates for a 10th straight meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fernando Fix, chief economist at Votorantim Asset
Management in Sao Paulo, estimates central bankers will raise
interest rates by a quarter point to 11.25 percent when the two-day meeting ends today after 6 p.m. local time. That puts him at
odds with the median estimate of 53 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg and traders, who say there&#8217;s an 80 percent chance the
central bank will hold the benchmark Selic at 11 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer prices in the world&#8217;s second-largest emerging
market have accelerated in the past four months as service costs
push annual inflation to the highest level in 10 months. Policy
makers will continue to raise the benchmark Selic rate today as
faster inflation threatens investment and confidence levels in
Brazil, Fix said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The central bank recognizes problems related to the
persistence of inflation,&#8221; he said by telephone. &#8220;It&#8217;s
becoming clearer that high inflation is counterproductive for
growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank&#8217;s press office declined to comment on
market expectations when contacted by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Biggest Increase &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Policy makers have raised the Selic by 3.75 percentage
points since April 2013 to fight inflation that Fix said is
still being fanned by falling unemployment rates and rising
wages. That&#8217;s the biggest increase of benchmark borrowing costs
in the past year after Turkey and the longest cycle of monetary
policy tightening in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annual inflation accelerated to 6.31 percent in mid-May
from 6.19 percent the prior month as education, health care and
housing prices increased. The central bank targets 4.5 percent
inflation, plus or minus two percentage points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jobless rate fell to 4.9 percent last month, the lowest
since January, while average real income grew from last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrial production has been weaker, contracting twice in
the first quarter, as economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast
economic growth will slow this year to 1.8 percent from 2.3
percent last year. Consumer confidence as measured by the
Getulio Vargas Foundation in May fell to the lowest level in
more than five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Disappointing&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross domestic product expanded 0.2 percent in the first
quarter, down from 0.7 percent in the previous three months,
according to analysts polled by Bloomberg. The statistics agency
is scheduled to publish GDP data May 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;disappointing&#8221; expansion in some wealthier nations
is helping reduce inflationary pressures, according to Fabio Akira, chief economist for JPMorgan in Brazil. Policy makers
also are aware that boosting the Selic more will hinder Brazil&#8217;s
economic expansion, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Activity numbers are weakening,&#8221; said Akira. &#8220;We are
going to see data that will worsen further.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akira is the best forecaster of Brazil&#8217;s economic data
after Fix, according to information compiled by Bloomberg. The
ranking is based on the accuracy of estimates for key economic
indicators over the past two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The local currency appreciation also will help relieve
inflationary pressures, Akira said. The real has strengthened
5.6 percent against the dollar this year, the best performance
among 24 emerging market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. It
depreciated 0.6 percent yesterday to 2.2377 per U.S. dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pared Bets &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traders have pared bets for further tightening as policy
makers such as central bank President Alexandre Tombini and the
institution&#8217;s international affairs director, Luiz Awazu Pereira, said at separate events this month that monetary policy
has a delayed impact on consumer prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swap rates on the contract maturing in January 2015 have
declined 21 basis points, or 0.21 percentage point, to 10.91
percent since the central bank&#8217;s last meeting. The breakeven
rate, based on the difference in yields of inflation-linked
bonds and interest-rate swaps due in 2015, dropped 58 basis
points over the same period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jose Carlos de Faria, chief Brazil economist for Deutsche
Bank, agrees with the central bank&#8217;s assessment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s clear that we still haven&#8217;t seen the full effect&#8221;
of rate increases, said Faria. &#8220;The central bank has provided
signs that it will pause.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Votorantim Asset Management&#8217;s Fix, policy makers will
need to increase the Selic by 100 basis points next year to
prevent consumer price increases from breaching the ceiling of
the target range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Inflation is still worrisome,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The headline of an earlier version of this story was
corrected to show JPMorgan forecasts no change in the Selic.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Executive
Officer Satya Nadella said he will seek to focus on businesses
where the company can lead, rather than harp on missed
opportunities in areas like tablet computers and hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The question is, what is the next thing that is going to
make us better?&#8221; Nadella said in a keynote interview yesterday
at Re/code&#8217;s Code conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, California.
&#8220;It&#8217;s the hunt for what is it that is the inflection point that
matters more than what caused us to miss.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Nadella&#8217;s first public interview since replacing Steve Ballmer as CEO in February, he also said he doesn&#8217;t plan to
change Microsoft&#8217;s plans for Xbox or sell off the Bing search
engine. The company will continue to span both enterprise and
consumer markets, he said. He highlighted Microsoft&#8217;s focus on
products that run on any device, as well as the areas of Web-based cloud computing, mobile and business software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of that effort, the Redmond, Washington-based
company also used the conference to unveil a new Skype product
that translates Web-conference conversations in real time. Set
for a test release later this year, the Skype translator was
demonstrated in a conversation between Gurdeep Singh Pall, who
oversees Skype, and a German speaker. The product provides both
a spoken and text translation and will initially be available as
a stand-alone offering before being combined into the Skype
application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Global Product&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Skype is a very global product -- it&#8217;s all about
connecting people that are separated by distance,&#8221; Pall said in
an interview. &#8220;One of the biggest barriers that still remains
is really the language barrier.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft isn&#8217;t sure how many languages will be included
initially, Pall said. The company will release new languages as
they meet the bar for translation quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software relies on work by Microsoft&#8217;s research arm, as
well as the Bing search unit, which has its own translation
product for Web pages and Internet content, he said. The Skype
service needs to use speech recognition to understand the
speaker, machine learning for the translation, and text-to-speech technology to send the translation to the listener. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since taking over, Nadella has sought to focus the world&#8217;s
largest software maker on mobile and cloud products. He has
signaled a desire to shift attention to producing software for
rival operating systems like Apple Inc.&#8217;s iOS and Google Inc.&#8217;s
Android and has shuffled management in areas like marketing,
business development and the Xbox game console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tablet Event &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A company event earlier this month to release a new Surface
tablet was noteworthy for what the CEO chose not to unveil.
While Microsoft showed a larger model of its Surface Pro, a
planned smaller tablet failed to meet with the approval of
Nadella and his executives and was pulled from the event, people
familiar with the matter said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the session in New York, Nadella didn&#8217;t discuss the
missing device and noted that Microsoft won&#8217;t seek to develop
hardware to compete with its partners and will instead focus on
areas where it can develop something unique. His comments
suggest a more selective approach to building devices rather
than going for the largest number of offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Nadella&#8217;s first quarter as CEO, Microsoft posted better-than-projected profit as cloud initiatives and cost controls
begun under Ballmer boosted results. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fabrice Tourre, the former Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) vice president found liable for his part in
selling a pre-crisis mortgage security that lost value, said he
won&#8217;t file an appeal in the civil case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While my lawyers have advised me there are strong grounds
to appeal, I prefer to move forward with my education and close
this difficult chapter of my life,&#8221; Tourre said in a statement
yesterday. &#8220;I look forward to finishing my Ph.D. in economics
and to making meaningful contributions to my field.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre, 35, was found liable Aug. 1 after a jury trial at
which the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission claimed he
intentionally misled investors in a subprime-mortgage vehicle
called Abacus 2007-AC1. In March, he was ordered to pay more
than $825,000 in penalties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was one of the government&#8217;s most prominent
efforts to fix responsibility for the housing market crash,
which helped precipitate the worst economic downturn since the
1930s. Critics have faulted the SEC for not doing more to police
the abuses that helped lead to the crisis or to pursue top
financial executives they say are responsible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which paid Tourre&#8217;s legal fees, settled SEC
claims over the Abacus transaction in July 2010 for $550
million, a record at the time. No senior Goldman Sachs
executives were questioned in Tourre&#8217;s trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre lied about the role played by the hedge-fund firm
run by billionaire John Paulson, which helped choose the
securities underlying Abacus then made a billion-dollar bet it
would fail, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest ruled in March that
Tourre, who&#8217;s in the middle of a six-year economics Ph.D.
program at the University of Chicago, couldn&#8217;t seek
reimbursement from Goldman Sachs for $650,000 in civil penalties
and repaying $175,463 of his 2007 bonus, plus interest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Salesforce.com
Inc. (CRM) agreed to make some of their business-software products
work better together, signaling a thaw between two longtime
rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salesforce&#8217;s customer-management programs will become
available for Microsoft&#8217;s Windows and Windows Phone operating
systems, and will work with Office 365 online productivity
software, the companies said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement marks a shift in what has sometimes been a
fractious relationship. In 2010, Microsoft sued Salesforce for
patent infringement, setting off a countersuit before the
companies settled later that year. Microsoft in 2005 also
announced plans to &#8220;give Salesforce a very effective run for
their money&#8221; with a competing product and in 2010 ran an anti-Salesforce ad campaign with the tagline &#8220;Don&#8217;t Get Forced.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under new Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella, Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft has been looking to bolster its
Internet-based cloud software and corporate programs. Software
makers are looking for more ways to let applications, even from
rivals, work together as customers seek to use multiple products
and share information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This announcement is really about putting our customers
first,&#8221; Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said on a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January, employees of Chevron (CVX)&#8217;s
renewable power group, whose mission was to create large,
profitable clean-energy projects, dined at San Francisco&#8217;s
trendy Sens restaurant. Managers applauded them for almost
doubling their projected profit in 2013, the group&#8217;s first full
year of operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mood quickly turned somber. Despite the financial
results and the team&#8217;s role in helping start more than a half-dozen solar and geothermal projects capable of powering at least
65,000 homes, managers told the group that funding for the
effort would dry up, and encouraged staffers to find jobs
elsewhere, say four people who attended the dinner, Bloomberg
Businessweek reports in its June 2 issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past eight years, Chevron Corp. has promoted
&#8220;profitable renewable energy&#8221; as a core component of its
business plan. The company&#8217;s slogan, &#8220;Finding newer, cleaner
ways to power the world,&#8221; is splashed across its website. And
ads begun in 2010 as part of Chevron&#8217;s &#8220;We Agree&#8221; campaign
declare, &#8220;It&#8217;s time oil companies get behind the development of
renewable energy.&#8221; Yet Chevron recently has retreated from key
efforts to produce clean energy. This includes the renewable
power group, which invested in or built utility-scale solar and
geothermal projects with margins of 15 percent to 20 percent or
more, according to a dozen people who worked on them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responsible Investor &#8212; ExxonMobil, one of the oil companies whose stance on climate change disclosure has been under scrutiny from investors, has revealed that it expects the implied cost of CO2 emissions to reach $80 per metric ton [tonne] in 2040 in developed economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes as major institutional investors backed a shareholder proposal calling on Exxon to set quantitative goals for reducing its emissions at its annual meeting in Dallas yesterday (May 28).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The motion &#8211; filed by the Sisters of St. Dominic of New Jersey &#8211; was supported by investors including the AFSCME Employees Pension Plan, the California Public Employees Retirement System, the Florida State Board of Administration, FC and Dutch giant PGGM. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FC said that while it appreciates the company&#8217;s recent disclosures around climate change challenges &#8211; prompted by an investor campaign spearheaded by Ceres and Carbon Tracker &#8211; nevertheless &#8220;climate change presents ongoing and serious risks to shareholder value and there is room for the company to improve its transparency&#8221;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the absence of a viable price for carbon, setting a greenhouse gas reduction target would demonstrate a stronger strategy for operating in carbon-constrained markets,&#8221; FC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil had resisted the Sisters of St. Dominic resolution, saying it already provides extensive public disclosure on its approach to managing the risks of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full voting results haven&#8217;t yet been released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon released the $80 figure in its latest corporate responsibility report, saying OECD countries are &#8220;likely to continue to lead the way&#8221; in adopting greenhouse gas reduction policies &#8211; with developing nations gradually following, led by China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To help model the potential impacts of a broad mosaic of future GHG policies, we use a simple cost of carbon as a proxy mechanism,&#8221; Exxon says in the report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $80/tonne figure by 2040 compares with a $60/tonne number &#8211; albeit for 2030 &#8211; that Exxon disclosed in the same report last year. Peer companies such as BP and Shell typically refer to current price assumptions of $40/tonne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon has also revealed that two responsible investment figures have &#8220;transitioned out&#8221; of its social and environmental expert panel. Both Tim Smith of Walden Asset Management and Elizabeth McGeveran, former Senior Vice President of Governance  Sustainable Investment at FC, have left its External Citizenship Advisory Panel, replaced by Frank Loy, the former US Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs, and Sarah Labowitz, co-director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University&#8217;s Stern School of Business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republished with the permission of Responsible Investor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visit The Grid for the latest about energy, natural resources and global business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Bill Gross vows to restore top
performance at the world&#8217;s biggest bond fund, he&#8217;s taking a path
many of his rivals shun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross, who manages the $230 billion Pimco Total Return Fund (PTTRX)
at Pacific Investment Management Co. in Newport Beach,
California, is betting five-year Treasuries, which are more
sensitive to changes in the central bank rate than longer-dated
bonds, will do well because markets overestimate how much the
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates. Bond managers at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., BlackRock Inc. (BLK) and JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) say he&#8217;s wrong and the intermediate bonds he holds will
suffer when the Fed lifts borrowing costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Once they see the whites of the eyes of full employment,
they will want to normalize rates at a faster clip,&#8221; Jonathan Beinner, co-head of global fixed income at Goldman Sachs Asset
Management, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross, 70, is betting on an economic view he calls the
&#8220;new neutral,&#8221; which argues that the top speeds of the biggest
economies and their equilibrium interest rates have declined and
won&#8217;t return to levels seen before the financial crisis. While
most bond managers agree rates will be lower, with the federal

&lt;p&gt;The city of Los Angeles accused
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) of targeting minority borrowers with
predatory loans in a lawsuit filed two days after Wells Fargo 
Co. (WFC) lost a court bid to dismiss a similar case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second-largest U.S. city sued Wells Fargo, Citigroup
Inc. and Bank of America Corp. last year, saying the lenders
engaged in biased practices since at least 2004 by placing
minority borrowers in mortgages they couldn&#8217;t afford and driving
up the number of foreclosures in their neighborhoods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;L.A. continues to suffer from the foreclosure crisis,
from blight in our neighborhoods to diminished revenue for basic
city services,&#8221; City Attorney Mike Feuer said in a statement.
&#8220;We&#8217;re fighting to hold those we allege are responsible to
account.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The claim against New York-based JPMorgan is the most
recent in a series of lawsuits by municipalities across the U.S.
to hold mortgage lenders responsible for fallout from the
collapse of the housing market. Yesterday, Providence, Rhode
Island, sued Banco Santander SA (SAN)&#8217;s U.S. unit, alleging
discriminatory lending in the years after the recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today&#8217;s suit and earlier ones by Los Angeles, the city
accuses the banks of historically &#8220;red-lining&#8221; black and
Hispanic areas as no-loan zones. Starting in the late 1990s, the
banks engaged in &#8220;reverse red-lining&#8221; by flooding the areas
with subprime mortgages even when minorities qualified for
better terms, according to the complaint filed today in federal
court in Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Fair Terms&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, JPMorgan has since 2009 declined to offer
refinancing or loan modification to minority customers on &#8220;fair
terms,&#8221; according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are disappointed the L.A. city attorney is pursuing an
adversarial approach to address city finances impacted by the
recent economic downturn,&#8221; JPMorgan spokeswoman Suzanne Ryan
said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;The downturn was beyond our
control.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counties encompassing Chicago and parts of Atlanta have
made similar claims in lawsuits against units of Bank of America
and HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA) The banks deny the claims, which allege
violations of the Fair Housing Act of 1968. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is City of Los Angeles v. JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
14-cv-04168, U.S. District Court, Central District of California
(Los Angeles.) &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Jasmine Ng and David Stringer" date="May 30, 2014  2:41 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-30/iron-ore-heads-for-record-losing-streak-as-goldman-eyes-supply.html"><headline>Iron Ore Heads for Record Losing Streak on Growing Supply</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Iron ore capped a sixth monthly drop
in the longest losing run on record as rising supplies from
Australia and Brazil spur a global glut. Fortescue Metals Group
Ltd. (FMG) said there could be further losses, with a risk prices may
retreat to the lowest level since 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ore with 62 percent content delivered to Tianjin tumbled
4.1 percent to $91.80 a dry ton, the lowest level in 20 months,
according to data from The Steel Index Ltd. today. The steel-making raw material sank 12.9 percent in May, and has dropped
every month since December in the longest run of monthly losses
since the data series began in November 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron ore entered a bear market in March as the biggest
miners including BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) and Rio Tinto Group (RIO) raised
output, spurring forecasts for a rising global surplus. Slowing
growth and tight credit conditions in China have restricted the
expansion of demand in the world&#8217;s largest user. The price drop
validates a forecast from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in November
that the commodity would see a significant decline in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think it is mainly a supply story,&#8221; Christian Lelong,
an analyst at Goldman Sachs in Sydney, said in an e-mail
yesterday in response to questions from Bloomberg. &#8220;Demand is
clearly growing at a slower pace, but supply growth is
particularly strong after years of overinvestment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron ore may drop to as low as $80 over the next 12 months,
Fortescue Chairman Andrew Forrest told a conference in Melbourne
today. The benchmark tracked by The Steel Index last traded
below $80 in September 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Forrest&#8217;s View &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty comfortable with the iron ore price
oscillating around the $110 mark,&#8221; said Forrest, who heads
Australia&#8217;s third-largest shipper. &#8220;I think it could wander
down to $80, it could wander up to $140.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The raw material has lost 32 percent this year compared
with the 2.8 percent advance for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI Spot
Index of 24 commodities and 3.1 percent gain for the MSCI World
Index of equities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rio shares declined as much as 4.4 percent to 3,047.50
pence in London, the lowest since October. Stock in BHP
retreated as much as 4.1 percent in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron ore will average $109 a ton in 2014 and $80 next year,
Goldman forecasts. So far in 2014, it&#8217;s averaged $116. The bank
boosted its estimate for next year&#8217;s surplus to 175 million tons
from 145 million tons in a May 20 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worldwide seaborne surplus will increase to 79 million
tons this year and 158 million tons in 2015 from last year&#8217;s 1
million tons, Morgan Stanley said in a report on May 26. Global
supplies will expand 10 percent in 2014, outstripping the 3.7
percent rise in demand, according to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chinese Economy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross domestic product in China, the world&#8217;s largest
steelmaker, will grow 7.3 percent this year, according to a
Bloomberg survey. While that&#8217;s set to be the least since 1990,
it&#8217;s still more than double expected growth in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Premier Li Keqiang said pressures for a downturn are
&#8220;relatively large&#8221; and the nation will adjust policy to
support the economy, according to a statement on May 23.
Economists at Nomura Holdings Inc. said that Li&#8217;s comments
signaled looser borrowing conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even if the government tries to come up with measures to
prop up the economy, the problem for iron ore is oversupply,&#8221;
Helen Lau, an analyst at UOB Kay Hian Ltd. in Hong Kong, said by
phone. &#8220;The oversupply issue will outweigh demand recovery.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron ore prices are unlikely to rise in the next two to
three months because of increasing supplies from imports, high
port inventories and a slowdown in steel-product demand, China&#8217;s
National Development  Reform Commission said on May 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Record Stockpiles &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stockpiles at Chinese ports climbed 0.7 percent to a record
113.30 million tons in the week to May 23 from a week earlier,
according to Shanghai Steelhome Information Technology Co.
Inventories have expanded 31 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shipments from Australia and Brazil are expected to grow 28
percent over the next five years till 2019 to reach 1.3 billion
tons, data from Australia&#8217;s Bureau of Resources and Energy
Economics, or BREE, showed in a quarterly report in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A union representing tugboat deckhands at Australia&#8217;s Port
Hedland deferred a strike on May 22 and said it would apply to
extend the period in which it can take industrial action,
risking disruption to iron ore shipments from the world&#8217;s
largest bulk-export terminal. A second union representing
tugboat masters at the port approved work stoppages from two to
72 hours, the Fair Work Commission said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Port Hedland &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrial action may hurt exports by miners including
Fortescue  and BHP, which estimated that disruption will cost
users about $94 million a day. Shipments through Port Hedland
made up more than a quarter of worldwide seaborne trade last
year, according to Bloomberg calculations based on figures from
BREE, with 81 percent of the port&#8217;s ore going to China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surging supplies of seaborne ore will challenge producers
in China, probably forcing some higher-cost capacity in the
country to close, BHP and Goldman said separately on May 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating costs at about 80 percent of China&#8217;s domestic
iron ore mines are $80 to $90 a ton, according to Xia Yang, a
Shanghai-based analyst at Mysteel, China&#8217;s biggest steel
researcher. That compares with A$39 ($37) for Rio Tinto, A$41
for BHP and A$56 for Fortescue, UBS AG estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Perth-based Fortescue have tumbled 24 percent in
Sydney this year. Vale SA (VALE5), the world&#8217;s biggest iron ore
exporter, advanced 0.3 percent in Sao Paulo yesterday, trimming
the drop this year to 19 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
is working with Beijing TransWiseway Information Technology Co.
to offer drivers in China more connectivity in their vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s cloud-based technology will connect vehicles to the
Internet and each other to deliver information such as traffic
alerts, weather advisories and suggestions for alternate routes
to a driver&#8217;s mobile phone, the companies said today in a
statement. The new platform may connect with 1.5 million trucks
next year and 10 million in two to three years, the companies
estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drivers are increasingly looking to be connected while in
their vehicles. Technology to do that is the top selling point
for 39 percent of auto buyers, more than twice the 14 percent
who say their first consideration is traditional performance
measures such as power and speed, according to a study
consulting firm Accenture released in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This effort targeted for improving in-vehicle services
will make an important impact on the whole driving ecosystem in
China and combining mobile and cloud technologies will drive
innovation across the automotive industry,&#8221; said Ernie Hu, vice
president of software for the IBM Greater China Group. IBM is
based in Armonk, New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s collaboration for the connected car in China is being
announced as tensions between the world&#8217;s two largest economies
have escalated after U.S. prosecutors accused the Chinese
military of stealing corporate secrets. China&#8217;s government is
studying whether domestic banks&#8217; reliance on IBM&#8217;s high-end
servers threatens national security and is expanding a trial
program to replace them with local brands, people familiar with
the matter said this week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Vice President Joe Biden will
deliver the keynote address at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s North
American Energy Summit next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biden will speak at the June 11 summit for leaders from
government and companies, according to a statement today from
New York-based Goldman Sachs. Petroleos Mexicanos Chief
Executive Officer Emilio Lozoya, Duke Energy Corp. CEO Lynn Good, and U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz are all scheduled
to attend, Goldman Sachs said this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shale oil and gas development in North America was listed
as one of 25 key global trends in Goldman Sachs&#8217;s 2013 annual
report last month. The production may lead to a more stable oil
market and strengthen the U.S. dollar, the bank&#8217;s research
analysts said in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein and President Gary Cohn, who will attend the summit, started in the commodities
trading division. The pair has said the firm will remain
committed to that unit, even as other large banks such as
JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Barclays Plc have scaled back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. hired Gregg Brody, a high-yield energy analyst, from JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
according to an internal memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brody will be replacing Kelly Krenger, who is leaving the
Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender, according to the memo.
He will report to Larry Bland, the head of U.S. credit research,
according to the memo, the contents of which were confirmed by
Rinat Rond, a spokeswoman at Bank of America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brody, who will start in his new position at the end of
July, has previously worked at Deutsche Bank AG, Germany&#8217;s
biggest lender, according to records maintained by the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krenger had joined the bank in 1996 and headed the high-yield energy team, Bland wrote in the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are as many as 337 bonds in the Bloomberg high-yield
energy index with a market value of $218.5 billion, bond index
data show. That compares with 179 issues with a value of $108.4
billion at the end of 2012, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds sold by energy companies are the second-most actively
traded securities in the last three months behind those of
financial firms, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of Finra. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Salesforce.com
Inc. (CRM) plan to announce an agreement that will enable customers of
Microsoft&#8217;s cloud-computing service to use Salesforce&#8217;s
enterprise software, said people familiar with the talks,
signaling a thaw between two longtime rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partnership will make Salesforce&#8217;s customer-management
programs available on Microsoft&#8217;s Azure service, said the
people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions
are confidential. Salesforce will also commit to using Azure to
host some of its own applications and will integrate data from
Salesforce products into Microsoft&#8217;s Office programs, the people
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An agreement would mark a shift in what has sometimes been
a fractious relationship between the two companies. In 2010,
Microsoft sued Salesforce for patent infringement, setting off a
countersuit before the companies settled later that year.
Microsoft in 2005 also announced plans to &#8220;give Salesforce a
very effective run for their money&#8221; with a competing product
and in 2010 ran an anti-Salesforce ad campaign with the tagline
&#8220;Don&#8217;t Get Forced.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nortel European Units Seek Slice of Asset Auction Cash Hoard &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nortel Networks Corp. (NRTLQ)&#8217;s defunct units in the U.K. and
Europe deserve part of the bankrupt telecom company&#8217;s $7.3
billion cash hoard because of their technology researchers&#8217; past
work, an investment banker said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Huffard, a senior managing director at Blackstone
Group LP called to testify by the European units, argued May 28
in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware, that the best way to
split the cash is based on the research and development by
Nortel&#8217;s regional units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using that method, disputed by Nortel&#8217;s defunct U.S. and
Canadian components, the U.K. and European units deserve about
18 percent of the cash, Huffard said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contingents are in the third week of a six-week trial
over how to divide money raised in auctions after what was once
North America&#8217;s largest telephone-equipment maker went bankrupt
in 2009. The money includes proceeds of a patent sale that
raised $4.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The units are arguing on behalf of creditors including
bondholders in the U.S. and pensioners in the U.K. and Canada.
Each group is trying to convince a U.S. bankruptcy judge and a
Canadian judge that its method for dividing the money is best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Nortel Networks Inc., 09-bk-10138, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanrio Co. (8136)&#8217;s Hello Kitty items were among counterfeit
merchandise seized in a raid by Singapore Customs May 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enforcement officers from the customs service found a 40-foot container containing toys, water bottles and accessories
with unauthorized Hello Kitty, Batman, Captain America, Spider-Man, Superman, Transformers, Barney and Care Bears marks, the
service said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goods came from Shenzhen, China, and the customs
service said it found more infringing merchandise in the office
of the importer who was bringing in the container. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;HR Block Settles Suit Over &#8216;Peace of Mind&#8217; Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HR Block Inc. (HRB) of Kansas City, Missouri, and a competing
tax-preparation service settled their trademark dispute,
according to a May 19 court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit involved Fast Cash Taxes LLC&#8217;s alleged
unauthorized use of HR Block&#8217;s &#8220;Peace of Mind&#8221; trademark. HR
Block sued Fast Cash, of Doraville, Georgia, in Atlanta federal
court on March 28, seeking a court order barring unauthorized
use of the mark and awards of money damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court filing didn&#8217;t disclose terms of the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is HRB Innovations Inc. v. Fast Cash Taxes LLC,

&lt;h2&gt;More than 1.3 Million Copyright Alert Notices Sent, Center Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Center for Copyright Information, an advocacy group
comprising copyright holders and Internet service providers,
issued a report on the &#8220;six strikes&#8221; copyright alert system in
place in the U.S. since February 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 1.3 million notices were sent to consumers in the
past year, with 70 percent sent at the first stage of what can
be an escalating alert and mitigation system, according to the
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under a policy set up when the system was put into place,
the American Arbitration Association reviews challenges filed by
consumers who say the notices were erroneous. In the past year,
only 265 requests were filed, according to the center. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG), creator of the world&#8217;s most-used Internet
search engine, backed down on its claims that numbers reflecting
the ethnic and gender makeup of its workforce were a trade
secret. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a report published on the Mountain View, California-based company&#8217;s official blog May 28, Google said that it was in
the wrong when it refused to release the data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company revealed that 70 percent of its employees are
male and 61 percent are white. Only 2 percent of its workforce
is black, Google said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India is cashing in on the rupee&#8217;s
region-beating rally to boost its foreign reserves, prompting
banks from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to HSBC Holdings Plc to
predict an end to the currency&#8217;s gains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rupee will reverse this month&#8217;s 2.2 percent advance and
tumble more than 3 percent to 61 per dollar by year-end, the
sharpest decline among 11 Asian currencies after the yen,
according to Bloomberg strategist surveys. HSBC forecasts a drop
to 62 by Dec. 31, while Goldman Sachs sees the rupee at 61 in
six months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan has used the
stronger rupee to buy foreign currency, pushing reserves above
$300 billion for the first time since 2011 and bolstering the
nation&#8217;s defenses against speculators. Currency analysts are
speculating Rajan&#8217;s policy will outweigh the foreign investment
lured by the election campaign of pro-business politician
Narendra Modi, who was confirmed as prime minister this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We would caution against the conclusion that positive
politics will translate into large gains for the currency,&#8221;
Mallika Sachdeva, a Singapore-based strategist at Deutsche Bank
AG, the world&#8217;s second-biggest foreign-exchange trader, said May
28 by e-mail. &#8220;The RBI will be opportunistically buying
dollars. India&#8217;s reserves buffer, while large in absolute terms,
is still weak versus regional peers on metrics like import or
short-term debt cover.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Modi Inflows &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revived confidence in Indian assets during the election
campaign prompted foreigners to pump $14.6 billion into the
nation&#8217;s stocks and bonds this year, exceeding inflows of $12
billion in the whole of 2013. The rupee surged almost 5 percent
against the dollar since Dec. 31, the best performance after
Brazil&#8217;s real of 24 emerging-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rupee has already retreated more than 1 percent from an
11-month high of 58.335 per dollar reached May 23 and traded at
59.0462 as of 11:24 a.m. in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. says India will have to keep building
its reserves because they&#8217;re still only enough to pay for eight
months of imports, the lowest coverage ratio since 1996. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect Governor Rajan to continue to buy foreign
exchange to improve import cover that&#8217;s almost halved in the
past six years,&#8221; Indranil Sengupta, a Mumbai-based economist at
the U.S. investment bank, said May 27 by phone. &#8220;We calculate
the RBI needs to buy $80 billion in the next two years to just
maintain that import cover.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deploying Gains &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s not the only developing country to parlay local-currency gains into foreign reserves in anticipation of an end
to the U.S. Federal Reserve&#8217;s monetary stimulus program. The 12
emerging markets with the biggest stockpiles outside of China
lifted their combined holdings to $2.97 trillion as of May 26,
about the most since Bloomberg began compiling the data in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India boosted its reserves to $315 billion, $6 billion
short of a record reached in September 2011, as the rupee
rallied from an all-time low of 68.845 per dollar in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBI intervention will merely &#8220;limit the pace of rupee
appreciation,&#8221; Hamish Pepper, a Singapore-based strategist at
Barclays Plc, said in a May 28 client note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The British bank raised its six-month rupee forecast to 59
per dollar, from 61 previously, citing a strengthening economy
and fund inflows. Nomura Holdings Inc. lifted its year-end
prediction to 57 after the election, from 59.5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The victory of Modi&#8217;s Bharatiya Janata Party stoked
optimism that India will be able to take measures to cut its
current-account deficit, after the nation&#8217;s last prime minister
passed the fewest bills for any government to have completed a
five-year term. The shortfall in the broadest measure of the
country&#8217;s trade narrowed to $32.4 billion in the fiscal year
ended March from an unprecedented $88 billion in the prior
period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Policy Switch &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 30 percent plunge in the rupee from 2011 through 2013 as
the deficit widened prompted the RBI to prop up the currency
last year by tightening the cash supply, raising interest rates
and selling banks discounted foreign-exchange swaps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs sees the central bank&#8217;s influence on the
rupee as being negative this time around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The RBI has said that it wouldn&#8217;t want the gains on the
current account to be lost due to a strengthening currency,
which would reduce competitiveness,&#8221; Goldman Sachs analysts
including Mumbai-based Tushar Poddar wrote in a May 22 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RBI&#8217;s increasing war chest will limit the rupee&#8217;s
short-term gains to 57, and the currency will fall to 61 by
year-end as the post-election rally fizzles out, according to
Credit Agricole SA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market has roped in too-high hopes about Modi,&#8221;
Dariusz Kowalczyk, a strategist at the bank in Hong Kong, said
in a May 27 phone interview. &#8220;There will be disappointment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) named Claudia Jury and Pranav Thakur as global co-heads of foreign exchange
and emerging markets, part of a wider reshuffle prompted by the
surprise departure of Mike Cavanagh two months ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kanav Bhagat, who was head of U.S. rates trading, will
become global head of rates, according to a memo to employees
from James Kenny and Troy Rohrbaugh, co-heads of global rates,
foreign exchange, commodities and emerging markets. Bhagat is
filling a role that Rohrbaugh had starting in 2012. A JPMorgan
spokesman in London confirmed the contents of the document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This team will focus on monetizing the opportunities made
available by changes in market structure and the competitive
landscape while also continuing to aggressively grow our client
franchise,&#8221; the co-heads said in the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel Pinto, head of the corporate and investment bank for
New York-based JPMorgan, named Kenny and Rohrbaugh co-heads of
global rates, foreign exchange, commodities and emerging markets
last month. Pinto, 51, is overhauling reporting lines across the
division after becoming its sole chief following Cavanagh&#8217;s move
to private-equity firm Carlyle Group LP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pluta, Robinson &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Pluta, global head of foreign-exchange forwards
trading, will have added responsibility as global head of short-term interest-rate trading, according to the memo. Pitts Robinson will be global head of foreign-exchange services to
deliver FX products to clients, and Eddie Wen was made global
head of electronic trading for the four areas overseen by Kenny
and Rohrbaugh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jury previously oversaw global foreign-exchange spot
trading and Thakur ran rates and currencies in Asia, excluding
Japan. Stephen Jefferies was named head of emerging markets and
Europe, Middle East and Africa foreign exchange, reporting to
Jury and Thakur, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reporting to Bhagat will be Charles Bristow, who was named
head of derivatives and liquid government bonds in Europe, the
Middle East and Africa, and Carl Norrey, who will manage
sovereign credit default swap trading and non-liquid European
government bond trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, also named Jeff Herbert-Smith as head of Australia markets, expanding his role
managing fixed-income trading to include equities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activist investor Carl Icahn, golfer
Phil Mickelson and sports gambler William Walters are targets of
an insider-trading probe by U.S. authorities, the Wall Street
Journal reported yesterday, citing people briefed on the
investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Securities and
Exchange Commission are examining whether during the past three
years Mickelson and Walters traded using non-public information
provided by Icahn about companies he had invested in, the paper
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation is looking at large option trades in the
days before Icahn&#8217;s $10.2 billion offer for Clorox Co. (CLX) in July
2011, as well as trading patterns related to Dean Foods Co. (DF), the
WSJ said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icahn has said he has never traded in Dean Foods and is not
aware of any federal investigation, the paper reported. The
suggestion that he was involved in improper trading was
&#8220;inflammatory and speculative,&#8221; Icahn said, according to the
WSJ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for Mickelson denied the golfer was the target of
any investigation, while Walters declined to comment, the paper
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icahn Enterprises and Mickelson&#8217;s attorney Glenn Cohen were
unavailable for comment when contacted by Bloomberg News outside
regular office hours. Contact details for Walters couldn&#8217;t
immediately be found. &lt;/p&gt;
