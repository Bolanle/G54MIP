<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)''s plans to develop
a $14 billion underwater oil field off Newfoundland''s coast
allows the world''s biggest energy company to hedge against
discounted crude from Canada''s oil sands. </p>
<p>The better pricing is definitely an issue, Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones  Co. said by phone from
St. Louis on Jan. 4. While things could change in the time it
takes to finish the project, it''s a great way for Exxon to hedge
their pricing. </p>
<p>The investment to capture 700 million barrels of heavy
undersea crude at the field about 350 kilometers (218 miles)
southeast of St. John''s rivals spending in Alberta''s oil sands,
where the estimated 170 billion barrels of recoverable reserves
attracted C$23 billion ($23.2 billion) in spending last year.
Newfoundland and Labrador oil is priced off the global
benchmark, almost twice as high as western Canada''s heavy crude,
and will help Exxon add to profit growth. </p>
<p>As Exxon and global competitors seek to lock up reserves in
increasingly hard-to-reach terrain, offshore Canadian oil in
Newfoundland and the Arctic is becoming more attractive. </p>
<p>The Hebron project puts Canada''s offshore assets, not
normally the subject of a lot of development chatter, back
on the map, Jennifer Stevenson, a vice president who helps
manage about C$100 billion at Dynamic Funds in Toronto, said on
Jan. 4. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) asked a federal
judge to order the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to cover any
costs or liabilities in a bondholder case stemming from the
bank''s takeover of Washington Mutual Bank. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, in a filing today in Washington, said that under
the terms of a 2008 agreement with the FDIC it shouldn''t be on
the hook for any damages, attorneys'' fees or court costs in a
lawsuit filed by Washington Mutual bondholders accusing the bank
of being involved in a scheme to deprive them of their
investments. </p>
<p>When it picked up Washington Mutual banking operations in
September 2008, JPMorgan assumed only certain defined
liabilities, which didn''t include WaMu''s bond obligations,
according to the filing. WaMu''s debt obligations -- including
the bonds at issue in the case -- were liabilities that remained
with the FDIC, the bank said. </p>
<p>As a result of this action, the JPMC defendants have
suffered significant harm, attorney Brent McIntosh of Sullivan
 Cromwell LLP wrote in the filing, referring to the suit. New
York-based JPMorgan has been forced to litigate this action
for close to four years and incurred substantial costs and
expenses, he said. </p>
<p>A federal judge dismissed the suit in 2010 after finding
that the bondholders hadn''t sought recovery through the FDIC''s
administrative claims process. </p>
<h2>Case Revived </h2>
<p>The case was revived on appeal in 2011 by a three-judge
panel, which ruled that the court had jurisdiction because the
bondholders'' allegations of wrongdoing were made against
JPMorgan. </p>
<p>If JPMorgan thinks the FDIC is responsible for the
damages my client suffered, that is between them, Andrew J.
Mytelka, a lawyer for the bondholders, said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>David Barr, an FDIC spokesman, said the agency doesn''t
comment on active litigation. </p>
<p>The case is American National Insurance Co. v. Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp., 09-cv-01743, U.S. District Court,
District of Columbia (Washington). </p>

<p>New York''s fraud lawsuit against
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) over mortgage securities sold to investors
must be dismissed because the time for bringing the claims has
expired, the bank said. </p>
<p>New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman''s complaint is
barred by a three-year statute of limitations, JPMorgan said in
papers dated Jan. 4 and filed in New York State Supreme Court in
Manhattan. </p>
<p>Schneiderman sued New York-based JPMorgan in October,
alleging that Bear Stearns, the investment bank it acquired in
2008, deceived investors about mortgage loans backing
securities, leading to losses. </p>
<p>Schneiderman, who was named co-chairman of a state-federal
group formed to investigate misconduct in the bundling of
mortgage loans into securities, has said the JPMorgan case would
serve as a template for lawsuits against other issuers. The
state has also sued Credit Suisse Group AG (CS) on similar grounds. </p>
<p>New York''s claims stem from Bear Stearns'' role as sponsor
and underwriter of subprime and Alt-A mortgage-backed securities
before JPMorgan acquired the securities firm. Losses on $87
billion of securities from 2006 and 2007 total about $22.5
billion, according to the state''s complaint. </p>
<h2>Will Prevail'' </h2>
<p>We are confident that our office will prevail, and that
those responsible for the misconduct that led to the crash of
the housing market and the collapse of the American economy will
be held accountable, James Freedland, a spokesman for
Schneiderman, said in a statement. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is among 10 mortgage servicers that reached an
$8.5 billion settlement that will end reviews of foreclosure-
abuse claims, regulators said today. </p>
<p>The lender argued in its court filing that New York can''t
take advantage of a six-year statute of limitations and that a
three-year period applies. JPMorgan and the state reached a
so-called tolling agreement effective April 5, 2012, that
stopped the statute of limitations from expiring, according to
the filing. Because the conduct at issue occurred before April
2009, the claims must be dismissed, JPMorgan argued. </p>
<p>The attorney general''s office contends a six-year period
applies under the state''s securities fraud statute. </p>
<p>JPMorgan also said in its court filing that the case should
be dismissed because the state hasn''t outlined its allegations
with the requisite particularity. </p>
<p>Even if the attorney general''s claims were not time-
barred, they would fail for lack of specificity and must
therefore be dismissed, the bank said. </p>
<p>The case is People of the State of New York v. J.P. Morgan
Securities, 451556-2012, New York State Supreme Court
(Manhattan). </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world''s biggest
software maker, signed a lease for offices at 11 Times Square, a
midtown Manhattan skyscraper that was completed in 2011. </p>
<p>The technology company, based in Redmond, Washington, will
join the law firm Proskauer Rose LLP in the 1.1 million-square-
foot (102,000-square-meter) tower, developer SJP Properties said
today in a statement. Terms, including rent payments and the
size of the leased space, weren''t disclosed. </p>
<p>Including the Microsoft and Proskauer deals and seven other
agreements signed last year, the building is more than 70
percent leased, Parsippany, New Jersey-based SJP said. The
company co-owns the tower, located across Eighth Avenue from the
Port Authority Bus Terminal, with a real estate investment unit
of Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) Proskauer Rose has more than
400,000 square feet in the building. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s lease was reported yesterday on the website of
the Wall Street Journal, which said the company was taking just
more than 200,000 square feet in the tower. Microsoft and the
landlords were represented by brokers from Jones Lang LaSalle
Inc. (JLL), with Lisa Kiell negotiating for the tenant and Mitchell Konsker leading a team working on behalf of SJP. </p>

<p>European naphtha declined as Vitol
Group sold two cargoes, bringing its total in the past two
sessions to six lots. </p>
<p>Diesel barges gained as Trafigura Beheer BV and Gunvor
Group Ltd. bought. Gasoil rose for the first time in three days
on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London. </p>
<h2>Light Products </h2>
<p>Naphtha traded at $929 and $933 a metric ton, according to
a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
pricing window which showed Trafigura and Royal Dutch Shell Plc
as buyers. Deals were done Jan. 4 at $932 to $934 a ton. </p>
<p>Vitol bought 17 naphtha lots in the last week of December,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Naphtha''s crack, or discount to Brent crude, was unchanged
at $6.20 a barrel as of 2:14 p.m. local time, according to data
from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker in London. </p>
<p>Gasoline barges traded from $970 to $981.50 a ton in the
Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp area, according to a similar survey
of the Argus Bulletin Board and the Platts. That compares with
deals from $967 to $978 on Jan. 4. </p>
<p>Chevron, Vitol, Gunvor and Total SA sold barges of the
Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is added to make finished fuel.
Trafigura, Shell and Gunvor bought barges that typically

a barrel, compared with $6.66 on Jan. 4, according to PVM data. </p>
<h2>Middle Distillates </h2>
<p>Diesel barges rose to trade at $20 to $21 a ton more than
January gasoil versus plus $20 in the previous session, the
survey of Platts showed. BP and Argos Groep BV sold, and Vitol
bought. </p>
<p>Heating oil barges traded from a $1 discount to January
gasoil to parity to the marker as Mercuria Energy Trading SA,
Shell and Mocoh SA bought from Vitol and Gunvor. That compares
with a discount of $1 on Jan. 4. </p>
<p>Gasoil for January delivery rose $8.25, or 0.9 percent, to

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the bank
that sold its stake in Germany''s largest department store last
month, plans to sell shares in a unit that owns homes valued at
4.7 billion euros ($6.1 billion) in the country. </p>
<p>An initial public offering of LEG Immobilien GmbH is
planned for the first half, LEG said in a statement today. The
sale may raise as much as 1 billion euros, said two people with
knowledge of the plan. Another person familiar with the IPO said
it will probably take place in early February. Both people asked
not to be identified because the matter is private. </p>
<p>LEG would be Germany''s biggest property IPO if it raises 1
billion euros. The Dusseldorf-based landlord owns 91,000
apartments in North Rhine Westphalia, Germany''s most populous
state. Goldman Sachs'' Whitehall Street Real Estate fund holds
about 95 percent of the company. </p>
<p>The fundamentals for the segment are very good, said
Thomas Martin, an analyst at HSBC Trinkaus  Burkhardt AG. (TUB)
Because some of their competitors are trading expensively,
this could be an interesting way for stock investors to get
in. </p>
<h2>Baubecon Bid </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs is one of the most active foreign investors
in German property. In April 2011, Whitehall Street and Cerberus
Capital Management LP raised 468 million euros in an IPO of
Berlin-based residential landlord GSW Immobilien AG. Whitehall
Street also made an unsuccessful bid to buy Baubecon, the
residential property portfolio that Barclays Plc (BARC) agreed to sell
to Deutsche Wohnen AG in May in a deal valued at 1.24 billion
euros. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs and LEG co-owner Perry Capital, which bought
the company from the state government for about 3.5 billion
euros in 2008, are seeking to profit from a boom in German
residential real estate. The FTSE EPRA/Nareit index of German
property stocks has gained 42 percent in the past 12 months. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) will be lead managers
and bookrunners for the IPO. </p>
<p>Deutsche Annington Immobilien GmbH, Germany''s largest owner
of apartments, also plans an IPO this year. Annington, which has
186,000 apartments, is controlled by Guy Hands'' Terra Firma
Capital Partners Ltd. </p>
<p>Whitehall Street agreed to sell its stake in 17 German
department stores, including Kaufhaus des Westens, the country''s
largest, in December. </p>

<p>The U.S. Supreme Court left intact a
$70 million award assessed against an Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) unit for
failing to comply with a Puerto Rico law governing gasoline
prices. </p>
<p>The justices today turned down an appeal from the oil
company''s Puerto Rico gasoline wholesaler, which said the award
in the consumer class-action lawsuit violates the Constitution. </p>
<p>The 1996 law was designed to ensure that wholesalers, in
the prices they charge to gas stations, account for the
expansion of fuel in warmer climates. The law requires
wholesalers to make a temperature adjustment, reducing the
price. </p>
<p>In its appeal, the Exxon unit said it had no way of
complying with the law until regulations implementing the
measure were adopted in 2005. The company said the
Constitution''s due process clause barred liability until those
regulations took effect. </p>
<p>The suing consumers said the regulations concerned prices
at the pump and didn''t affect the wholesalers'' obligation to
provide the temperature adjustment to retailers. The consumers
said the Exxon unit was receiving a windfall of 1.34 cents per
gallon before the law was enacted. </p>
<p>Puerto Rico''s Supreme Court let the award stand last year. </p>
<p>The case is Esso Standard Oil Co. (Puerto Rico) v. Trilla

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon has left the board of the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York. </p>
<p>Dimon is no longer on the board after the Dec. 31
expiration of his second term as a director, Jack Gutt, a
spokesman for the New York Fed, said today in a telephone
interview. Dimon was a Class A director, elected by the banks in
the New York Fed''s district. A replacement has not yet been
named. </p>
<p>Lawmakers last year criticized Dimon for serving on the Fed
district bank''s board after JPMorgan reported a trading loss
that rekindled concern the New York Fed, the company''s principal
regulator, is too cozy with Wall Street. Senator Bernie Sanders,
a Vermont independent, along with Democrats Barbara Boxer of
California and Mark Begich of Alaska, introduced legislation
last year that would remove the industry''s executives from the
12 regional Fed banks'' boards. </p>
<p>Congress created the Fed in 1913 with public and private
features. Three bankers are on each of the 12 Fed district bank
boards, along with six other directors who represent the
borrowing public. They play no part in bank supervision. </p>
<p>Dimon said in June that the district banks benefit from
industry leaders'' input. </p>
<p>If I had a board, I''d want to hear from a lot of
different types of people, Dimon said June 19 at a hearing of
the House Financial Services Committee in Washington. It''d be
funny to be talking about global markets and not have someone
involved in the global markets at the table. It certainly does
not have to be me. </p>
<p>Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for the bank, said Dimon
finished out his term, declining further comment. Dimon''s
departure from the board was earlier reported by the New York
Times. </p>

<p>James E. Staley, the JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) executive once seen as a candidate to become chief executive
officer, quit to join BlueMountain Capital Management LLC, the
$12 billion hedge fund that profited from the bank''s trading
loss last year. </p>
<p>Staley, who was at JPMorgan for more than 34 years, will
become a managing partner and purchase a stake in BlueMountain,
the New York-based firm said today. The former investment
banking chief, Staley last year handed off day-to-day management
duties and became chairman of the corporate and investment bank
in a series of executive changes as JPMorgan grappled with
wrong-way bets in its chief investment office in London. </p>
<p>I''m very excited to be joining BlueMountain at a time
when sea changes in the financial industry combined with the
firm''s unique strengths open up enormous possibilities to
deliver value to clients, Staley, 56, said in the statement. </p>
<p>Staley, who rose from his post as an investment banker in
Brazil, took over JPMorgan''s investment bank in 2010 after chief
executive officer Jamie Dimon ousted co-heads Steve Black and
Bill Winters. He was stripped of all day-to-day management
duties and passed over for promotion in July. He had been
looking for a new job for several months, according to people
with knowledge of the situation. </p>
<p>BlueMountain, co-founded in 2003 by Andrew Feldstein, who
helped create the credit-derivatives market while he worked for
JPMorgan in the 1990s, aided the bank last year as it unwound
trades at the heart of what became at least $6.2 billion in
losses at its CIO unit. </p>
<h2>Ethical People'' </h2>
<p>Jes is one of the most experienced and successful leaders
in the industry and has played a key role at one of the world''s
most successful financial institutions,Feldstein, the 48-
year-old chief executive and chief investment officer of
BlueMountain, said in the statement. Not only has he had a
front row seat for the evolution of the financial industry, but
he''s also one of the most ethical people we''ve worked with. </p>
<p>BlueMountain benefited after a trader in the JPMorgan CIO
unit, Bruno Iksil, had built a portfolio of credit derivatives
so large it distorted price relationships in the market, first
reported by Bloomberg News on April 5. The hedge fund compiled
offsetting index trades to help JPMorgan unwind the position,
people familiar with the trading said at the time. </p>
<p>Staley warned Dimon that supervision and risk controls in
former Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew''s division weren''t
strong enough, current and former executives said last year.
Dimon brushed off the concerns, one of the people said. JPMorgan
has denied that assertion. </p>
<h2>Warning Dimon </h2>
<p>Staley was moved to a new role in July when Dimon named
Matt Zames, who worked for Staley in the investment bank, co-
chief operating officer with Frank Bisignano. London-based
Barclays Plc and Baltimore-based Legg Mason Inc. both considered
hiring him as CEO during searches last year, the Wall Street
Journal and CNBC reported at the time. </p>
<p>Jes has been an extraordinary leader and a valued partner
for many of us at JPMorgan over the years, Dimon said in an e-
mail to senior managers today. While Jes is leaving JPMorgan
Chase, he is joining a respected private investment firm,
BlueMountain Capital. BlueMountain is an important client of
ours, and we look forward to working with Jes in the future. </p>
<p>Feldstein co-founded BlueMountain with Harvard Law friend
Stephen Siderow in a spinoff from BlueCrest Capital Management
LLP. Affiliated Managers Group Inc., the company with stakes in
firms overseeing about $416 billion, last year increased its
minority stake in BlueMountain. </p>
<p>Proceeds from the stake sale to Staley will be invested in
new infrastructure, technology and people, BlueMountain said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) has taken a
stake in Cantab Capital Partners LLP after the two firms revised
the terms of a licensing agreement the hedge fund had used to
pay the New York-based bank for using its technology. </p>
<p>Cantab paid Goldman Sachs fees as part of a deal when the
firm started in 2006, according to two people with knowledge of
the matter who declined to be identified because Cantab is
private. They restructured it last year, with Goldman Sachs
giving up the fees in exchange for a minority ownership stake in
Cantab, they said. Cantab, based in Cambridge, England, told its
investors of the change in a letter earlier this month. </p>
<p>As you are aware, we have been spending 2012 building our
own information-technology system, Cantab Chief Investment
Officer Ewan Kirk said in the letter, which was obtained by
Bloomberg News. As part of this, the existing profit-share
arrangement with Goldman Sachs has been amended and as from
December 31, Goldman Sachs will become a partner. </p>
<p>Kirk, who has a doctorate in mathematics from England''s
University of Southampton, led a team of 120 employees at
Goldman Sachs focused on quantitative investing before he
founded Cantab with $60 million. The hedge fund, which relies on
computers and mathematical algorithms to spot trades, has grown
to manage $4.7 billion, according to the letter. </p>
<h2>Quant Funds </h2>
<p>Officials at Cantab and Goldman Sachs declined to comment
on the size of the bank''s stake in the hedge fund. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs hasn''t invested in Cantab or paid any money
for the stake as part of the restricting of the licensing deal,
one of the people said. The Cantab position isn''t held by
Goldman Sachs'' Petershill unit, which uses client money to buy
stakes in hedge funds, the person added. </p>
<p>Cantab, which has stopped accepting money from new
investors, gained 15 percent last year and 13 percent in 2011,
according to the client letter. Others have lost money as
political announcements whipsawed markets and broke up the
trends in asset prices that quant funds try to follow. </p>
<p>The Newedge CTA Trend Sub-Index, which tracks the
performance of the largest computer-driven hedge funds, fell 3.4

<p>Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G), Italy''s
biggest insurer, agreed to buy the 49 percent stake it doesn''t
own in its eastern European venture with private-equity firm PPF
Group NV for 2.5 billion euros ($3.3 billion). </p>
<p>Generali will acquire about half the stake by March 28 for
1.29 billion euros and the rest at the end of 2014, the Trieste,
Italy-based company said in a statement today. The insurer will
use proceeds from bond sales in December to finance the first
purchase and part of the amount will return to Generali as
reimbursement of PPF''s debts. </p>
<p>Generali and Amsterdam-based PPF, controlled by Czech
billionaire Petr Kellner, formed the joint venture in 2007,
combining their insurance assets in eastern Europe to create a
company with 9 million customers in 12 countries. Generali Chief
Executive Officer Mario Greco, who pursued the deal as part of a
plan to boost profit from emerging markets, said the insurer
won''t need a capital increase to fund the second tranche. </p>
<p>The deal is positive because it allows Generali to take
the control of the venture without need of capital increase,
Alberto Villa and Michele Ballatore, analysts at Intermonte SIM
SpA, who have an outperform recommendation on the stock, wrote
in a note today. </p>
<p>Generali rose as much as 1.7 percent, and was up 1.3
percent to 14.54 euros at 9:25 a.m. in Milan, giving the company
a market value of 22.6 billion euros. The Bloomberg Europe 500
Insurance Index (BEINSUR) fell 0.7 percent, paring its gain over the past
six months to 27 percent. Generali rose 45 percent over that
period. </p>
<h2>Funding Generation </h2>
<p>The net amount payable in the first part of the purchase
will be about 1.1 billion euros, the insurer said. </p>
<p>Generali doesn''t need external funding to pay the second
tranche of the transaction, Greco said on a conference call.
Generali''s funding generation is enough to cover the
purchase, he said, ruling out any need of a capital increase. </p>
<p>The two companies also agreed to swap some assets,
including the combined 38.5 percent stake in Russian insurer OEO
Ingosstrakh, which will be transferred to Generali. The insurer
will sell PPF its insurance operations in Russia, Ukraine,
Belarus and Kazakhstan, in consumer finance insurance for 80
million euros. </p>
<p>This transaction eliminates all uncertainty over our
development strategy in central and eastern Europe and the
resources required from the group to put it in place, Greco
said in the statement. We''ll be able to take full advantage of
our investment and focus on developing our core insurance
business while improving competitiveness and profitability. </p>

<p>Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G), Italy''s
biggest insurer, agreed to buy the 49 percent stake it doesn''t
own in its eastern European venture with private-equity firm PPF
Group NV for 2.5 billion euros ($3.3 billion). </p>
<p>Generali will acquire about half the stake by March 28 for
1.29 billion euros and the rest at the end of 2014, the Trieste,
Italy-based company said in a statement today. The insurer will
use proceeds stemming from bonds sold in December to finance the
first purchase and part of the amount will return to Generali as
reimbursement of PPF''s debts. The net amount payable by Generali
in the first part of the purchase will be about 1.1 billion
euros, the insurer said. </p>
<p>Generali and Amsterdam-based PPF, controlled by Czech
billionaire Petr Kellner, formed the joint venture in 2007,
combining their insurance assets in eastern Europe to create a
company with 9 million customers in 12 countries. Mario Greco,
who took over as chief executive officer of Generali in August,
pursued the deal as part of a plan to boost profit by focusing
on emerging markets. </p>
<p>This transaction eliminates all uncertainty over our
development strategy in central and eastern Europe and the
resources required from the group to put it in place, Greco
said in the statement. We''ll be able to take full advantage of
our investment and focus on developing our core insurance
business while improving competitiveness and profitability. </p>
<p>The two companies also agreed to swap some assets,
including the combined 38.5 percent stake in Russian insurer OEO
Ingosstrakh, which will be transferred to Generali. </p>

<p>Banque Saudi Fransi (BSFR), whose fourth-
quarter profit topped estimates, will probably spur upbeat
earnings expectations for other banks in the largest Arab
economy, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) </p>
<p>The fifth-biggest Saudi Arabian lender, part-owned by
Credit Agricole SA (ACA), said yesterday quarterly profit climbed 22
percent to 808 million riyals ($215 million). That beat the
average estimate of five analysts for a profit of 750 million
riyals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Total operating
income rose 16 percent, while net special commission income
increased 7 percent to 834 million riyals. </p>
<p>This is an encouraging start to the Saudi banks''
reporting, JPMorgan analysts, including Naresh Bilandani and
Christian Kern, wrote in a note to clients. It will likely set
upbeat expectations for full-year reporting of peers, given
investor concerns on the sector post a damp third quarter, which
was negatively impacted by higher-than-expected provisioning. </p>
<p>Saudi Arabian lenders are benefiting from lending to
government projects as the world''s top oil exporter pursues more
than $500 billion of investments to develop infrastructure and
create jobs. Al-Rajhi Bank (RJHI), the kingdom''s biggest lender by
market value, will probably post a 7 percent increase in 2012
net income next week to 7.92 billion riyals, according to the
mean estimate of fourteen analysts compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Rising Provisions </h2>
<p>Shares of Saudi banks underperformed the benchmark index
last year and third-quarter net missed estimates as rising
provisions against bad loans from construction companies
eclipsed the fastest loan growth in three years. The Tadawul All
Share Bank Index rose 0.4 percent in 2012, compared with a 6
percent gain for the Tadawul. Saudi Fransi shares tumbled 13
percent in the period. </p>
<p>JPMorgan has an overweight recommendation on the stock with
a price estimate of 42 riyals. The shares, which are unchanged
so far this month, closed at 29.40 riyals in Riyadh trading
yesterday. </p>
<p>Saudi Fransi''s earnings have bounced sharply as non-
interest income recovered and provisioning costs normalized,
EFG-Hermes Holding SAE said in a research note yesterday.
However, balance sheet growth was sluggish, with loan growth
decelerating and deposits declining marginally. Net interest
spreads are likely to have been impacted by year-end hike in
deposit rates, and should recover in the first quarter of
2013. EFG-Hermes also has a price estimate of 42 riyals for
the stock, with a buy recommendation. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Executive
Officer Steve Ballmer, in a surprise appearance at a technology
trade show in Las Vegas, said the number of applications for new
Windows tablets has increased fivefold since late October. </p>
<p>There are four times more applications for Windows RT
computers now than there were when the device was introduced in
late October, Ballmer said yesterday at the International
Consumer Electronics Show. He said that more apps -- including
Twitter Inc., Dropbox Inc. and Time Warner Inc. (TWX)''s CNN -- are
coming. </p>
<p>Ballmer is striving to drum up interest in the latest
flavor of Microsoft''s flagship operating system while he plays
catch-up to Apple Inc. in the $63.2 billion market for tablets.
Early demand for some Windows tablets has appeared
disappointing, according to analysts at FBR Capital Markets. </p>
<p>The availability of a broad range of apps is crucial for
luring customers to mobile devices such as tablets. In December
alone, the number of new apps reached 10,000, Ballmer said.
Among them: Expedia Inc., Fitbit Inc. and AOL Inc.''s Huffington
Post. </p>
<p>Microsoft said in late 2011 that Ballmer''s address at the
2012 CES would be the company''s last keynote. He appeared
yesterday during a presentation by Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) CEO Paul Jacobs. </p>
<p>Microsoft sold five times more Windows Phone devices during
the week of Christmas than the same period a year earlier,
Ballmer said. He didn''t give specific numbers. </p>

<p>Four of the top 10 U.S. money-market
fund providers said they''ll disclose daily fund values,
pressuring rivals to follow suit as regulators consider banning
the use of a constant $1 share price. </p>
<p>BlackRock Inc. (BLK), the world''s biggest money manager, will
begin revealing daily net asset values for all its U.S. money
funds on Jan. 16. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) began today to
disclose the values for its funds that are eligible to purchase
commercial paper, or prime funds. JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) plans to
take that step for all money funds, starting with prime funds on
Jan. 14, and Bank of New York Mellon Corp. will make daily
market values available going forward. </p>
<p>The prime goal here is to diffuse the misperception
that''s been created by regulators that fund share prices are an
accounting fiction, Peter Crane, president of research firm
Crane Data LLC, said in an interview. It''s a pretty good bet
the daily values will show that market-value NAVs don''t float. </p>
<p>Regulators led by former U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro have worked to impose tighter
restrictions on money funds since the September 2008 collapse of
the $62.5 billion Reserve Primary Fund. Proposals to make the
funds stronger have included abandoning the $1 fixed share
price, an idea providers want to counter because they say it
would destroy the appeal of money funds, which investors use as
an alternative to holding cash. </p>
<p>Money-market funds buy short-term debt securities and book
them based on their expected value at maturity. They also round
their share prices to the nearest 1 cent. Those practices
obscure small fluctuations in the funds'' market values. </p>
<h2>SEC Encouraged'' </h2>
<p>Rule changes enacted by the SEC in 2010 required funds to
disclose their market value, or shadow net-asset value, on a
monthly basis, with a 60-day lag. Some providers, including
Fidelity and Vanguard, opposed the change at the time, saying it
could confuse investors. </p>
<p>SEC Chairman Elisse B. Walter, who took over from Shapiro
last month, welcomed today''s announcements by the New York-based
fund managers. </p>
<p>Chairman Walter is encouraged when industry voluntarily
takes steps to provide greater transparency for investors,
John Nester, an SEC spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Fidelity Investments, the biggest U.S. money-fund manager
with $420 billion in such assets, is considering daily
disclosure of per-share market values, Stephen Austin, a
spokesman for the Boston-based company, said in an interview. </p>
<h2>Vanguard, Fidelity </h2>
<p>Nancy Prior, Fidelity''s head of money funds, said in an
October speech in Washington the firm would support more
frequent disclosure of market values. </p>
<p>If regulators believe that providing this information
more often could improve the resiliency of the funds and the
overall stability of the financial system, then we would support
such disclosure, Prior said in the speech. </p>
<p>Vanguard Group Inc., the fourth-biggest provider, said it
wasn''t planning to increase the frequency of shadow NAV
disclosure. </p>
<p>We have not seen an increased demand for more frequent
disclosure from our clients, who are primarily retail
investors, John Woerth, a spokesman for the Valley Forge,
Pennsylvania-based company said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Woerth said market-value fluctuations in Vanguard''s largest
money fund, the $123 billion Vanguard Prime Money Market Fund,
has been de minimus. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s asset-management unit was the first to
announce a change in a statement today. </p>
<p>Crane said he doubted the practical value of disclosing the
market values. </p>
<h2>Rounding Prices </h2>
<p>The shadow NAVs don''t differ materially from the rounded
NAVs unless something blows up, in which case you don''t see it
until after it happens, he said. </p>
<p>Meghan McAndrew, a spokeswoman for Pittsburgh-based
Federated Investors, the second-largest money-market mutual-fund
manager in the U.S., declined to comment on the firm''s plans
regarding NAV disclosure. </p>
<p>In the run-up to the rule''s enforcement, some companies,
including Charles Schwab Corp. and T. Rowe Price Group (TROW) Inc.,
injected cash into funds that were carrying small losses to
boost their market values back to $1 before they were forced to
disclose the shortfalls. </p>
<h2>Schapiro''s Proposal </h2>
<p>More recently, industry leaders offered to increase fund
disclosure as part of a proposal made to regulators in October.
That plan would require funds to reveal shadow NAVs on a weekly
basis with a five-day lag. </p>
<p>Companies made the proposal while continuing to resist
calls from Schapiro, the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department
for SEC commissioners to consider approving a floating share
price for funds. </p>
<p>Schapiro, who left the SEC in December, had planned as
recently as August to propose that money funds be forced to
choose to either float their share value or adopt a combination
of capital buffers and withdrawal restrictions to protect
against credit losses and investor runs. She shelved the
proposal when three of her four fellow commissioners signaled
that they would reject it. </p>
<p>A senior panel of regulators, the Financial Stability
Oversight Council, began a process in November by which it can
pressure SEC commissioners to reconsider the elements of
Schapiro''s plan. The panel includes the heads of the SEC and
central bank, and is headed by Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner. </p>
<h2>Reserve Primary </h2>
<p>We''re not doing this in anticipation of a floating net-asset value, JPMorgan''s Deutsch said. Our decision was
informed by the extra scrutiny money funds have come under
since 2008. The world changed when the Reserve Fund broke the
buck and since then we''ve been making details of our holdings
more accessible. </p>
<p>The Reserve Primary fund fell below $1 a share, or broke
the buck, in September 2008 because it held debt issued by
bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Its closing triggered a
wider run on prime money funds that helped freeze global credit
markets. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs said it would expand the daily disclosure
next week to include money funds that invest in municipal and
government debt. The daily values will be available to investors
on the morning after the previous day''s close. </p>
<p>JPMorgan manages about $233 billion in U.S. money funds,
according to Crane Data, based in Westborough, Massachusetts.
Goldman Sachs''s asset-management unit manages $856 billion in
client money. It is the eighth-biggest provider of money-market
funds in the U.S. </p>

three-year-old Beijing court ruling that it exceeded the scope

holder Zhongyi Electronic Ltd. </p>
<p>The Beijing Higher People''s Court upheld a November 2009

<p>Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest U.S. bank by assets, plans to eliminate about 1,600 jobs from its investment bank and support staff in coming weeks, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said. </p> <p>The cuts total about 6 percent of the New York-based company''s institutional securities group, which includes investment banking and trading units, and support staff, the person said, asking not to be identified because the decision hasn''t been made public. About half the reductions will be in the U.S., the person said. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley reduced staff by about 4,200 people in the first nine months of last year through job cuts and unit sales, after saying in December 2011 it would trim 1,600 jobs. Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, 54, has pledged to lower costs as return on equity remains below the bank''s cost of capital. </p> <p>All levels of employees will be affected, with a focus on senior workers, the person said. The cuts will be distributed across all investment banking and trading units, and some workers have already been notified, the person said. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley, which had 57,726 employees as of Sept. 30, has laid out a plan to cut $1.4 billion of annual expenses by next year. The firm produced a return on equity of about 5 percent in the first nine months of 2012, excluding charges related to its own credit spreads. That''s below Gorman''s target of 15 percent. </p> <h2>Bold Fix'' </h2> <p>Daniel Loeb''s Third Point LLC said today that it bought a stake in Morgan Stanley and that the firm''s shares may double. The New York-based hedge fund called for a bold fix for the bank''s fixed-income trading business that includes reducing costs in the unit. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley fell 3 cents, or 0.2 percent, to close at $19.62 in New York. The shares climbed 26 percent in 2012, and trade at about 65 percent of book value, a measure of the firm''s assets minus liabilities. </p> <p>Citigroup Inc. said last month it would cut 11,000 jobs and pull back from some emerging-market nations. UBS AG announced in October that it would fire 10,000 workers and largely exit fixed-income trading. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Michael J.

<p>Morgan Stanley shares may double as
brokerage margins improve and management devises a bold fix
for the fixed-income trading business, Daniel Loeb''s Third Point
LLC said as it disclosed a stake in the firm. </p>
<p>The hedge fund bought shares at an average cost of $16.77,
15 percent below yesterday''s close of $19.65, Third Point said
today in a letter to investors. The stock will probably rise as
earnings increase and the bank gets a greater percentage of
profit from wealth-management, the fund said. </p>
<p>We view MS at these prices as a chance to buy a free call
option on a promising restructuring, Third Point said in the
letter, referring to New York-based Morgan Stanley by its stock
ticker. Although MS has historically failed to capitalize on
its strengths, its leadership currently is focused on growing
its good businesses while consolidating and successfully fixing
its previously troubled wealth-management business. </p>
<p>Third Point didn''t disclose the size of the stake. The
stock fell 0.2 percent to $19.62 at 4 p.m. in New York trading. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), which pays its directors more than rivals,
should revise its board practices and upgrade the members of
its board, the hedge fund said. </p>
<h2>Encouraging'' Results </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley has shown encouraging results in
improving profitability at its retail brokerage joint venture
with Citigroup Inc., the hedge fund said in the letter. The bank
must do more in 2013 to address its fixed income, currency and
commodities, or FICC, trading unit, according to the letter. </p>
<p>Mark Lake, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley, declined to
comment on Third Point''s letter. </p>
<p>Gorman has already pledged to shrink that group, with plans
to reduce risk-weighted assets in the business 35 percent from
the third quarter of 2011 through the end of 2014. Morgan
Stanley is cutting 1,600 jobs from its investment banking and
trading units and support staff, a person with direct knowledge
of the plans said today. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley has a tougher road ahead in dealing with
its FICC businesses, which are limping along with a still-
bloated cost structure and anemic returns due to regulatory
changes stemming from the global financial crisis, Third Point
wrote. </p>

<p>Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G) Chief
Executive Officer Mario Greco is targeting growing emerging
markets as he seeks to revive profit at the third-largest
insurer in Europe, a mission that cost his predecessor the job. </p>
<p>Generali has agreed this week to buy the 49 percent stake
it doesn''t own in its eastern European venture with private-
equity firm PPF Group, as part of a plan to boost business in
the region, considered by Greco a core market. The CEO
expects profitability in the area will be twice as much as in
western European markets over the next five years. </p>
<p>The 53-year-old CEO, who took the helm at Trieste, Italy-
based Generali in August, will unveil Jan. 14 in London the
guidelines of his plan to strengthen finances, boost profit and
cut debt. He will seek to convince investors he can replicate
what he achieved over 17 years in the insurance industry, when
he oversaw businesses in countries including France, Spain,
Turkey and Italy. </p>
<p>Allocating resources in growing businesses and freeing-up
capital in non-core business is the right strategy, said
Stefano Girola, who manages about 3 billion euros ($3.9 billion)
at Banca Albertini Syz  C. in Milan and owns Generali''s stock.
Greco is showing investors he is on the right track to turn
around and modernize the company. </p>
<p>Generali, which operates in more than 60 countries with
82,000 employees, makes about 10 percent of its operating profit
in central and eastern Europe. The company has also set up
offices in the main markets of the Far East, including India and
China, where it has a joint venture with China National
Petroleum Corp. </p>
<h2>High-Growth Markets </h2>
<p>Generali''s agreement to buy PPF''s stake is a way to
reinforce its position as the market-leading insurance company
in the region, Greco said in a conference call Jan. 8.
Definitely, this is also a clear signal that we invest in
high-growth markets and we use core markets as the engine to
finance growth in the most developing markets. </p>
<p>Greco arrived at Generali at a time when the insurer''s
capital was weakened by exposure to Italy''s sovereign debt and
its stock was trading near the lowest level in more than 20
years. The insurer''s poor track record for governance
weighed on the shares as well, Atanasio Pantarrotas, an analyst
at CA Cheuvreux wrote in a Jan. 9 note. </p>
<p>Investors led by Mediobanca SpA (MB) and Leonardo Del Vecchio,
which together own 16 percent of the company, forced Giovanni Perissinotto to resign as CEO on June 2, after profit fell for
four consecutive quarters on writedowns of assets including
Greek bonds and lower earnings at the life-insurance unit. The
controlling shareholders picked Greco, then head of general
insurance at Zurich Insurance Group AG, to replace Perissinotto. </p>
<h2>CEO Ousting </h2>
<p>The shares, which hit their lowest level since December
1988 on May 31, just two days before Perissinotto''s ousting,
have rallied 42 percent since Greco''s appointment, compared with
the 23 percent increase in the Bloomberg Europe 500 Insurance
Index (BEINSUR), showing investors'' optimism about his ability to turn
around the company. </p>
<p>Despite the recent share performance, there may still be
some upside on the stock, Matteo Ghilotti, a Milan-based
analyst at Equita Sim wrote in a Jan. 7 report. </p>
<p>In the three months following his appointment, Greco
shuffled management to spur profit growth and smooth relations
with investors. He moved Managing Director Sergio Balbinot to
the new position of chief insurance officer and appointed
Alberto Minali as chief financial officer to replace Raffaele Agrusti, who became country manager for Italy. </p>
<p>Generali also created a ten-member management committee
that will be led by Greco with Balbinot as deputy, and it will
include the heads of Italy, France and Germany as well as other
top executives. </p>
<h2>Asset Sales </h2>
<p>While on one hand Generali is boosting investment in high-
growth areas, on the other hand Greco will seek to improve its
capital position and reduce debt by disposing of non-strategic
assets, including the U.S. life reinsurance business and Swiss
asset-management unit BSI Group and cutting costs. Analysts at
Merrill Lynch Bank of America, CA Cheuvreux and Equita expect
cost cuts between 235 million euros and 800 million euros in the
next three years, with a reorganization in Italy and a boost to
efficiency through a simplified structure. </p>
<p>Generali''s solvency I ratio, a measure of its ability to
absorb losses, was 140 percent at the end of the third quarter,
compared with a median of 195 percent for ten insurance

<p>Francois-Xavier de Mallmann, a
London-based partner at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., bought an
apartment on Manhattan''s Park Avenue for $13 million, 13 percent
less than what its owners initially sought. </p>
<p>The deal for the four-bedroom co-op at 730 Park Ave., near
71st Street, was completed on Dec. 26, according to New York
City property records made public today. The apartment was once
home to Richard Mack, chief executive officer of AREA Property
Partners LP''s North America division. Mack transferred the
property in 2011 to his wife, Christine, who was listed as the
seller, property records show. </p>
<p>The 4,300-square-foot (400-square-meter) property includes
a library, a staff room and a hallway ideal for displaying
your art collection, according to the Corcoran Group brokerage
listing posted on StreetEasy.com. An outstanding layout with
spectacular entertainment space and grand rooms. </p>
<p>The deal was completed amid a surge in year-end luxury-home
transactions made before an expected jump in capital-gains taxes
on Jan. 1. There were more sales of Manhattan luxury property in
the last three months of 2012 than in any other fourth quarter
since at least 1989, when New York appraiser Miller Samuel Inc.
began tracking the data. </p>
<p>Luxury sales, defined as the top 10 percent of transactions
by price, jumped 29 percent from a year earlier to 260, based on
data Miller Samuel collected from public records through Dec.
31. The figures capture 85 percent of all such deals in the
quarter and will climb higher as purchases completed in the
final days of last month are reported with the city finance
department, said Jonathan Miller, the appraiser''s president. </p>
<h2>Price Cut </h2>
<p>Mack declined to comment on the deal. De Mallmann, Goldman
Sachs''s head of investment banking services in Europe, the
Middle East and Africa, didn''t return an e-mail. Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to comment. </p>
<p>The apartment de Mallmann purchased was first listed for
sale in April for $15 million, according to StreetEasy. The
asking price was reduced to $13.5 million in October. </p>
<p>De Mallmann, 42, joined Goldman Sachs in 1993 and became a
partner in 2004, one year after being named a managing director.
He was head of the European financing group before taking his
current job in 2011. He has French and Swiss citizenship,
according to a Goldman Sachs filing in November. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s largest
drugmaker, is weighing whether to ask U.S. regulators to
expedite their review of a potential $5 billion-a-year treatment
to slow a type of incurable breast cancer. </p>
<p>The therapy, called PD 0332991, generated excitement among
oncologists in December after data showed the drug stopped
disease progression for more than two years in 165 patients.
That trial was done in the second of three stages of research
regularly required for Food and Drug administration approval. </p>
<p>The FDA has cleared cancer drugs for sale before final
trial results are completed, including New York-based Pfizer''s
Xalkori for lung tumors in 2011 and Novartis AG (NOVN)''s Gleevec for
leukemia a decade earlier. While no company decision has been
made to push for early clearance, There are some precedents
for approval after Phase 2, said Mikael Dolsten, Pfizer''s head
of worldwide research. </p>
<p>We''ll see whether there are ways to accelerate
availability of the drug for patients, Dolsten said in an
interview at the JPMorgan Chase  Co. health conference in San
Francisco. We''re obviously open to dialogues and advice from
FDA and the European agencies. </p>
<p>Pfizer climbed 1.1 percent to $26.76 at the close of New
York trading. The shares have increased 22 percent in the last
12 months. </p>
<p>The drugmaker hopes to start the final-stage trial by the
end of March, said Geno Germano, who heads the company''s
oncology and specialty care businesses. The medicine is the
first in a new class of agents that works by blocking a protein
critical in the cancer cell cycle, lead researcher Richard Finn
said in December. </p>
<h2>Metastatic Disease </h2>
<p>The study unveiled in December included women with tumors
fueled by the hormone estrogen, the most common type of breast
cancer. All had metastatic disease, which had spread to other
parts of the body and is no longer considered curable. Almost
230,000 women in the U.S. will be diagnosed with breast cancer
this year, and more than 39,900 will die from it, according to
the American Cancer Society. </p>
<p>If cleared, Pfizer''s drug may generate as much as $5
billion in yearly sales, wrote Andrew Baum, an analyst at
Citigroup Inc., in a Nov. 29 note to investors. That comes as
Pfizer is seeking new treatments to replace the $10 billion in
losses from its cholesterol medicine Lipitor, the world''s best-
selling pill with $13 billion in sales before losing market
exclusivity. </p>
<p>By the end of this year, we''re going to have the Phase 3
enrolling, we''re going to have two Phase 2s done, and we''re
going to be talking to the agency about getting the product to
patients, Germano said in an interview at the conference. </p>
<h2>Data Available </h2>
<p>The positive Phase 2 results, which showed the drug was
safe, may give Pfizer much of the data it could use to justify
seeking an early ruling, even without the larger number of
patients usually tested in a late-stage study, Dolsten said. </p>
<p>The patients tolerate it very, very well, and that brings
the two components of benefit and risk to the table, he said.
The agency has been very thoughtful when it comes to making
those judgments on when they can accelerate access of drugs and
approve them on a smaller dataset than a traditional approval. </p>
<p>Baum, the Citigroup analyst, said in his note that Pfizer
is already at least two years ahead of its closest competitors,
Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY) and Novartis, with similar cancer drugs in
development. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) sold $35
million of one-year notes linked to the price of gold, the
bank''s largest offering tied to the precious metal in at least
three years. </p>
<p>The securities, issued Jan. 2, yield three times the gains
of the price of gold in London up to 15.6 percent, with no
protection against losses and all capital at risk, according to
a prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. The metal''s price increased 8.3 percent last year in
London. </p>
<p>The bank sold $82.4 million of notes tied to gold in eight
offerings last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
New York-based JPMorgan issued $27.8 million of one-year
securities on Oct. 26, the next-largest deal since 2010, when
Bloomberg began collecting comprehensive data on U.S. structured
notes. </p>
<p>Elizabeth Seymour, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan Chase,
declined to comment on the latest offering or future gold notes. </p>
<p>Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather. </p>

<p>Computers running Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)''s
Windows software and Intel Corp. (INTC)''s processors will continue
losing market share to tablets and smartphones this year,
according to researcher Canalys. </p>
<p>So-called Wintel machines will grab 65 percent of the
computer market this year, down from 72 percent in 2012, Canalys
said. In the fourth quarter of last year, combined shipments of
desktops, netbooks and notebooks declined about 10 percent from
the same period in 2011. </p>
<p>Windows 8, a new version of Microsoft''s flagship software
revamped to work with touch-screen machines, hasn''t helped boost
PC sales because many consumers resisted the need to learn a new
operating system, Canalys said. As PCs fall out of favor, the
market for tablets such as Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s iPad and touch-screen
devices running Google Inc. (GOOG)''s Android software will surge to
reach 59 percent of the market, or 389 million units, by 2016. </p>
<p>Wintel PCs are becoming less likely as an individual''s
first choice of computing device for everyday tasks, such as
sending e-mail or Web browsing, Pin-Chen Tang, an analyst at
Canalys, said in a research report. Pads and, increasingly,
smartphones can perform many of the day-to-day computing tasks
that most people require. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) racked up more U.S. patents than any other company for the
20th straight year, helped by increasing contributions from its
researchers in other countries. </p>
<p>IBM''s 6,478 patents in 2012 mark a record for the company,
research firm IFI Claims Patent Services said in a statement.
South Korea''s Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) and Tokyo-based Canon Inc. (7751)
ranked second and third. Google Inc. took a spot in the top 50
for the first time, with 15 more patents than Apple (AAPL) Inc. </p>
<p>About 30 percent of IBM''s patents were produced by
inventors outside the U.S., up from 22 percent in 2010. Research
centers in Germany, Japan, Canada, the U.K. and Israel were
especially productive, the Armonk, New York-based company said.
The percentage of its patents coming from overseas is expected
to continue growing as newer labs in Brazil and Kenya ramp up,
said Manny Schecter, IBM''s chief patent counsel. </p>
<p>Intellectual property flows from where markets are
flourishing, he said in an interview. You''ll see upticks in
the amount of technology and intellectual property which we
generate outside the U.S. </p>
<p>IBM''s flow of patents lets the computer-services giant
produce about $1 billion a year in licensing revenue. The
intellectual property also gives it the freedom to move into new
businesses with less risk of being sued over technology. </p>
<h2>Qualcomm''s Bounty </h2>
<p>Still, some other technology companies get much higher
royalty revenue from a smaller number of patents. Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM),
a designer of mobile-phone chips, made $6.33 billion in
technology licensing in the most recent fiscal year -- even
though it''s not in the top 10 of IFI''s list. </p>
<p>Apple, whose innovations helped revolutionize computing and
mobile phones, also isn''t one of the biggest recipients of U.S.
patents. The maker of the iPhone and iPad spends about half as
much as IBM on research and development. </p>
<p>Even so, Apple did make gains in this year''s list, jumping
to No. 22 from 39th place. Google, Apple''s biggest rival in
smartphone software, rose to 21st place. Both companies are
embroiled in lawsuits over intellectual property -- along with
other mobile-phone makers such as Samsung -- giving them more
incentive to increase their store of patents. </p>
<h2>Broader Trend </h2>
<p>Companies are applying for more U.S. patents in general,
Mike Baycroft, chief executive officer of Madison, Connecticut-
based IFI, said in the statement. This year, the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office issued a total of 253,155 patents, a record. </p>
<p>IBM, which has more than 430,000 employees worldwide,
invests about $6 billion in RD each year. With more than 67,000
patents since 1993, about half of which are active, it is easier
for the company to avoid courtrooms, Schecter has said. Eight
thousand inventors in 46 states and 35 countries contributed to
last year''s patents. </p>
<p>The latest crop of patents underscores the kinds of markets
IBM is trying to enter. In computer security, the company has a
patent for blocking attacks from an intruder to a network. In
the realm of IBM''s Smarter Planet initiative, the company was
granted one patent for predicting traffic patterns using GPS in
vehicles and another for remotely monitoring and adjusting power
usage across an electricity grid. </p>
<p>The patents also included a technique for providing precise
answers to natural-language questions. This is the technology
that IBM uses for Watson, the computer that beat humans on the
Jeopardy! quiz show and is now being applied to health care
and finance. </p>
<p>Our future intellectual property strategy is a reflection
of our business strategy, Schecter said. We like being the
leader and will continue to be very aggressive. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s private-
wealth-management unit expects hedge funds to return an average
of 4 percent to 5 percent over the next five years as the
industry struggles amid low interest rates. </p>
<p>Everybody hopes to get the five hedge funds, all of whom
are going to have 15 percent returns, Sharmin Mossavar- Rahmani, chief investment officer of Goldman Sachs Private
Wealth Management''s Investment Strategy Group, said at a press
briefing today. People need to be more realistic. </p>
<p>The $2.19 trillion hedge-fund industry last year trailed
global stocks for the fifth time in seven years, posting a 6.7
percent gain, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The MSCI
All-Country World Index (MXWO) returned 17 percent in 2012, and the
Standard  Poor''s 500 Index (SPX) rose 16 percent. </p>
<p>Federal Reserve officials said last year they will keep
interest rates near zero as long as the jobless rate is above
6.5 percent and inflation is forecast to be 2.5 percent or less.
Previously they said they will keep rates low through at least
mid-2015. </p>
<p>Mossavar-Rahmani said investors are overestimating how
much hedge funds can return in excess of market indexes. While
some managers may do well, the low-interest-rate environment
makes it difficult to produce double-digit returns, she said. </p>
<p>They don''t walk on water, Mossavar-Rahmani said. </p>
<p>Equity funds and event-driven funds, those that invest in
companies undergoing transactions such as mergers or spinoffs,
may benefit if stock markets rise next year, she said. </p>

<p>Global securitization volumes jumped
20 percent last year to $511.6 billion as JPMorgan Chase (JPM)  Co.
widened its lead as the top underwriter, according to newsletter
Asset-Backed Alert. </p>
<p>JPMorgan managed the sales for $66.2 billion, or 12.9
percent, of the total offerings of securities backed by assets
such as home mortgages, auto debt and speculative-grade company
loans, according to the newsletter. </p>
<p>The bank''s share grew from 10.1 percent in 2011 as the New
York-based firm managed $39.9 billion in sales of asset-backed
securities tied to U.S. consumer or corporate borrowing, a
category that excludes mortgage debt and so-called
collateralized debt obligations. Barclays Plc (BARC) and Bank of
America Corp., the other top underwriters in that market,
remained the second- and third-ranked global bookrunners. </p>
<p>Barclays handled 10 percent of the global total last year,
up from 9.2 percent for the London-based bank, according to
Asset-Backed Alert. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of
America''s share climbed to 8.7 percent, from 8 percent. </p>
<p>Worldwide securitization volumes are down from the record
$2.57 trillion reached in 2006, a year before U.S. mortgage
securities and CDOs began a collapse that would spark the worst

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) will become the
latest big bank ordered by U.S. regulators to clean up its
safeguards against money laundering, said a person briefed on
the situation. </p>
<p>Banking regulators including the Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency will soon order the largest U.S. bank to fix
compliance flaws in its Bank Secrecy Act responsibilities, said
the person, who declined to be identified because the talks
aren''t public. The order doesn''t include monetary penalties and
is similar to one issued to Citigroup Inc. (C) in April, the person
said. </p>
<p>Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan, and Bryan Hubbard, an OCC spokesman, declined to
comment on the order. </p>
<p>After the 2008 credit crisis companies reduced compliance
staff tasked with guarding the financial system against the flow
of illicit money, banking regulators said. HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA),
Europe''s largest bank, agreed last month to pay $1.9 billion to
settle a money-laundering probe by the U.S. Department of
Justice and banking regulators in the U.S. and U.K. Another
London-based bank, Standard Chartered Plc, was fined a total of
$667 million by U.S. regulators last year for facilitating
transactions with Iran in violation of sanctions. </p>
<p>In a separate OCC probe, Treasury Department Inspector
General Eric Thorson threatened to sanction the bank if it fails
to turn over documents to regulators investigating its ties to
Bernard Madoff''s Ponzi scheme, giving JPMorgan a deadline of
today to cooperate with the regulator. </p>
<p>The OCC is also investigating the 2012 trading losses in
JPMorgan''s chief investment office and is preparing an
enforcement action, according to another person briefed on the

<p>The base salaries of analysts at
three major U.S. investment banks have declined since 2009,
while increasing 15 percent at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>The CHART OF THE DAY shows that from 2009 to 2012, the base
pay of analysts at Goldman Sachs increased to $76,250 on average
from $66,000 according to data provided by Glassdoor, a San
Francisco-based career website. The combined average pay at Bank
of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. over
the same period fell to $58,226 from $62,105. The data, which
exclude bonuses and other forms of compensation, were gathered
from verified surveys of analysts with one to three years of
experience at each firm. </p>
<p>Lower salaries are consistent with what we''re hearing, so
it suggests to me that until there''s a turnaround in the banking
sector, until the next period of real growth, we may see more of
the same, said John Challenger, chief executive officer of
Chicago-based Challenger Gray  Christmas Inc., an employment
consulting firm. Goldman has continued to go out and pay for
and be the place that the very top talent wants to go. It''s a
conscious choice that they''ve made to not lose that position. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and
Citigroup declined to comment on the Glassdoor survey. Morgan
Stanley is planning to eliminate 1,600 jobs in the coming weeks
according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. This
accounts for 6 percent of the company''s investment banking
division. The nine largest investment banks announced more than
30,000 job cuts in the first nine months of 2012 according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) portrayed speech recognition pioneer Dragon Systems Inc. as rushing to close a $580 million deal without sufficiently vetting its buyer in a doomed union that triggered a negligence suit and landed the bank in Boston federal court. </p> <p>Beginning its defense this week, Goldman Sachs made its case to jurors who have spent weeks hearing how the 2000 all- stock deal was quickly followed by an accounting scandal that led to the collapse of suitor Lernout  Hauspie Speech Products NV. Goldman Sachs, which advised Dragon on the deal, called witnesses to counter allegations by Dragon founders Jim and Janet Baker that its negligence cost them their life''s work. </p> <p>Testifying Jan. 9 for Goldman Sachs, former Dragon president John Shagoury agreed with a bank attorney that Dragon''s board of directors was focused on speed and certainty in the months leading to the deal. </p> <p>Because the company''s financial situation was getting worse instead of better, and at the same time we felt it was creating a huge distraction for the employees, we needed to get something done, or decide how the company was going to continue, Shagoury testified. </p> <p>Do you blame Goldman Sachs that the stock options became worthless in the merger? Goldman Sachs attorney Paul Vizcarrondo asked. </p> <p>No, said Shagoury, who became president of Lernout  Hauspie Holdings USA when the deal closed, and is now president of health care communications technology company Eliza Corp. </p> <h2>Gross Negligence </h2> <p>Dragon''s founders, who are seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages, claim that four Goldman Sachs bankers assigned to the transaction committed gross negligence by failing to pursue questions about Belgium-based Lernout  Hauspie''s finances that should have led them to avoid the deal. </p> <p>They alleged in court papers that they lost their company and access to the technology they had spent their careers developing, including Dragon NaturallySpeaking dictation software, when Lernout  Hauspie filed for bankruptcy in November 2000. The deal closed in June of that year. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs claimed its team gave Dragon competent advice and said it urged company management to press their accountants at Arthur Andersen LLP to probe Lernout  Hauspie''s finances. </p> <p>The Bakers, who started Dragon in 1982, claim the bankers failed to do due diligence and never advised them to back away from the sale despite lingering questions about LH''s unusual revenue spikes in Asia. </p> <h2>Due Diligence </h2> <p>Lawyers for New York-based Goldman Sachs have argued that due diligence wasn''t the bank''s responsibility under a five-page engagement agreement. Several members of the banking team who worked on the deal said in court testimony that Goldman Sachs properly shepherded the transaction to a final sale. </p> <p>Dragon paid Goldman Sachs $5 million for its advice. </p> <p>With the sale moving ahead in February 2000, Goldman Sachs sent Dragon an unsigned memo recommending the company have Arthur Anderson perform due diligence on Lernout  Hauspie, according to court papers. </p> <p>Catherine Moy, who worked on the Dragon account for Arthur Anderson, testified Jan. 7 that her firm''s work was very limited on the deal. She said the accounting firm was never hired to do any of the tasks Goldman Sachs described in its Feb. 29 memo to Dragon. </p> <p>Former Dragon President Shagoury testified that he remembered both Dragon''s chief financial officer, Ellen Chamberlain, and Goldman Sachs''s team wanted further due diligence. He said Chamberlain eventually declared it done. </p> <h2>Recalls Completion </h2> <p>I recall she said the due diligence was completed, Shagoury told jurors. </p> <p>Chamberlain, who testified Dec. 18, told the jury that Dragon expected Goldman Sachs to conduct due diligence. She said no one from the bank ever expressed reservations about moving forward with the sale. </p> <p>I had a level of expectation of bankers driving a process, making due diligence happen, being very active, detailed and that was not the way Goldman Sachs operated, she said. </p> <p>Chamberlain also testified that no one on the Goldman team ever mentioned that the bank''s own investment division had investigated LH in the late 1990s, under work labeled internally as Project Sermon, and decided not to invest. </p> <p>In a videotaped deposition played for the jury Jan. 4, Goldman Sachs analyst Luca Velussi, who worked on Project Sermon, said he couldn''t remember specific reasons why that project didn''t move forward. </p> <h2>Abandoned Projects </h2> <p>We abandon the vast majority of projects, Velussi said under questioning by the Bakers'' attorney, Alan Cotler. </p> <p>T. Otey Smith, a former member of the Goldman Sachs team who worked on the Dragon deal, testified in a taped deposition that the team''s leader, Richard Wayner, didn''t press the issue that there were unanswered questions about the merger when Dragon''s board of directors met and voted to approved it in March 2000. </p> <p>Wayner testified last month that Goldman Sachs had unanswered questions about Lernout  Hauspie''s suspicious surges in sales in Asia -- revenue that turned out to be fictitious -- but never sought to stop Dragon from selling. </p> <p>Wayner told the jury that, after informing Dragon that Goldman Sachs didn''t receive satisfactory answers from LH, it was the client''s decision whether or not they want to do the deal. </p> <h2>Inadequate Standards </h2> <p>A former investment banker testifying on behalf of Dragon this week told jurors Goldman Sachs''s team didn''t provide the level of standards Goldman sets for itself, nor did it meet industry standards. </p> <p>Their failure to do that gave the folks at the March 27 meeting a flawed and inaccurate picture of what a merger with LH would actually look like, said Donna Hitscherich, a former investment banker with JPMorgan Chase  Co. who now lectures at Columbia Business School, referring to the board meeting. </p> <p>She said she spent more than 700 hours reviewing records from the case. </p> <p>I was shocked, she said. It was grossly subpar and inadequate for the type of engagement they were assigned to. </p> <p>She said she would have expected Goldman Sachs to take additional action after sending Dragon the February 2000 memo. </p> <p>In my mind, that''s a showstopper, Hitscherich said. </p> <h2>Next Week </h2> <p>Testimony in the case, presided over by U.S. District Judge Patti Saris, is scheduled to resume Jan. 14. Goldman Sachs Vice President Chris Fine, who was chief technology strategist for the bank''s high-tech group during the Dragon sale, is to return to the witness stand. Goldman Sachs also said that it plans to call Wayner to testify again. Closing arguments are expected to begin at the end of next week. </p> <p>On Jan. 9, Fine testified the Goldman Sachs team working on the deal developed a list of questions that needed answers in the months prior to the sale, and advised Dragon to obtain an accounting firm with knowledge of accounting regulations in Belgium. </p> <p>Did Dragon follow up on the recommendation to do more due diligence? a Goldman Sachs''s lawyer asked Fine. </p> <p>Not that I recall, he responded. </p> <p>Another case against New York-based Goldman Sachs filed by Paul G. Bamberg and Robert Roth, two other Dragon founders who held minority shares in the company, is being heard at the same time before Saris. </p> <h2>Lernout''s Collapse </h2> <p>According to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Lernout  Hauspie created bogus customers, booked circular transactions with shell companies and recorded loans as sales from 1996 to 2000. The company was forced to restate $373 million in earnings. </p> <p>The suit against Goldman Sachs was put on hold by agreement of both sides for years while the Bakers sued other participants and advisers in the deal. They''ve reached a total of about $70 million in settlements, their lawyer, Cotler, has told Saris. </p> <p>Based on the value of Dragon at the time of the sale, the Bakers'' lost as much as $288.8 million in the deal and its aftermath, they said in court papers. Bamberg and Roth have said they lost as much as $50 million. </p> <p>In court filings, Goldman Sachs said the plaintiffs'' damages are less than the amount they''ve already recovered. </p> <p>On Jan. 2, Bamberg, now a senior lecturer on mathematics at Harvard University, testified he initially opposed the merger and was shocked when the deal became an all-stock offering. In one conversation with Dragon board members, he said he compared partnering with Lernout  Hauspie to joining the Serbian Army. </p> <p>Bamberg said the Goldman Sachs team never raised any concerns about the deal at the board of directors meeting. He said he would have rejected the sale if they had. </p> <p>Anything significant I would have said I''m not signing until we get more information about this, Bamberg said. </p> <p>The case is Baker v. Goldman Sachs  Co., 09-cv-10053, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts (Boston). </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By George Smith Alexander and Jacqueline Simmons" date="Jan 14, 2013 11:19 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-14/pfizer-said-to-weigh-purchase-of-strides-unit-agila-specialties.html"><headline>Pfizer Said to Weigh Purchase of Strides Agila Unit</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s largest
drugmaker, is among companies weighing a purchase of the
injectable-medicines unit of Indian drug supplier Strides
Arcolab Ltd. (STR), said three people with knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>Pfizer began due diligence last week for a possible
acquisition of the Bangalore-based company''s division known as
Agila Specialties, the people said, asking not to be identified
as the process is private. The unit may be valued at about $2
billion, two of the people said. </p>
<p>Strides provides Pfizer with generic versions of off-patent
drugs through a partnership announced in 2010. Agila has also
drawn interest from Canonsburg, Pennsylvania-based Mylan Inc.,
Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG (NOVN), and Fresenius SE, which is based in
Bad Homburg, Germany, two of the people said. A deal could be
reached in the first quarter, they said. </p>
<p>Large drugmakers are seeking acquisitions to offset a
potential decline in revenue as U.S. patents expire. With drugs
losing patent protection this year and last, New York-based
Pfizer may lose as much as $2.75 billion in sales in 2013, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Strides rose as much as 3.9 percent to 1095 rupees in
Mumbai today, the most since Dec. 24. Representatives for
Pfizer, Mylan and Novartis declined to comment, while a
spokesman for Strides didn''t respond to requests for comment. </p>
<h2>Cancer, Antibiotics </h2>
<p>As a market leader, Fresenius is very often brought into
contact with companies that potentially may be for sale,
Fresenius spokesman Matthias Link said in an e-mail. He declined
to comment on any potential deal with Strides. </p>
<p>Strides started trying to sell Agila last year, three
people with knowledge of the matter said in August. Agila, which
makes cancer treatments and antibiotics, accounted for 74
percent of Strides''s earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization in the nine months through
September, a company release from October shows. </p>
<p>Agila''s sales jumped to 10 billion rupees ($183 million) in
the nine-month period, from 7.4 billion rupees a year earlier,
according to the statement. </p>
<p>In May 2009, Novartis paid about 4.7 times sales for
Unterach, Austria-based Ebewe Pharma''s injectable-drug unit in a
$1.2 billion purchase. Mylan acquired closely held injectable-
drug business Bioniche Pharma Holdings Ltd. for $550 million in
2010, paying about 4.2 times annual revenue. </p>
<p>The same year, Abbott Laboratories (ABT) announced the
acquisition of Mumbai-based Piramal Healthcare Ltd.''s branded
generic-medicine unit for $3.72 billion, paying about 8.7 times
sales. The deal was worth more than Piramal''s $2.5 billion
market value at the time, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Strides''s profit will more than quadruple to 9.2 billion
rupees this year, according to the average of nine analysts''
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company has 14
manufacturing facilities in six countries. </p>
<p>Strides sold Ascent Pharmahealth Ltd., its Australian and
Southeast Asian unit, to Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI) in January
2012 for A$375 million ($396 million) in cash. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) was ordered by U.S. regulators to strengthen risk controls and enhance executive compensation practices after losing more than $6.2 billion on a wrong-way derivatives bet last year. </p> <p>The Federal Reserve found deficiencies in JPMorgan''s risk controls, loss modeling and audit functions as well as the process for alerting the board of directors to problems. The central bank and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency both issued cease-and-desist orders yesterday requiring JPMorgan to tighten its trading oversight, particularly in the chief investment office, and separate orders to bolster systems preventing clients from laundering money. </p> <p>The orders show there are significant control weaknesses beyond the CIO''s office that raises questions about whether JPMorgan is that much better than its peers at risk management, said Josh Rosner, an analyst at New York-based Graham Fisher  Co. </p> <p>They are the first regulatory sanctions against JPMorgan in response to the botched trades, which Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56, said in May stemmed from egregious lapses. Bruno Iksil, the U.K. trader nicknamed the London Whale because his positions were big enough to move markets, made the wrong- way bet on credit derivatives that fueled the losses. As much as $51 billion in shareholder value had been erased at one point. </p> <p>The sanctions are relatively light, allowing JPMorgan to avoid fines, Rosner said. </p> <h2>U.K. Probe </h2> <p>Other U.S. agencies investigating the trading loss include the Securities and Exchange Commission and Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.K.''s Financial Services Authority said yesterday that it''s undertaking a formal enforcement probe, which typically indicates the agency found sufficient evidence of financial rule violations. </p> <p>Conclusions will be reached in the enforcement investigation in due course and any further appropriate action determined at that time, the FSA said in a statement. </p> <p>The Fed gave JPMorgan''s board 60 days to submit a plan to enhance oversight of risk-management, internal-audit and finance functions. The panel also must overhaul its system for compensating top executives, accounting for adverse risk outcomes and control deficiencies, according to a Fed order. </p> <h2>Internal Report </h2> <p>The bank''s board is considering releasing an internal report that faults Dimon''s oversight of the CIO when the company announces fourth-quarter results tomorrow, two people with direct knowledge of the matter have said. </p> <p>That report, which builds on a preliminary analysis released in July, is critical of senior managers including Dimon, former Chief Financial Officer Doug Braunstein, 52, and ex-Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew, 56, for inadequately supervising traders in the U.K., according to the people. </p> <p>The report will be presented to the board when it meets today. The directors will then vote on whether to disclose it, the people said. </p> <p>JPMorgan didn''t admit or deny wrongdoing in consenting to the regulatory orders issued yesterday. </p> <p>We''ve been working hard to fully remediate the issues identified in the consent order on the trading losses, Joe Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, said in a statement. </p> <p>An OCC order found that the bank also has an inadequate system of internal controls and independent testing for anti- money-laundering compliance. The company failed to identify significant volumes of suspicious activity and to file required reports alerting regulators, according to the order. </p> <p>Meeting those responsibilities -- and going above and beyond -- is a top priority for us, Evangelisti said. We have already made progress addressing the issues cited in the consent orders, which contain no allegations of intentional misconduct by the firm or any of its employees. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By David Glovin, David Voreacos and Bob Van Voris" date="Jan 14, 2013  1:18 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-14/morgan-stanley-seeks-10-million-from-convicted-ex-trader.html"><headline>Morgan Stanley Seeks $10 Million From Convicted Ex-Trader</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>Insider traders like Joseph F. Chip Skowron III must be held responsible for the harm they cause their employers, Morgan Stanley (MS) lawyers told an appeals court in a bid to recover $10.2 million. </p> <p>Skowron, 43, who is serving five years in prison, was a hedge fund manager at Morgan Stanley''s FrontPoint Partners LLC until he was charged in April 2011 with using inside information to avoid $30 million in losses. </p> <p>The U.S. Court of Appeals in Manhattan heard arguments today in Skowron''s appeal of a judge''s order that he pay $10.2 million in restitution to the New York-based bank, which closed FrontPoint after the scandal. Morgan Stanley and prosecutors argued in support of the judge''s order, saying he hid his activities from his employer and the government. </p> <p>There isn''t any doubt, had he not lied, he would have been fired immediately, Kevin Marino, a lawyer for Morgan Stanley, told the court today. And that was before he was paid $20 million. </p> <p>The bank has also sued Skowron for $65 million, part of what his spokesman Montieth Illingworth previously called an effort to grind down what remains of Dr. Skowron''s life. </p> <h2>File Lawsuit </h2> <p>Joshua Epstein, Skowron''s lawyer, told the appeals panel today that Morgan Stanley is entitled to file a lawsuit to seek the money it paid his client. The firm isn''t entitled to restitution in the criminal case, he said. </p> <p>With U.S. prosecutors pursuing insider trading on Wall Street, banks and hedge funds will probably be watching the outcome of the case, said A. Jeff Ifrah, co-author of Federal Sentencing for Business Crimes. </p> <p>The reputation of an employer like this one can get killed by the conduct of its employee, Ifrah said in a telephone interview. </p> <p>Seeking restitution is certainly a good strategy to reclaim a company''s good name, said Ifrah, a Washington lawyer not involved in the case. </p> <p>Today''s argument comes as Skowron, a doctor who trained at Harvard and Yale, completes his first year at the U.S. prison camp in Minersville, Pennsylvania. </p> <p>On Aug. 5, 2011, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud and obstruct justice. He admitted helping FrontPoint avoid more than $30 million in trading losses on Human Genome Sciences Inc., a Rockville, Maryland, pharmaceutical firm that was acquired by GlaxoSmithKline Plc. (GSK) </p> <h2>Secret Tips </h2> <p>Skowron admitted that he got secret tips from a French physician, Yves Benhamou, who was helping to oversee a clinical trial of an HGSI hepatitis drug, Albuferon. After Benhamou told Skowron about disappointing results in the drug trial, Skowron sold HGSI shares in FrontPoint''s health-care funds. </p> <p>At his sentencing in 2011, U.S. District Judge Denise Cote ordered Skowron to forfeit $5 million. She also required him to pay restitution of $5.9 million to five investors that bought FrontPoint''s HGSI stock in block trades just before HGSI announced the clinical-trial results in January 2008. Deutsche Bank AG and Galleon Group LLC were among the funds. </p> <p>At the time of his sentencing, Skowron had a net worth of $22 million. </p> <p>On March 20, the judge ordered Skowron to pay restitution of $3.8 million to a sixth victim, Morgan Stanley, for the bank''s legal fees and $6.4 million to cover one-fifth of his compensation from 2007 to 2010. </p> <h2>Bank''s Expectation </h2> <p>Morgan Stanley''s expectation was that Skowron would abide by policies that prohibited insider trading, Cote wrote in an opinion. </p> <p>His crimes deprived Morgan Stanley of the honest services of its employee, diverted valuable corporate time and energy in the defense of Skowron and FrontPoint and injured Morgan Stanley''s reputation, she wrote. </p> <p>The judge refused to award Morgan Stanley $33 million from Skowron that the bank paid to settle a related U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit. The money was illegal profit, not funds FrontPoint was entitled to, Cote said. </p> <p>In his appeal, Skowron advanced largely technical arguments for why Cote''s order violated the U.S. Mandatory Victims Restitution Act, which provides for repayment to an identifiable victim of a fraud. </p> <p>For instance, he didn''t commit honest services fraud because he didn''t accept a bribe or kickback from a third party, as the law requires, he said. </p> <h2>Entirely Speculative'' </h2> <p>He also argued there''s no proof that his compensation stemmed from the illegal trades. This is entirely speculative, Epstein wrote. </p> <p>The U.S. Supreme Court in 2010 narrowed the scope of the U.S. restitution law, Ifrah said. Illingworth, Skowron''s spokesman, declined to comment on the appeal. </p> <p>Prosecutors defend Cote''s decision, pointing to cases in which offenders were ordered to surrender part of their pay. In one, a police chief who took bribes from mobsters running a gambling business was ordered to pay an amount equal to about 25 percent of his salary. </p> <p>Prosecutors say Skowron''s pay was tied to his funds'' performance. </p> <p>Skowron avoided approximately $1.36 million in losses to his own compensation by causing FrontPoint to avoid the $30 million loss, they wrote. </p> <p>By hiding the fraud from internal Morgan Stanley investigators beginning in early 2008, Skowron profited by keeping the job that he certainly would have lost, they said. </p> <h2>Clear Choice'' </h2> <p>He has a very clear choice in front of him, Assistant U.S. Attorney David Massey told the court today, arguing that the amount Skowron was paid after he obstructed the government''s investigation was properly subject to return to Morgan Stanley. If he tells the truth, he''ll be fired within the hour. </p> <p>Jerika Richardson, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, declined to comment on the case. </p> <p>News of the fraud in November 2010 led Morgan Stanley to write down $116 million of the value of its FrontPoint investment and, after massive redemptions, to shutter FrontPoint''s health-care funds, which managed $1.55 billion, prosecutors said. The bank says it''s a victim. </p> <p>The significant compensation Morgan Stanley paid to Skowron was undeniably based in part on the success of his criminal scheme to commit insider trading and then conceal that crime from Morgan Stanley and the government, the bank''s lawyers wrote. </p> <p>Jim Wiggins, a Morgan Stanley spokesman, declined to comment on the appeal. </p> <h2>Bank Sues </h2> <p>On Oct. 31, Morgan Stanley sued, seeking the $33 million Cote said it was not entitled to, as well as the entire $32 million it paid Skowron from 2007 to 2010. </p> <p>The bank called Skowron a faithless servant who lied repeatedly to continue being paid by the bank and to avoid the blow to his reputation that a loss on HGSI would have caused. Skowron hasn''t responded yet. </p> <p>Since August 2009, Bharara''s office has brought insider- trading charges against 76 people, many at Wall Street funds. </p> <p>They and other employers, whose insurance carriers may require them to sue rogue employees, need to be certain they can''t be tarnished by wrongdoing before pursuing restitution, Ifrah said. </p> <p>You have to make sure you''re solid on noninvolvement before you throw yourself into the lion''s den, he said. Do you want to really get involved in a criminal proceeding? Are you confident and comfortable enough? </p> <p>The case is U.S. v. Skowron, 12-1284, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Manhattan). Morgan Stanley''s suit is Morgan Stanley v. Skowron, 12-cv-8016, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Dina Bass" date="Jan 14, 2013 12:59 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-14/microsoft-surface-estimate-cut-in-half-to-1-million-units-at-ubs.html"><headline>Microsoft Surface Estimate Cut in Half to 1 Million Units at UBS</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)''s fiscal second-
quarter earnings will be less than previously expected due to
weak demand for personal-computers and the company''s new tablet,
Surface, according to Brent Thill, an analyst at UBS AG. </p>
<p>Thill cut his estimate for Surface sales in half, to 1
million units for the period, which ended in December, citing
gloomy sentiment after the holiday shopping season, he wrote
in a research report today. He cut his earnings per share
projection for the quarter by 8 cents to 76 cents. </p>
<p>Microsoft initially limited sales of the device to its own
roughly 60 retail outlets and Surface also failed to draw many
customers away from Apple Inc.''s iPad and rival devices with
Google Inc.''s Android software. A new business-focused version

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) accused ACA
Financial Guaranty Corp. (MANF) of withholding thousands of audio
recordings the investment bank wants in its fight against a
lawsuit over a collateralized debt obligation called Abacus. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs asked a New York state judge in court papers
Jan. 11 to order bond insurer ACA to produce the recordings,
pointing to one phone call that it says utterly eviscerates
ACA''s claims. </p>
<p>ACA''s unjustified withholding of the additional
recordings impedes Goldman Sachs'' ability to challenge, and the
court''s ability to examine, the claims in the case, the New
York-based company said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s bid for the recordings comes after ACA
sought court permission to file a revised complaint that adds
hedge fund Paulson  Co. as a defendant. ACA claims Goldman
Sachs and Paulson conspired to induce it to provide financial
guaranty insurance for Abacus. </p>
<p>ACA claims it was deceived into believing that Paulson was
a long investor in the deal when the hedge fund was in fact
betting against it. Goldman Sachs agreed to a $550 million
settlement in 2010 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission to resolve claims that it misled investors. </p>
<h2>Doomsday'' Strategy </h2>
<p>In its filing, Goldman Sachs quotes from a May 2007 call
between an ACA portfolio manager and a bond trader at Morgan
Stanley in which ACA is told Paulson was pursuing a doomsday
strategy and betting against the mortgage market. The recording
demonstrates unequivocally that ACA actually knew of
Paulson''s shorting strategy, Goldman Sachs said. </p>
<p>Marc Kasowitz, an attorney for New York-based ACA, said in
an interview that the call wasn''t about Abacus and was instead
anecdotal market chatter about Paulson. </p>
<p>ACA, which is seeking to recover $120 million in damages,
cites in its complaint a recording in which a Goldman Sachs
managing director told ACA that Paulson was a 100 percent
equity investor in the deal. ACA has produced 6,900 recordings
to Goldman Sachs and will turn over more as they become
available, Kasowitz said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s specific misrepresentation to ACA about
Paulson''s 100 percent equity'' interest in Abacus trumps any
anecdotal market color'' by a third party, Kasowitz said in a
statement. </p>
<p>The case is ACA Financial Guaranty Corp. v. Goldman Sachs 
Co., 650027-2011, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is set to face
new actions from U.S. and U.K. bank regulators as early as today
for botched trades that cost the company more than $6.2 billion
last year, according to two people familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and
Federal Reserve, which have been investigating the loss, may
release some of their findings today, three people familiar with
the matter said. The U.K.''s Financial Services Authority, which
has also been informally looking into whether traders
intentionally mismarked some of their positions and tried to
cover up their losses, may open an official investigation,
according to one of the people. </p>
<p>Regulators have yet to punish New York-based JPMorgan, the
biggest U.S. bank, for lapses in risk oversight that Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56, has called egregious. It
isn''t clear whether the Fed and OCC''s announcement will also
include sanctions, according to the people, who asked not to be
named because the matter hasn''t been made public. </p>
<p>The OCC is preparing a cease-and-desist order requiring New
York-based JPMorgan to fix internal controls that contributed to
its wrong-way bet on credit derivatives, a person familiar with
the matter said last month. </p>
<p>The chief investment office within JPMorgan''s national bank
suffered from inadequate risk management, Comptroller of the
Currency Thomas Curry said during U.S. Senate testimony in June. </p>
<h2>Potential Gaps'' </h2>
<p>We have been focusing on potential gaps or deviations
from accepted standards of risk management within that
particular office and looking to see whether similar gaps exist
in any other area, Curry said. </p>
<p>The move to a formal enforcement proceeding by the FSA
typically indicates the agency found sufficient evidence of
financial rule violations. </p>
<p>Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman at JPMorgan, Robert Garsson at
the OCC, Barbara Hagenbaugh at the Federal Reserve and
Christopher Hamilton at the FSA all declined to comment on the
regulatory actions. </p>
<p>The bank''s board of directors is also considering releasing
an internal report that faults Dimon''s oversight of the division
when the company announces fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 16,
two people with direct knowledge of the matter have said. </p>
<h2>Braunstein, Drew </h2>
<p>The final report, which builds on a preliminary analysis
released in July, is critical of senior managers including
Dimon, former Chief Financial Officer Doug Braunstein, 51,
and ex-Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew, 56, for inadequately
supervising traders in the U.K. unit. </p>
<p>The report will be presented to the board when it meets
tomorrow. The directors will then vote on whether to disclose it
when the bank announces fourth-quarter results the following
day, said the people, who asked not to be named because the
report isn''t yet public. </p>
<p>Bruno Iksil, the U.K. trader nicknamed the London Whale
because his trading book was big enough to move the market, made
a wrong-way bet on credit derivatives that led to the company''s
biggest trading loss. At one point, as much as $51 billion in
shareholder value was erased. </p>

<p>Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G), Europe''s
third-largest insurer, plans to cut costs and boost cash flow to
more than 2 billion euros ($2.7 billion) by 2015 as it focuses
on emerging markets and insurance to restore profitability. </p>
<p>Cash flow is expected to increase by 700 million euros from
1.3 billion euros in 2011, the Trieste, Italy-based insurer said
today. The company wants to reduce costs by 600 million euros by
2015 and sees a return on equity of 13 percent, with more than 5
billion euros operating profit over the cycle. </p>
<p>We want to create value, focusing on the insurance
business and return to shareholders, Chief Executive Officer
Mario Greco said in an interview with Bloomberg television
before a strategy presentation to investors in London. We are
confident to reach these targets. The ROE target is challenging,
but we think we will be there by 2015. </p>
<p>Greco, who took the helm at Generali in August, is seeking
to convince investors he can revive profit and boost capital by
cutting costs, shedding non-strategic assets and targeting
faster-growing emerging markets. Cost-cutting will impact on
personnel, even if job cuts are not significant, Greco said. </p>
<p>The plan is slightly underwhelming, Sanford C.
Bernstein  Co. analysts Thomas Seidl and Rusne Didziulyte wrote
in a note to clients, citing cost-cut targets below their
forecast. We do not see how Generali can achieve its target
equity level without external funding which eventually would
dilute shareholder value. </p>

<p>The U.S. Supreme Court signaled
interest in Pfizer Inc. (PFE)''s bid for a shield from some asbestos
lawsuits connected to its Quigley Co. subsidiary, a bankrupt
unit that stopped most operations in 1992. </p>
<p>The justices today asked the Obama administration for
advice on Pfizer''s appeal of a ruling that opened the New York-
based drugmaker to some claims related to Quigley. That company
made asbestos-containing products for the steel industry from
the 1940s to the 1970s. Pfizer acquired Quigley in 1968.
Asbestos, once widely used an insulator, was later shown to
cause cancer. </p>
<p>Pfizer, the world''s largest drugmaker, contends that
Quigley''s bankruptcy proceedings insulate the parent company
from suits filed by the Baltimore law firm of Peter Angelos. The
firm began suing Pfizer in Pennsylvania state courts in 1999,
saying the company was legally responsible for some claims
because its logo appeared on Quigley products. </p>
<p>Pfizer says it played no role in making or selling the
Quigley products. A federal appeals court in New York said the
claims against Pfizer could go forward. </p>
<p>The Supreme Court case is Pfizer v. Law Offices of Peter
Angelos, 12-300. The bankruptcy case is In re Quigley Co.,

<p>Russia will increase interest rates
in the first six months of 2013 before easing monetary policy in
the second half as inflation slows to the central bank''s 5
percent to 6 percent target range, according to Morgan Stanley. </p>
<p>As core inflation, which excludes volatile costs such as
energy, is set to exceed 6 percent in the first half, the
central bank will raise borrowing costs by a quarter-point to
keep inflation expectations in check and maintain the
credibility of its transition to inflation targeting, Jacob Nell and Alina Slyusarchuk, economists at Morgan Stanley, said
today in an e-mailed research note. </p>
<p>Bank Rossii Chairman Sergey Ignatiev, whose third and final
term ends this year, failed to hold inflation below the 6
percent upper limit of the regulator''s target band last year,
with price growth accelerating to 6.6 percent in December, up
from 6.1 percent a year earlier. </p>
<p>Policy makers will cut rates at least once in the
second half of the year, Nell and Slyusarchuk said, adding that
the pace and timing of the moves will depend on the impact of
July''s increases in utility tariffs and the grain harvest this
year. The central bank will also expand the range in which it
allows the ruble to trade against its target dollar-euro basket
to 9 rubles from 7 rubles and reduce its levels of currency
interventions, according to Morgan Stanley. </p>

<p>Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G), Europe''s
third-largest insurer, targets more than 2 billion euros ($2.7
billion) cash flow by 2015 and lower costs as the company
focuses on growing emerging markets and its main insurance
business. </p>
<p>Generali expects to increase its cash flow by 700 million
euros from 1.3 billion euros generated in 2011, the company said
in a statement today. The insurer wants to reduce costs by 600
million euros by 2015 and sees a return of equity of 13 percent,
with more than 5 billion euros operating profit over the
cycle. </p>
<p>The goal of the strategy we are presenting today is to
transform Generali into one global insurance group that will be
able to compete in the international markets, Chief Executive
Officer Mario Greco said in the statement. Generali will have
a more solid and stable balance sheet and provide greater
returns for its shareholders. </p>
<p>Greco, who took the helm at Trieste, Italy-based Generali
in August, is seeking to convince investors he can turn the
company around. He''s cutting costs, shedding non-strategic
assets and targeting growing emerging markets to revive profit
and boost capital. </p>
<h2>Lagging Peers </h2>
<p>Generali''s profitability is lagging behind peers, with the
insurer''s Solvency I ratio, a measure of its ability to absorb
losses, at 140 percent at the end of the third quarter. That
compares with a median of 195 percent for 10 insurance companies
in western Europe disclosing data, according to Bloomberg
Industries data. The company targets a solvency ratio of 160
percent by 2015. </p>
<p>Generali will achieve this through retained earnings,
selective disposals of non-core assets and other capital
management actions, the company said. </p>
<p>Analysts predict operating profit will rise to 4.91 billion
euros ($6.55 billion) in 2015, according to the average estimate
of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The insurer targeted
more than 4 billion euros of operating profit in 2012 and
expects non-life premiums to climb, while life premiums will
match the 2011 level. </p>
<h2>Growth Markets </h2>
<p>Generali is unifying domestic business around three brands,
Generali, Alleanza and Genertel, and simplifying the Italian
business as part of the plan to improve efficiency and cut costs
in the country. Analysts at Merrill Lynch Bank of America, CA
Cheuvreux and Equita expected cost cuts of 235 million euros to
800 million euros in the next three years. </p>
<p>Generali will enhance its competitive position and
profitability through further investments in the high growth
markets: Central and Eastern Europe and Asia, the insurer said
in the statement. </p>
<p>Generali agreed last week to buy the 49 percent stake it
doesn''t own in its eastern European venture with private-equity
firm PPF Group as part of the plan. The CEO predicts
profitability in the region will be twice as much as in western
European markets over the next five years. </p>
<h2>Eastern Europe </h2>
<p>Generali, which operates in more than 60 countries with
82,000 employees, makes about 10 percent of its operating profit
in central and eastern Europe. The company has also set up
offices in the main markets of the Far East, including India and
China, where it has a joint venture with China National
Petroleum Corp. </p>
<p>Generali has said it''s seeking to sell its U.S. life
reinsurance business and Swiss asset-management unit BSI Group. </p>
<p>Greco was picked by Generali''s controlling shareholders,
led by Mediobanca SpA (MB), to replace Giovanni Perissinotto, who
resigned as CEO on June 2 after profit fell for four consecutive
quarters and at a time when the insurer''s capital was weakened
by exposure to Italy''s sovereign debt. </p>
<h2>Management Shuffle </h2>
<p>In the three months following his appointment, Greco
shuffled management to spur profit growth and smooth relations
with investors. He moved Managing Director Sergio Balbinot to
the new position of chief insurance officer and appointed
Alberto Minali as chief financial officer to replace Raffaele Agrusti, who became country manager for Italy. </p>
<p>Greco appointed Nikhil Srinivasan, a former Allianz Group
executive, as chief investment officer and Carsten Schildknecht
as chief operating officer. </p>
<p>Generali also created a 10-member management committee that
will be led by Greco with Balbinot as deputy and include the
heads of Italy, France and Germany as well as other top
executives. </p>
<p>The shares, which hit their lowest level since December
1988 on May 31, just two days before Perissinotto''s ousting,
have rallied 42 percent since Greco''s appointment on Aug. 1,
compared with the 23 percent increase in the Bloomberg Europe
500 Insurance Index (BEINSUR), showing investors'' optimism about his
ability to turn around the company. </p>

<p>ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM) and Citgo Petroleum
Corp. are the last holdouts in an $800 million lawsuit by New
Hampshire alleging that oil companies knew a chemical added to
gasoline would contaminate residents'' groundwater. </p>
<p>Opening statements are set to begin today in Concord in a
trial that pits the state''s environmental claims against the
companies'' efforts to comply with federal pollution standards.
It''s one of scores of cases involving the additive methyl
tertiary butyl ether that have been filed since 2000 against oil
refiners, fuel distributors and chemical makers. </p>
<p>New Hampshire says ExxonMobil and Citgo knew MTBE would
pollute water supplies. The companies say the federal Clean Air
Act overrides the state''s claims and by adding MTBE to gasoline,
they were complying with a U.S. mandate to supply fuel that
would burn more cleanly. </p>
<p>The oil companies will say: Federal law made us do that
and that pre-empts any state lawsuit, Keith Hylton, who
teaches law and economics at Boston University School of Law,
said in an interview before the trial began. If the federal
regulatory body looked at all the issues that the state would
examine in a lawsuit, then there is pre-emption. </p>
<p>Oil refiners have added MTBE to gasoline since the 1970s to
replace lead. From 1995 to 2006, they increased the use of MTBE,
which boosts the oxygen level of the fuel and makes it burn more
efficiently. </p>
<h2>Foul, Putrid'' </h2>
<p>According to filings in the New Hampshire case, MTBE can
render drinking water foul, putrid and unfit for human
consumption. The state said it petitioned the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency in 2001 to get out of its
reformulated gasoline program because of awareness of MTBE''s
harmful effects. The additive has been banned in the state since
January 2007. </p>
<p>In 2003, New Hampshire sued ExxonMobil and Citgo along with
Shell Oil Co., Sunoco Inc., ConocoPhillips (COP), Irving Oil Ltd.,
Vitol SA and Hess Corp. All have settled except Irving, Texas-
based ExxonMobil and Citgo, the Houston-based unit of
Venezuela''s state-owned oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA.
Shell and Sunoco agreed to pay New Hampshire $35 million in a
settlement announced in November. </p>
<p>The state has said it has identified 229 sites that will
require cleanup from contamination by MTBE, which, according to
court filings, can cause cancer in animals. It said tests in
2005 and 2006 showed MTBE in 9.1 percent of private wells
throughout the state. </p>
<p>New Hampshire is seeking $816 million to cover cleanup and
monitoring costs, Jessica Grant, a lawyer for the state, said at
a pretrial hearing. </p>
<h2>Second-Guessing'' </h2>
<p>The state is second-guessing decisions made by Congress,
the EPA and by the state''s own officials to rely on gasoline
with MTBE as the solution to air pollution, Claire Hassett, a
spokeswoman for ExxonMobil, said in an e-mail. Gasoline with
MTBE was a product that worked as it was intended -- it provided
significant health benefits by helping gasoline burn cleaner,
thereby reducing smog. </p>
<p>Citgo said in an e-mailed statement that although it
doesn''t comment on pending litigation, its strong safety and
environmental record speaks for itself. </p>
<p>The state has said the oil companies could have used safer
additives, such as ethanol, and chose not to because MTBE is
inexpensive to produce. </p>
<p>If they had an alternative product to use and the
alternative is just as good and avoids serious risk to
consumers, there''s a strong argument the defendants have failed
the risk-utility standard and can be held liable, said Hylton,
the Boston University professor. </p>
<h2>Short Supply </h2>
<p>The oil companies have said ethanol wasn''t in large enough
supply at the time an additive was sought and that it presents
its own environmental hazards. </p>
<p>This case is not about health risks or personal
injuries, Hassett said. There is not a single recorded case
of anyone getting sick from drinking water with MTBE. The
majority of the state''s damage claims are based on computer
models and projections not on actual testing or data. </p>
<p>The oil companies also said in court filings that a statute
of limitations should prevent the litigation from proceeding.
The state waited three years from the time it detected MTBE in
sites until it sued, they said. </p>
<p>New Hampshire Superior Court Judge Peter Fauver in August
rejected a series of motions by the oil companies seeking
judgment without a trial based on the arguments they raised.
Those issues can be brought up again for the jury''s
consideration. </p>
<h2>Water Sources </h2>
<p>In January 2011, the New Hampshire Supreme Court denied a
motion by the companies to decide the case in their favor and
sent it back to the Superior Court. The state''s highest court
said New Hampshire could seek damages for contamination of
nonpublic sources of water, such as wells, as well as public
sources. </p>
<p>The New Hampshire case was moved to federal court in New
York, where other lawsuits have been consolidated for pretrial
evidence-gathering and motions before U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin, who presided over the trial of New York City''s case
against ExxonMobil. In 2009, the jury in that case ordered
ExxonMobil to pay $104.7 million after finding it liable for
polluting wells in the city. ExxonMobil has appealed. </p>
<p>In 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York sent New
Hampshire''s case back to the state court. </p>
<p>The cases consolidated in New York may be tried separately
in courts around the U.S. if settlements aren''t reached. In the
New York litigation, the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection filed its fourth amended complaint in June. No date
has been set for a trial, which would probably take place in
federal court in New Jersey. </p>
<h2>Great Distances </h2>
<p>MTBE is produced by combining methanol, which is derived
from natural gas, and isobutylene, a byproduct of gasoline
refining. It can leak into the ground from gas stations, storage
tanks and automobile junkyards. It dissolves in water and
doesn''t biodegrade or stick well to soil particles, so it can be
carried with the water great distances from the site of a leak
or spill, according to court papers. The chemical is difficult
and expensive to find, treat and remove, according to court
filings. </p>
<p>In the 1980s, the defendants knew that the addition of
MTBE would lead to widespread contamination, Grant said in an
interview after a pretrial hearing Jan. 9. Despite knowing
that MTBE posed a greater threat to drinking water resources,
they never posted a single warning. </p>
<h2>Spills Fault </h2>
<p>ExxonMobil''s Hassett said the fault lies with whoever
spilled the chemically treated fuel. </p>
<p>MTBE contamination has been found in New Hampshire
because someone spilled gasoline in New Hampshire, not because
it was added to gasoline in a refinery in another state, she
said. The state should be suing parties responsible for
spilling gasoline. </p>
<p>ExxonMobil rose 0.6 percent to $89.61 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading on Jan. 11. Citgo''s shares don''t
trade publicly. </p>

<p>(Corrects software sales decline in 10th paragraph of
story published on Jan. 15.) </p>
<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS), working to improve
results at its interactive division, unveiled a video-game
system that reduces development costs by incorporating
characters from multiple movies in the same game. </p>
<p>The Infinity platform includes a base unit that connects to
computers and game consoles, Burbank, California-based Disney
said today in a statement. Plastic figures set on top of the
unit appear on screen in games. The company will sell the
figures, as well as discs that add scenery and features. A
starter kit with the base and three figures is priced at $75. </p>
<p>With Infinity, Disney will be able to add content without
developing new games from scratch each time a film comes out,
according to John Pleasants, co-president of Disney interactive.
That''s critical for a division Disney Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Robert Iger has said will be profitable in
2013 after losses of $1.6 billion in the past six years. </p>
<p>It''s something we expect to be able to live on for years,
and we can continuously add to it, Pleasants said in an
interview. It''s not just a game that we''re shipping. </p>
<p>Pleasants, who joined Disney with the acquisition of
social-game maker Playdom in 2010, urged his designers to
think big in developing the system, according to John Blackburn, vice president of Disney''s Avalanche Software unit in
Salt Lake City, Utah, which oversaw the project. </p>
<h2>Player Freedom </h2>
<p>Infinity is Disney''s largest game project in terms of the
cost and characters involved, Blackburn said, without giving
specifics on the finances. The initial release will involve 20
Disney and Pixar characters. </p>
<p>Adventures within Infinity leave a lot to the player, the
executives said. Captain Jack Sparrow, from the Pirates of the
Caribbean films, could go on missions with Buzz Lightyear, one
of the Toy Story characters, while riding in Cinderella''s
coach. </p>
<p>It''s like your parent''s living room floor, where nobody
told you what to do with your toys, John Vignocchi, an
executive producer of the game, said in an interview. </p>
<p>By combining collectible figures with video-game play, the
Infinity platform, which goes on sale in June, is similar to
Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI)''s Skylanders games, which generated
$500 million in sales of games and related merchandise last
year. </p>
<h2>Pirates Games </h2>
<p>Disney is changing direction as sales of traditional video
games have fallen. Video-game software sales declined 23 percent
to $6.71 billion in 2012, NPD said. Disney released six titles
for consoles last year, down from 23 in 2010, according to the
company and VGChartz.com, a research site. </p>
<p>Its products have sometimes disappointed consumers. A group
called Revive Potco gathered 2,000 signatures asking Disney to
invest more in its Pirates of the Caribbean game. </p>
<p>Brad Phillips, who follows the business on a blog called In
the Life of Nerd, was critical of that game and another called
World of Cars, tied to the popular Pixar films. </p>
<p>It was a terrible waste of the Cars brand and one that
was likely designed and rushed out in an attempt to profit from
the movies, Phillips wrote last February, the same month
Disney shut it down. </p>
<p>John Lasseter, chief creative officer for Disney animation
studios, also thought some movie-themed games lacked substance,
according to Blackburn. He was reluctant to include Pixar
content in Infinity until the game makers showed him designs
where the disparate characters shared a common look. </p>
<h2>Game Challenges </h2>
<p>Disney gained 1 percent to $51.09 at the close in New York.
The shares advanced 33 percent in 2012, compared with 13 percent
for the SP 500 Index. </p>
<p>Larry Gerbrandt, a long-time media analyst now with Media
Valuation Partners in Los Angeles, said he is skeptical the
interactive unit can ever produce the consistent earnings of
Disney''s cable TV and theme-park businesses. He pointed to
challenges facing Zynga Inc. (ZNGA), the social game leader, which has
fallen 74 percent since it first sold shares in December 2011. </p>
<p>It''s a very streaky business, Gerbrandt said. All you
have to do is look at Zynga to see how hard it is to create hits
and come up with sequels. If they could be happy with the Disney
website, they''d be fine. It''s when they move beyond that they
run into problems. </p>
<p>Pleasants, co-president of the unit, disagrees. </p>
<p>Profitability is a goal for this division for sure, for
this year, for the future, for beyond, he said. We are very,
very focused on that. We are growing nicely. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Co. (KO) has taken to television to fight back against an obesity epidemic the world''s largest soft-drink maker has been blamed for fueling. </p> <p>The company will air ads throughout the year, including one tomorrow on Fox Broadcasting Co.''s American Idol, to bring attention to the importance of exercise and calories in curbing obesity. The first two-minute spot aired yesterday on cable TV, highlighting Coca-Cola''s low- and zero-calorie products, the Atlanta-based company said yesterday in a statement. </p> <p>The commercials are the most overt move yet in a more than three year campaign by Coca-Cola to counter criticism that it contributes to America''s obesity epidemic. Almost 36 percent of adults and about 17 percent of children are obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. </p> <p>This is part of Coke''s effort to blunt the opposition they are running into in all different sectors, said Michael Jacobson, executive director of Washington-based Center for Science in the Public Interest, whose 1998 report Liquid Candy propelled criticism of sugary drinks. The opposition is not sitting still these days. </p> <p>One of Coca-Cola''s new ads, called Coming Together, suggests consumers pay attention to the calories they consume in order to manage their weight. The commercial points out the company can play an important role in fighting obesity. </p> <h2>Smaller Packages </h2> <p>A female narrator goes on to say the company offers more than 180 low- and no-calorie beverages among its more than 650 drinks. This helped reduce calories per serving across the U.S. beverage industry by 22 percent during the past 15 years, according to the ad. Coca-Cola will offer smaller packages in about 90 percent of the U.S. market by the end of the year, it said. </p> <p>The commercial to debut tomorrow on American Idol states that a can of Coca-Cola contains 140 calories and encourages consumers to find fun ways of burning those calories. </p> <p>Coca-Cola will air 30- and 60-second versions of the ads throughout the year in national broadcast and Spanish language media, according to Diana Garza Ciarlante, a company spokeswoman. She would not disclose spending on the effort. </p> <p>Health advocates agree soft drinks are an unhealthy source of sugar in Americans'' diets. Obesity in the U.S. comes at a staggering financial cost, the CDC has said. Everything from treatments for diabetes to lost work by obese employees cost Americans about $147 billion in 2008, according to one estimate cited by the agency. </p> <h2>Obesity Cost </h2> <p>Obesity is measured by using weight and height to calculate a number called body mass index, according to the CDC. An adult who is 5 feet, 9 inches tall and weighs 203 pounds or more is considered obese. </p> <p>In 2009, President Barack Obama recommended exploring a federal tax on sugary drinks to help pay for health-care reform. Lawmakers in 30 states then proposed levying their own soda taxes on the $74 billion U.S. soft drink industry. </p> <p>Obama''s suggestion prompted Coca-Cola Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent to call the idea of a federal tax on soft drinks outrageous. Kent has argued that programs encouraging exercise and health education in schools and communities are more effective at curbing obesity. </p> <p>I have never seen it work where a government tells people what to eat and what to drink, Kent said in September 2009, responding to an audience question at the Rotary Club of Atlanta. If it worked, the Soviet Union would still be around. </p> <h2>New York </h2> <p>The comments marked a shift in Coca-Cola''s approach to soft drink critics. Until that point, the company let its chief lobbying association, the American Beverage Association, handle most of the push back. </p> <p>Between 2009 and 2011, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) and the American Beverage Association spent as much as $70 million on lobbying and issue ads, according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a proponent of soda taxes. The money helped defeat efforts to enact such levies in 30 states. </p> <p>Last year, the beverage industry squared off against New York City, whose health department plastered placards all over New York''s subways comparing sugary drinks with globs of fat and packets of sugar. </p> <p>The ABA countered with its own subway ads touting lower- calorie options and package sizes as progress against obesity. They were part of a nationwide public relations campaign started in February, and an offshoot of similar ABA programs in recent years. </p> <p>In September, New York City''s Board of Health voted to restrict sales of sugary soft drinks to no more than 16 ounces a cup in restaurants, movie theaters, stadiums and arenas after it was proposed by Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The mayor is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP. </p> <p>Coke shares rose 0.9 percent to $37.32 at the close in New York. The stock advanced 3.6 percent in 2012, its fourth consecutive year of gains. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Drew Armstrong" date="Jan 15, 2013  4:10 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-15/pfizer-drug-units-shuffle-triggers-concers-about-breakup.html"><headline>Pfizer''s Possible Unit Shuffle Triggers Breakup Concern</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE)''s four business units may be combined into two, a top company official said, triggering speculation by analysts that the world''s biggest drugmaker is preparing to split in half. </p> <p>Pfizer''s units cover oncology, primary care, specialty drugs, and so-called established products, which are medicines that have lost patent protection and are sold against generics. That''s probably going to evolve to two, where there''s the innovative business and the value business, Geno Germano, president of the specialty care and oncology businesses, said in a Jan. 8 interview. </p> <p>Chief Executive Officer Ian Read took over New York-based Pfizer in 2010, as the company was digesting the 2009 acquisition of Wyeth and preparing for the loss of its top- selling product Lipitor. Under Read, Pfizer has cut research and operations and is divesting non-drug businesses, such as animal health and infant nutrition. Those actions have created questions about whether a bigger breakup is on the horizon. </p> <p>The possible reorganization outlined by Germano may be another step toward a split by Pfizer two to three years down the line, said Mark Schoenebaum, an ISI Group Inc. analyst. Such a move would be similar to the action by Abbott Laboratories (ABT), which spun off its brand-drug business Jan. 1 as the new company AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) </p>

<p>ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM) told a jury that a
gasoline additive to reduce air pollution never caused illness
to any resident of New Hampshire, which sued oil companies
claiming the chemical polluted its groundwater. </p>
<p>ExxonMobil and Citgo Petroleum Corp. made opening
statements today in a jury trial of an $816 million lawsuit in
which the state alleges the oil companies knew the chemical
would contaminate groundwater. The state court trial, which
began yesterday in Concord, pits the environmental claims
against assertions by companies that they were simply complying
with federal pollution standards. </p>
<p>It''s one of scores of cases involving the additive methyl
tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE, filed since 2000 against oil
refiners, fuel distributors and chemical makers. </p>
<p>This is not a personal-injury case, David Lender, a
lawyer for ExxonMobil, told the jury. There''s not any evidence
that anyone ever got sick or got cancer from MTBE. He said
there has been no gasoline sold in the state containing MTBE for
more than six years. </p>
<p>The state claimed that the oil companies knew that if they
added MTBE to gasoline it would increase the risk and costs
associated with contamination. </p>
<p>Exxon decided to disregard the recommendation of its own
employees and put MTBE in gasoline, Jessica Grant, a lawyer
for the state, told jurors yesterday. In 1984, Exxon
anticipated that if it added MTBE to its gasoline, the number of
contamination incidents would triple. These incidents would take
longer to clean up and cost five times as much. Each cleanup
at that time would have cost as much as $7 million, she said. </p>
<h2>Federal Law </h2>
<p>The companies said the federal Clean Air Act overrides the
state claims, and that by adding MTBE to gasoline, they were
complying with a U.S. mandate to supply cleaner-burning fuel. </p>
<p>Oil refiners began adding MTBE to gasoline in the 1970s to
replace lead. From 1995 to 2006, they increased the use of MTBE,
which boosts the fuel''s oxygen level, making it burn more
cleanly. </p>
<p>We had no choice but to put oxygenates in our gasoline,
Nate Eimer, a lawyer for Citgo, said today in his opening
statement. Nothing worked better in cleaning the air than
MTBE. </p>
<p>Keith Hylton, who teaches law and economics at Boston
University School of Law, said the oil companies are counting on
pre-emption, which turns on whether federal regulators looked
at all the issues that the state would examine in a lawsuit. </p>
<p>The oil companies will say, Federal law made us do that,
and that pre-empts any state lawsuit,'' Hylton said. </p>
<h2>Exxon Lawyer </h2>
<p>James Quinn, a lawyer for ExxonMobil, told the jury
yesterday that there were great benefits to using MTBE but
there were downsides. All of these downsides were known to all
the folks involved. </p>
<p>MTBE is produced by combining methanol, which is derived
from natural gas, and isobutylene, a byproduct of gasoline
refining. It can leak into the ground from gas stations, storage
tanks and auto junkyards. </p>
<p>It dissolves in water and doesn''t biodegrade, so it can be
carried with the water great distances from the site of a leak
or spill, according to court papers. The chemical is difficult
and expensive to find, treat and remove, according to filings. </p>
<p>According to New Hampshire case filings, MTBE can render
drinking water foul, putrid and unfit for human consumption.
The state said it petitioned the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency in 2001 to get out of its reformulated-gasoline program
because of awareness of MTBE''s harmful effects. The additive has
been banned in the state since January 2007. </p>
<h2>No Warning </h2>
<p>Despite knowing that MTBE posed a greater threat to
drinking water, they never posted a single warning, Grant
said. </p>
<p>New Hampshire sued ExxonMobil and Citgo in 2003 along with
Shell Oil Co., Sunoco Inc., ConocoPhillips (COP), Irving Oil Ltd.,
Vitol SA and Hess Corp. All settled but Irving, Texas-based
ExxonMobil and Citgo, the Houston-based unit of Venezuela''s
state-owned oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA. Shell and
Sunoco agreed to pay $35 million in an accord announced in
November. </p>
<p>New Hampshire said it has identified 228 sites that will
require cleanup from contamination by MTBE, which according to
court filings can cause cancer in animals. Tests in 2005 and
2006 found MTBE in 9.1 percent of private wells throughout the
state, it said. </p>
<p>New Hampshire is seeking $816 million to cover cleanup and
monitoring costs, Grant said, and it will ask for damages from
ExxonMobil and Citgo based on their market shares of gasoline
sold in the state during the time the suit covers. </p>
<h2>Market Share </h2>
<p>ExxonMobil''s market share was about 30 percent, she said.
That means the state will seek $245 million in damages from the
company. Citgo''s market share ranged from 3 percent to
8.7 percent. </p>
<p>Lender said today that ExxonMobil''s market share in New
Hampshire was only 6.1 percent during that time. </p>
<p>The majority of the state''s damage claims are based on
computer models and projections, not on actual testing or
data, Claire Hassett, an ExxonMobil spokeswoman, said by e-
mail. </p>
<p>The state said the oil companies could have used safer
additives, such as ethanol, and chose not to because MTBE is
inexpensive to produce. </p>
<p>If they had an alternative product to use and the
alternative is just as good and avoids serious risk to
consumers, there''s a strong argument the defendants have failed
the risk-utility standard and can be held liable, said Hylton,
of Boston University. </p>
<h2>Short Supply </h2>
<p>The oil companies said ethanol wasn''t in large enough
supply when an additive was being sought, and that it presents
its own environmental hazards. </p>
<p>ExxonMobil''s Hassett said the fault lies with whoever
spilled the chemically treated fuel. </p>
<p>MTBE contamination has been found in New Hampshire
because someone spilled gasoline in New Hampshire, not because
it was added to gasoline in a refinery in another state, she
said. The state should be suing parties responsible for
spilling gasoline. </p>
<p>The oil companies also said in court filings that a statute
of limitations should prevent the litigation from proceeding.
The state waited three years from the time it detected MTBE in
sites until it sued, they said. </p>
<p>Superior Court Judge Peter Fauver in August rejected oil
company motions seeking judgment without a trial based on the
arguments they raised. Those issues can be brought up again for
the jury''s consideration. </p>
<h2>Water Sources </h2>
<p>In January 2011, the New Hampshire Supreme Court denied a
motion by the companies to decide the case in their favor and
sent it back to the Superior Court. The state''s highest court
said New Hampshire could seek damages for contamination of
nonpublic sources of water, such as wells, and public sources. </p>
<p>The New Hampshire case had been moved to federal court in
New York, where other lawsuits have been consolidated for
pretrial evidence-gathering and motions before U.S. District
Judge Shira Scheindlin in Manhattan. In 2007, the U.S. Court of
Appeals in New York sent New Hampshire''s case back to the state
court there. </p>
<p>Scheindlin presided over the trial of New York City''s case
against ExxonMobil. In 2009, the jury in that case ordered
ExxonMobil to pay $104.7 million after finding it liable for
polluting wells in the city. ExxonMobil has appealed. </p>
<h2>Consolidated Cases </h2>
<p>The cases consolidated in New York may be tried separately
in courts around the U.S. if settlements aren''t reached. In the
New York litigation, the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection filed its fourth amended complaint in June. No date
has been set for a trial, which would probably take place in
federal court in New Jersey. </p>
<p>The New Hampshire trial may take more than four months,
lawyers said. </p>
<p>After the jury was dismissed yesterday, Citgo''s Eimer asked
the judge to declare a mistrial, claiming that the state''s
lawyer misrepresented a document as one of Citgo''s in her
remarks to the jury. </p>
<p>There''s a long road ahead of us, Fauver told the
lawyers. This will all be clarified. I don''t think it warrants
a mistrial. </p>
<p>The case is State of New Hampshire v. Hess Corp. (HES), 03-C-
0550, New Hampshire Superior Court, Merrimack County (Concord).
The federal cases are consolidated as In re MTBE Products
Liability Litigation, 00-11898, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) won''t delay
distribution of U.K. bonuses to help minimize employees'' tax
rates, a person with direct knowledge of the decision said. </p>
<p>The firm had considered postponing incentive compensation
due to employees from 2009, 2010 and 2011 until after top
income-tax rates drop in April. Bank of England Governor Mervyn King said today it''s depressing that banks may be willing to
shift bonus payments to minimize workers'' tax burden. </p>
<p>U.K. Treasury minister Sajid Javid spoke with Goldman Sachs
representatives today, according to a person with knowledge of
the discussion. They gave assurances that bonuses would be paid
in the normal way and that there would be no changes to the
schedule. The call was set up yesterday, said the person, who
requested anonymity because the discussion was private. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs accelerated delivery of $65 million in stock
awards last month to 10 executives, including Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, in a move that helped them avoid
higher U.S. taxes that take effect this year. That change, which
didn''t affect compensation for 2012, was made public in company
filings at about 8 p.m. New York time on Dec. 31. </p>
<p>This week, the Financial Times and other media reported
that New York-based Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank
by assets, was reviewing whether to delay U.K. bonus payments
due from prior years to help employees pay lower rates. The
reports were met with criticism from U.K. politicians and King. </p>
<p>Management opted against proceeding with the plan, a
decision that was ratified today in a regular meeting of the
board''s compensation committee, said the person with knowledge
of the decision. </p>
<p>British Broadcasting Corp. editor Robert Peston reported
Goldman Sachs''s decision earlier today on Twitter.com. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), the investment bank
that''s cutting 1,600 jobs, is deferring 100 percent of bonuses
for some senior bankers and traders over three years, according
to a person briefed on the matter. </p>
<p>The deferrals apply to employees who have both total pay of
more than $350,000 and bonuses of at least $50,000, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the plans hadn''t
been announced. Mark Lake, a spokesman for New York-based Morgan
Stanley, declined to comment. Reuters reported on the plan
earlier today. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley last year capped most cash bonuses at
$125,000 as it seeks to tie employees to the firm and satisfy
regulators'' demands for long-term incentives. Chief Executive
Officer James Gorman, 54, has said banks need to balance rewards
to employees with shareholder returns. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley set aside $5.17 billion for compensation in
its investment-banking and trading division in the first nine
months of 2012, a 9 percent decline from a year earlier. Return
on equity, excluding charges tied to changes in the value of the
company''s own debt, was about 5 percent in the first three
quarters and below Gorman''s target of 15 percent. </p>
<h2>Deutsche Bank </h2>
<p>Banks are cutting pay and increasing deferrals as investors
demand higher returns. Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) is weighing 2012 bonus
cuts of as much as 20 percent for investment bankers in Europe,
while those in New York will see smaller declines, four people
briefed on the matter said this week. The Frankfurt-based lender
also is increasing the vesting period for deferred bonuses for
about 150 senior managers to five years from three, and will
make a single payout after the deferral period ends rather than
staggered payments each year. </p>
<p>Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF), the investment bank selling itself to
Leucadia National Corp., has broken from that trend, saying it
will pay employees year-end bonuses in immediately available
cash. </p>
<p>Deferred bonuses for affected employees at Morgan Stanley
will be paid 50 percent in cash and 50 percent in stock, said
the person briefed on the matter. Bankers will get a quarter of
the cash in May, with another quarter coming in each of the
following three Decembers, the person said. The stock also will
be paid over three years with the first installment in December. </p>

<p>CTC Media Inc. (CTCM) is rebounding from
the cheapest level versus peers since 2009 as Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. recommends buying the Russian television company on
prospects a focus on younger viewers will stoke revenue growth. </p>
<p>Shares of CTC traded in the Nasdaq Composite Index (CCMP) jumped
7.3 percent yesterday to $8.70 in New York, the biggest advance
since Aug. 7. The Moscow-based company traded for 9.3 times
estimated earnings, the highest valuation since Dec. 13. CTC''s
rally, the steepest on the Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index
yesterday, narrowed its discount to companies on the MSCI
Emerging Markets Media Index (MXEF0MD) to 61 percent, from as wide as 67
percent Dec. 28, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>CTC''s revenue will climb 10 percent next year and about 11
percent in 2014 and 2015 as it wins more viewers with original
programming and as the company cuts costs, Goldman analysts led
by Alexander Balakhnin, wrote in a report dated Jan. 11. CTC,
which tumbled 11 percent last year as it took on a new chief
executive officer, is debuting new shows including Angel and
Demon'' and The Eighties'' as it seeks out viewers aged 10 to 45. </p>
<p>The stock is undervalued, it''s a clear buy for those who
want exposure to Russia''s growth story, Konstantin Chernyshev,
the Moscow-based head of research at UralSib Financial Corp.,
which has had a buy rating on CTC since May 2011, said by phone
yesterday. CTC Media has a lot of potential for growth as the
company has a good management team, has stabilized its share of
viewers and is winning new ones. </p>
<h2>Increased Volume </h2>
<p>The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN) rose 1.1 percent to
101.38 yesterday and RTS stock futures expiring in March held at
159,090 in the New York day. Trading volume in CTC Media''s stock
was almost four times the average daily volume for the past
three months, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>The Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX), the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, rose 1.3 percent to $30.14
yesterday. The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected
swings in the stock futures, decreased 0.3 percent to 20.58. </p>
<p>Under CEO Boris Podolsky, who moved from the chief
financial officer position on June 14, CTC will post an 11
percent jump in 2013 revenue, after an predicted 2.8 percent
increase in 2012, according to the mean of 12 analysts''
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company''s 2013 revenue will
rise to $872.7 million, according to forecasts. </p>
<p>Russian television advertising will probably rise between
10 percent and 15 percent in 2013 from 2012, fueled by an
expanding economy, UralSib''s Chernyshev said. </p>
<h2>Ad Spending </h2>
<p>Russia''s gross domestic product will climb 3.4 percent in
2013, according to the median of 25 economists''s estimates in a
Bloomberg survey last month. Economic growth probably
accelerated 3.5 percent in 2012, the government forecast last
year, slowing from 4.3 percent expansion in 2011. </p>
<p>Total spending on Russian TV ads is expected to increase to
$5.9 billion in 2014, the biggest market in Europe, from $4.4
billion in 2011, CTC Media says on its website, citing estimates
by industry think-tanks, including Zenith Optimedia and Video
International. </p>
<p>CTC, which operates television channels in Russia,
Kazakhstan, Moldova and broadcasts its programs in countries
including Germany, the U.S., Thailand and Israel, is switching
its focus to a younger audience beginning this year as it seeks
to attract more advertisers. </p>
<p>The broadcaster will direct its content to viewers aged 10
to 45 years-old, compared with the previous target of six to 54-
year-olds, CEO Podolsky told analysts on a conference call Aug.
7. </p>
<h2>Local Shows </h2>
<p>Proceeds from advertising accounted for more than 97
percent of company revenue in 2011, the highest level since
2005, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>CTC TV, the company''s main television channel, has changed
its strategy and is winning more viewership by broadcasting
domestically made shows, rather than Hollywood-made
blockbusters, Goldman''s Balakhnin wrote, adding that the new
strategy also helps to cut costs. </p>
<p>The largest non-government television broadcaster in
Russia, CTC said its audience of viewers aged six to 54 for all
of its television channels increased to 14.8 percent in the
third quarter, from 14.7 percent a year ago, and was the third-
biggest after NTV Television and TNT TV. The company cited TNS
Global as a source for the data. </p>
<p>CTC TV''s weekly audience of viewers aged 18 years and older
rose to 6.9 percent in the week to Jan. 6, from 5.3 percent in
the week to Dec. 30, TNS Global data showed Jan. 10. </p>
<h2>VimpelCom Gains </h2>
<p>The launch of the spring season, with new episodes of
existing titles and scheduled premieres, should support audience
share dynamics and unwind inventory erosion concerns,
Goldman''s Balakhnin wrote. The quality of programming has
improved and the company is able to retain audience share
through more cost-efficient means. </p>
<p>VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP), Russia''s third-biggest mobile phone company
by subscribers, rallied 1.5 percent to $10.75 yesterday in New
York. </p>
<p>Markus Bjerke, an analyst at Arctic Securities ASA in Oslo,
raised its recommendation on the shares to buy from hold and
lifted the price estimate on the shares to $13 from $10.60. </p>
<p>Crude for February delivery gained 0.6 percent to $94.14 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday, the
highest level since Sept. 18. It slid 0.5 percent to $93.68 by
8:25 a.m. today. </p>
<p>Brent oil for February settlement increased 1.1 percent to
$111.88 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange
yesterday, before dropping 0.3 percent today to $111.58. Urals
crude, Russia''s chief export blend, rose 1.1 percent to $109.96,
and was down 0.1 percent today to $109.83 a barrel. </p>
<p>The ruble added 0.2 percent to 30.2540 per dollar
yesterday, the highest level since May 11. It was little changed
at 30.275 today. Ruble futures showed the currency strengthening
0.2 percent to 30.520 per dollar in New York yesterday. </p>
<p>United Co. Rusal (486), the world''s largest aluminum producer,
dropped 0.8 percent to HK$5.01 in Hong Kong today. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of
America Corp. and Nomura (8604) Holdings Inc. are predicting Japanese
stocks will extend their longest streak of gains in 23 years as
extra economic stimulus boost earnings. </p>
<p>The Topix Index, Japan''s broadest gauge of share
performance, rose for nine straight weeks through Jan. 11, the
longest stretch since December 1989 (TPX), when it hit a record
2,886.5. Goldman Sachs boosted its estimate to 1,000 on Jan. 7
from 930, while Bank of America increased its 12-month estimate
to 1,250 from 1,050, according to a Jan. 11 note from Tokyo-
based chief equity strategist Naoki Kamiyama. That''s a gain of
39 percent from the last close of 898.69. </p>
<p>Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced 10.3 trillion yen ($116
billion) in additional stimulus measures on Jan. 11 and is
pressuring the Bank of Japan to double its inflation target to 2
percent after the third recession in five years. Goldman Sachs
is buying shares of exporters, financial firms and utilities,
Hiroyuki Ito, Tokyo-based head of equity investment at Goldman
Sachs Asset Management Co., said last month. </p>
<p>Abe is not just talk, but is about action, Jesper Koll,
head of equity research at JPMorgan Chase  Co. in Tokyo, said
Jan. 11. In his first 30 days, it''s really quite impressive in
that you have a concrete supplementary spending. </p>
<p>Koll has a 12-month target of 1,050 for the Topix. Analysts
surveyed in December said the Topix would rise to 905 by year-
end, according to the median of 14 estimates. Predictions have
been revised up after Abe''s Liberal Democratic Party was
returned to power at Dec. 16 elections. The Topix increased 0.8
percent to 906.22 today. </p>
<h2>Earnings Boost </h2>
<p>All 33 industries on the Topix advanced since Nov. 14.
Securities companies led, as Nomura, the country''s biggest
brokerage, jumped 72 percent and Daiwa Securities Group Inc. (8601)
surged 49 percent as the market rallied. Gauges of shipping
companies and iron and steel manufacturers recorded the second-
and third-biggest increases. </p>
<p>A weaker yen and Abe''s stimulus policies will boost
earnings, according to a Jan. 7 note from Goldman Sachs analysts
led by chief Japan strategist Kathy Matsui. The yen fell below
89 to the U.S. dollar last week and is trading at its lowest
level since June 2010. The currency has declined 11 percent
since the election was announced. </p>
<p>The Nikkei 225 Stock Average will advance 9.7 percent to
11,860 by year end, Jefferies Group Inc. analysts led by Sean
Darby, chief global equity strategist said Jan. 10, citing
improving trade ties with China as a catalyst for earnings. </p>
<p>Earnings are forecast to rise more than 20 percent in
fiscal 2013 and Japanese stocks remain relatively cheap, said
Masahiro Fukuda, investment director at Fidelity Worldwide
Investment in Tokyo. Even before talk on Abe-nomics began,
Japanese stocks could''ve rebounded to this level without
counting the impact of a rapid drop in the yen on earnings.
Valuation justifies further gains when you take a weaker yen
into account. </p>
<h2>1983 Levels </h2>
<p>Income per share on the Topix Index will climb 56 percent
in the next year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
That compares with a 13 percent increase for the Standard 
Poor''s 500 Index and 27 percent for the Shanghai Composite
Index, the data show. </p>
<p>The Topix trades for 1.06 times book value, up from 0.82
times the value of net assets in June, the lowest ever,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg going back to 1993. The
gauge closed at 695.51 on June 4, a level not seen since 1983. </p>
<p>Nakayama Steel Works Ltd. (5408), which gets all its revenue from
Japan, almost doubled in value during the nine-week rally,
surging 97 percent and leading gains by makers of the material
on speculation Abe will pursue greater public-works spending. </p>
<h2>Export Prospects </h2>
<p>Nippon Yusen K.K. (9101), Japan''s biggest shipping line by market
value, added 42 percent as the yen''s decline and signs of
recovery in the economies of China and the U.S. boosted the
propects for exports. Progress in halting the spread of Europe''s
debt crisis also improved the outlook for the company, which
receives 39 percent of revenue from routes to the continent. </p>
<p>I''rom Holdings Co. (2372), a supplier of equipment and management
services to medical institutions, gained the most among the
Topix''s 1,687 members, surging 224 percent from Nov. 14. Kubotek
Corp., a maker of inspection systems for display manufacturers
including South Korea''s Samsung Electronics Co., recorded the
second-biggest advance, jumping 178 percent. </p>
<p>This isn''t the first time analysts have called for a rally
in Japanese shares. </p>
<p>A surge from November 2010 through the start of 2011 was
cut short by the March 11 earthquake. Forecasts for a recovery
in share prices on the back of reconstruction spending were
dashed as the government of former Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda
proved unable to restart the economy. The yen rose as Europe''s
sovereign-debt crisis and an uneven recovery in the U.S
conspired sent investors in search of safer assets. </p>
<h2>Growth Challenge </h2>
<p>Expectations for policy action will lead the market, but
I''m not sure how much impact it will actually have on
earnings, said said Shintaro Shinohara, who helps oversee
about 11 trillion yen ($124 billion) as the head of equity
investment at Prudential Investment Management Japan Co. It''s
not going to be a one-way rally. Globally, Europe''s growth will
be about 1 percent, the U.S. faces uncertainty and China''s not
going to expand as fast as previously. </p>
<p>Japan faces domestic problems as well. More than 25 percent
of people are older than 65 and the country''s government debt
has balooned to 185 percent of gross domestic product. The
country''s shares trade about 70 percent below their 1989 level. </p>
<p>Of the stimulus package announced Jan. 11, about 3.8
trillion yen will be for disaster prevention and reconstruction,
with 3.1 trillion yen directed to stimulating private investment
and other measures, according to a statement released by the
Cabinet Office. Extra spending will increase gross domestic
product by about 2 percentage points and create about 600,000
jobs, the government said. </p>
<h2>Game Changer </h2>
<p>Japan''s currency slid below 120 per euro yesterday for the
first time since May 2011 after Abe said he wanted someone who
can push through bold monetary policy as the next Bank of
Japan (8301) governor. The BOJ meets next week. </p>
<p>This year may become a game-changing year for Japanese
stocks, said Takashi Ito, an equity strategist at Nomura in
Tokyo. The new government are aiming to support corporate
growth and let Japanese companies lead the Japanese economy. </p>

<p>ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM) told a jury that a
gasoline additive to reduce air pollution never caused illness
to any resident of New Hampshire, which sued oil companies
claiming the chemical polluted its groundwater. </p>
<p>ExxonMobil and Citgo Petroleum Corp. made opening
statements today in a jury trial of an $816 million lawsuit in
which the state alleges the oil companies knew the chemical
would contaminate groundwater. The state court trial, which
began yesterday in Concord, pits the environmental claims
against assertions by companies that they were simply complying
with federal pollution standards. </p>
<p>It''s one of scores of cases involving the additive methyl
tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE, filed since 2000 against oil
refiners, fuel distributors and chemical makers. </p>
<p>This is not a personal-injury case, David Lender, a
lawyer for ExxonMobil, told the jury. There''s not any evidence
that anyone ever got sick or got cancer from MTBE. He said
there has been no gasoline sold in the state containing MTBE for
more than six years. </p>
<p>The state claimed that the oil companies knew that if they
added MTBE to gasoline it would increase the risk and costs
associated with contamination. </p>
<p>Exxon decided to disregard the recommendation of its own
employees and put MTBE in gasoline, Jessica Grant, a lawyer
for the state, told jurors yesterday. In 1984, Exxon
anticipated that if it added MTBE to its gasoline, the number of
contamination incidents would triple. These incidents would take
longer to clean up and cost five times as much. Each cleanup
at that time would have cost as much as $7 million, she said. </p>
<h2>Federal Law </h2>
<p>The companies said the federal Clean Air Act overrides the
state claims, and that by adding MTBE to gasoline, they were
complying with a U.S. mandate to supply cleaner-burning fuel. </p>
<p>Oil refiners began adding MTBE to gasoline in the 1970s to
replace lead. From 1995 to 2006, they increased the use of MTBE,
which boosts the fuel''s oxygen level, making it burn more
cleanly. </p>
<p>We had no choice but to put oxygenates in our gasoline,
Nate Eimer, a lawyer for Citgo, said today in his opening
statement. Nothing worked better in cleaning the air than
MTBE. </p>
<p>Keith Hylton, who teaches law and economics at Boston
University School of Law, said the oil companies are counting on
pre-emption, which turns on whether federal regulators looked
at all the issues that the state would examine in a lawsuit. </p>
<p>The oil companies will say, Federal law made us do that,
and that pre-empts any state lawsuit,'' Hylton said. </p>
<h2>Exxon Lawyer </h2>
<p>James Quinn, a lawyer for ExxonMobil, told the jury
yesterday that there were great benefits to using MTBE but
there were downsides. All of these downsides were known to all
the folks involved. </p>
<p>MTBE is produced by combining methanol, which is derived
from natural gas, and isobutylene, a byproduct of gasoline
refining. It can leak into the ground from gas stations, storage
tanks and auto junkyards. </p>
<p>It dissolves in water and doesn''t biodegrade, so it can be
carried with the water great distances from the site of a leak
or spill, according to court papers. The chemical is difficult
and expensive to find, treat and remove, according to filings. </p>
<p>According to New Hampshire case filings, MTBE can render
drinking water foul, putrid and unfit for human consumption.
The state said it petitioned the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency in 2001 to get out of its reformulated-gasoline program
because of awareness of MTBE''s harmful effects. The additive has
been banned in the state since January 2007. </p>
<h2>No Warning </h2>
<p>Despite knowing that MTBE posed a greater threat to
drinking water, they never posted a single warning, Grant
said. </p>
<p>New Hampshire sued ExxonMobil and Citgo in 2003 along with
Shell Oil Co., Sunoco Inc., ConocoPhillips (COP), Irving Oil Ltd.,
Vitol SA and Hess Corp. All settled but Irving, Texas-based
ExxonMobil and Citgo, the Houston-based unit of Venezuela''s
state-owned oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA. Shell and
Sunoco agreed to pay $35 million in an accord announced in
November. </p>
<p>New Hampshire said it has identified 228 sites that will
require cleanup from contamination by MTBE, which according to
court filings can cause cancer in animals. Tests in 2005 and
2006 found MTBE in 9.1 percent of private wells throughout the
state, it said. </p>
<p>New Hampshire is seeking $816 million to cover cleanup and
monitoring costs, Grant said, and it will ask for damages from
ExxonMobil and Citgo based on their market shares of gasoline
sold in the state during the time the suit covers. </p>
<h2>Market Share </h2>
<p>ExxonMobil''s market share was about 30 percent, she said.
That means the state will seek $245 million in damages from the
company. Citgo''s market share ranged from 3 percent to
8.7 percent. </p>
<p>Lender said today that ExxonMobil''s market share in New
Hampshire was only 6.1 percent during that time. </p>
<p>The majority of the state''s damage claims are based on
computer models and projections, not on actual testing or
data, Claire Hassett, an ExxonMobil spokeswoman, said by e-
mail. </p>
<p>The state said the oil companies could have used safer
additives, such as ethanol, and chose not to because MTBE is
inexpensive to produce. </p>
<p>If they had an alternative product to use and the
alternative is just as good and avoids serious risk to
consumers, there''s a strong argument the defendants have failed
the risk-utility standard and can be held liable, said Hylton,
of Boston University. </p>
<h2>Short Supply </h2>
<p>The oil companies said ethanol wasn''t in large enough
supply when an additive was being sought, and that it presents
its own environmental hazards. </p>
<p>ExxonMobil''s Hassett said the fault lies with whoever
spilled the chemically treated fuel. </p>
<p>MTBE contamination has been found in New Hampshire
because someone spilled gasoline in New Hampshire, not because
it was added to gasoline in a refinery in another state, she
said. The state should be suing parties responsible for
spilling gasoline. </p>
<p>The oil companies also said in court filings that a statute
of limitations should prevent the litigation from proceeding.
The state waited three years from the time it detected MTBE in
sites until it sued, they said. </p>
<p>Superior Court Judge Peter Fauver in August rejected oil
company motions seeking judgment without a trial based on the
arguments they raised. Those issues can be brought up again for
the jury''s consideration. </p>
<h2>Water Sources </h2>
<p>In January 2011, the New Hampshire Supreme Court denied a
motion by the companies to decide the case in their favor and
sent it back to the Superior Court. The state''s highest court
said New Hampshire could seek damages for contamination of
nonpublic sources of water, such as wells, and public sources. </p>
<p>The New Hampshire case had been moved to federal court in
New York, where other lawsuits have been consolidated for
pretrial evidence-gathering and motions before U.S. District
Judge Shira Scheindlin in Manhattan. In 2007, the U.S. Court of
Appeals in New York sent New Hampshire''s case back to the state
court there. </p>
<p>Scheindlin presided over the trial of New York City''s case
against ExxonMobil. In 2009, the jury in that case ordered
ExxonMobil to pay $104.7 million after finding it liable for
polluting wells in the city. ExxonMobil has appealed. </p>
<h2>Consolidated Cases </h2>
<p>The cases consolidated in New York may be tried separately
in courts around the U.S. if settlements aren''t reached. In the
New York litigation, the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection filed its fourth amended complaint in June. No date
has been set for a trial, which would probably take place in
federal court in New Jersey. </p>
<p>The New Hampshire trial may take more than four months,
lawyers said. </p>
<p>After the jury was dismissed yesterday, Citgo''s Eimer asked
the judge to declare a mistrial, claiming that the state''s
lawyer misrepresented a document as one of Citgo''s in her
remarks to the jury. </p>
<p>There''s a long road ahead of us, Fauver told the
lawyers. This will all be clarified. I don''t think it warrants
a mistrial. </p>
<p>The case is State of New Hampshire v. Hess Corp. (HES), 03-C-
0550, New Hampshire Superior Court, Merrimack County (Concord).
The federal cases are consolidated as In re MTBE Products
Liability Litigation, 00-11898, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), detailing lapses behind its biggest-ever trading loss, said employees were overwhelmed by the complexity of their bets, risk managers were ill-equipped and leaders including Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon weren''t aggressive enough in responding. </p> <p>In a 129-page report issued yesterday, the bank described an error prone risk-modeling system that required employees to cut and paste electronic data to a spreadsheet. Workers inadvertently used the sum of two numbers instead of the average in calculating volatility. The firm also reiterated an assertion that London traders initially tried to hide losses that ballooned beyond $6.2 billion in last year''s first nine months. </p> <p>The investigation, overseen by Dimon confidante Mike Cavanagh, is part of an effort to overhaul the bank and rebuild investor trust after the trading debacle helped cut shareholder value by as much as $51 billion last year. The report doesn''t explain why the chief investment office, a unit responsible for managing cash and mitigating risk, departed from more conservative strategies, eventually amassing a portfolio of complex credit derivatives. Dimon''s pay for last year was cut in half following the losses. </p> <p>The people who conduct these internal investigations walk a fine line, said David Felt, a lawyer with Arnall Golden Gregory in Washington. Their job is to find out what happened and prevent it from reoccurring, but not to provide evidence to prosecutors and other litigators. Felt, who specializes in corporate inquiries, helped oversee the regulatory investigations into accounting fraud at Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac for the Federal Housing Finance Agency. </p> <h2>London Whale </h2> <p>JPMorgan first disclosed losses on the trades in May, almost a month after Dimon dismissed initial news reports on the bets as a tempest in a teapot. Transactions were handled by London-based trader Bruno Iksil, nicknamed the London Whale because his positions were so big. Dimon, 56, said yesterday the bank is almost done with losses in the CIO and won''t disclose the size of future declines. </p> <p>The board of directors cut the CEO''s compensation for 2012 to $11.5 million. The decision was announced as the firm reported a 53 percent jump in fourth-quarter profit to $5.69 billion, driven by earnings on mortgages. </p> <p>Mr. Dimon bears ultimate responsibility for the failures that led to the losses in CIO and has accepted responsibility, the bank said. </p> <p>Cavanagh, who has worked with or for Dimon since 1993, led the management task force that produced the report. Dimon promoted him from chief financial officer to run the treasury and security services division in June 2010, and again last July to co-head the corporate and investment bank. </p> <h2>More Independent'' </h2> <p>I would have much rather seen a more-independent report, said Paul Miller, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets in Arlington, Virginia. Let''s say that Cavanagh is a straight-up, straight-shooting guy who''s going to do this effectively. Nobody is going to believe it. </p> <p>Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for the bank, said Cavanagh answered to the independent committee of the board, which also conducted its own review. </p> <p>The loss at JPMorgan, considered one of the industry''s best-managed firms after remaining profitable during the credit crisis, has prompted lawsuits and probes in the U.S. and abroad. This week, it led to the first regulatory sanctions, as banking watchdogs found internal-control deficiencies. It also has pushed lawmakers to tighten trading curbs included in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. </p> <h2>Too Trusting </h2> <p>The CIO unit used credit derivatives as part of a hedging strategy, and the trades became so large the bank couldn''t easily unwind them. The report blamed managers, many of whom were reassigned or left last year, for roles in failing to halt the loss. The executives include former Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew, Barry Zubrow, ex-head of companywide risk management, and former Chief Financial Officer Doug Braunstein. </p> <p>Read the full JPMorgan Chase  Co. report</p><p>Dimon was faulted for trusting information given him by senior managers, according to the task force. </p> <p>He could have better tested his reliance on what he was told, the firm found. More should have been done regarding the risks, risk controls and personnel associated with CIO''s activities, and Mr. Dimon bears some responsibility. </p> <p>Dimon, who is also chairman of the board, wasn''t included in deliberations on his compensation, he told reporters on a conference call. The bank said its decisions took into account his replacement of senior managers, efforts to claw back their pay and the formation of a team to examine what went wrong. </p> <h2>Embarrassing Mistake'' </h2> <p>Once Mr. Dimon became aware of the seriousness of the issues presented by CIO, he responded forcefully by directing a thorough review and an extensive program of remediation, the company said. </p> <p>The board had to look at the positives, which I think are large, and the negatives, Dimon said. This is one huge embarrassing mistake and I respect their decision. </p> <p>Executives failed to ensure that the CIO''s risk controls kept pace with the increased complexity of the unit''s activities, the task force said. The leaders didn''t verify that the unit was well managed or had the same level of risk controls as elsewhere at the firm, according to the report. </p> <p>Significant risk-management weaknesses developed within CIO that allowed the traders to pursue their flawed and risky trading strategies, the bank said. Senior firm management''s view of CIO had not evolved to reflect the increasingly complex and risky strategies CIO was pursuing. </p> <h2>Traders Ousted </h2> <p>Dimon ousted three London traders involved in the loss, shuffled senior managers and accepted resignations from executives including Drew. Matt Zames, the former co-head of fixed-income trading, was promoted twice last year and, after helping overhaul the CIO, is now co-chief operating officer with Frank Bisignano. </p> <p>Drew retired four days after the loss was disclosed May 10. Iksil, his supervisor Javier Martin-Artajo and the former CIO head in Europe, Achilles Macris, also left. </p> <p>Zubrow, who had overseen JPMorgan''s risk-management function while Iksil expanded his book, retired at the end of last year. Braunstein, 52, stepped down to become a vice chairman in the investment bank. </p> <p>In the years before the trading losses, Dimon had pushed the CIO to generate more profit by boosting the size and risk of its bets to include higher-yielding assets, Bloomberg News reported in April, citing former executives. The shift had made the unit an increasingly important customer to Wall Street''s trading desks, with bets that could move markets. </p> <h2>Probe''s Focus </h2> <p>The task force wrote in a footnote to its report that while it had reviewed certain background information on how the CIO expanded into credit derivatives, its focus was on the events at the end of 2011 and the first several months of 2012 when the losses occurred. </p> <p>The report also highlighted blunders tied to measuring risk. Dimon had previously said switching models understated the chance of losses. </p> <p>The CIO exceeded its so-called value-at-risk limit at several points during a period in January 2012, driven by the synthetic credit portfolio, JPMorgan said in the report. The office recommended a temporary increase in the risk limit, as the new model was expected to show a substantially reduced measure of the amount in danger of being lost. </p> <p>On Jan. 23, a trader e-mailed the person who developed the new model to say he should keep the pressure on our friends in model validation and [quantitative research], the bank said. </p> <h2>Flaws Overlooked </h2> <p>There is some evidence the Model Review Group accelerated its review as a result of this pressure, and in so doing it may have been more willing to overlook the operational flaws apparent during the approval process, according to the bank. </p> <p>The risk model was developed by a London-based quantitative expert who had not previously created or implemented such a model and wasn''t given the support he requested, JPMorgan said. The firm''s review of the model wasn''t as rigorous as it should have been, JPMorgan said. </p> <p>JPMorgan also found the spreadsheet used the sum of two numbers, rather than their average, as part of a risk calculation. </p> <p>This error likely had the effect of muting volatility by a factor of two, according to the report. </p> <p>The Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency on Jan. 14 took the first regulatory actions stemming from the trade, ordering the bank to strengthen risk and auditing controls. The board of directors also was told to consider control weaknesses and adverse risk outcomes while awarding compensation for Dimon and other top managers. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Karen Gullo" date="Jan 16, 2013  8:09 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-16/chevron-subpoenas-in-ecuador-suit-challenged-in-california-1-.html"><headline>Chevron Subpoenas in Ecuador Suit Challenged in Court</headline><body><![CDATA[

Foundation, asked U.S. Magistrate Judge Nathanael Cousins in San
Francisco today to block Chevron subpoenas, saying that free
speech and privacy rights are at stake. She alleged that the
company is trying to harass and intimidate activists associated
with the legal effort to hold Chevron responsible for
environmental damage in the Amazon basin. </p>
<p>These people feel intimidated by this, said Hofmann,
who''s trying to shield the identity of people she refers to as
John Does from Chevron in records it seeks from Google Inc.
and Yahoo Inc. They''re all engaged in political activity, and
it''s public criticism against Chevron. </p>
<p>Chevron is seeking information about when and where people
logged into e-mail accounts, not the content of e-mails, to use
as evidence in its racketeering lawsuit against Steven Donziger,
the lead U.S. legal adviser for the Ecuador plaintiffs, said
Theodore Boutrous, Chevron''s lawyer. The San Ramon, California-
based company alleges Donziger and others improperly influenced
a court expert in the case and committed fraud to win the
damages award. </p>
<h2>Innocent Bystanders'' </h2>
<p>The fight over the subpoenas isn''t a free-speech battle,
Boutrous said. Rather than innocent bystanders, the John
Does were part of the pressure campaign against Chevron
and their e-mail activity might provide proof of how the
plaintiff lawyers funneled information to the Ecuador judge and
ghost-wrote his decision against Chevron, Boutrous told Cousins. </p>
<p>We know who every one of these people are, Boutrous
said. We allege some of them at least, many of them, were part
of the scheme, wittingly or unwittingly. </p>
<p>Donziger denies wrongdoing and the oil company is attacking
him to avoid responsibility for the damages and trying to
intimidate people who it thinks don''t have the resources to
fight back, Karen Hinton, a spokeswoman for the Ecuadorean
plaintiffs, said in an e-mail today. </p>
<p>Cousins said the underlying case, which is being litigated
in several countries and is the subject of international
arbitration, involves political issues. He questioned whether
there should be heightened concern about free speech rights. </p>
<h2>Contract Dispute'' </h2>
<p>This is not a run-of-the-mill contract dispute, Cousins
told Boutrous. I''m not sure I agree with your assessment
that the case is about something agnostic and commercial.
Isn''t this a political case? He didn''t say when he would rule. </p>
<p>The damages against Chevron were awarded in 2011 by a
provincial judge in Ecuador in a lawsuit brought by villagers
who said the company was responsible for toxic pollution from
oil drilling by Texaco Inc., which Chevron acquired in 2001.
Chevron, the world''s fourth largest oil company, says it cleaned
up its portion of the region and was released by the Ecuadorean
government from future damage claims. </p>
<p>The company has no assets in Ecuador; the plaintiffs have
gone to court in Canada, Brazil and Argentina to seize Chevron
funds. </p>
<p>The case is Chevron v. Donziger, 12-80237, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco). </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest U.S. bank by assets, said fourth-quarter profit rose 53 percent, beating analysts'' estimates as mortgage revenue more than doubled and the lender set aside less for future losses. </p> <p>Net income climbed to $5.69 billion, or $1.39 a share, from $3.73 billion, or 90 cents, a year earlier, the New York-based company said today in a statement. JPMorgan earned $1.35 a share excluding one-time items such as accounting adjustments and costs from a mortgage settlement, compared with the $1.22 estimate for adjusted earnings by 28 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. </p> <p>The firm''s results reflected strong underlying performance across virtually all our businesses for the fourth quarter and the full year, with strong lending and deposit growth, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56, said in the statement. </p> <p>JPMorgan capped its third-straight year of record profits with $21.3 billion in net income, even after suffering its biggest trading loss ever. The bank faces regulatory sanctions and investigations by U.S. and international authorities stemming from the loss over a wrong-way bet on credit derivatives. The mistake cost JPMorgan more than $6.2 billion in the first nine months of last year, and the board cut Dimon''s 2012 pay in half as a result. </p>

<p> Cobalt International Energy Inc (CIE),
the explorer seeking oil in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and West
Africa, fell the most in more than a month after Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) and other backers announced plans to sell 40 million
shares worth more than $1 billion. </p>
<p>Cobalt fell 7.1 percent to $24.84 at the close in New York,
the biggest decline since Dec. 12. The share sale would reduce
the holdings of Goldman Sachs and First Reserve Corp. as well as
funds owned by Carlyle Group LP (CG) and Riverstone Holdings LLC from
about 15 percent each to less than 13 percent, according to a
filing today. </p>
<p>A successful sale would drop holdings by Cobalt''s biggest
investors below 50 percent, requiring the company to qualify a
majority of directors as independent within a year to meet New
York Stock Exchange standards, according to the filing. Cobalt
won''t receive any proceeds from the share sale. The shares have
climbed to as much as $34.03 since first offered to the public
at $13.50 in December 2009. </p>
<p>Cobalt, based in Houston, announced Dec. 5 a
significant discovery at its North Platte prospect in the
Gulf of Mexico. The company announced its second discovery off
the coast of Angola July 31. It has yet to report a profit as a
public company, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Goldman intends to sell 13 million shares, paring its stake
to 12.15 percent from 15.33 percent, according to the filing.
Funds controlled by Carlyle and Riverstone will also offer 13
million shares, trimming their holdings to 12.15 percent. Funds
of First Reserve expect to sell 10 million shares to retain a
12.76 percent stake. </p>
<p>KERN Fund, with investors that include Stanford University
and Caisse de depot et placement due Quebec, plans to sell 3.9
million shares, trimming its stake to 5.61 percent from 6.56
percent, according to the filing. </p>
<h2>Exploration Success </h2>
<p>Cobalt''s $1.38 billion of 2.625 percent convertible notes,
which mature in December 2019 and can be swapped for shares at
about $35.69 each, dropped 3.4 cents to 103.5 cents on the
dollar and yielded 2.1 percent at 9:52 a.m. in New York,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. </p>
<p>We have had successes in our exploration efforts in each
of our focus areas, Cobalt said in the prospectus filed today
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Cobalt has
long-lived leasehold positions that cannot be replicated,
according to the filing. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) and Citigroup Inc. (C) will handle the sale with
an option to buy as many as 6 million additional shares at the
offer price, according to the filing. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) agreed to offer a $557 million package of cash and other assistance for mortgage borrowers to settle a federal probe into allegations that the banks improperly seized homes. </p> <p>The sum includes $232 million in direct payments to more than 220,000 borrowers and $325 million in assistance such as loan modifications, the Federal Reserve said in a statement. Eric Kollig, a Fed spokesman, declined to say how much each of the New York-based firms will pay. </p> <p>The deal adds to the $8.5 billion settlement announced last week among the Fed, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and 10 of the biggest U.S. lenders, including JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. Regulators probed allegations that lenders rushed home foreclosures by using flawed documents. </p> <p>With the addition of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, more than 4 million borrowers will receive a total of $3.5 billion in cash compensation while an additional $5.5 billion will be provided by the servicers for mortgage assistance, the Fed said in the statement. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley''s share of the accord totals $227 million, consisting of $97 million in cash and $130 million in other relief, according to two people briefed on the matter. Goldman Sachs will pay $135 million in cash plus $195 million in relief, said the people, who asked for anonymity because terms weren''t publicly announced. </p> <h2>Helping Borrowers </h2> <p>Cash payments in today''s deal range as high as $125,000 and cover borrowers whose homes were in foreclosure in 2009 and 2010, the Fed said. The loans were handled by Litton Loan Servicing LP, which formerly was owned by Goldman Sachs, and Saxon Mortgage Services Inc., which was a unit of Morgan Stanley, according to the Fed. </p> <p>Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, and Mark Lake of Morgan Stanley both said their firms were pleased to have resolved the probe. Lake declined to say whether the accord will result in a charge against fourth-quarter earnings, which are scheduled to be released Jan. 18. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs set aside $260 million in the fourth quarter to cover litigation and regulatory proceedings including today''s settlement, according to a statement today released with the firm''s earnings. </p> <h2>Longer List </h2> <p>Goldman Sachs bought Litton in 2007 to get into mortgage servicing, and Morgan Stanley bought Saxon in 2006, before a housing market collapse that led to the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Litton started 135,586 foreclosures in 2009 and 2010, and Saxon initiated at least 60,313 actions in the same period, according to the Fed. Both banks later sold the servicers to Ocwen Financial Corp. (OCN) </p> <p>The settlement with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley expands the industry payouts beyond the initial 14 firms that agreed in 2011 to hire outside consultants to review their foreclosures for errors. </p> <p>HSBC Holdings Inc. (HBC) and Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY) are also preparing to sign on to the deal, two people briefed on the matter have said. Neil Brazil, a U.S. spokesman for HSBC, said the bank is still in discussions with regulators. Its mortgage- servicing operations were regulated by both the Fed and OCC. </p> <p>The OCC continues conversations with the remaining servicers, said Bryan Hubbard, an OCC spokesman. </p> <p>IndyMac Bancorp''s successor OneWest Bank FSB and EverBank Financial Corp. (EVER) also haven''t reached an accord with regulators. </p> <p>Ally, with all its mortgage-servicing affiliates, represented the fifth-largest U.S. servicer with 2.5 million loans during the crisis, according to the Fed. </p> <p>Residential Capital LLC, the unit of Detroit-based Ally involved in the settlement, supports the idea that bank funds should go toward consumers rather than consultants, and has been delayed in considering the settlement because of its bankruptcy, said Susan Fitzpatrick, a bank spokeswoman. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Christine Harper and Michael J.

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said it''s
weighing whether to sell a stake in its reinsurance unit, which
generated $1.08 billion of revenue last year. </p>
<p>The business may be better held in other people''s hands
and we can be a minority owner after global capital rules take
effect, Harvey M. Schwartz, who is set to become chief financial
officer this month, said today on a conference call after New
York-based Goldman Sachs reported fourth-quarter results. </p>
<p>It was the first time the bank disclosed the contribution
of its Goldman Sachs Reinsurance Group. Reinsurance revenue
climbed 23 percent last year from 2011 and accounted for 13
percent of the firm''s $8.21 billion of equities revenue. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is in talks to sell a majority stake in the

<p>The division has a global property and casualty reinsurance
business as well as life and annuity reinsurance operations
primarily in the U.S. Goldman Sachs agreed in March to buy Ariel
Holdings Ltd.''s Bermuda-based insurance and reinsurance
businesses to expand property and casualty coverage. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank, reduced its 2013 stock-repurchase request with
federal bank regulators by at least 20 percent after suffering
its biggest trading loss ever last year. </p>
<p>JPMorgan asked the Federal Reserve if it could buy back
less than $3 billion per quarter when it submitted its annual
capital request in January, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon,
56, told analysts on a conference call today. </p>
<p>The Fed forced the New York-based company to suspend a $15
billion stock-buyback program last year after the bank in May
acknowledged losses in a credit-derivatives portfolio that
eventually swelled to more than $6.2 billion. JPMorgan''s board
of directors cut Dimon''s pay for 2012 in half after a review of
the losses in the chief investment office held him responsible
for the botched trades. </p>
<p>JPMorgan had repurchased $1.6 billion of the $15 billion in
authorized share buybacks when the Fed suspended the program.
The central bank later approved the repurchase of $3 billion in
additional shares in the first quarter, leaving $10.4 billion of
the original buyback goal unused. </p>
<p>Dimon said he is inclined to buy back shares when the price
of the stock falls below tangible book value. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) won''t delay
distribution of U.K. bonuses to help minimize employees'' tax
rates, a person with direct knowledge of the decision said. </p>
<p>The firm had considered postponing incentive compensation
due to employees from 2009, 2010 and 2011 until after top
income-tax rates drop in April. </p>
<p>In remarks to lawmakers in London yesterday, Bank of
England Governor Mervyn King criticized the plan as lacking in
care and attention to how others might react. He said it''s
depressing that banks may be willing to shift bonus payments
to minimize workers'' tax burden. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs accelerated delivery of $65 million in stock
awards last month to 10 executives, including Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, in a move that helped them avoid
higher U.S. taxes that take effect this year. That change, which
didn''t affect compensation for 2012, was made public by company
filings at about 8 p.m. New York time on New Year''s Eve. </p>
<p>This week, the Financial Times and other media reported
that Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, was
reviewing whether to delay U.K. bonus payments due from prior
years to help employees pay lower rates. The reports were met
with criticism from U.K. politicians as well as King. </p>
<p>Management decided against proceeding with the plan, a
decision that was ratified yesterday in a regular meeting of the
board''s compensation committee, according to the person, who
asked to not be identified because deliberations were private. </p>
<p>The decision by New York-based Goldman Sachs was reported
earlier yesterday by British Broadcasting Corp. editor Robert
Peston on Twitter.com. </p>
<h2>Compliance Policy </h2>
<h2>Appraisal Standards for Higher-Risk Mortgages Approved by FDIC </h2>
<p>U.S. mortgage lenders will get an additional year to
implement new appraisal standards for higher-risk loans after
regulators revised the Dodd-Frank Act measure to address
concerns raised by financial firms. </p>
<p>Creditors issuing loans at above-average interest rates
that don''t meet the qualified mortgage standard will need to
get written reports by certified appraisers who physically
inspect homes under rules approved yesterday by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp., one of six regulators that must sign
off. </p>
<p>Lenders will get the full 12-month implementation period
permitted under the statute, according to John Fairbanks, a
spokesman for the National Credit Union Administration. </p>
<p>In addition to the initial physical inspection, the rule
requires a second appraisal when a home is being turned around
for a quick, higher resale. Fairbanks said the final rule
doesn''t require the second appraisal if the new sale price is
only slightly higher. </p>
<p>The six U.S. regulators involved in the joint rule include
the FDIC, NCUA, the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency, Federal Housing Finance Agency and Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau. </p>
<h2>BBA Proposes Independent Board to Monitor Banking Standards </h2>
<p>The British Bankers'' Association, a financial lobby group,
proposed creating an independent council to promote a new code
of conduct for bankers after scandals eroded trust in the
industry. </p>
<p>The code would guide banks on pay, what''s expected of
boards and controls to prevent unethical behavior, the London-
based BBA said in a submission to parliament published
yesterday. </p>
<p>The plan comes after banks set aside about 11 billion
pounds ($17.7 billion) to compensate customers mis-sold loan
insurance and for the Libor scandal. Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc, Britain''s biggest government-owned lender, may pay as
much as 500 million pounds in fines next week to settle
allegations traders tried to rig interest rates, two people with
knowledge of the matter said. Barclays Plc (BARC) was fined 290 million
pounds in June for manipulating Libor. </p>
<p>The proposed Banking Standards Review Council would need
to be independent of the industry with a non-banking chairman
and a majority of non-banking members, including customers, the
lobby group said in its submission to the Parliamentary
Commission on Banking Standards. </p>
<h2>U.K.''s Biggest Companies Lower Tax Rate With Overseas Business </h2>
<p>The biggest U.K. companies paid taxes at a lower rate for
the fourth consecutive year, partly by garnering more profit
overseas, and caused public outcry by avoiding levies in
Britain. </p>
<p>The effective tax rate for FTSE 100 companies, the largest
traded on the London Stock Exchange, fell to 24.5 percent from
35.8 percent in 2009, according to UHY Hacker Young, a London-
based accounting company. The firm said in an e-mailed statement
that reductions in corporate taxes around the world, including
in the U.K., have helped multinational companies reduce their
tax payments. </p>
<p>U.K. Business Secretary Vince Cable said in December that
governments should coordinate across borders to make companies
pay more tax. More than 20 companies left the U.K. for tax
reasons from 2007 to 2011, according to the accounting firm. </p>
<p>The government will be encouraged by tax-law changes that
prompted a few to return, the firm said. An anti-abuse rule
that may be considered by the U.K. government to limit tax
avoidance could drive more companies away, the accountants said. </p>
<p>The averages used in the study are taken from effective tax
rates reported by FTSE 100 companies in their latest annual
reports or by their investor relations teams in the 12 months
ended Oct. 31. </p>
<h2>EU Lawmakers Back Sovereign-Debt Curbs for Ratings Companies </h2>
<p>Credit-ratings companies will face European Union curbs on
how they update markets about the quality of government debt
under plans approved by the bloc''s lawmakers today. </p>
<p>The measures, intended to make it less likely that ratings
decisions roil markets, will also give investors the right to
sue if they lose money because of poor quality or deliberately
distorted credit assessments. European Parliament legislators,
voting in Strasbourg, France, backed the plans in a compromise
deal with the EU''s 27 governments, which must now rubber-stamp
the accord before it can take effect. </p>
<p>Under the EU plan, each credit ratings company would pick a
maximum of three days a year when they would be allowed to
publish so-called unsolicited assessments of governments''
creditworthiness. </p>
<p>Unsolicited ratings are those that haven''t been requested
and paid for by a client. Ratings companies will be able to
issue such ratings outside of their three dates if they can
justify it to regulators. </p>

<h2>Compliance Action </h2>
<h2>Siemens Agrees to Pay $10 Million to Settle New York Fraud Case </h2>
<p>A Siemens AG (SIE) unit agreed to pay $10 million to settle
allegations made by New York prosecutors that the company lied
about its qualifications to win more than $200 million in
infrastructure contracts. </p>
<p>Schlesinger-Siemens Electrical violated New York state law
by filing false documents with two city departments, the New
York District Attorney''s Office said in a statement on its
website Jan. 14. Siemens takes responsibility for misconduct
committed by its former business partner Schlesinger Electrical
Contractors Inc., Munich-based Siemens said in an e-mailed
statement. </p>
<p>New York''s Department of Environmental Protection awarded
five contracts to Schlesinger-Siemens Electrical with a total
value of $234.8 million between Aug. 31, 2005, and Jan. 19,
2007, New York District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said a
statement. </p>
<h2>U.K. Will Widen Review of Financial Firm Sales Incentives </h2>
<p>The U.K.''s financial watchdog is widening a probe into
sales incentives at retail financial companies. </p>
<p>The Financial Services Authority will investigate practices
at high street banks and other firms in addition to the 22
firms that were originally assessed, the agency said in an e-
mailed statement today. </p>
<p>Separately, the regulator is in talks with banks to set a
cut-off date for claims arising from alleged improper selling of
payment protection insurance, the London-based Times reported,
citing unidentified people with knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>The British Bankers Association has suggested a summer
deadline in return for agreement by banks to finance an
advertising campaign making the public aware, the newspaper
said. The FSA is sympathetic to banks'' concern that without a
cut-off date, there may otherwise be no end to mis-selling
claims, the Times said. </p>
<p>The British Bankers Association declined to comment, the
Times said. </p>
<h2>Courts </h2>
<h2>Broadband Research''s Kinnucan Gets 4 Years in Insider Case </h2>
<p>Broadband Research LLC founder John Kinnucan, the expert-
networker who refused to cooperate in a U.S. probe of insider
trading before admitting to passing tips to hedge-fund clients,
was sentenced to four years and three months in prison. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Deborah Batts yesterday in Manhattan
federal court also ordered him to forfeit $164,000 he made in
illegal profit. Kinnucan, who was indicted in February, pleaded
guilty in July to one count of conspiracy and two counts of
securities fraud. </p>
<p>In his plea, Kinnucan said he both obtained and gave tips
to clients of his expert-networking firm, including two in New
York. Prosecutors said he got inside information about SanDisk
Corp. (SNDK), F5 Networks Inc. (FFIV) and OmniVision Technologies Inc. (OVTI),
including quarterly revenue numbers, after befriending employees
of technology companies. </p>
<p>Kinnucan was arrested Feb. 16 at his home in Portland,
Oregon. Prosecutors said that in the two months leading up to
his arrest, he engaged in a campaign of threats and anti-
Semitic rants. </p>
<p>In a submission by his lawyer, which hasn''t been made
public and was referred to by the government in their court
papers, Kinnucan sought a 24-month prison term, saying his
conduct was caused by stress, depression and alcohol abuse
after he learned he was the subject of an insider-trading
investigation. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Kinnucan, 12-cv-163, U.S District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<h2>Apple Sued by Belgian Consumer Group Over Product Warranties </h2>
<p>Apple Inc. (AAPL) is being sued by a Belgian consumer group over
its product-warranty practices, more than a year after the iPad
maker was fined by an Italian regulator over the same issue. </p>
<p>Test-Aankoop/Test-Achats filed a lawsuit at the commercial
court in Brussels claiming Apple violates laws on consumer
guarantees, it said in a statement yesterday. It cited customer
complaints about information provided by Apple and authorized
distributors about the company''s legal warranty, its one-year
warranty and a warranty extension of as much as three years
through the AppleCare Protection Plan. </p>
<p>Italy''s competition agency fined Apple 900,000 euros ($1.2
million) in 2011, saying the Cupertino, California-based company
misled consumers by prominently advertising that its
products had a one-year manufacturer warranty and selling an
extension when consumers have the right to an automatic two-year
warranty. European Union Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding
last year asked state governments to check whether Apple
retailers failed to advertise buyers'' right to the two-year
warranty for products such as the iPhone and the iPad tablet. </p>

<h2>United Airlines Skirted Jet-Fuel Taxes, Illinois Agency Says </h2>
<p>United Airlines Inc. (UAL) used a sham site outside Chicago
to avoid paying the full tax on jet fuel, the Illinois Regional
Transportation Authority said in a lawsuit. </p>
<p>The airline''s United Aviation Fuels Corp. unit, which
purchases jet fuel for United and its regional carriers, used an
office in Sycamore, Illinois, that has no true sales activity,
the agency said in the complaint filed Jan. 14 in state court in
Chicago. The office has one staff member, who doesn''t work daily
and doesn''t have a computer, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>United Airlines and its unit have been engaging in the
sales since 2001, diverting tax money owed to the agency and
other municipalities, according to the lawsuit. The RTA asked
for a court order barring the practice, as well as recovery for
unpaid taxes. </p>
<p>The lawsuit is without merit, said Jennifer Dohm, a
spokeswoman for Chicago-based United Continental Holdings Inc.,
United Airlines'' parent company. </p>
<p>The operation of our fuel subsidiary in Sycamore has been
examined by tax authorities in the past and has been determined
to comply with all applicable laws, Dohm said in an e-mail.
She said the company will fight the claims. </p>
<p>The case is Regional Transportation Authority v. United
Aviation Fuels Corp., 2013CH01023, Circuit Court of Cook County,
Chancery Division (Chicago). </p>
<h2>Interviews/Hearings </h2>
<h2>EU''s Barroso Expects Bank-Supervisor Regulations Within Weeks </h2>
<p>European Commission President Jose Barroso said regulations
to create a single bank supervisor at the European Central Bank
are proceeding quickly. </p>
<p>I hope making the final step for formal adoption is a
matter of weeks, not months, he said in the text of a speech
to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. Parliament
members have worked very efficiently with the council of
European nations to speed up work on the issue, he said
yesterday. </p>
<p>The European Central Bank is slated to become the single
supervisor for euro-area banks around March 1, 2014, a year
after regulations are set to establish oversight operations. The
new supervisor is one condition for allowing the 500 billion-
euro ($667 billion) European Stability Mechanism to lend
directly to banks. </p>
<p>The Brussels-based commission will move swiftly on other
banking measures such as capital requirements, deposit-insurance
standards and how to handle failing lenders, Barroso said. </p>
<h2>Comings and Goings/Executive Pay </h2>
<h2>JPMorgan Halves Dimon Pay, Says CEO Responsible for Lapses </h2>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon
had his pay cut by half after a review of losses at the bank''s
chief investment office found he bears responsibility for the
blunders. </p>
<p>The CEO''s compensation for 2012 is $11.5 million, the New
York-based bank said today on its website, compared with $23
million a year earlier. The 2012 sum includes a $1.5 million
salary and $10 million of incentive compensation. </p>
<p>Mr. Dimon bears ultimate responsibility for the failures
that led to the losses in CIO and has accepted responsibility
for such failures, the New York-based company said today on
its website after spending about eight months reviewing what
Dimon, 56, has called egregious mistakes at the CIO. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is working to rebuild investors'' trust after
losing more than $6.2 billion in last year''s first nine months
on derivatives bets by U.K. trader Bruno Iksil, nicknamed the
London Whale because his positions were so big. The debacle
fueled legal claims against the company and its executives, and
regulatory probes. </p>
<p>The bank said its review of Dimon took into account his
decisions to replace senior managers, efforts to claw back their
pay and the formation of a team to examine what went wrong. </p>
<p>Dijsselbloem a Good'' Possible Next Eurogroup Head, Faymann Says </p>
<p>Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann praised Dutch Finance
Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem''s qualifications as the possible
next head of the group of euro-area finance chiefs, saying he is
a good candidate. </p>
<p>Faymann made the remarks to reporters yesterday in
Strasbourg, France. </p>
<p>Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, who has led
the group of euro-area finance ministers since 2005, is
preparing to step down. His successor is due to be designated on
Jan. 21. Faymann said the 17-nation euro area has yet to reach
an agreement on Juncker''s successor. </p>
<p>Dijsselbloem, a member of the Labor Party in the
Netherlands, was appointed Dutch finance minister in November as
part of Liberal Prime Minister Mark Rutte''s coalition government
following elections in September. </p>

Candillier, who rose in the ranks at JPMorgan''s cash equity
sales unit in Europe, was educated at France''s ESSEC Business
School, according to his LinkedIn profile. </p>
<p>He was a wonderful leader, colleague, mentor, and
friend, Patrick Burrowes, head of cash equities for Europe,
Middle East and Africa, and other senior colleagues at the New

Candillier passed away on Jan. 14, according to the memo. </p>
<p>His previous roles at JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by
assets, included running the French sales team for cash
equities. He was promoted to executive director in 2005 at
JPMorgan and was most recently a managing director at the bank. </p>
<p>Our thoughts are with his family during this most

<p>Iron ore will see another year of
exceptional prices before supplies start to outpace demand,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said today as it increased its forecast
for the seaborne commodity used in steel. </p>
<p>Prices will probably average $144 a dry ton in 2013, up
from $140 estimated previously, the bank said in an e-mailed
report. The ore may decline to $126 in 2014 before averaging $90
in 2015 and $80 in 2016, it said. </p>
<p>Iron ore surged 76 percent since dropping to a three-year
low in September on optimism China, the biggest buyer, is
recovering. JPMorgan Chase  Co. today increased its 2013
estimate to an average $130 from $110, while Deutsche Bank AG
said Jan. 8 prices may climb to $170 in the first half before
falling below $120. Rio Tinto Group, the second-biggest
exporter, posted yesterday better-than-expected output for the
fourth quarter and said it will press ahead with expansion. </p>
<p>The market is headed for a long period of significant
oversupply, but in our view this is still two years away, said
Goldman. We expect iron ore producers will see one last year
of exceptional prices and profit margins as the restocking
phase continues, supply starts to tighten and market sentiment
becomes more bullish, the report said. </p>
<p>Ore with 62 percent iron content delivered to the Chinese
port of Tianjin declined a fourth day, dropping 1.1 percent to
$152.90 yesterday, according to data from The Steel Index Ltd.
Prices climbed to $158.50 on Jan. 8, the most expensive since
Oct. 13, 2011 after rallying 39 percent in the three months
through December, the most since at least 2009. </p>
<h2>Unwilling Buyers </h2>
<p>The rally prompted Chinese steelmakers to use more domestic
supplies, a survey by Mysteel.com showed. Higher prices will
stop mills from rebuilding inventories, according to Hebei Iron
 Steel Group and Maanshan Iron  Steel (323) Co. The country''s
steelmakers are unwilling to buy imported ore at above $150, UBS
AG analyst Hubert Tang said yesterday. </p>
<p>Prices will drop from an average $145 in the first quarter
this year to $120 in the fourth quarter as new supply comes on
stream, Fraser Jamieson, an analyst at JPMorgan, said in a
report. The bounce in prices from September while China''s
production was stable suggests restocking, which we estimate
will come to an end around Chinese new year in early February
when activity typically slows, he said. </p>
<p>Imports last month climbed to a record 70.94 million tons
from 65.78 million tons in November, customs data show. </p>
<p>Strong demand growth in China has induced the development
of low-grade, high-cost operations that require relatively high
prices in order to remain viable, said Goldman. As long as
those mines remain in operation, we believe the seaborne price
will be supported at a high level. </p>
<p>The growth in the China''s steel output will accelerate to
4.9 percent in 2013, while inventory levels in the country''s
ports of 73 million tons are at their lowest since January 2011,
said Goldman. </p>

<p>A chemical additive to gasoline
meant to make it burn more thoroughly poses a long-term threat
of contamination in New Hampshire, a witness testified at the
trial of ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM) </p>
<p>Dr. Graham Fogg, a professor of hydrology at the University
of California, Davis, took the stand yesterday in state court in
Concord as the first witness in the state''s $816 million
lawsuit. New Hampshire sued oil companies for allegedly using
the additive, MTBE, while knowing its potential for groundwater
pollution as long as 29 years ago. </p>
<p>A problem like this is not going to disappear in a mere 6
years or 16 years or, I would say, 26 years, Fogg testified. </p>
<p>ExxonMobil and Citgo Petroleum Corp. said the additive,
meant to reduce air pollution, never caused illness to any
resident of New Hampshire. The trial, which began Jan. 14, pits
state environmental claims against assertions by companies that
they were complying with federal pollution rules. </p>
<p>Fogg testified the additive can zigzag through fractured
bedrock in unpredictable patterns and remain in groundwater
longer than other compounds. Fogg said the additive poses unique
risks to drinking water when leaked from underground storage
tanks, based on its chemical properties and the state''s geology. </p>
<p>The contaminant will tend to move along fractures that
are open and connected, he told jurors. Those fractures can
be quite complex. </p>
<h2>Creates Hazard </h2>
<p>As a result, MTBE creates a hazard that is difficult to
detect and equally difficult to clean up, Fogg said, showing
jurors slides that demonstrated the way MTBE can bleed into
water supplies. The state sought to counter claims by the oil
companies that MTBE has largely disappeared from the water
supply, as well as claims that the additive is safer than some
of the chemicals it displaces when mixed with gasoline. </p>
<p>Chemicals such as benzene don''t move very fast or very
far, Fogg said. They tend to stabilize because of
biodegradation.'''' </p>
<p>The state claimed in opening arguments that the oil
companies knew that if they added MTBE to gasoline it would
increase the risk and costs associated with contamination. </p>
<p>Exxon decided to disregard the recommendation of its own
employees and put MTBE in gasoline,'''' Jessica Grant, a lawyer
for the state, told jurors Jan. 14. In 1984, Exxon anticipated
that if it added MTBE to its gasoline, the number of
contamination incidents would triple. These incidents would take
longer to clean up and cost five times as much.'''' </p>
<p>Each cleanup at that time would have cost as much as $7
million, she said. </p>
<h2>Clean Air </h2>
<p>The companies said the federal Clean Air Act pre-empts the
state claims, and that by adding MTBE to gasoline, they were
complying with a U.S. mandate to supply cleaner-burning fuel. </p>
<p>Oil refiners began adding MTBE to gasoline in the 1970s to
replace lead. From 1995 to 2006, they increased the use of MTBE,
which boosts the fuel''s oxygen level. </p>
<p>We had no choice but to put oxygenates in our gasoline,''''
Nate Eimer, a lawyer for Citgo, said yesterday in his opening
statement. </p>
<p>The lawsuit is one of scores of cases involving the
additive methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE, filed since 2000
against oil refiners, fuel distributors and chemical makers. </p>
<p>The defendants sought to emphasize to jurors that no one
has been injured. </p>
<p>This is not a personal-injury case,'''' David Lender, a
lawyer for ExxonMobil, said in his opening statement. There''s
not any evidence that anyone ever got sick or got cancer from
MTBE.'''' </p>
<h2>No Gasoline </h2>
<p>Lender contended that there has been no gasoline sold in
New Hampshire containing MTBE for more than six years. </p>
<p>MTBE is produced by combining methanol, which is derived
from natural gas, and isobutylene, a byproduct of gasoline
refining. It can leak into the ground from gas stations, storage
tanks and auto junkyards. </p>
<p>It dissolves in water and doesn''t biodegrade, so it can be
carried with the water great distances from the site of a leak
or spill, according to court papers. The chemical is difficult
and expensive to find, treat and remove, according to filings. </p>
<p>According to New Hampshire case filings, MTBE can render
drinking water foul, putrid and unfit for human consumption.''''
The state said it petitioned the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency in 2001 to get out of its reformulated-gasoline program
because of awareness of MTBE''s harmful effects. The additive has
been banned in the state since January 2007. </p>
<h2>No Warning </h2>
<p>Despite knowing that MTBE posed a greater threat to
drinking water, they never posted a single warning,'''' Grant
said. </p>
<p>New Hampshire sued ExxonMobil and Citgo in 2003 along with
Shell Oil Co., Sunoco Inc., ConocoPhillips (COP), Irving Oil Ltd.,
Vitol SA and Hess Corp. All settled but Irving, Texas-based
ExxonMobil and Citgo, the Houston-based unit of Venezuela''s
state-owned oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA. Shell and
Sunoco agreed to pay $35 million in an accord announced in
November. </p>
<p>New Hampshire said it has identified 228 sites that will
require cleanup from contamination by MTBE, which according to
court filings can cause cancer in animals. Tests in 2005 and
2006 found MTBE in 9.1 percent of private wells throughout the
state, it said. </p>
<p>New Hampshire is seeking $816 million to cover cleanup and
monitoring costs, Grant said, and it will ask for damages from
ExxonMobil and Citgo based on their market shares of gasoline
sold in the state during the period covered by the lawsuit. </p>
<h2>Market Shares </h2>
<p>ExxonMobil''s market share was about 30 percent, she said.
That means the state will seek $245 million in damages from the
company. Citgo''s market share ranged from 3 percent to 8.7
percent. </p>
<p>Lender said yesterday that ExxonMobil''s market share in New
Hampshire was only 6.1 percent during that time. </p>
<p>The majority of the state''s damage claims are based on
computer models and projections, not on actual testing or
data, Claire Hassett, an ExxonMobil spokeswoman, said in an e-
mail. </p>
<p>The state said the oil companies could have used safer
additives, such as ethanol, and chose not to because MTBE is
inexpensive to produce. </p>
<p>If they had an alternative product to use and the
alternative is just as good and avoids serious risk to
consumers, there''s a strong argument the defendants have failed
the risk-utility standard and can be held liable, said Keith
Hylton, who teaches law and economics at Boston University
School of Law. </p>
<h2>Short Supply </h2>
<p>The oil companies said ethanol wasn''t in large enough
supply when an additive was being sought, and that it presents
its own environmental hazards. </p>
<p>ExxonMobil''s Hassett said the fault lies with whoever
spilled the chemically treated fuel. </p>
<p>MTBE contamination has been found in New Hampshire
because someone spilled gasoline in New Hampshire, not because
it was added to gasoline in a refinery in another state, she
said. The state should be suing parties responsible for
spilling gasoline. </p>
<p>The oil companies also said in court filings that a statute
of limitations should prevent the litigation from proceeding.
The state waited three years from the time it detected MTBE in
sites until it sued, they said. </p>
<p>New Hampshire Superior Court Judge Peter Fauver in August
rejected oil company motions seeking judgment without a trial
based on the arguments they raised. Those issues can be brought
up again for the jury''s consideration. </p>
<h2>Water Sources </h2>
<p>In January 2011, the New Hampshire Supreme Court denied a
motion by the companies to decide the case in their favor and
sent it back to the Superior Court. The state''s highest court
said New Hampshire could seek damages for contamination of
nonpublic sources of water, such as wells, and public sources. </p>
<p>The New Hampshire case had been moved to federal court in
New York, where other lawsuits have been consolidated for
pretrial evidence-gathering and motions before U.S. District
Judge Shira Scheindlin in Manhattan. In 2007, the U.S. Court of
Appeals in New York sent New Hampshire''s case back to the state
court there. </p>
<p>Scheindlin presided over the trial of New York City''s case
against ExxonMobil. In 2009, the jury in that case ordered
ExxonMobil to pay $104.7 million after finding it liable for
polluting wells in the city. ExxonMobil has appealed. </p>
<p>The cases consolidated in New York may be tried separately
in courts around the U.S. if settlements aren''t reached. In the
New York litigation, the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection filed its fourth amended complaint in June. No date
has been set for a trial, which would probably take place in
federal court in New Jersey. </p>
<p>The New Hampshire trial may take more than four months,
lawyers said. </p>
<p>The case is State of New Hampshire v. Hess Corp. (HES), 03-
C-0550, New Hampshire Superior Court, Merrimack County
(Concord). The federal cases are consolidated as In re MTBE
Products Liability Litigation, 00-11898, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the top arranger for renewable-energy stock offerings last year, is accelerating its funding efforts as it anticipates a rebound in an industry that''s slumped every year since 2009. </p> <p>Goldman overtook Morgan Stanley as the biggest lead manager for share offerings with three deals valued at $405.6 million, according to an annual ranking by Bloomberg New Energy Finance. </p> <p>The investment bank is backing renewable energy that it expects will gain favor in a global shift it says is inevitable. That''s why short-term volatility will be trumped by long-term gains as emerging technologies first become commonplace and then become indispensable, according to Stuart Bernstein, the Goldman partner overseeing its renewables unit. </p> <p>It feels like the worst is behind us, Bernstein, 49, said in an interview from his office in San Francisco. I''m a contrarian, so when everyone else is capitulating, I think it''s time to invest. </p> <p>Related:</p>

Global Clean-Energy Investment Fell 11% in 2012
<p>Goldman may boost its financing efforts this year as it seeks to meet a pledge made in May to invest and finance more than $40 billion in the industry in the next decade. Worldwide, more than $395 billion will be invested annually in renewable energy by 2020, he said. </p> <p>The company has made equity investments in solar developer BrightSource Energy Inc. (BRSE) and Horizon Wind Energy, which it sold to EDP-Energias de Portugal SA in 2007. </p> <h2>Goldman''s Deals </h2> <p>In September, Goldman underwrote a $225 million follow-on offering for the electric-car company Tesla Motors Ltd. (TSLA), along with IPOs for the rooftop photovoltaic developer SolarCity Corp. (SCTY) in December and the biofuel crop developer Ceres Inc. (CERE) in February. </p> <blockquote>Backing renewable energy isn''t just an investment strategy, it''s a necessity.<blockquote/><p>The industry is so important that when Goldman''s top executives visit the West Coast, up to Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, they don''t just visit our largest market-cap clients, they also spend time with our early stage clean-tech companies, Bernstein said. Clean energy is central to the Goldman Sachs franchise. </p> <p>The WilderHill New Energy Global Innovation Index (NEX), known as the NEX, slumped 5.5 percent last year, adding to 40 percent and 15 percent declines in the two previous years as investors pared their appetite for risk and governments slashed incentives for the industry. The Bloomberg Industries Large Solar Energy (BISOLAR) index of 17 companies fell 26 percent last year. </p> <h2>Renewable Rebound </h2> <p>Renewable shares have rebounded in the past few months as risk appetite returned. The NEX, which tracks 94 clean-energy stocks, has climbed more than 20 percent since Nov. 16, and the Large Solar index surged 81 percent. </p> <p>The market appears to have toughed in the fourth quarter of last year and several sectors have rallied meaningfully since then, Bernstein said. </p> <p>His comments coincide with a deal in the U.S. to extend a tax credit that supports wind-turbine installations. The policy was due to expire Dec. 31 and lobbying efforts to renew it received a boost after President Barack Obama''s re-election. </p> <p>The solar industry is also gaining, with the first consecutive monthly increases in polysilicon prices since January 2012. Polysilicon, the raw material in most solar panels, has risen 1.3 percent since Dec. 24 to $16.03 a kilogram on Jan. 7, according to data from New Energy Finance. </p> <p>Goldman has been investing in renewable energy since at least 2005, and has a long-term view, said Ethan Zindler, an analyst with New Energy Finance. </p> <h2>Credibility'' </h2> <p>They have considerable credibility within this sector, he said in by e-mail. They have seen the various ups and downs, so they have significant perspective as well. </p> <p>Goldman last took the top position in 2010, losing the slot to Morgan Stanley (MS) both in 2011 and in 2009. Morgan Stanley and UBS AG (UBSN) were co-lead managers on China Longyuan Power Group Corp.

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) led lending to
commodities companies for a third consecutive year even as
global financing to the industry fell to the lowest since 2010. </p>
<p>The biggest U.S. bank by assets arranged $44.1 billion of
loans, giving the New York-based company a 7.8 percent market
share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Bank of America
Corp. and Citigroup Inc. (C) came next. Three Canadian banks were in
the top 10, from one a year ago, as European lenders retreated. </p>
<p>Loans fell 23 percent to $568 billion last year after
mergers and acquisitions diminished to the lowest annual total
since 2010. Deals accelerated in the fourth quarter to the
highest in five years, including OAO Rosneft''s $55 billion
purchase of oil producer TNK-BP, as economic growth improved.
Stock markets are rising for a third consecutive month after
U.S. lawmakers reached a budget agreement. </p>
<p>Since there hasn''t been much MA for the past couple of
years, there is some pent-up demand, said Thomas Cassin, co-
head of investment-grade finance at JPMorgan in New York.
Having more clarity around the fiscal cliff, the debt ceiling
and just the direction of the economy in general will bring to
bear a bit more confidence and willingness to go out and look at
the MA. </p>
<h2>Raw Materials </h2>
<p>Commodities stagnated in 2012, with the Standard  Poor''s
GSCI gauge of 24 raw materials rising 0.3 percent, the least in
five years. The 140-member Bloomberg World Mining Index (BWMING) advanced
2.9 percent, lagging behind the 13 percent gain in the MSCI All-
Country World Index of equities. Natural-resource and energy
companies announced $610 billion of mergers and acquisitions,
8.3 percent less than in 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Bank of America, the second-biggest U.S. lender by assets,
arranged $30.8 billion of loans, and New York-based Citigroup
$30.6 billion, giving them both a 5.4 percent market share.
Combined lending by the top three banks fell 36 percent from a
year ago. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) overtook BNP Paribas SA (BNP) to take the
fourth slot after buying $9.5 billion of the French bank''s
energy loans in February. The Paris-based lender retreated 10
places in the rankings, as rival Societe Generale dropped to
19th from 15th. The figures as of yesterday reflect transactions
involving more than one bank and include credit lines, project
or term loans and trade finance. Wells Fargo''s total was $29.3
billion in loans, for a 5.2 percent share. </p>
<h2>Syndicated Loans </h2>
<p>Declines in syndicated loans in the commodity and energy
sector are consistent with trends in the broader market, said
Peter Hall, the global head of investment-grade loan syndicates
at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in London. The next big wave
of refinancing is due in two years, so 2014 and 2015 are going
to be much busier. </p>
<p>The average interest banks charge for loans to commodity
companies has risen to 325 basis points more than benchmark
lending rates, from 268 basis points in 2011, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. </p>
<p>Globally across all industries, banks charged 323.4 basis
points above lending rates compared with 282.3 basis points in
2011. Syndicated loans across industries declined 21 percent to
$2.99 trillion in 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<h2>Canadian Banks </h2>
<p>RBC Capital Markets, a unit of Royal Bank of Canada (RY), led
the advance by Canadian banks last year, taking fifth place with
$28.4 billion of loans, little changed from a year earlier. TD
Securities Inc., part of Toronto Dominion Bank, arranged almost
$19.9 billion for seventh place, and was one of only two in the
top 10 to increase overall lending, along with Barclays Plc. (BARC)
Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS), based in Toronto, oversaw $16 billion of
loans to take 10th place. Wells Fargo, Barclays, Nova Scotia and
BNP Paribas declined to comment for this story. </p>
<p>Resource financing will go up this year, said Burke Smyth, the co-head of Canadian credit origination at TD
Securities in Toronto. There is nothing to prevent it from
seeing an increase as commodity prices recover a bit, foreign
companies start to look at Canada and the U.S. starts to grow. </p>
<p>Canadian banks have been ranked as the world''s soundest for
five consecutive years by the Geneva-based World Economic Forum.
They are also buying more assets, including Bank of Nova
Scotia''s agreement in August to purchase ING Groep NV''s Canadian
unit for C$3.1 billion ($3.15 billion). </p>
<p>The banks are playing off the strength of their balance
sheets and expertise that we have in metals and mining, said
Mark Chandler, the head of Canadian syndicated and leveraged
finance at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto. Canada is home to
Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX), the largest gold miner, and Potash Corp. of
Saskatchewan Inc., the biggest fertilizer producer. Commodities
are about half of Canada''s exports, government figures show. </p>
<h2>Mergers Data </h2>
<p>Natural-resource and energy companies announced $202.8
billion of mergers and acquisitions in the fourth quarter,
accounting for 33 percent of the annual total, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Rosneft raised $16.8 billion in loans last month
to finance the TNK-BP acquisition, to become the world''s largest
publicly-traded crude-oil producer. </p>
<p>Loans to commodity companies in North America declined 24
percent to $317.9 billion while those in Europe, Middle East and
Africa tumbled 31 percent to $140.9 billion, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. There was an 8.7 percent drop in the Central
Asia and Pacific Rim region to $92.7 billion. </p>
<h2>Key Event'' </h2>
<p>A key event in 2012 was the return to stability of
funding to the commodity finance market, even if the overall
financing market volumes are down due to the pullback in metals
prices and slower global economic growth, said Federico Turegano, the global head of natural resources and energy
finance at Societe Generale in Paris. The big question for
2013 will be how fast the Asian markets return to purchasing
commodities, particularly China on the metals side. </p>
<p>China is the biggest consumer of everything from copper to
cotton to coal and it probably returned to faster economic
growth in the final three months of 2012, having slowed for
seven consecutive quarters, the mean of 35 economist estimates
compiled by Bloomberg show. Chinese banks probably will lend
more this year, with a focus on financing the nation''s commodity
cargoes, said Simon Tyler, the head of corporate banking at
China Construction Bank Ltd. in London. </p>
<p>The Chinese banks are starting to compete more in the
loans space, he said. This year there will be much more. We
are expanding from a relatively low base, so we are not going to
be a major player yet but we will be doing a lot more. </p>
<p>Any return of funding won''t be fully reflected in
syndicated loans, said Turegano of Societe Generale. A huge
part of the commodity finance business is done on an uncommitted
bilateral basis, therefore undisclosed. </p>
<h2>Higher Prices </h2>
<p>Lending may increase this year should commodity costs
rebound. A Bloomberg survey of 131 analysts, traders and
investors last month predicted higher prices across industrial
and precious metals and agriculture. Brent crude will trade
above $100 a barrel for a third consecutive year, according to
the median of 30 estimates compiled in December. It traded at
$111.09 a barrel today. </p>
<p>The world needs commodities, said David Basra, the head
of debt financing for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at
Citigroup in London. We have a growing global population, we
have growth in the emerging markets and that all puts demand on
natural resources. The requirement for liquidity and funding
remains high. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
securities firm that set a Wall Street compensation record in
2007, is now demonstrating how little it can pay. </p>
<p>The portion of revenue allotted for salaries, bonuses,
stock awards and benefits was 38 percent in 2012, down from 42
percent a year earlier and the lowest since 2009, the company
said yesterday in a statement. The move helped the bank post a
fourth-quarter profit that beat analysts'' estimates and pushed
return on equity to 10.7 percent for the year, up from 3.7
percent in 2011. The stock climbed the most in 10 months. </p>
<p>It''s a better time to be an investor than when bonuses
are becoming ridiculous, said Michael Vogelzang, chief
investment officer at Boston Advisors LLC, which manages $2.4
billion including Goldman Sachs shares. You''re seeing a
massive amount of overcapacity in the business and it''s
continuing to push down the price of labor. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs still may be one of few Wall Street firms
that pay employees more for 2012 because revenue surged 19
percent and it cut staff by 3 percent. JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the
biggest U.S. bank by assets, cut total compensation expense at
its corporate and investment bank 3 percent last year as revenue
at that division rose 1 percent. The pay expense was 33 percent
of revenue for the year, down from 34 percent in 2011. </p>
<h2>Operating Leverage'' </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley, which is eliminating 1,600 jobs, will defer
100 percent of bonuses for some senior bankers and traders over
three years as it reins in costs, a person briefed on the matter
said earlier this week. Deutsche Bank AG is weighing 2012 bonus
cuts of as much as 20 percent for investment bankers in Europe,
while those in New York will see smaller declines, four people
briefed on the matter said this week. </p>
<p>Anton Schutz, president of Rochester, New York-based Mendon
Capital Advisors, said control of expenses, which rose 1 percent
during 2012 even as revenue climbed 19 percent, is something
Goldman Sachs investors have craved. </p>
<p>One of the things we''ve been looking for in this space
for a long time is operating leverage, said Schutz, whose firm
has about $150 million under management including Goldman Sachs
stock. That''s exciting for shareholders. I don''t think it''s so
good for employees unless they own a lot of stock. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs rose 1.7 percent to $143.50 by 10:52
a.m. in German trading after climbing 4.1 percent yesterday in
New York to $141.09, the biggest advance since March. The shares
have gained 11 percent this year on top of a 41 percent advance
in 2011. </p>
<h2>Market Rebound </h2>
<p>The bank derived about 70 percent of its revenue last year
from investments with the firm''s own money or trading with
clients. The performance of those businesses is often tied to
the rise or fall of asset prices. </p>
<p>A stock-market rebound and a $500 million profit from
selling a hedge-fund-administration unit helped revenue recover
from the lowest first half since 2005 as the company booked its
first annual revenue gain in three years. Revenue in Investing 
Lending, the segment that includes the firm''s stakes in stocks,
bonds, real estate, private equity and hedge funds, almost
tripled last year to $5.89 billion from $2.14 billion. </p>
<p>Ed Najarian, an analyst at International Strategy 
Investment Group LLC, said he raised his estimates for Goldman
Sachs''s earnings per share through 2015 because he expects the
annual compensation ratio to hold below 40 percent. He kept a
neutral rating on the stock because he expects gains from
private-equity and debt holdings to be lower this year and
predicts regulations will limit trading revenue, according to a
research note yesterday. </p>
<h2>Reinsurance Business </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs said yesterday that $1.08 billion of the
firm''s $8.2 billion of equity trading revenue was from the
bank''s reinsurance business, marking the first time that the
company disclosed revenue from that segment. The firm is
considering selling a majority stake in that unit, said Harvey M. Schwartz, who will replace Chief Financial Officer David A. Viniar, 57, at the end of this month. </p>
<p>The bank still doesn''t have enough information on proposed
regulatory changes to give a target for future return on equity,
Schwartz, 48, said on a conference call with investors. The 10.7
percent figure for 2012 was not particularly aspirational,
he said. We''d like to do better. </p>
<p>Central bank policies have boosted asset prices, and that''s
likely to continue to contribute to higher profits at firms like
Goldman Sachs, said Boston Advisors'' Vogelzang. He said he
expects the bank''s return on equity to reach the mid-teens. </p>
<p>The way we view the ROE target is this is a very cyclical
business, highly dependent on capital markets, Vogelzang said.
Our outlook for particularly the U.S. equity markets is quite
strong, and they''re going to be levered to that. </p>
<h2>Better Balance </h2>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 58, has
undertaken a $1.9 billion expense-reduction effort since mid-
2011. That helped reduce the compensation ratio, which was part
of an effort to strike a better balance between rewarding
employees and shareholders, Schwartz told analysts. </p>
<p>This year we hope we got the balance right, he said. </p>
<p>The bank employed 32,400 people as of Dec. 31, 900 fewer
than the end of 2011. It allocated $12.9 billion for
compensation, up from $12.2 billion in 2011. That averages
$399,506 per employee. While that''s up from $367,057 in 2011,
it''s 40 percent less than the $661,490 average for 2007. </p>
<p>That''s a reflection of how much the market has changed,
Vogelzang said. </p>
<p>It''s a very interesting case study in the supply-demand
equation for high wage-earning, white-collar workers, he said.
We''ve certainly seen it in manufacturing, we''ve seen it in
lower-level services, but we''re now seeing it at places like
Goldman and Morgan Stanley. (MS) </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, plans to consolidate its electronic trading
system for corporate bonds with other asset classes in the early
part of this year as lenders seek to adapt to regulatory changes
and reduce costs. </p>
<p>We''re trying to figure out how our customers would like
to execute, Scott Wacker, the London-based head of FX Sales
EMEA at JPMorgan, said today in a telephone interview. Our
target is the end of the first quarter, maybe into the second
quarter that we intend to start to offer the ability to execute
online for fixed-income products. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the most-active underwriter of dollar-denominated
debt, is beginning the effort as Wall Street''s biggest banks
have pared their corporate-bond inventories by 76 percent since
the 2007 peak with new risk-curbing regulations forcing them to
reduce their roles as market makers. Firms are capitulating to
the growing use of electronic systems to broker bonds that
traditionally were bought and sold over the counter with traders
as middlemen. </p>
<p>Clients are already using the web-based platform, JP Morgan
Markets, for purposes including trading currencies and commodity
futures and accessing research, according to Wacker. </p>
<p>Last week, Citigroup Inc., the third-biggest U.S. bank by
assets, announced the start of an electronic bond-trading
service. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. spent a year developing an
electronic trading system for corporate bonds called GSessions
that started operating in 2012. </p>
<p>The profitability of Wall Street firms is being challenged
by regulations requiring that they hold more capital as a buffer
against potential losses from assets such as corporate debt. </p>
<p>Holdings of company debt at the 21 primary dealers that
trade with the Federal Reserve shrank 74 percent to $56.4
billion as of Jan. 9 from the end of 2007, according to the
Federal Reserve. </p>

<p>Robert Iger, chairman and chief
executive officer of Walt Disney Co. (DIS), collected $40.2 million in
total compensation last fiscal year, based on regulatory
reporting rules, a 20 percent increase. </p>
<p>Iger''s pay included $2.5 million in salary, $9.53 million
in stock awards, $7.75 million in option awards and a bonus of
$16.5 million, according a regulatory filing today. A change in
the value of his pension plan and other compensation added
almost $4 million more. </p>
<p>The increase came in a fiscal year when shares of Burbank,
California-based Disney returned 76 percent including dividends,
compared with 30 percent for the SP 500 index. Iger, 61, also
took on the added role of chairman. Walt Disney''s profit rose 18
percent to $5.68 billion in the year ended Sept. 30. </p>
<p>Disney, the world''s largest entertainment company, will
hold its annual meeting March 6 in Phoenix. </p>
<p>At last year''s meeting 57 percent of shareholders supported
the company''s executive pay plan, down from 77 percent the year
before. In today''s filing, Disney said the vote fell below our
expectations. </p>
<p>The company reconfigured its bonus terms after management
and the chairwoman of the compensation committee met with the
largest shareholders, according to the filing. </p>
<p>While the previous plan allowed management to collect 100
percent of their bonuses even if shareholder returns were weak,
the new plan bases awards equally on stock performance and
earnings, according to the filing. The company said 92 percent
of Iger''s targeted compensation is performance based. </p>
<p>Connecticut Retirement Plans  Trust Funds is proposing at
the annual meeting that investors vote to split the chairman and
CEO roles in the future, according to today''s filing. Disney''s
board opposes that plan. </p>
<p>Disney fell 0.1 percent to $52.34 at the close in New York.
It has gained 5.1 percent this year. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley, owner of the world''s
biggest brokerage, rose the most in seven months after earnings
from that business more than doubled and the firm reached
profit-margin targets six months ahead of schedule. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley surged 7.9 percent to $22.38 at 4:15 p.m. in
New York, the biggest gain since June 6. The shares closed at
the highest level since July 27, 2011. </p>
<p>The brokerage''s improved profitability strengthens Chief
Executive Officer James Gorman''s plan to boost returns as he
requests regulatory approval to buy Citigroup Inc.''s remaining
35 percent stake in the business. Earnings at the brokerage, run
by Greg Fleming, increased to $385 million in the fourth quarter
and the pretax profit margin rose to 17 percent from 7 percent a
year earlier. </p>
<p>We''re seeing the margins move up on wealth management,
that''s the encouraging thing, Brad Hintz, an analyst at
Sanford C. Bernstein  Co., said in a Bloomberg Radio interview.
If he''s getting a 17 percent pretax margin in retail without
the flow, this implies that when retail comes back, that''s when
the margins really pop. </p>
<p>Fleming, 49, previously vowed to raise his unit''s pretax
margin to the mid-teens by the middle of this year, and said
last month that the increase can be obtained through cost
cutting as integration expenses decline. The figure was 13
percent in the third quarter, excluding a one-time charge. </p>

<p>LEG Immobilien AG, the apartment
landlord owned by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), plans to raise as
much as 1.4 billion euros ($1.9 billion) in an initial public
offering poised to be the largest by a German property company. </p>
<p>LEG will sell as many as 30.5 million shares for 41 euros
to 47 euros each, the Dusseldorf-based company said in a
statement today. That''s 57.5 percent of LEG''s shares. The stock
will begin trading in Frankfurt on Feb. 1. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which bought the company for about 3.5
billion euros including debt in 2008, is seeking to profit from
a boom in German residential real estate. The FTSE EPRA/Nareit
index of German property stocks has gained 38 percent in the
past 12 months. </p>
<p>An investment in LEG shares offers the opportunity to
invest in a large pure-play residential property company with
high growth, LEG Chief Executive Officer Thomas Hegel said in
the statement. In order to achieve future growth, we
constantly screen the market for potential acquisitions. </p>
<p>LEG owns 91,000 apartments in North Rhine-Westphalia,
Germany''s most populous state. Goldman Sachs'' Whitehall Street
Real Estate fund holds about 95 percent of the company. Perry
Capital owns the rest. </p>
<p>The offer period for the IPO will run from Jan. 21 to Jan.
31. Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) will be lead managers. </p>
<h2>Guy Hands </h2>
<p>Deutsche Annington Immobilien AG, Germany''s largest owner
of apartments, also plans an IPO this year. Annington,
controlled by Guy Hands'' Terra Firma Capital Partners Ltd., has
about 186,000 homes. </p>
<p>After the share sale, LEG will be Germany''s second-largest
publicly traded residential landlord by properties with 91,000
apartments. The biggest is Gagfah SA (GFJ), controlled by Fortress
Investment Group LLC (FIG), which has about 145,000 apartments. </p>
<p>LEG''s profit from its main business of renting apartments
was 243 million euros in 2011 and its funds from operations were
111.8 million euros, according to its last annual report. FFO
measures a property company''s ability to generate cash. </p>
<p>By comparison, Gagfah generated a rental profit of 419.6
million euros in 2011 and its FFO was 159.5 million euros,
according to its annual report. </p>
<h2>Active Investor </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs is one of the most active foreign investors

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the world''s
biggest brokerage, had de minimis commodities revenue in the
fourth quarter. </p>
<p>Fourth-quarter revenue from fixed-income and commodities
sales and trading was $811 million, compared with a $493 million
loss a year earlier, the New York-based company said today.
Commodities revenue was de minimis, it said on a conference
call with Chief Executive Officer James Gorman and Chief
Financial Officer Ruth Porat. </p>
<p>Commodities experienced meaningfully lower revenue in a
difficult market, Porat said on the call. </p>
<p>Commodities value-at-risk, a measure of how much the bank
estimates it might lose in a single day, was $22 million, the
same as in the third quarter, and down from $26 million a year
earlier, Morgan Stanley said on its website. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said on Jan. 16 its net revenue in
commodities were significantly lower in the fourth quarter.
Its commodities value at risk was $20 million, down from $26
million a year earlier, it said on its website. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which previously
dominated commodities trading among Wall Street banks, have lost
ground to JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Barclays Plc, according to a
Greenwich Associates survey published in March. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s $6.2 billion
trading loss last year is little more than a fading memory for
bondholders who awarded the lender its cheapest U.S. borrowing
costs ever at a debt sale yesterday. </p>
<p>The largest U.S. bank by assets sold $6 billion of
securities, including $2.75 billion of 10-year notes with an
unprecedented 3.2 percent coupon, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The extra yield investors demanded to hold those
securities rather than government debt was 56 basis points
tighter than where average comparable JPMorgan spreads traded
before the scandal came to light in April. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s bond offering came a day after it reported a
record profit for the third straight year even after posting the
trading gaffe at the hands of an employee known as the London
Whale. Aided by rising loan demand in a recovering economy, the
New York-based bank boosted mortgage fees and related revenue
almost threefold to $2.03 billion in the fourth quarter. The
trading losses are close to being a non-issue Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said. </p>
<p>Having the capacity to brush away a whale-sized problem
and still be able to generate such significant earnings should
make a bondholder sleep well at night, Joel Levington,
managing director of corporate credit for Brookfield Investment
Management Inc. in New York, which manages $150 billion, said in
an e-mail. The lender should generate north of $21 billion in
profit annually for the next few years. That profile is highly
unlikely to experience near-term default concerns. </p>
<h2>Record Coupon </h2>
<p>JPMorgan''s three-part debt sale was its biggest in the U.S.
since the lender issued $7.2 billion of bonds in April 2011,
Bloomberg data show. The bank sold $1.25 billion of five-year
notes at its record low coupon of 1.8 percent to yield 103 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, and $2 billion of
five-year, floating-rate bonds at 90 basis points more than the
London interbank offered rate. The 10-year portion had a spread
of 133 basis points. </p>
<p>Average spreads on 10-year, A rated JPMorgan bonds plunged
to 140 basis points Jan. 16, down from 243 basis points on May
18, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data, a
week after Fitch Ratings cut the bank''s debt as a result of the
trading loss. That compares with 189 basis points on March 26,
before reports of the credit-derivative trades surfaced. </p>
<p>Tasha Pelio, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan in New York,
declined to comment. </p>
<h2>Solid Position'' </h2>
<p>The bank earned $21.3 billion in net income last year on
improving credit quality, according to Kathleen Shanley, a bond
analyst at New York-based researcher Gimme Credit LLC. A
provision for credit losses declined by more than half to $3.4
billion from $7.6 billion in 2011, Shanley wrote yesterday in a
report. It''s the third straight year the lender has earned at
least $15 billion in profit. </p>
<p>They continue to be a very solid position for a lot of
fixed-income investors, Marc Pinto, head of corporate bond
strategy at Susquehanna International Group LLP, said in a
telephone interview from New York. They continue to perform
extremely well. </p>
<p>JPMorgan first disclosed the trading losses on May 10,
after Dimon initially dismissed concern as a tempest in a
teapot the month before. London-based trader Bruno Iksil, who
worked in the chief investment office, built up positions in
credit derivatives so large he was nicknamed the London Whale.
The bank released a 129-page report Jan. 16 that blamed managers
for roles in failing to halt the loss, as well as an error
prone risk-modeling system. </p>
<h2>Biggest Loss </h2>
<p>The bank''s shares fell 9.3 percent May 11, the biggest drop
in nine months, after JPMorgan estimated its trading losses at
$2 billion. Fitch reduced the firm''s long-term default rating to
A+ from AA- the same day, following the close of trading. </p>
<p>The cost to protect JPMorgan debt from losses for five
years climbed 21 basis points to 132.5 basis points after the
disclosure, Bloomberg prices show. Those credit-default swaps
traded at 78.5 basis points at 11:26 a.m. in New York. </p>
<p>CDS prices typically fall when investor confidence improves
and rise when it deteriorates. A basis point equals $1,000
annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt. </p>
<p>We''re five years on from the beginning of the financial
crisis and investors have now recognized that many banks have
increased their capital dramatically, non-performing loans have
come down or their asset quality has improved dramatically,
Pinto said. They''re much more comfortable investing today in
bank paper. </p>
<h2>Bank Spreads </h2>
<p>The lender set aside $656 million in provisions against
future mortgage loan losses, compared with an average estimate
by analysts of about $1.5 billion, according to a Jan. 16
earnings statement. Mortgage fees and related revenue increased
to $2.03 billion in the fourth quarter from $723 million a year
earlier as the unemployment rate fell to 7.8 percent, indicating
a strengthening economy. </p>
<p>The gap between spreads on investment-grade bank bonds and
the broader high-grade market reached the narrowest level in
more than five years, when relative yields on bank debt dropped
to 154 basis points, or 9 basis points more than corporates, on
Jan. 7, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. </p>
<p>Everything is driven by what the Fed is doing, said Pri de Silva, a bank analyst at New York-based CreditSights Inc.,
Banks are opportunistically locking in the lower rates. </p>
<p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has held interest rates near
record lows for an unprecedented fifth straight year, pushing
investors to riskier assets in the search for yield. </p>
<p>The CIO fiasco blemished JPMorgan''s previously stellar
reputation as a savvy risk control manager, wrote Gimme
Credit''s Shanley, who rates the bank''s debt a buy. Jamie Dimon
is no doubt glad to bid farewell to the year of the London
Whale. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) is seeking Federal
Reserve approval to buy the remaining 35 percent of its
brokerage joint venture with Citigroup Inc. (C) this year. </p>
<p>The company didn''t ask for any additional return of capital
to shareholders, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said today
in an interview. The firm had a 9.5 percent Tier 1 common ratio
under Basel III rules as of Dec. 31, above its 8.5 percent
requirement under guidelines set out by Financial Stability
Board last year, she said. </p>
<p>There''s a time for returning capital, but given the
importance of the wealth management joint venture, that''s our
first priority, said Porat, 55. Longer-term, we are focused
on returning capital to shareholders, whether in the form of
share repurchases or dividends. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, 54, has already set a
price with Citigroup to purchase the remainder of the brokerage
venture, which was created in 2009. Morgan Stanley will pay $4.7
billion for the last piece, and that stake will use an
additional $400 million of capital, the firm said in a
presentation today. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley will earn about $400 million in 2013 from
buying the rest of the brokerage, as the company eliminates non-
controlling interest payments to Citigroup and benefits from
more retail orders and deposits, it said. </p>
<p>The bank''s wealth-management business had a pretax margin
of 17 percent in the fourth quarter, the highest since the joint
venture was formed and ahead of its goal of mid-teens by the
middle of this year. The unit, which had $3.46 billion in
revenue, benefited from lower integration expenses and a lower-
than-normal compensation rate, Porat said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley had $460 billion of Basel III risk-weighted
assets, Porat said. That''s down from $500 billion at the end of
June. The firm today accelerated its goals for cutting RWAs in
its fixed-income business, saying it already reached $280
billion, its previous target for the end of 2013. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), the bank that''s
deferring all bonuses for top earners, set aside $6.65 billion
in 2012 to pay investment-bank employees, a 7.6 percent decline
from a year earlier. </p>
<p>The ratio of compensation to revenue in the unit fell to 44
percent from 53 percent in 2011, when excluding accounting gains
and losses related to the firm''s debt prices, according to
figures posted today on the company''s website. The bank doesn''t
disclose how many people work in the division. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley joins Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and JPMorgan
Chase  Co.''s corporate and investment bank in setting aside a
smaller portion of revenue for pay as the world''s biggest banks
seek to pare costs. New York-based Morgan Stanley is cutting
1,600 jobs in its investment bank, a person with direct
knowledge of the matter said last week. </p>
<p>We have to balance, as everybody does, between what our
shareholders are getting and what we are paying ourselves,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, 54, said in
an interview with CNBC today. We had to adjust to the
environment we are in right now. </p>
<p>The firm also is deferring all pay for employees who have
both total pay of more than $350,000 and bonuses of at least
$50,000, a person briefed on the matter said earlier this week. </p>
<h2>Most Unaffected </h2>
<p>About 80 percent of employees won''t be affected by the
deferral plan after the firm raised the compensation threshold,
Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said today in an interview.
Deferral costs in future years will continue to decline after
Gorman said they peaked in 2011, she said. </p>
<p>We''re not adding to deferrals in outer years, it''s on a
declining scope, said Porat, 55. The firm has more flexibility
after cutting about 6,000 positions, she said. </p>
<p>Compensation expenses, which include salaries, bonuses,
benefits and the cost of deferred pay, totaled $15.6 billion
companywide for the year, down 4.4 percent. Morgan Stanley has
55,358 employees after the latest cuts, the bank said in a
presentation today. That''s down 10 percent from the end of 2011. </p>
<p>Companywide compensation, the largest expense, was enough
to pay each Morgan Stanley employee $273,777 in 2012, according
to figures released today. That compares with an average of
$265,378 for each of the 61,546 people who worked at the firm at
the end of 2011. </p>
<h2>Brokerage Division </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s brokerage division, which employed 16,780
financial advisers at the end of December, set aside $8.13
billion for pay, down 1.9 percent from a year earlier. The
unit''s compensation cost, which is set by a fixed grid for some
employees, was 60 percent of the division''s revenue, down from
62 percent last year. </p>
<p>JPMorgan (JPM)''s corporate and investment bank cut employee
compensation costs 3 percent in 2012 to $11.3 billion as the
division generated 1 percent more revenue. The expense was
enough to give each of the unit''s 52,151 employees $216,928 on
average. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs set aside $12.9 billion to pay employees in
2012, up 6 percent from 2011 as revenue climbed 19 percent. The
cost amounted to 38 percent of revenue, compared with 42 percent
a year earlier. The pay expense averages $399,506 per employee,
up from $367,057 in 2011. </p>
<p>Wall Street firms typically reserve a portion of revenue
throughout the year for employees. Average pay per worker
doesn''t reflect the amount of money employees actually receive.
Top executives and revenue producers sometimes get multimillion-
dollar awards, while clerical workers are paid smaller salaries. </p>

<p>Gold may climb over the next three
months as U.S. lawmakers attempt to tackle the country''s debt
ceiling and the world''s largest economy slows, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. said, advising investors to place bets on advances. </p>
<p>We see current prices as a good entry point to re-
establish fresh longs, analysts Damien Courvalin and Alec Phillips wrote in a Jan. 18 report. The bank reiterated a three-
month target of $1,825 an ounce, as well as a forecast for
prices to weaken in the second half as the U.S. economy
rebounds. </p>
<p>Gold fell 5.5 percent last quarter, the worst performance
since 2008, on expectations for a recovery and potential end to
central bank stimulus in the U.S. An advance to $1,825 would be
consistent with rallies into debt-ceiling decisions, the
analysts wrote. Since 1960, Congress has raised or revised the
debt limit 79 times, according to the Treasury Department. </p>
<p>The uncertainty associated with these issues, combined
with our economists'' forecast for weak U.S. GDP growth in the
first half of 2013 following the negative impact of higher taxes
will push gold to the three-month target, they wrote. </p>
<p>Gold, which rallied for a 12th year in 2012, traded at
$1,687.90 an ounce on the Comex at 9:49 a.m. in New York.
Holdings in exchange-traded products reached a record last
month, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Most-active prices last
traded above $1,825 an ounce in September 2011. </p>
<h2>Borrowing Limit </h2>
<p>The Treasury has said the U.S. will exceed its $16.4
trillion borrowing authority sometime from mid-February to early
March. Financing for government agencies is set to lapse March
27, and lawmakers must pass new spending or cause a shutdown.
Also in March, Congress will confront the $110 billion in
automatic spending cuts, half from defense, that were postponed
in a Jan. 1 tax deal. </p>
<p>Goldman restated its outlook for lower prices in the second
half of this year, a call echoed by Credit Suisse Group AG and
Allan Hochreiter(Pty) Ltd., as the U.S. recovers. As growth
improves, prices will likely decline even with continued central
bank and exchange-traded fund demand, Goldman said. </p>
<p>Gold''s bull market is over, Allan Hochreiter Chief
Executive Officer Rene Hochreiter, the top forecaster in the
London Bullion Market Association''s 2012 poll, said this month.
The metal''s appeal is set to diminish as so-called fear trades
fade, according to Credit Suisse''s Tom Kendall, head of
precious-metals research and the most accurate precious-metals
forecaster in the past eight quarters tracked by Bloomberg. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank by assets, named Kyril Courboin head of France,
replacing Isabelle Seillier, who is becoming head of the firm''s
financial institutions group for Europe, the Middle East and
Africa. </p>
<p>Courboin, who joined JPMorgan in 1990 and currently heads
the financial institutions team in Europe, will report jointly
to Emilio Saracho, deputy chief executive officer of EMEA, and
Viswas Raghavan, head of banking for the region, according to an
internal memorandum to employees. The contents of the document
were confirmed by a spokeswoman for the lender today. </p>
<p>Seillier, who joined the firm in 1993 and has been in
charge of France since 2008, will be responsible for covering
banks and other clients in the financial-services industry in
the region. She will report to Raghavan. </p>
<p>JPMorgan combined its investment bank with the firm''s
corporate bank and treasury and securities-services units last
year, and named Raghavan head of banking for Europe as part of a
revamp. Fourth-quarter revenue at the newly combined corporate
and investment bank rose 21 percent to $7.6 billion, New York-
based JPMorgan said last week, the first time it reported
results of the entire group. </p>
<p>Courboin''s knowledge of the financial sector is second to
none, and his international profile will help further develop
our business in France, Raghavan said. Isabelle has
positioned JPMorgan as a top international bank in France, which
will prove invaluable in her new regional role. </p>
<p>Courboin has worked on deals including Credit Agricole SA''s
2003 acquisition of Credit Lyonnais and the privatization of
Credit Industriel et Commercial. Seillier served as head of
investment banking activities for France from 2005 to 2008. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), Standard Chartered (STAN)
Plc and Credit Agricole SA are selling the most structured notes
in two years where returns are linked to the U.S. dollar''s
relationship to China''s yuan and the Japanese yen. </p>
<p>The banks sold $93.6 million of notes with so-called
digital coupons this month, accounting for the entire market and
following no issuance in December, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That''s the most since $134 million of sales in
January 2011. </p>
<p>Digital coupons, also known as all-or-nothing interest
payments because they''re payable only if certain conditions are
met, are popular with investors because they can generate higher
returns. Volatility in China''s currency is close to the lowest
in 10 years and correlation between currencies such as the
Australian and Taiwanese dollars is near the closest to zero in
five years, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Digital coupons offer a payout that is linked to a
straightforward view of whether a currency will appreciate or
depreciate against another, said David Naville, head of foreign-exchange structuring for the Asia-Pacific region at Barclays Plc
in Hong Kong. If the view is right, the coupon is paid.
Otherwise it''s not. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest U.S. bank by assets,
raised 346.4 million yuan ($55.7 million) from one-year notes
tied to the Chinese currency this month, Bloomberg data show.
The securities pay coupons as high as 8.6 percent as long as the
yuan appreciates by as much as 1 percent or more in Hong Kong''s
offshore market, or else nothing. Noel Cheung, a spokeswoman for
the bank in Hong Kong, declined to comment on the bank''s notes. </p>
<h2>Standard Chartered </h2>
<p>Standard Chartered sold 101.5 million yuan of one-year
notes on Jan. 7 that pay 6 percent if the offshore yuan is less
than or equal to 6.24 per dollar. If it ends above that level,
investors will be paid 0.25 percent, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Credit Agricole (ACA) raised $21.5 million from two 10-year
offerings this month, including an $11 million note that pays
6.5 percent as long as the Australian dollar is worth $0.86 or
more U.S. dollars and the greenback can buy 27.5 or more of
Taiwan''s currency. The bank also sold a $10.5 million note that
profits if the dollar gains against the yen and remains at or
below 6.37 yuan, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<h2>High Coupons </h2>
<p>France''s third-largest lender, which is rated A2 by Moody''s
Investors Service and A by Standard  Poor''s, offered the notes
with coupons that can be 3.5 percentage points above where
European banks with a Bloomberg composite rating between A- and
A+ can raise funding in dollars for 10 years, according to
Bloomberg Valuation data. The bank was able to create the notes
with high coupons because the correlation between the currency
pairs is low, said Christine Lefort, Paris-based global head of
foreign-exchange and precious metals research and development. </p>
<p>Baskets that contain components that are less correlated to
each other are less volatile, making options embedded in the
structured notes cheaper to buy. </p>
<p>Daily price moves in the exchange rate between the U.S. and
Australian currencies are .09 percent correlated with those in
the rate between the U.S. and Taiwanese dollars, Bloomberg data
show. A correlation of 1 indicates two prices move exactly
together. </p>
<p>Structured notes package debt with derivatives to offer
customized bets to investors while earning fees and raising
money. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the bank
that generates the most revenue from equity trading worldwide,
named R. Martin Chavez, one of the leaders of that business, to
its management committee. </p>
<p>Goldman announced Chavez''s appointment in an internal memo
from Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and President
Gary D. Cohn that was obtained by Bloomberg News. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the New York-based firm, confirmed the
contents of the memo. Chavez runs the equity-trading business
with Michael D. Daffey and Paul M. Russo. </p>
<p>Chavez, 48, is a director of the International Swaps and
Derivatives Association and oversees Goldman Sachs''s principal
strategic investments group, which invests in exchanges and
other trading facilities. He has co-founded technology companies
Quorum Software Systems and Kiodex, according to the memo. </p>
<p>Marty''s previous work in the technology industry, his
cross-divisional experience and his deep insight into regulatory
reform, market structure and operational infrastructure will add
a unique perspective to the management committee, Blankfein
and Cohn wrote in the memo. This will be particularly valuable
as our sales and trading businesses, and the ways in which our
clients transact, continue to evolve. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs generated $8.2 billion of revenue from equity
trading, almost $3 billion more than its closest U.S.
competitor, Morgan Stanley. Goldman disclosed last week that
$1.08 billion of that revenue came from its reinsurance
business, which it is considering selling. </p>
<p>The management committee will remain at 30 members once
David Viniar, the firm''s chief financial officer until the end
of this month, departs and joins the board of directors. Reuters
reported the appointment earlier today. </p>

<p>ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM)  said in a trial
over claims it polluted New Hampshire''s groundwater with a
gasoline additive that the state''s own research indicates the
chemical''s level will decrease over time without having to be
cleaned up. </p>
<p>The oil company today concluded its cross-examination of
the state''s chief witness, Graham Fogg, a professor of
hydrology, in the state court trial in Concord. Fogg responded
by saying ExxonMobil''s lawyer was selecting isolated pieces of
information and taking them out of context in his questioning.
The trial began Jan. 14. </p>
<p>ExxonMobil is a defendant in the state''s $816 million
lawsuit on claims the oil companies knew that the chemical MTBE,
or methyl tertiary butyl ether, would contaminate groundwater. </p>
<p>New Hampshire''s suit is one of scores over MTBE against
refiners, fuel distributors and chemical makers. New Hampshire
Superior Court Judge Peter Fauver agreed last week to excuse
another defendant in this case, Citgo Petroleum Corp., while the
company and the state work to complete a settlement. </p>
<p>The oil company''s lawyer was trying to show the jury that
Fogg''s own research indicated that the amount of MTBE in the
groundwater would naturally decline to levels that aren''t
hazardous. Fogg replied that while that was true of some wells,
others would have a higher concentration of the additive. </p>
<p>Fogg testified last week that about 2 percent of the
state''s private wells are polluted with hazardous levels of
MTBE, determined by the state to be 13 million parts per
billion. </p>
<h2>Falling Levels </h2>
<p>In six years you were projecting that 40 percent of the
private wells that you estimate were above 13 million parts per
billion would already be down to 2 million parts per billion,
correct?, David Lender, a lawyer for ExxonMobil, said during
cross-examination of Fogg today. </p>
<h2>Fogg said that would be true for some wells. </h2>
<p>I made calculations that did not assume that it''s going
to keep growing forever and ever, he said. I also projected
there would be other wells that would see an increase in
concentration. </p>
<p>A professor at the University of California, Davis, Fogg
estimated that about 40,000 wells are contaminated with MTBE in
the state, and that about 5,590 are contaminated at levels
determined to be unfit for drinking. </p>
<p>The number of contaminated wells is one element in the
determination of monetary damages if ExxonMobil is found liable. </p>
<p>The state is also seeking damages based on the companies''
market share of gasoline sales in New Hampshire during the
period covered by the lawsuit. </p>
<h2>Market Share </h2>
<p>ExxonMobil''s share was about 30 percent, the state said.
Based on the state''s estimated cost of $816 million to test for,
monitor and clean up the contamination, New Hampshire could be
seeking about $245 million from the company. </p>
<p>Citgo''s market share during that time ranged from
3.1 percent to 8.7 percent, the state said. Based on those
figures, New Hampshire could be seeking $25 million to
$71 million from Citgo in a settlement. </p>
<p>The two sides have until Feb. 15 to agree. If they don''t,
Citgo will be reinstated to the case, barring an extension. The
New Hampshire attorney general''s office declined to comment on
terms of any proposed settlement. Fernando Garay, a spokesman
for Citgo, declined to comment on the matter. </p>
<p>In 2003, New Hampshire sued ExxonMobil, Citgo, Shell Oil
Co., Sunoco Inc., ConocoPhillips (COP), Irving Oil Ltd., Vitol SA and
Hess Corp. All settled before the trial except Irving, Texas-
based ExxonMobil and Citgo, the Houston-based unit of Petroleos
de Venezuela SA, the country''s state-owned oil company. </p>
<h2>Earlier Accord </h2>
<p>Shell and Sunoco agreed to pay New Hampshire $35 million in
a settlement announced in November. </p>
<p>New Hampshire has collected more than $100 million so far
from the defendants, according to court papers. </p>
<p>The state contends that the oil companies knew MTBE
presented a risk of groundwater contamination when they decided
to use it. </p>
<p>ExxonMobil and Citgo argued that they were complying with
federal regulations that pre-empt state law. They said MTBE was
added to gasoline to make it burn more thoroughly and thus
comply with a federal mandate to reduce air pollution. They also
said MTBE never caused any New Hampshire resident to become ill. </p>
<p>MTBE lawsuits have also been consolidated in federal court
in New York for pretrial evidence-gathering and motions. </p>
<p>In 2009, a federal jury ordered ExxonMobil to pay New York
City $104.7 million after finding it liable for polluting wells
in the city. ExxonMobil has appealed. </p>
<p>In today''s cross-examination, Lender questioned Fogg about
the money his firm has received for work on the case. </p>
<p>It''s been a significant amount of money, Fogg said. </p>
<p>Could it be more than a million dollars? Lender asked. </p>
<p>If you want to suggest I''m getting rich off this, I think
you''d be sadly disappointed, Fogg replied. </p>
<p>The case is State of New Hampshire v. Hess Corp. (HES), 03-C-
0550, New Hampshire Superior Court, Merrimack County (Concord). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s non-consensus call that Turkey''s central bank would act to stem capital inflows at the risk of higher loan growth was vindicated as the bank cut interest rates today. </p> <p>The Ankara-based bank lowered its overnight lending and borrowing rates by 25 basis points each, while leaving the 5.5 percent benchmark one-week repurchase rate unchanged, in line with Goldman Sachs economist Ahmet Akarli''s call on Jan. 18. The reductions were made to contain risks on financial stability amid accelerating capital inflows that have boosted the lira and helped prolong the best bond rally in emerging markets. </p> <p>Akarli was the only one of 12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg to correctly predict today''s move, with the median forecast calling for no change in rates as rising loan growth threatens to increase the inflation rate and widen the current-account deficit. The central bank''s priority last year was to limit lending growth that had exploded in 2011, driving the deficit up and leading to an 18 percent decline in the lira against the dollar. </p> <p>The bank has shifted focus towards the financial stability risks posed by accelerating capital inflows, and away from inflation, Akarli, who was not immediately available for comment today, said in an e-mailed note before the rates decision. Interest-rate cuts will be used to lean against these inflows and their subsequent currency appreciation pressures, he said. </p> <h2>Credit Rating </h2> <p>Accelerating inflows meant the proper policy would be to keep interest rates at low levels and to deliver a limited downward shift in the interest rate corridor, the central bank said in a statement accompanying its rate cuts. </p> <p>The interest-rate corridor is a policy tool unique to Turkey, allowing central bank Governor Erdem Basci to adjust the effective borrowing rate daily by extending funding through a duo of rates. At today''s meeting he cut the overnight borrowing rate to 4.75 percent and the overnight lending rate to 8.75 percent. </p> <p>The lira appreciated against 27 out of 31 major currencies this month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That brought the central bank''s real effective exchange rate close to the 120 reading which Basci said in November would be a cause for concern. The index measures the lira''s purchasing power against the currencies of Turkey''s main trading partners. </p> <h2>Lira Gains </h2> <p>The lira strengthened to 1.7530 per dollar on Jan. 17, the strongest level since Feb. 29 last year, on bets Moody''s Investors Service will raise Turkey''s credit rating to investment grade. Barclays Plc, Societe Generale SA and Morgan Stanley are among banks that have said Moody''s may upgrade Turkey this year, a move that would help include the country in more global bond indexes and generate additional investment flows, after Fitch Ratings raised government debt to investment-grade ranking in November. </p> <p>Moody''s today said it was scheduling a teleconference on Jan. 28 to discuss Turkey''s strengthening profile and shift closer to an investment grade sovereign rating. </p> <p>The lira dropped 0.4 percent to 1.7719 at 6:55 p.m. in Istanbul after the rate cuts, erasing as much as 0.3 percent of gains on the Moody''s announcement. Yields on two-year benchmark bonds dropped three basis points to 5.9 percent. </p> <h2>Credit Expansion </h2> <p>Excessive currency appreciation increases systemic risk and can have a damaging effect on macroeconomic and financial stability, Basci said Dec. 25. The governor has used the rates corridor to control the flow of money and curb the current-account deficit. </p> <p>The central bank wants to keep credit growth within a 14 percent to 15 percent range, Deputy Governor Turalay Kenc said during a roundtable discussion arranged by Euromoney Institutional Investor Plc (ERM) in Vienna Jan. 15. Bank loans grew 17 percent to 805 billion liras ($457 billion) in the 12 months to Jan. 11, according to data from the banking regulator yesterday. </p> <p>We think that the cut in the upper end might support overall economic activity, which was not necessarily needed since economic activity already started to gain momentum, Ozgur Altug, chief economist at brokerage BGC Partners in Istanbul, said in an e-mailed report today. The central bank''s signal via cutting the lower end hints that it will not allow the lira to become an overvalued currency. </p> <h2>Real Rate </h2> <p>Five-year credit-default swaps on Turkey were unchanged at 126 basis points today. That compares with 135 for Russia, 82 for Poland and 156 for South Africa. Rising prices show worsening perceptions of a borrower''s creditworthiness, and declining prices the reverse. The contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for the underlying securities or cash if a borrower fails to adhere to its debt agreements. </p> <p>The extra yield investors demand to hold Turkish debt denominated in dollars rather than U.S. Treasuries fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 178, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s EMBI Global Index. The premium compares with the emerging-market average at 265. </p> <p>The lira''s gain this month has come after the central bank''s real effective exchange rate fell to 118.3 in December from 119.4 in November. </p> <p>The real effective exchange rate has approached the central bank''s threshold of 120, Emre Tekmen and Selim Cakir, Istanbul-based analysts at BNP Paribas SA, said by e-mail yesterday. Strong risk appetite may lead to renewed appreciation pressure on the lira, prompting the central bank to cut its overnight borrowing rate, they said. </p> <p>]]> </body></entry><entry author="By Sherine El Madany" date="Jan 22, 2013  6:43 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-22/jpmorgan-hires-ubs-banker-amid-quest-for-bigger-islamic-slice.html"><headline>JPMorgan Hires UBS Banker Amid Quest for Bigger Islamic Slice</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) has named
former UBS AG (UBSN) banker Hussein Hassan to head global Islamic
finance as the biggest U.S. lender strives to boost its share of
an industry whose assets are set to double by 2015. </p>
<p>New York-based JPMorgan said Hassan, previously global head
of Islamic structuring for UBS, would focus on clients in
countries including Saudi Arabia and Malaysia, according to an
e-mailed statement today. Malaysia hosts the world''s biggest
market for Islamic bonds, or sukuk, while Saudi Arabia boasts
the world''s biggest share of Shariah-compliant assets. </p>
<p>As we have observed a significant increase in the demand
for Shariah-compliant banking products, we have decided to
invest in high-caliber people, systems and technology, Sjoerd Leenart, JPMorgan''s senior country officer for the Middle East
and North Africa, said in the statement. </p>
<p>Global banks including HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) and Standard
Chartered Plc have set up Islamic banking units to take
advantage of growing demand for financial products that comply
with the religion''s ban on interest. Global Islamic financial
assets are set to double to as much as $3 trillion by 2015,
according to Standards  Poor''s estimates. </p>
<h2>Islamic Offering </h2>
<p>Hassan, who also headed Zurich-based UBS'' Middle East and
North Africa structuring, will be based in Dubai, a Persian Gulf
emirate striving create a hub for Shariah-compliant banking that
would take on such centers as Malaysia and Bahrain. He will lead
JPMorgan''s effort to further build out its Islamic offering
across different lines of business and regions, the bank said. </p>
<p>Global sales of Islamic bonds surged 26 percent last year
to $46 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Issuers
in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, accounted for almost half
of the total after sukuk sales tripled and borrowing costs
plunged to records. </p>
<p>JPMorgan helped arrange $119 million of global sukuk sales
last year, or 0.3 percent of the total, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. That compares with $11 billion, or almost a
quarter of the total, for HSBC, the world''s top underwriter of
Islamic bonds. Dubai, which is home to the world''s tallest
skyscraper, plans to sell 10-year dollar-denominated sukuk
today, four people familiar with the matter said. </p>

<p>General Dynamics Corp. (GD) forecast a
2013 profit short of analysts'' estimates and reported a $2.1
billion fourth-quarter loss that the company attributed to ill-
advised acquisitions and to declining defense spending. </p>
<p>For 2013, profit will be $6.60 to $6.70 a share, the
company said. The average estimate of 21 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for a profit of $7.32 a share on sales of $32.1
billion. </p>
<p>The fourth-quarter loss for General Dynamics, the maker of
Abrams tanks and Gulfstream business jets, compared with a
profit of $603 million or $1.68 a share, a year earlier. After
adjusting for certain items, profit in the quarter was $1.39 a
share, the company said today in a statement. Analysts forecast
a profit of $1.89 a share, the average of 20 estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. Sales declined 12 percent to $8.1 billion. </p>
<p>The results and charges that we have recorded in the
fourth quarter reflect the fact that some of our markets are
contracting as government budgets shrink at home and abroad,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Phebe Novakovic said in the
statement. </p>
<p>General Dynamics gained 1 percent to $71.45 at the close in
New York trading and have fallen less than 1 percent in the past
12 months. </p>
<h2>European Sales </h2>
<p>Declining sales for the Falls Church, Virginia-based
company''s European land systems unit was the single largest
cause of falling revenue, Novakovic said on a conference call
with investors today. </p>
<p>The company cut the goodwill value of its Information
Systems and Technology unit by $2 billion because its revenue is
down 14 percent from a high point in 2010, Chief Financial
Officer Hugh Redd said on the call. </p>
<p>The unit''s margins declined 2.7 percent in that period, he
said. It had made 38 acquisitions since being created in 1997,
he said. </p>
<p>Novakovic, who took the top job on Jan. 1, said on the call
that she was not a particular fan of some of the company''s
previous acquisitions. </p>
<h2>Clearing Decks'' </h2>
<p>The goodwill writedowns and charges included some
anticipated clearing of the decks, though the scale of the write
downs are pretty eye-watering, Robert Stallard, a London-based
analyst at RBC Capital Markets LLC, wrote in a note to investors
today. The company has arguably over-paid for certain
acquisitions leading to the non-cash goodwill impairment as the
defense environment turns down. He rates the stock as neutral. </p>
<p>While all U.S. defense contractors face tightening budgets,
General Dynamics will be under more pressure than the other
large defense primes because of its exposure to Army and IT
services, Douglas Harned, an analyst at New York-based Sanford
C. Bernstein wrote in a Jan. 22 note to clients. </p>
<p>The company and its peers in the industry must also deal
with the uncertainty of operating without a budget approved by
Congress this year as well as the prospect for across-the-board
cuts of $45 billion if Congress and President Barack Obama can''t
reach agreement on alternative spending cuts. </p>
<p>Even with declining orders for technology services in the
U.S., the company anticipates margins improving at the
Information Systems and Technology unit, Novakovic said. </p>
<p>The unit''s sales fell 12 percent to $2.6 billion in the
fourth quarter compared with the previous year and declared a
loss. </p>
<h2>Abrams Tank </h2>
<p>The U.S. business of the company''s Combat Systems unit is
extremely stable on its vehicle orders and backlog,
Novakovic said. The unit makes the Abrams tanks as well as
Stryker vehicles for the Army. It''s bidding for the Army''s new
Ground-Combat Vehicle program. </p>
<p>General Dynamics had no acquisition candidates in the
current pipeline, according to Novakovic, who said that she
was focusing on cutting costs, increasing margins and generating
cash. I''m not looking at reshaping our portfolio at the
moment. </p>
<p>The company''s Aerospace unit, the maker of Gulfstream
business jets, posted the only revenue increase in the quarter,
a gain of less than 1 percent to $1.9 billion, while profit
fell. The unit''s margins suffered because the company had to
retrofit its new G650 jet, which is in production, with changes
mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration. </p>
<p>The G650 received its initial certification in September
after a delay because of a crash in April 2011 during a test
flight that killed all four crew members. </p>

<p>A Defense Department investigation
found no evidence of wrongdoing by Marine General John Allen,
President Barack Obama''s nominee to be NATO''s top commander, in
e-mails the military leader exchanged with a Florida woman. </p>
<p>Defense Secretary Leon Panetta requested a probe into the
propriety of the e-mail communications between Allen, the
commander of U.S. and allied forces in Afghanistan, and Jill Kelley of Tampa. The inquiry concluded that Allen didn''t engage
in professional misconduct, Pentagon press secretary George Little said yesterday. </p>
<p>The secretary has complete confidence in the continued
leadership of General Allen, who is serving with distinction in
Afghanistan, Little said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>The findings of the Pentagon''s inspector general clears a
path for Allen''s nomination as Supreme Allied Commander of North
Atlantic Treaty Organization forces. The Pentagon had asked the
Senate Armed Services Committee in November to postpone
confirmation hearings while the probe was under way. White House
press secretary Jay Carney told reporters today that the
administration is urging the Senate to proceed with Allen''s
nomination. </p>
<p>From the outset, the general placed his faith in -- and
fully supported -- the investigative process, Allen''s
spokesman, Marine Corp Major David Nevers, said today in an e-
mailed statement. He''s obviously pleased by the outcome. </p>
<h2>General''s Friend </h2>
<p>Allen, 59, exchanged a series of e-mails with Kelley, who
has described herself as a friend of the general and his family.
Their relationship surfaced because of a complaint she filed
about harassing e-mails from an anonymous sender that led to the
Nov. 9 resignation of CIA Director David H. Petraeus. </p>
<p>Kelley''s complaint to an acquaintance who is an FBI agent
triggered an investigation that uncovered an affair between
Petraeus, a retired Army general, and his biographer Paula Broadwell, U.S. officials have said. </p>
<p>The harassing e-mails to Kelley were traced to Broadwell,
according to three people briefed on the FBI probe. The Justice
Department last month decided against pursuing cyber-stalking
charges against Broadwell, according to the Associated Press. </p>
<p>Kelley and her husband, Scott, an oncology surgeon, wrote
in a Washington Post article published online yesterday how
their lives were disrupted by a flood of media coverage of their
role in the Petraeus scandal. </p>
<h2>Paparazzi Horde </h2>
<p>After our names were linked to the Petraeus story, a
horde of paparazzi stormed our front lawn, the couple wrote.
We didn''t want our silence to validate false headlines, but we
did what most people unaccustomed to such a blitzkrieg would do:
walled it off in the hopes the storm would fade or pass. </p>
<p>The Kelleys, parents of three young daughters, criticized
media reports that incorrectly said Jill Kelley and Allen
exchanged 30,000 e-mails and that insinuated she and the general
were involved in an extramarital relationship. </p>
<p>This small sample of junk reporting was emotionally
exhausting and damaging -- as it would be to the strongest of
families, they wrote. </p>
<p>Jill Kelley became acquainted with Allen and Petraeus
through social events she hosted at her Tampa home for military
officers from nearby MacDill Air Force Base, headquarters for
U.S. Central Command. </p>
<p>Allen, a 1976 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy in
Annapolis, Maryland, served as deputy commander of Central
Command under Petraeus before taking over coalition forces in
Afghanistan in July 2011. </p>
<p>Obama said on Jan. 11 that Afghan forces would take the
lead security role for their country within a few months, sooner
than planned, as the U.S. seeks to extricate itself from the 11-
year war. </p>
<p>Allen has cited progress in handing more responsibility to
Afghan forces in the fight against the Taliban as the U.S. winds
down its combat operations there. </p>

<p>Eleni plans to build commodity exchanges in Africa, Morgan

<p>What we''re trying to do is improve the domestic supply

Gabre-Madhin said. If you talk to the big buyers, a lot of

white pea beans and corn a year with a total value of $1.4

percent of the final export price, up from 38 percent three
years ago, she said. </p>

start eleni LLC because it''s a good hub for technological

<p>Goldman (GS) Sachs International sold 1
billion euros ($1.33 billion) of a Sept. 15, 2026, Madrid region
note today as the second-biggest contributor to Spain''s economy
seeks to benefit from a rally in the nation''s securities. </p>
<p>Goldman placed the notes privately while five banks took
part in the syndicated sale of a 2018 note, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The five-year notes were sold at a spread of 190
basis points over the reference 2018 Treasury bond, according to
people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named
because they''re not authorized to speak about it. </p>
<p>The region tapped the markets after the Treasury yesterday
saw record demand for a 10-year bond. Spain''s Cabinet last week
gave Madrid, Galicia, Navarra and Aragon a green light to issue
4.4 billion euros of bonds amid a surge in investor interest for
Spanish shares as well as government and corporate debt. </p>
<p>Madrid''s economy department said it has sold the 2.3
billion euros of debt it was authorized to issue on Jan. 18 and
that details will be given today at 5 p.m. in Madrid. The amount
represents about 60 percent of the region''s 2013 funding needs. </p>
<p>Analistas Financieros Internacionales, a Madrid-based
consultancy, estimates gross debt sales from the regions of
about 30 billion euros this year, excluding short-term debt. </p>
<p>The Treasury plans to raise 23 billion euros for the
nation''s regional rescue fund known as FLA, created last year to
prevent any regional default, and that was tapped by nine of 17
semi-autonomous regions. </p>
<p>The Budget Ministry has imposed a debt ceiling of 172
billion euros on the regions this year, or 16 percent of gross
domestic product. That compares with outstanding debt of 167
billion euros in the third quarter and includes 102 billion
euros of bank loans, with the remainder mostly in bonds,
according to the Bank of Spain. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Bristol-Myers Squibb
Co. (BMY)''s Eliquis won the backing of the U.K.''s health-cost
regulator for people with an irregular heartbeat, putting the
drug in line to be the third new treatment recommended for such
patients in the past year. </p>
<p>The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence
issued draft guidance recommending the blood thinner to prevent
strokes in patients with atrial fibrillation, the agency said
today in an e-mailed statement. NICE asked patients and doctors
to talk before using Eliquis about whether to choose one of the
other two new drugs or the older medicine warfarin instead. </p>
<p>Eliquis will compete with Bayer AG (BAYN) and Johnson  Johnson (JNJ)''s
Xarelto and Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH''s Pradaxa to replace
warfarin, a decades-old medicine that had previously been the
standard of care for people with an erratic heartbeat. Both of
the other drugs won a recommendation from NICE last year. </p>
<p>The appraisal committee heard from patient experts that
warfarin can have a greater impact on a person''s quality of life
than atrial fibrillation itself, Carole Longson, director of
NICE''s Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said in the
statement, citing the older drug''s interactions with food,
alcohol and other medicines, and the regular monitoring it
requires. </p>
<p>NICE, which advises the state-run National Health Service
on getting medical value for its money, said it will probably
issue final guidance on Eliquis, also known as apixaban, in
February. The agency recommended the pill in January 2012 for
people who have undergone hip or knee replacement surgery. </p>
<p>The recommendation confirms the value of apixaban as a
cost-effective oral anticoagulant, Amadou Diarra, vice
president of the U.K. and Ireland for Bristol-Myers, said in an
e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>More than 46,000 new cases of atrial fibrillation are
diagnosed in the U.K. each year, according to the NHS. </p>

<p>Gorman, 54, will get stock options valued at $2.6 million,
according to a filing yesterday with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. He also will receive a $2.6 million
deferred cash bonus in addition to his $800,000 salary, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because Gorman''s total
pay hasn''t been announced. That totals $6 million, down from
$8.56 million on a comparable basis for 2011. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley cut 2012 costs 2 percent as revenue climbed
6.9 percent, excluding charges or gains related to changes in
the price of the firm''s own debt. Still, the bank''s return on
equity was 5 percent, below Gorman''s goal of 15 percent. </p>
<p>He''s receiving options instead of restricted shares
awarded for 2011 and a new long-term incentive package separate
from his year-end pay that will have a similar structure to the
performance shares he got for 2010 and 2011, the person said.
Even including the package, the size of which hasn''t been
disclosed, his total compensation will be down from the $10.5
million he received for 2011, the person said. </p>
<p>Gorman''s pay trails Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein''s $21 million and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon''s $11.5 million. Morgan Stanley''s decision to separate
Gorman''s award based on future performance targets from year-end
pay brings it in line with New York-based Goldman Sachs, which
gave Blankfein such an incentive worth $3 million in February
and a $7 million award the previous year. </p>
<h2>Beating Estimates </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley shares climbed 26 percent last year, after
tumbling 44 percent in 2011. The stock has gained 18 percent in
January, fueled by fourth-quarter results that exceeded
analysts'' estimates and Gorman''s plan to double the firm''s
return on equity even without an improvement in markets. </p>
<p>The bank is eliminating 1,700 jobs this month as Gorman
pursues $1.6 billion of annual savings during the next two
years. The New York-based firm is deferring all bonuses for
employees who have both total pay of more than $350,000 and
incentive compensation of at least $50,000, a person briefed on
the matter said earlier this month. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) paid many of its top executives in options
because of a tax rule that limits the deductibility of
compensation for certain officers, except the chief financial
officer, unless the pay qualifies as performance-based, the
person said. The rule came into effect because of the firm''s low
level of pretax earnings, the person said. Morgan Stanley had
$515 million of pretax profit in 2012, a figure that was reduced
by $4.4 billion because of charges relating to the firm''s own
debt, known as debt valuation adjustments. </p>
<h2>Porat''s Pay </h2>
<p>CFO Ruth Porat was awarded 99,835 restricted shares worth
$2.29 million based on the closing price on Jan. 22, the day
they were awarded, according to a separate regulatory filing
yesterday. Last year, she received restricted stock valued at
$3.2 million. Paul Wirth, deputy CFO, received 92,070 restricted
shares valued at $2.12 million. </p>
<p>Colm Kelleher, president of the investment banking and
trading division, received 445,425 options valued at $2.41
million, compared with restricted shares worth $2.54 million for
2011. Greg Fleming, who runs the brokerage and asset-management
businesses, received 447,888 options worth $2.43 million. Last
year, he received restricted stock units worth $3.4 million. </p>
<p>Chief Operating Officer Jim Rosenthal and Chief Risk
Officer Keishi Hotsuki received options valued at $2.03 million
and $1.25 million, respectively. Chief Legal Officer Eric Grossman was awarded options worth about $1.83 million. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley, the biggest
financial brokerage, will spend $500 million to improve computer
systems after flaws in a previous upgrade frustrated the staff. </p>
<p>Investments in technology will be made over the next 18
months, according to a memo from Greg Fleming, 49, head of its
brokerage unit, that was dated yesterday and obtained by
Bloomberg News. Brokers complained about glitches and more
cumbersome processes last year after New York-based Morgan
Stanley switched to a single system for its Smith Barney joint
venture with Citigroup Inc. </p>
<p>For us to be the best wealth-management firm for our
advisers and clients, we must have the best platform, Fleming
wrote. We will not stop until we have achieved this. </p>
<p>Fleming wrote that his top priority for the next year is
his advisory business, which takes fiduciary responsibility for
managing client funds, rather than just taking commissions on
trades. Dow Jones reported on Fleming''s memo earlier today. </p>
<p>The joint venture was known as Morgan Stanley (MS) Smith Barney
until last year, when Morgan Stanley moved to buy out New York-
based Citigroup. The deal turned Morgan Stanley''s wealth-
management division into the world''s largest brokerage, with
16,780 financial advisers at the end of 2012. </p>
<p>The division more than doubled fourth-quarter net income to
$385 million, helping the company beat analysts'' estimates. The
wealth business surpassed a profit-margin target six months
ahead of schedule. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley has asked regulators for approval to buy the
final 35 percent of the brokerage venture from Citigroup after
resolving a dispute over the valuation of the business in
September. </p>

<p>Debt markets that have seen junk-
bond yields drop to record lows may face a substantial
repricing'''' if interest rates spike or investors begin pulling
money out of fixed-income, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) President
Gary Cohn said. </p>
<p>A sudden or large increase in rates would be a shock to
markets, presenting a big risk'''' with a low probability,''''
Cohn, 52, said in an interview today with Bloomberg Television''s
Erik Schatzker at the World Economic Forum in Davos,
Switzerland. Such a move would potentially be heightened by a
liquidity shortage as large banks cut holdings to comply with
new capital requirements, he said. </p>
<p>I''m concerned when money starts flowing out of fixed-
income funds, with firms trying to reduce their risk-weighted
assets and firms trying to reduce their balance sheets, who will
be the ultimate buyer of those fixed-income products? Cohn
said. Someone has to buy them, and maybe it takes a fairly
substantial repricing of fixed income to find the next round of
buyers. </p>
<p>Investors have funneled cash into junk bonds at a record
pace as the Federal Reserve holds benchmark interest rates
between zero and 0.25 percent and buys back bonds to suppress
borrowing costs. Bond sales by Spain and Portugal this week are
among signs that the European sovereign-debt crisis has eased.
Buyers of fixed-income products must be told that just because
it is a bond doesn''t mean that it trades at par, Cohn said. </p>
<h2>Inventories Drop </h2>
<p>The 13 largest investment banks have announced plans to cut
$1.03 trillion in risk-weighted assets, consulting firm McKinsey
 Co. said in a report yesterday. Inventory holdings of
corporate bonds by top dealers have dropped about 40 percent
from two years ago and are less than a quarter of their 2007
peak, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>A lot of the banks have a new plan of de-risking their
balance sheets, getting their risk-weighted assets down to try
to improve their equity ratios, Cohn said. And I''m not sure
that that capital can come back into the market quick enough
if there''s a sell-off, he said. </p>
<p>Cohn is not the first to warn of a potential liquidity
squeeze for institutional investors that have driven junk bond
yields to record lows. Greenwich Associates, a consulting firm
that surveys large investors, said in a report this month that
banks have increasingly relied on electronic trade crossing, a
process that depends on a large number of buyers. </p>
<p>When everyone wants to sell, there will be no one on the
other side to cross trades with and capital-constrained banks
will have no interest in assuming their traditional role of
liquidity backstops, Andrew Awad, a Greenwich consultant, said
in the report. </p>
<h2>Widest Gap </h2>
<p>Yields on dollar-denominated junk bonds dropped to an
unprecedented 6.46 percent on Jan. 22, and prices rose to 105.6
cents from as low as 54.8 cents in December 2008, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. </p>
<p>Yields over benchmarks for junk debt owned by exchange-
traded funds are 2.03 percentage points less than for below-
investment-grade bonds that they don''t hold, the widest gap on
record, according to Bank of America Corp. The difference
between yields on offerings above and below $400 million has
widened to about the highest level since February 2009, as
investors favor bonds sold in the most liquid batches. </p>
<p>Portugal sold 2.5 billion euros ($3.34 billion) of five-
year bonds through banks, the first offering of that maturity in
almost two years. Spain sold 7 billion euros of 10-year bonds on
Jan. 22, a sale Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said had the
biggest demand in the nation''s history. </p>
<p>At some point, interest rates will go higher again, and
all of the money that has piled into fixed income over the past
three years, some of it will come out, Cohn said. We will
clearly be there to facilitate, we will clearly be there to
provide balance sheet and liquidity to our clients, but
ultimately, we can''t be the buyer of last resort. </p>

<p>A computer hacker from the online
activism group Anonymous was sentenced in Britain to 18
months in jail for conspiring to attack the websites of Visa
Inc. (V), PayPal Inc., MasterCard Inc. (MA) and others. </p>
<p>The prison term was handed down today, according to a clerk
at Southwark Crown Court in London. Christopher Weatherhead was
found guilty in December, while three co-defendants -- Jake
Birchall, Ashley Rhodes and Peter Gibson -- pleaded guilty
earlier to conspiring to impair the operation of computers. </p>
<p>Britain''s Crown Prosecution Service described Weatherhead
in December as a cyber-criminal who waged a sophisticated and
orchestrated campaign of online attacks on computer systems. </p>
<p>Gibson was ordered to perform 100 hours community service
and given a six-month suspended sentence for two years, meaning
he faces jail if he offends again during that period. Birchall''s
sentence will be discussed at a hearing scheduled for Feb. 1,
the clerk said. Rhodes''s sentence hadn''t been discussed today,
the clerk said. </p>
<p>The four also targeted the British Recorded Music Industry,
Ministry of Sound and the International Federation of the
Phonographic Industry, prosecutors said. The attacks cost the
companies more than 3.5 million pounds ($5.5 million) in extra
staffing, software and sales losses. </p>
<p>U.K. police have been investigating hacktivist
collectives Anonymous and LulzSec for conducting denial-of-
service attacks, which flood computer networks with requests for
information until they shut down. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) President Gary Cohn said he''s fairly bullish on global stock markets as investors will shift money from bonds to equities as interest rates rise. </p> <p>The cause of interest rates going up, which is greater economic activity and greater growth, will be very positive for our business, Cohn said in an interview today with Bloomberg Television''s Erik Schatzker at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. </p> <p>Shares in top companies also offer attractive dividend yields relative to where interest rates are, Cohn said. The dividend yield of the Dow Jones Industrial Average is 2.51 percent, compared with the 1.86 percent yield of 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p> <p>I look at the dividend yield that you can receive in relatively blue-chip companies around the world, and I look at that versus risk-free yields, and I think that is an interesting opportunity, Cohn said. You are long some global growth, you''re long some inflation, and you get paid a decent return to own those. </p> <p>Cohn contrasted his view on stocks with that on bonds. </p> <p>Fixed income on the other hand, interesting, Cohn said. At some point, interest rates will go higher again, and all of the money that has piled into fixed income over the past three years, some of it will come out. </p>

<p>Former Morgan Stanley brokerage
adviser Kevin L. Dowd was charged with insider trading for
tipping a friend ahead of Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD)''s $11 billion
acquisition of Pharmasset Inc., U.S. prosecutors said. </p>
<p>Dowd, 37, who worked at a brokerage in Aventura, Florida,
learned that a Pharmasset director told Dowd''s superiors about
the deal before it was announced on Nov. 21, 2011, according to
a Federal Bureau of Investigation arrest complaint filed today. </p>
<p>Dowd was told not to act on the information yet tipped a
childhood friend, identified as J.F., who illicitly made
$163,621 on Pharmasset shares, the FBI said. J.F. tipped another
friend who made $544,706 on Pharmasset options, the FBI said. In
July 2012, agents confronted Dowd, who said he told J.F. to buy
stock, while denying he had inside information, the FBI said. </p>
<p>Dowd admitted that he told J.F., but falsely stated that
he had never received information that Pharmasset was going to
be acquired by another pharmaceutical company, Paul Fishman,
the U.S. attorney in New Jersey, said in a statement. </p>
<p>The number of people sued by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission or charged with insider trading by the
Justice Department more than doubled since 2008, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. There were 56 in 2008, 96 in 2009,
67 in 2010, 104 in 2011 and 125 last year. Of those, 22 percent
were linked to trades involving health-care stocks. </p>
<h2>Wooden Dock </h2>
<p>In exchange for the tip, J.F. gave Dowd a wooden dock for
his Jet Skis and a cashier''s check for $35,000, according to the
FBI. Dowd used the money to buy an in-ground pool at his Boca
Raton home, according to the FBI. </p>
<p>Dowd, who was arrested at his home today, is charged with
conspiracy to commit securities fraud and faces as long as five
years in prison if convicted. </p>
<p>He appeared today in federal court in West Palm Beach,
Florida. A judge released Dowd on a $100,000 bond. He is
scheduled to appear in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, on
Feb. 1. </p>
<p>Peter Willis, a lawyer for Dowd, didn''t immediately return
a call seeking comment on the charges. </p>
<p>The SEC also sued Dowd today in federal court in Newark. </p>
<p>As an industry professional, Dowd surely knew what he was
doing was wrong, but he incorrectly thought that his scheme was
clever enough to avoid detection by investigators, Daniel M. Hawke, chief of the SEC''s Market Abuse Unit, said in a
statement. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s wealth management unit has cooperated with
the SEC and Justice Department, Christine Jockle, a spokeswoman
for the New York-based bank, said in an e-mail. </p>
<h2>Clear Violation'' </h2>
<p>Mr. Dowd was in clear violation of company policy and was
terminated on Dec. 12, 2012, for behavior that the firm does not
tolerate, Jockle said. </p>
<p>At least six weeks before the acquisition by Gilead, the
Pharmasset director confidentially told a Morgan Stanley (MS) manager
that his company was engaged in an auction process involving a
sale of the company, had attracted the interest of several large
pharmaceutical companies, and was going to be sold, according
to the SEC. </p>
<p>The Pharmasset director served on the Princeton, New
Jersey-based company''s board from August 2000 until January 2012
and was the largest customer of the brokerage''s Aventura branch,
according to the FBI. </p>
<p>Dowd''s managers told him that he was prohibited from
recommending or trading Pharmasset securities because the office
had come into possession of material nonpublic information
about the sale, the SEC said. He also was told not to trade
Pharmasset securities in his personal account. </p>
<p>Dowd began work at Morgan Stanley in June 2009, according
to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. He worked from
August 2005 to June 2009 at Citigroup Inc. (C), according to Finra
records. </p>
<p>The criminal case is U.S. v. Dowd, 13-mj-6515, U.S.
District Court, District of New Jersey (Newark). The SEC case is
Securities and Exchange Commission v. Dowd, U.S. District Court,
District of New Jersey (Newark). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) raised 1
billion euros ($1.3 billion) from its first benchmark sale in
the currency for 1 1/2 years, just a week after issuing $6
billion of debt in its biggest deal ever. </p>
<p>The U.S. bank sold 3.25 percent senior, unsecured 10-year
notes that were priced to yield 155 basis points more than the
swap rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The deal
lifts total corporate bond sales in Europe this week to about 19
billion euros, matching the previous week''s volume. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is borrowing money as the European Central
Bank said today that banks will hand back more of its three-year
emergency loans than forecast by economists in a Bloomberg News
survey. That boosted investor confidence and helped send the
cost of insuring bank debt down from near a four-week high. </p>
<p>There''s still strong demand for financial debt in
Europe, said Georg Grodzki, the head of credit research at
Legal  General Investment Management in London, which manages
more than $600 billion of bonds. Yields may be heading up soon
and fast if Goldman Sachs''s own economic optimism proves
correct and interest rates rise, he said. </p>
<p>Sophie Bullock, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in London,
declined to comment. </p>

<p>JPMorgan shares have lagged 30 percent behind global banks
since early August, analysts led by Matthew O''Connor wrote in a
research note by Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank. JPMorgan, which
reported its third record year of profits with $21.3 billion in
net income last year, may see annual operating expenses drop as
much as $5 billion in coming years partly because costs to
service mortgages will drop, according to the note. </p>
<p>We think JPM is the best-positioned market-sensitive bank
for a pickup in consumer loan growth, O''Connor wrote,
referring to New York-based JPMorgan by its stock ticker.
Deutsche Bank upgraded JPMorgan to buy from hold and raised its
12-month price target to $53 from $48. </p>
<p>Deutsche Bank lowered Goldman Sachs to hold from buy
because the New York-based bank is trading close to its 12-month
price target of $144. The firm doesn''t have the same
opportunities for cost savings as JPMorgan, and is trading at a
premium to other large investment banks, O''Connor said in the

<p>General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP), the
second-largest U.S. owner of shopping malls, purchased $633
million of warrants to buy the company''s shares from Blackstone

<p>The warrants were exercisable into about 52 million shares

that all the guys want to own, Jody Lurie, a corporate
credit analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia,
said in a telephone interview. There are so few issuers out
there that any sort of issuance gets priced very, very tight. </p>
<p>It last sold 30-year securities in May 2010, issuing $500
million of 5.4 percent debt at a spread of 130 basis points,
Bloomberg data show. The bonds traded at 122.8 cents on the
dollar to yield 4.02 percent, at a spread of 100.1 basis points,
on Jan. 23, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. </p>
<p>General Mills previously sold benchmark debt in November
2011, issuing $1 billion of 3.15 percent, 10-year debentures.
Benchmark sales are typically at least $500 million. </p>
<p>General Mills''s balance sheet, as it stands today, is
strong and healthy, but also leaves some risks on the table for
additional debt-financed acquisitions, Edward Mui, an analyst
at CreditSights Inc., wrote in a research note today, adding
that the company may look to acquisitions abroad. </p>
<p>Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG and JPMorgan Chase
 Co. managed today''s offering for the Minneapolis-based
company, Bloomberg data show. The bonds are rated Baa1 by
Moody''s Investors Service and BBB+ by Standard  Poor''s. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) sold $29.9 million of six-month structured notes tied to Apple Inc. (AAPL) the day before the company announced earnings that sent its stock plunging 12 percent. </p> <p>The securities, issued Jan. 22, yield 10 percent a year, plus any gains of the stock up to 11.25 percent, according to a prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) paid about
$35.7 million for an interest in eight Ormat Technologies Inc. (ORA)
geothermal power plants in California and Nevada. </p>
<p>JPMorgan plans to pay Ormat an additional $8.7 million for
25 percent of the value of production tax credits generated by
the plants through the end of 2016, the Reno, Nevada-based
developer said today in a statement. </p>
<p>The so-called tax equity investment gives JPMorgan
production tax credits and accelerated depreciation benefits
that Ormat isn''t able to use, because we generate more
deductions for tax purposes than we are currently able to
utilize, Ormat Chief Executive Officer Dita Bronicki said in
the statement. The production tax credit for geothermal is 2.2
cents a kilowatt-hour and applies to the first 10 years of a
plant''s operation. </p>
<p>The eight plants are part of Ormat''s Ormesa, Heber and
Mammoth complexes in California and its Steamboat and Brady
complexes in Nevada, Bronicki said today in an e-mail. </p>
<p>JPMorgan invested $24.9 million in four of Ormat''s Nevada

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), which sold 10-
year dollar bonds at a record low 3.2 percent two weeks ago,
priced similar-maturity notes in euros as debt sales in the
currency head for the slowest January since 2008. </p>
<p>The largest U.S. bank by assets, which last issued euro
debt in November, sold 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) of bonds
to yield 95 basis points above the swap rate, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with the 155 basis-point
spread Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) paid on 10-year debt it sold
Jan. 25. </p>
<p>Banks are poised to overtake industrial companies as the
safest borrowers in the $5.1 trillion U.S. corporate bond market
for the first time since the start of the financial crisis,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investors demand an
extra 154 basis points in yield over benchmarks to buy bonds of
JPMorgan, Wells Fargo  Co. and other lenders, compared with 138
basis points for companies from Alcoa Inc. (AA) to Ford Motor Co.,
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. </p>
<p>Financials are perhaps dominating sales so far this year
as they issued about 30 percent less debt in 2012 than they had
in redemptions, said Jonathan Pitkanen, the London-based head
of credit research at Threadneedle Asset Management Ltd. The
macro environment in Europe doesn''t look to be improving which
is why perhaps investors are becoming more wary of buying the
bonds of non-financial corporates. </p>
<h2>Interest Payments </h2>
<p>The cost for banks to convert euro interest payments into
dollars is holding near a 20-month low. The three-month cross-
currency basis swap was little changed at 14 basis points below
Euribor, the lowest cost to swap since May 2011. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s 1.5 billion euros of 2.75 percent bonds due in
10 years which it sold in August yield 83 basis points more than
swaps, 17 tighter than at issue, Bloomberg data show. The spread
on Goldman Sachs'' 3.25 percent debt due February 2023 has
tightened five basis points since issue last week. </p>
<p>Patrick Burton, a spokesman for JPMorgan in London,
declined to comment. </p>
<p>Today''s sales lift corporate bond issuance in euros and
pounds to 60.1 billion euros ($80.8 billion) so far this year,
the slowest start to a year since 2008 when 34 billion euros
were issued in the first three weeks of January, according to
Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>BASF SE (BAS) offered the only non-financial benchmark-sized bond
in the single currency, Bloomberg data show. It priced 500
million euros of eight-year notes to yield 38 basis points more
than swaps, the tight end of the 40 basis point range initially
marketed, a person with knowledge of that deal said. </p>
<h2>Good Value'' </h2>
<p>There has been lots of seven-year to 10-year maturity
issuance which is desirable if you are a treasurer but
introduces an element of volatility for investors versus more
traditional five-year paper, said Jens Vanbrabant, lead
portfolio manager at London-based investment firm ECM Asset 
Management Ltd. Nevertheless there are areas that still 
represent good value. </p>
<p>In derivatives markets, the Markit iTraxx Financial Index
of credit-default swaps on the senior debt of banks and insurers
rose one basis point to 136 at 3:35 p.m. in London. The Markit
iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with investment-grade
ratings increased one basis point to 106. </p>
<p>The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps
on 50 companies with mostly high-yield ratings added two basis
points to 422. </p>
<p>A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros of debt from default for five years is equivalent
to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements. </p>

<p>Gregory Peters, Morgan Stanley (MS)''s
chief cross-asset strategist who warned in 2007 that mortgage
losses risked causing a financial crisis, is leaving the bank. </p>
<p>His responsibilities will be taken on by the firm''s
committee of global strategists and economists, according to an
internal memo obtained by Bloomberg News. Lauren Bellmare, a
spokeswoman for the New York-based bank, confirmed the contents
of the memo. Peters probably will seek a job on the buy side, he
said in an interview. </p>
<p>He previously was the head of fixed-income research and led
U.S. credit strategy. Before joining Morgan Stanley in 2000, he
worked as a strategist at Salomon Smith Barney and as a bank
regulator at the U.S. Office of Thrift Supervision. </p>
<p>Peters gave views on asset classes from equities to
commodities and currencies. He said in a note last month that
his group expected lower returns in 2013, and favored emerging-
market and European equities. The group was bearish on U.S.
Treasuries and the Japanese yen. </p>
<p>We appreciate Greg''s hard work and determination in
helping shape the global macro research product over the past 12
years, Juan-Luis Perez, who leads research at the bank, wrote
in the memo. His thought leadership and market insights will
be missed. </p>
<p>The bank is eliminating 1,700 jobs this month as Chief
Executive Officer James Gorman, 54, pursues $1.6 billion of
annual savings during the next two years. Morgan Stanley also is
deferring all bonuses for employees who have both total pay of
more than $350,000 and incentive compensation of at least
$50,000, a person briefed on the matter said earlier this month. </p>
<h2>Grinding Halt'' </h2>
<p>Peters warned in November 2007 that there was a greater
than 50 percent chance that mortgage losses would cause a
systemic shock that would bring the financial system to a
grinding halt. He said in July that investors should buy
corporate bonds, which returned 5.2 percent over the last six
months of 2012, according to Bank of America Corp. indexes. </p>
<p>Other calls didn''t pan out. In June 2011, Peters said that
inflation would rise over the next year. After climbing in
August and September of that year, the U.S. inflation rate, as
measured by changes in the consumer price index, fell for the
next nine months. </p>
<p>Separately, Peter Bacon, Morgan Stanley''s head of capital
markets in Europe, and Gene Martin, co-head of the leveraged and
acquisition finance group, also are leaving the bank, according
to people briefed on the matter. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) is closing Junction
Point Studios, the maker of the Epic Mickey video games, as
the world''s largest media company works to boost results in its
money-losing interactive division. </p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Disney declined to say how many jobs were
eliminated by shuttering the Austin, Texas-based studio. </p>
<p>Disney Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger is
restructuring the company''s interactive division, which designs
games and websites, and has said it will be profitable in 2013
after six years of losses totaling $1.6 billion. </p>
<p>This month, Burbank, California-based Disney unveiled a new
game platform called Infinity that is designed to reduce some of
the cost in releasing new games. Characters and storylines from
new Disney movies can be added to the Infinity system without
all of the expense of developing games from scratch. </p>
<p>Junction Point, founded by game designer Warren Spector,
designed the 2010 Epic Mickey game, a merger of current
video-game technology with classic Disney characters that sold
2.6 million copies. Last year''s sequel, Epic Mickey 2, has
sold 529,000, according to market researcher NPD Group. </p>
<p>It was with much sadness that we informed our teams today
of changes to our games organization, which include the closure
of Junction Point Studios, Disney said in a statement. These
changes are part of our ongoing effort to address the fast-
evolving gaming platforms and marketplace and to align resources
against our key priorities. </p>
<p>The shares fell 0.7 percent to $53.96 at 2:39 p.m. in New
York. Disney rose 33 percent last year compared with a 13
percent gain for the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index. </p>
<p>The cost-cutting comes as sales of games for consoles such
as Sony Corp.''s (SNE) PlayStation and Microsoft Corp.''s (MSFT) Xbox are in
decline. Video-game software sales fell 23 percent to $6.7
billion in 2012, according to NPD. </p>
<p>Disney once operated six video games studios, three of
which have now been closed in the past three years. The company
added another with the acquisition of Lucasfilm Ltd., which was
completed in December. </p>
<p>The Junction Point closure was first reported by
Forbes.com. </p>

<p>U.S. companies from Pfizer Inc. (PFE) to
3M Co. (MMM) are beating analysts'' quarterly sales estimates at the
highest rate in 1 1/2 years, undeterred by political gridlock in
Washington and slowing demand in China. </p>
<p>Of 175 companies in the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index that
have reported fourth-quarter results so far, 67 percent have
exceeded analysts'' average revenue projections. That''s the
highest percentage since the second quarter of 2011, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Fewer than half the companies had
surprise sales gains in the second and third quarters. </p>
<p>Pfizer, the world''s largest drugmaker, today reported
revenue of $15.1 billion, beating the estimate of $14.4 billion
in its biggest positive surprise in five quarters. 3M, which
reaches both companies and consumers with products from
sandpaper to Post-it sticky notes, last week exceeded
projections on its best sales gain in a year. </p>
<p>We are seeing a pickup in global growth and business
activity, so companies are beating estimates, Nick Raich,
research director at KeyCorp''s private banking unit in
Cleveland, said yesterday. The unit manages about $25 billion. </p>
<p>Ford Motor Co. (F) topped fourth-quarter sales estimates today
with a 5.8 percent increase on higher F-Series pickup demand.
Ford''s automotive revenue rose to $34.5 billion, ahead of the
$33 billion average prediction on higher F-Series pickup demand. </p>
<p>Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO), the largest U.S. Web portal, yesterday posted
a 4.5 percent sales increase for its biggest jump in more than
four years. The Sunnyvale, California-based company in 2012
recorded its first revenue gain in four years after collecting
higher prices for ads placed on the company''s pages and
increasing revenue from search-related marketing messages. </p>
<h2>Markets Respond </h2>
<p>Yahoo''s profit also beat estimates, putting it among the 76
percent of SP 500 companies reporting so far that exceeded
earnings projections. The third-quarter rate was 71 percent. </p>
<p>While sales gains for SP 500 (SPX) companies may more than
quadruple to 4.6 percent by this year''s third quarter, based on
estimates compiled by Bloomberg, the results may be uneven.
Ford, for example, today said its 2013 loss in Europe may be
bigger than its previous projection because a possible recession
would sap demand for cars. And yesterday, Yahoo''s sales
forecasts for the current quarter and 2013 fell short of
analysts'' predictions. </p>
<p>Even so, stock markets worldwide are reflecting companies''
improving performances. </p>
<p>The SP 500 rose 5.2 percent this year through yesterday,
aided by low interest and mortgage rates that have spurred
borrowing and demand for housing. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)
rose about 3.5 percent in the same period while the FTSE MIB
Index (FTSEMIB), consisting of 40 stocks listed on the Borsa Italiana,
climbed 10 percent. </p>
<h2>Sustained Growth'' </h2>
<p>The economic fundamentals are increasingly warming for
sustained economic growth and higher equity prices, Ed Hyman,
chairman of New York-based International Strategy  Investment
Group, wrote today in a note to clients. Despite tax hikes and
budget-negotiations overhang, weekly, monthly and first-quarter
preliminary economic data seems robust. </p>
<p>St. Paul, Minnesota-based 3M boosted sales by 4.2 percent
with higher demand in the U.S., Latin America and China. Sales
from existing businesses climbed 16 percent in China, even as
economic growth slowed in Asia last year. </p>
<p>For the base business we see a recovery coming and we
feel optimistic about that, 3M Chief Executive Officer Inge Thulin told analysts last week. We''re still cautious. </p>
<p>Reflecting that caution, some of the companies are matching
or beating previously lowered forecasts. Peoria, Illinois-based
Caterpillar Inc. (CAT), the largest maker of construction and mining
equipment, yesterday reported revenue sank 6.8 percent, matching
the average estimate, as machinery dealers cut orders. </p>
<h2>Caterpillar Forecasts </h2>
<p>The second half of 2012 really sputtered, Caterpillar
CEO Doug Oberhelman said in a Jan. 28 interview on Bloomberg
Television. We had the fiscal cliff, the steady din of that,
we had the uncertainty of an election. </p>
<p>Even so, Oberhelman said he is pretty optimistic about
''13 around the world. </p>
<p>The worldwide economy may grow at least 2.5 percent this
year, up from about 2.3 percent in 2012, Caterpillar projected.
The company sees U.S. economic growth of at least 2.5 percent,
helped by housing, and 8.5 percent expansion in China as its
government boosts credit growth and infrastructure spending. </p>
<p>In the U.S., economic growth shows signs of withstanding
political debates about federal deficits and spending. Orders
for durable goods rose in December for an unprecedented fourth
straight month, indicating manufacturing will improve in 2013, a
Commerce Department report showed Jan. 28. </p>
<h2>Broad-Based Gain </h2>
<p>We see just basically broad-based gain, John Herrmann,
president of Herrmann Forecasting LLC in Summit, New Jersey,
said in an interview yesterday on Bloomberg Radio''s Bloomberg
Surveillance. This is just a solid report. We are seeing
more risk taking by businesses and by investors. </p>
<p>Businesses don''t yet know whether lawmakers will avert
across-the-board government spending cuts scheduled to begin
March 1, even after the fiscal pact passed by Congress on Jan. 1
avoided sweeping tax increases that had threatened to crimp
consumer spending. </p>
<p>Our visibility to forecast the coming couple of months is
extremely limited, Erik Gershwind, CEO of MSC Industrial
Direct Co., told analysts earlier this month. Fiscal first-
quarter revenue for the Melville, New York-based company missed
analysts'' estimates, as did its profit forecast for the second
quarter, after customers restrained orders, he said. </p>
<p>For now, Caterpillar''s CEO said 2013 is shaping up for
improved performance worldwide. </p>
<p>China certainly is stronger today, Oberhelman told
Bloomberg Television. Latin America looks pretty good. Boy,
the drumbeat out of Europe is sure behind us. All the bad news
is out, at least for a while. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley, (M) once OAO Rosneft''s
favorite investment bank, is seeking to regain its mergers and
acquisitions lead in Moscow after losing its two best dealmakers
to Russia''s largest oil company. </p>
<p>The New York-based bank, Russia''s top MA adviser in 2010
and 2011, tumbled to seventh in 2012 after Rosneft hired Morgan
Stanley (MS) Russia Chairman Rair Simonyan and President Elena Titova
to run its financial unit, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley lost ground to Bank of America Corp. and
Citigroup Inc. (C), which are advising Rosneft on the two halves of
its record $55 billion acquisition of TNK-BP from BP Plc and a
group of billionaires. Morgan Stanley is advising London-based
BP on its deal. </p>
<p>Russia is a priority area for us, Gergely Voros, Morgan
Stanley''s co-head for Russia, said in an interview in Moscow on
Jan. 24. We have, by and large, avoided the cuts that you have
seen elsewhere in the industry here, and we would selectively
hire where there is a business need. </p>
<p>Russian companies did 373 mergers and acquisitions valued
at $109 billion last year, the most since 2007''s record $128
billion and 60 percent more than 2011''s $68 billion, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Deutsche, VTB </h2>
<p>Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) advised on 15 transactions valued at $70.1
billion, making the Frankfurt-based company the largest
dealmaker in the country last year, a position it last held in
2006. Bank of America''s Merrill Lynch unit was second with six
transactions valued at $66.3 billion, followed by VTB Capital, a
unit of Russia''s second-largest lender, with 20 deals at $65.5
billion. </p>
<p>Voros, 41, a Harvard-educated Hungarian citizen, declined
to comment on why Morgan Stanley isn''t advising Rosneft on the
TNK-BP deal. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley was one of the first U.S. financial firms to
enter Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union, opening an
office in Moscow in 1994. It has benefited from more than a
decade of close relations with state-run Rosneft, which is
headed by Igor Sechin, a longtime ally of President Vladimir Putin and a former deputy prime minister. </p>
<p>The bank advised Rosneft on its $10.4 billion initial
public offering in 2006, the biggest in the world that year and
the largest by a Russian company. It also advised on Rosneft''s
debut $3 billion euro bond in December. </p>
<h2>No Shock'' </h2>
<p>Rosneft has poached senior Morgan Stanley bankers in the
past. Last June, Dmitry Avdeev left as co-head of investment
banking to become Rosneft''s vice president for finance, a role
previously held by Morgan Stanley alumni Peter O''Brien and Pavel Fedorov, who is now a deputy energy minister. </p>
<p>Simonyan, 65, who joined Morgan Stanley in 1998 after
serving as first vice president of Rosneft in 1996 and 1997, has
been a director at state-run companies including pipeline
monopoly OAO Transneft and OAO Zarubezhneft. Titova joined
Morgan Stanley in 2006 from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), where she
ran its Moscow office. </p>
<p>It wasn''t a shock, said Voros. Rair''s departure was a
natural transition from more than a decade of investment banking
with us. The reality is that there is a very strong bench of
bankers in our business. </p>
<p>Rosneft Bank may in the future compete for investment
banking mandates, Simonyan told reporters in Moscow in November.
Its priority is to hedge its parent''s oil-trading risk, he said.
The pair were joined by 10 support staff from Morgan Stanley''s
Moscow office and Walid Chammah, the former chairman of Morgan
Stanley''s international business. </p>
<h2>Sberbank, MegaFon </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley named Voros and Mikhail Soloviev co-heads of
its Russian business in August, with responsibility for
investment banking and debt sales and trading, respectively. It
hired Oleg Vyugin, a former head of the country''s markets
watchdog, as a senior adviser this month. </p>
<p>The bank was No. 2 in organizing Russian equity sales last
year, behind Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), thanks to its work on the
two biggest deals, by OAO Sberbank and OAO MegaFon, Bloomberg
data show. As well as Rosneft, Morgan Stanley advised on bonds
issued by state development bank VEB, coal producer OAO
Raspadskaya and billionaire Vladimir Evtushenkov''s AFK Sistema
holding company. </p>
<p>The lender, which has been focusing on the Ukraine debt
market, has had a lower market share in Russia euro bonds. It

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) signed on McDonald''s Corp. (MCD)''s South Africa division as a
customer for its business-focused social-networking software,
landing the highest-profile client yet for the product. </p>
<p>McDonald''s will have 8,000 employees in South Africa using
the Connections software, IBM said today in a statement. The
product is part of an effort to create internal networks for
companies, letting employees use Facebook-style tools to
communicate, sign off on documents and report expenses. </p>
<p>IBM aims to build on the McDonald''s contract by winning
deals with other retail and food-services business. After years
of sluggish revenue, the world''s biggest computer-services
provider sees social-networking software as a source of growth.
The company declined to give financial terms for the contract
with McDonald''s, the largest fast-food chain by sales. </p>
<p>It''s really going to attract more companies, said Sandy
Carter, vice president of social-business strategy for Armonk,
New York-based IBM. McDonald''s South Africa also demonstrates
that the power of social has moved beyond major markets into the
emerging opportunity. </p>
<p>After a $1.3 billion acquisition of Kenexa Corp.''s human-
resources software last year -- along with several data-analysis
companies -- IBM is betting its social software can compete with
offerings from Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Salesforce.com Inc. and Jive
Software Inc. By making it easier for employees to access and
share data, social-networking services will help IBM make $16
billion from business analytics by 2015, the company has said. </p>
<p>IBM shares fell less than 1 percent to $203.07 at the close
today in New York. The stock gained 4.2 percent last year,
compared with a 13 percent gain for the Standard  Poor''s 500
Index. </p>

<p>The tumble in Argentine stocks that
sent valuations to an almost four-year low has spurred Morgan
Stanley Investment Management and BlackRock Inc. (BLK) to buy. </p>
<p>Timothy Drinkall, whose Morgan Stanley Frontier Emerging
Markets Portfolio (MFMIX) rose 26 percent in the past 12 months, said he
bought Argentine shares last year after avoiding the country
altogether earlier in 2012. By Dec. 31, the nation''s equities
accounted for a larger percentage of holdings than were in the
fund''s benchmark index, he said in a Jan. 23 phone interview. </p>
<p>The MSCI Argentina Index of five companies with operations
in the South American country has rebounded 16 percent this year
following a 39 percent rout in 2012 that was sparked by
President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner''s seizure of the
nation''s largest oil company and restriction of imports and
capital flows. Fernandez may ease import curbs this year as she
seeks to boost economic growth before mid-term congressional
elections in October, according to Drinkall. </p>
<p>Valuations are at extreme low levels, said Drinkall,
whose frontier fund beat 98 percent of peers tracked by
Bloomberg during the past 12 months. Sometimes for a market to
adjust upwards, things just have to be less bad. </p>
<p>The MSCI Argentina (MXAR) gauge, which tracks the U.S.-listed
shares of two banks, two oil producers and the nation''s largest
telecommunications company, was valued at 1.1 times net assets
on Jan. 30, about 30 percent below its four-year average and
less than the multiple of 1.5 for the MSCI Frontier Markets
Index (MXFM), according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Argentina
measure sank to 0.67 times on Nov. 16, the lowest since March
2009. </p>
<h2>Currency Controls </h2>
<p>Argentine shares had a 3.5 percent weighting in the MSCI
frontier index as of Jan. 30, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The MSCI Argentina Index was little changed today at 9:37
a.m. in New York trading. </p>
<p>The BlackRock Frontiers Investment Trust Plc (BRFI), which had
about $132 million of assets as of Dec. 31, increased its
position in Argentine stocks to 3.9 percent of total holdings
from 2.4 percent in July, the fund said in a Jan. 16 statement.
Sam Vecht, who manages the trust, said by phone on Jan. 18 he''s
turning more positive on Argentina after valuations fell. </p>
<p>Government controls on imports and currency markets have
weakened Argentina''s economy and may be contributing to
Fernandez''s declining popularity, said Drinkall, who helps
oversee about $300 million in New York. The president has banned
the purchase of dollars for savings or real estate investments
and forced insurers to repatriate their money held abroad. The
peso plunged about 40 percent in the past 12 months in an
unregulated foreign-exchange market that Argentines use to
acquire dollars. </p>
<h2>Approval Rating </h2>
<p>Fernandez''s approval rating plummeted to 29.8 percent in
December from 64.1 percent when she was re-elected in October
2011, according to a poll by Buenos Aires-based Management 
Fit. About 2 million demonstrators protested against inflation,
crime and currency controls in cities across the country on Nov.
8. </p>
<p>Her ability to implement some of the negative policies
has been curtailed by her waning popularity, said Drinkall,
who traveled to Argentina in December. </p>
<p>The economy may expand between 2 percent to 3 percent this
year, up from an estimated rate of less than 1 percent in 2012,
helping to boost corporate profits, Drinkall said. He declined
to disclose which stocks he bought. </p>
<p>The odds of government meddling in listed companies are
still too high to invest in Argentine equities, Thomas Vester Nielsen, who helps oversee more than $250 million in frontier
markets as a senior money manager at Lloyd George Management in
London, said in a Jan. 14 phone interview. </p>
<h2>YPF Rout </h2>
<p>The U.S.-listed shares of YPF SA (YPFD) have lost about 50 percent
of their value during the past 12 months as Fernandez seized
control in April, ousting Spanish owner Repsol SA amid a dispute
over slumping output and investments. </p>
<p>The cost to protect Argentine government debt against
default for five years using credit-default swaps has almost
tripled during the past year to about 2,100 basis points,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That''s the highest
among countries tracked by Bloomberg after Greece. </p>
<p>In 2001, Argentina''s $95 billion default sent the stock
market tumbling. The MSCI Argentina index fell 22 percent that
year and another 51 percent in 2002. It returned 288 percent
since then including dividends, compared with a 136 percent
rally in the MSCI frontier gauge. </p>
<p>Argentina is moving in the wrong direction, Hans-Henrik Skov, who manages the BankInvest New Emerging Markets Equities
Fund from Copenhagen, said in a Jan. 15 phone interview. It
will definitely have its rallies from time to time, but I''m
comfortable missing out on those. </p>
<h2>Chevron, Bridas </h2>
<p>Foreign companies'' increased interest in Argentina''s shale
fuel deposits may signal easing concern about the risk of doing
business in the country, according to Vecht, who manages
developing-nation funds at BlackRock, the world''s largest asset
manager. YPF (YPF) struck agreements with Chevron Corp. (CVX) and Bridas
International in December to develop shale reserves. </p>
<p>We had been very negative but we''re looking to move in a
more positive direction because markets have come off so much,
said Vecht, who''s based in London. There are obviously severe
challenges. But if things were to change, markets could move up
quite significantly. </p>

<p>General Electric Co. (GE) Chairman
Jeffrey Immelt said the company will invest $1 billion in

<p>We are committed to playing our part in the sustainable
growth of the country and the positive impact this will have on
Nigeria and the continent of Africa as a whole, Immelt said in
a statement handed to reporters today in Abuja during the
signing of the agreement with Trade and Investment Minister
Olusegun Aganga. </p>
<p>GE will invest $250 in capital expenditure that will make
Nigeria a regional hub in manufacturing and services. The
company will make products that would support power generation
and oil and gas exploration and production. </p>
<p>Africa''s top oil producer and most populous country of more
than 160 million people is seeking increased investments in
power to meet demand that''s more than double the current output
of about 4,000 megawatts. The government has ended state
monopoly of power utilities and sold generation and distribution
companies to private investors. </p>
<p>The manufacturing plant will be based in the southeastern
city of Calabar in Cross River state, and additional investments
will be made in the company''s service workshops in the southern
oil hub of Port Harcourt and Onne port nearby. </p>
<p>More than $800 million of investments will go to sourcing of
goods, services and staff over the next five years. The investment 
is expected to create 2,300 jobs, 300 of which will be direct GE
hires and the remaining 2,000 indirect jobs created through GE
suppliers, the company said in the statement. </p>
<p>GE will produce power turbines for domestic use and export,
Aganga told reporters after the signing ceremony. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. energy company, said fourth-quarter profit increased 41
percent to a record $7.25 billion as it reported stronger
refining results and a gain from an Australian natural gas field
swap. </p>
<p>Net income rose to $3.70 a share from $2.58, or $5.12
billion, a year earlier, the San Ramon, California-based company
said in a statement today. Chevron was expected to report per-
share profit of $3.06, based on the average of 19 analysts''
estimate compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales fell 3 percent to $56.3
billion. </p>
<p>Chevron''s refining segment returned to profit from a loss a
year earlier as rising supplies from U.S. shale formations
lowered crude input costs and processing margins climbed 46
percent. Chevron also benefited as crude prices rose in
international energy markets. About 75 percent of the company''s
crude is pumped from non-U.S. wells. </p>
<p>Chevron Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John S. Watson
plans to spend $36.7 billion this year to explore for oil, build
gas export terminals and upgrade oil refineries. The company
expects to reach output equivalent to 3.3 million barrels a day
in 2017. </p>
<p>Strong cash flows allowed us to invest aggressively in
our major capital projects and to acquire several important, new
resource opportunities, Watson said. We also raised the
dividend on our common shares for the 25th consecutive year and
continued our share repurchase program. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Chevron Corp. (CVX),
the largest U.S. energy producers, are boosting profits with oil
refineries that some analysts and investors urged them to divest
as recently as last year. </p>
<p>Earnings from processing crude into fuels such as gasoline
and diesel more than made up for lagging returns from oil and
natural gas exploration during the final three months of 2012,
Exxon and Chevron reported today. Fuel refining helped propel
fourth-quarter net income to a five-year high of almost $9.95
billion for Exxon and a record $7.25 billion for Chevron. </p>
<p>Exxon, the world''s biggest refiner, and Chevron, operator
of fuel plants from South Korea to Mississippi, have resisted
the trend among peers such as Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO) and
ConocoPhillips of spinning off refineries to focus on oil
drilling. The persistence is paying off: Exxon posted the
second-highest annual profit in U.S. history last year,
surpassed only by its own all-time high from 2008, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Even though refining has long been seen by some as a drag

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM)''s plan to spend almost $15 billion on deals through 2015
is turning NetApp Inc. (NTAP) and Splunk Inc. (SPLK) into takeover candidates. </p>
<p>IBM finds itself looking for deals after sales increased
just 0.8 percent in four years, the worst rate since the period
that ended in 2002, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Investors have taken notice, with its shares lagging behind
those of rivals Oracle Corp. and SAP AG by the most in at least
nine years in 2012, the data show. </p>
<p>The company, with a market value of $232 billion, has
identified areas for expansion through the end of 2015. Sterne
Agee  Leach Inc. sees NetApp, which has almost doubled revenue
since 2008, strengthening IBM''s standing in cloud storage.
Splunk, which has rallied almost twofold since its initial
public offering last year, would help IBM meet a goal of growing
in data analytics, according to Credit Agricole SA. Royal Bank
of Canada says Imperva Inc. (IMPV) would bolster its position in
security products. </p>
<p>It''ll probably be a surprise acquisition that will really
get things going, Laurence Balter, an analyst with Oracle
Investment Research in Fox Island, Washington, said in a
telephone interview. Unless IBM does something real
interesting, an acquisition down the road or something that will
stir up growth, we''re at a little bit of a plateau. </p>
<h2>Biggest Deals </h2>
<p>James Sciales, a spokesman for Armonk, New York-based IBM,
said the company doesn''t comment on potential acquisition
targets. NetApp''s Roger Villareal, Splunk''s Ken Tinsley and
Imperva''s Rob Rachwald also declined to comment. </p>
<p>IBM shares rose 1 percent to $205.18 today, closing at the
highest price in more than three months. NetApp climbed 0.7
percent to $36.25, Splunk rallied 2.9 percent to $33.90, and
Imperva added 2 percent to $35. </p>
<p>IBM has faced pressure for years to expand through deals,
with investors saying in 2010 that profit growth hinged on doing
a multibillion-dollar acquisition. The company managed to
increase net income to $16.6 billion last year, up 12 percent
from $14.8 billion in 2010, even without announcing any
transactions that eclipsed its two biggest: the 2008 purchase of
Cognos Inc. for $4.5 billion and the $3.9 billion deal for
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP''s consulting business in 2002. Both
figures include net debt. </p>
<p>The company''s preference is to strike deals valued at $200
million to $1.5 billion, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge
said in May. We are not looking at big acquisitions, nor do we
want to communicate that we''re looking at big acquisitions, he
said during the presentation at a conference. </p>
<h2>Larger Scale'' </h2>
<p>To make a difference in IBM''s revenue, which totaled $104.5
billion last year, up just 0.8 percent since 2008, the company
may have to consider bigger transactions, said Joe Foresi, a
Boston-based analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC. </p>
<p>Clearly, given the size of the company, acquisitions will
have to be on a larger scale, he said in a phone interview. </p>
<p>IBM has a goal of doing $20 billion of deals from the start
of 2011 through the end of 2015. Counting already announced
transactions, IBM has $14.5 billion left to spend. IBM completed
11 purchases in 2012, including five in data analysis and two in
cloud computing, according to the company. It bought Worklight
Inc. for mobile tools and spent $1.2 billion including net cash
on Kenexa Corp. to add social business capabilities. </p>
<h2>Takeover Speculation </h2>
<p>Splunk, a $3.3 billion company based in San Francisco,
could help IBM grab a larger slice of the global market for
analyzing large, complex databases that should reach $48.3
billion by 2018, up from $6.3 billion in 2012, according to
Transparency Market Research. Splunk also has intellectual
property for data analysis that would be valuable to IBM, said
Edward Maguire, a New York-based analyst at Credit Agricole. </p>
<p>Splunk''s shares rose 6.9 percent on Jan. 15 amid
speculation it could be bought by IBM or Oracle, according to
Brian White, an analyst at Topeka Capital Markets Inc. </p>
<p>Buying Splunk makes sense from a products perspective,
because Splunk is a gigantic analytics engine, Peter Goldmacher, a San Francisco-based analyst at Cowen Group Inc.,
said in a phone interview. It can take data from data centers
or cars or planes, and that''s what IBM is all about. </p>
<p>Analysts estimate Splunk''s sales increased 60 percent in
the fiscal year that ended in January, according to the average
of projections compiled by Bloomberg. It went public in April
and has since rallied 94 percent. </p>
<p>IBM today said it''s buying Star Analytics Inc. for an
undisclosed amount. The Redwood City, California-based company
integrates business information and helps sort out what''s
important, eliminating time-consuming steps for data analysis. </p>
<h2>Weak Areas'' </h2>
<p>NetApp, valued at $13 billion, has been speculated as an
IBM target for years, said Shaw Wu, a San Francisco-based
analyst at Sterne Agee  Leach. The computer-storage company
would bolster IBM''s cloud-computing plans, he said. </p>
<p>Storage is definitely one of the weak areas for the
company, Wu said in a phone interview. For them to get
stronger there would make sense. </p>
<p>The analyst said IBM may have to pay a 30 percent to 100
percent premium for NetApp, which at current prices would exceed
the $14.5 billion left in IBM''s projected takeover budget. </p>
<p>Adding Imperva, valued at $842 million, would help IBM''s
customers better protect applications and data, particularly
information on remote servers referred to as the cloud, said
Amit Daryanani, a San Francisco-based analyst at RBC. </p>
<h2>Juniper, Akamai </h2>
<p>Sales at the Redwood Shores, California-based company rose
30 percent in 2012, according to the average of analysts''
forecasts compiled by Bloomberg. Imperva''s software for managing
databases, files, Web applications, servers and hardware
appliances is used by more than 2,000 customers -- including top
telecommunications providers, U.S. banks and government agencies
-- in over 60 countries. </p>
<p>Sterne Agee''s Wu said that a purchase of Juniper Networks
Inc. (JNPR) would add higher-margin hardware, helping IBM compete with
Cisco Systems Inc., while adding security capabilities. Akamai
Technologies Inc. (AKAM) would bolster IBM''s cloud plans, he said. </p>
<p>Juniper''s Cindy Ta and Akamai''s Rob Morton declined to
comment. </p>
<p>Today, shares of Juniper declined 0.3 percent to $22.32.
Akamai rallied 2.7 percent, the most in a month, to $41.81. </p>
<p>IBM rallied 4.4 percent on Jan. 23, the most in a year,
after the world''s biggest computer-services provider forecast
profit that exceeded analysts'' estimates. Last year, shares of
Redwood City, California-based Oracle rallied 30 percent, versus
IBM''s 4.2 percent gain, while SAP of Walldorf, Germany, rose 49
percent. Oracle won by the most since 1999, while SAP last
outperformed IBM by that amount in 2003. </p>
<p>They''re probably aware that the absence of top-line
growth hurts the stock price, David Grossman, a San Francisco-
based analyst at Stifel Financial Corp., said in a phone
interview. They''re constantly evolving their strategy. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world''s
largest company by market value, expects to begin bitumen
production at its Kearl oil sands project in Alberta before the
end of March after weather delays, a company executive said. </p>
<p>Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, is stockpiling ore and
preparing to introduce solvent to the processing plant, David Rosenthal, vice president of investor relations, said during a
conference call today. Initial production will be about 37,000
barrels a day, increasing to 110,000 by the end of 2013. </p>
<p>The weather situation was a major factor in the startup
moving from what we had originally said by the end of the year
to the first quarter, he said. Weather came earlier than
normal, and then it has just been brutally cold up there. And so
we''ve had to adjust accordingly. </p>
<p>Lagging infrastructure has created a glut of oil in Alberta
that pushed prices to a record discount to U.S. crude in
December. Western Canada Select oil in Alberta was priced at a
$42.50-a-barrel discount to West Texas Intermediate in Cushing,
Oklahoma, on Dec. 14, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It was at $31.50 below the U.S. benchmark at 12:13 p.m. New York
time today. </p>
<p>Exxon can run all 110,000 barrels of Kearl production in
its own refineries, Rosenthal said. </p>
<p>We may elect to put some into third-party refineries, but
we do not have an issue in terms of logistics moving those

<p>Online companies may face action by
Congress to toughen U.S. privacy standards if they don''t do a
better job of protecting the privacy of mobile device users,
Federal Trade Commission Chairman Jon Leibowitz said today. </p>
<p>If some companies don''t wake up and do the right thing,
my sense is that industry is far more likely to face much more
prescriptive laws down the road, Leibowitz, the outgoing FTC
head, said on a conference call with reporters. I don''t think
that''s going to be very far down the road because privacy is the
quintessential bipartisan issue in Congress. </p>
<p>The FTC today released a set of mobile-privacy
recommendations for application stores, such as those run by
Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG), app developers and online
advertising networks. FTC staff strongly encourages
companies to adopt the non-binding guidelines, the agency said
in a news release. </p>
<p>The growing popularity of mobile devices and apps that can,
for example, track a user''s location and habits has prompted
hearings and proposals by U.S. lawmakers for privacy
legislation. Mobile application store revenue is expected to
reach $74 billion in 2016, from $15 billion last year, according
to technology research firm Gartner Inc. </p>
<h2>Massive'' Data </h2>
<p>The FTC report is reminder to industry that the agency is
on the case, said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the
Center for Digital Democracy, a Washington-based privacy group.
At the same time, Chester said the report fell short by focusing
on how companies disclose their data practices without looking
at the broader issue of how they collect information from users. </p>
<p>Consumers aren''t aware of the massive amounts of data
scooped out of the mobile device that are used, analyzed and
sold to the highest bidder, Chester said. </p>
<p>The FTC also announced a settlement today with Path Inc.,
the developer of a mobile social-networking application, over
complaints that it deceived consumers by collecting personal
information from mobile address books. </p>
<p>As part of the settlement, Path will develop a
comprehensive privacy program and submit to independent privacy
assessments over the next 20 years, according to the FTC. The
company will also pay $800,000 to settle charges that it
illegally collected data from about 3,000 children without
getting their parents'' consent. Path said in a blog post that it
has since closed those accounts. </p>
<h2>Leibowitz Leaving </h2>
<p>The FTC mobile-privacy report is one of the agency''s last
actions under Leibowitz, who said that he will leave for the
private sector by Feb. 15 after eight years at the commission. </p>
<p>The report contains guidelines for mobile platforms
such as Apple and Google, recommending that they develop a
dashboard for users to see the type of content accessed by apps
they have downloaded; tell users to what extent they review apps
before making them available; and offer a do not track
mechanism to let consumers prevent tracking by ad networks and
other third parties. </p>
<p>Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr declined to comment. Niki Fenwick, spokeswoman for Google, didn''t immediately respond to
an email seeking comment. </p>
<p>The report says app developers should immediately get
consumers'' consent before accessing and sharing sensitive
information and do a better job of understanding how they
integrate with ad networks to provide better disclosure to users
about information that''s being collected. </p>
<h2>California Effort </h2>
<p>The Commission''s recommendation to make privacy policies
a requirement for apps is a sensible step and one that ACT has
been advocating to its members for some time, Morgan Reed,
executive director of the Association for Competitive
Technology, a group representing 5,000 app developers and
technology firms, said in an e-mail message. </p>
<p>California Attorney General Kamala Harris has taken a
prominent role in mobile-privacy efforts, warning companies to
adhere to a state law requiring apps to have a privacy policy.
Harris announced last February that Apple, Google, and other
mobile platforms signed an agreement to encourage compliance
with the law. </p>
<p>Separate from the FTC, the U.S. Commerce Department is
holding a series of meetings involving companies and consumer
advocates to hammer out a voluntary code of conduct for
informing users about the kinds of personal data their mobile
applications collect and how the information is used. </p>

<p>LEG Immobilien AG, which completed
the largest initial public offering for a German property
company yesterday, unchanged on its first day of trading as
analysts questioned whether its homes will grow in value. </p>
<p>Considering their portfolio, the pricing was very
ambitious, said Georg Kanders, an analyst at Bankhaus Lampe
KG. Many of LEG''s apartments are in small cities whose
population is shrinking, he said. Some are in regions with
struggling economies. The quality of the properties'' locations
doesn''t justify the price. </p>
<p>LEG Immobilien, which became Germany''s largest publicly
traded property company by market value through the IPO, closed
at 44 euros in Frankfurt, giving the company a market value of
2.3 billion euros. Before the IPO, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
owned 95 percent of the company. </p>
<p>German property stocks have been in demand as investors
seeking a safe haven amid the European sovereign debt crisis.
Stocks of companies that own homes in booming cities such as
Berlin trade more expensively than those with properties in
smaller cities. </p>
<p>We''re comfortable with our share price development
today, LEG Chief Executive Officer Thomas Hegel said in an
interview. Our IPO was clearly oversubscribed. We''re a long-
term product. </p>
<p>Deutsche Wohnen, Germany''s second-largest listed property
company has about 50% of its apartments in the German capital
and trades at 19 percent above its net asset value, according to
data compiled by Warburg Research GmbH. NAV measures the value
of a property company''s buildings excluding debt. By contrast,
TAG Immobilien AG (TEG), whose holdings are more widely scattered
among smaller cities, trades at a 5 percent discount, according
to Warburg. </p>
<p>The share is expensive compared to its peers, said
Torsten Klingner, an analyst at Warburg Research. LEG''s IPO was
priced at 16 percent above its net asset value, which is higher
than the average of other German residential companies, he said.
I don''t see any upside. </p>
<h2>LEG Regions </h2>
<p>LEG owns 91,000 apartments in North Rhine-Westphalia,
Germany''s most populous state. The state''s gross domestic
product is the country''s highest, according to data compiled by
the state government. </p>
<p>Some cities, especially former mining centers such as
Dortmund and Essen, have falling populations and declining
economies, said Ralph Henger, an economist at the IW Koeln
economic institute. </p>
<p>LEG has about 70% of its apartments in cities with
shrinking populations, according to data compiled by Warburg. </p>
<p>North Rhine-Westphalia has the highest population density
in Germany, and it''s a place where people rent their homes,
Hegel said. We have properties in extraordinary locations and
they''re widely spread. </p>
