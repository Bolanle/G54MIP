&lt;p&gt;SodaStream International Ltd. (SODA), the
Israeli maker of soda machines trading at the most expensive
level since February, will extend last year&#8217;s 37 percent climb
as its U.S. business grows, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of the company, based in Airport City, Israel,
climbed 12 percent last week in New York to $48.69, the highest
level since Aug. 15, 2011. It was the biggest gainer on the
Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index (ISRA25BN) of the largest U.S.-traded
Israeli companies, which rallied 1.6 percent in its first weekly
advance since November. Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX) rose 3.2
percent Jan. 4, trimming its slide in the week to 13 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SodaStream, which sells its machines, gas canisters and
flavors in Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), trades at 18.3 times estimated
earnings, the highest level since Feb. 29. The U.S. will
contribute 39 percent of SodaStream&#8217;s sales this year, according
to JPMorgan, from 29 percent in 2011. The company will post a 44
percent jump in adjusted net income in the first quarter, the
median of analysts&#8217; estimates shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As the top line continues to grow, and more U.S. revenue
switches to canisters and flavors, the profitability in the U.S.
business will improve,&#8221; John Faucher, an analyst at JPMorgan
who rates SodaStream a buy, said by phone in New York Jan. 4.
&#8220;That&#8217;s a trend that benefits SodaStream.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index ended last week at
86.78. Israel&#8217;s TA-25 Index (TA-25) rose 0.7 percent to 1,218.84 at
10:57 a.m. in Tel Aviv. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rising Income &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SodaStream, which is counting on a commercial during next
month&#8217;s Super Bowl to boost U.S. sales, will post net income in
the first quarter of $14.6 million, according to the average of
four analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales in the
first quarter will rise 23 percent, according to the average of
five forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock is trading at its widest premium versus the
average valuation for companies on the Nasdaq Composite Index
since at least February, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SodaStream began to roll out its products in May at 2,900
stores owned by Wal-Mart, the world&#8217;s largest retailer, while
its machines have also been available since at least the second
quarter at Target Corp., Staples Inc. and Bed Bath  Beyond
Inc., as well as department stores owned by J.C. Penney Co. (JCP) and
Macy&#8217;s Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the shares have soared, bets on its decline have
decreased. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SodaStream&#8217;s 9.6 percent rally in the second half of 2012
came as short interest on the stock declined to 8.1 million
shares, or 45 percent of the company&#8217;s float, at the end of
December from 10.8 million shares in May, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fad Concerns &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors have been shorting SodaStream on concern the
product, which carbonates tap water, is a fad and that revenue
growth will slow as copycat machines and products encroach on
market share, Faucher said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mellanox plunged last week in the U.S. to $52.31, after the
Yokneam Elit, Israel-based developer of data management
technology cut its fourth-quarter sales forecast to between $119
million and $121 million, compared with revenue guidance given
in October of $145 million to $150 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of the company rose Jan. 4 after Chief Executive
Officer Eyal Waldman said in an interview after markets closed
the day before that he expects $150 million in quarterly sales
to again become the &#8220;base line sometime in 2013.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mellanox&#8217;s revenue in the third quarter reached a record
$156.5 million. The shares in Tel Aviv rose 3.7 percent to
197.4, or the equivalent of $52.32, this morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allot Communications Ltd. (ALLT), which develops products to track
wireless traffic, tumbled 16 percent last week to $14.63 in New
York after Oppenheimer  Co. said fourth-quarter sales will miss
analysts&#8217; estimates. Shares of Hod Hasharon, Israel-based Allot
traded in Tel Aviv lost 8.7 percent this morning to 55.69
shekels, or the equivalent of $14.76, heading for the lowest
close since November 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ittai Kidron, a New York-based analyst at Oppenheimer,
wrote in a Jan. 3 report that Allot will report fourth-quarter
sales of $28.6 million and net income of $5 million, missing the
mean for revenue of $31.09 million and profit of $5.5 million of
11 analysts&#8217; estimates collated by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s plans to develop
a $14 billion underwater oil field off Newfoundland&#8217;s coast
allows the world&#8217;s biggest energy company to hedge against
discounted crude from Canada&#8217;s oil sands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The better pricing is definitely an issue,&#8221; Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones  Co. said by phone from
St. Louis on Jan. 4. &#8220;While things could change in the time it
takes to finish the project, it&#8217;s a great way for Exxon to hedge
their pricing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment to capture 700 million barrels of heavy
undersea crude at the field about 350 kilometers (218 miles)
southeast of St. John&#8217;s rivals spending in Alberta&#8217;s oil sands,
where the estimated 170 billion barrels of recoverable reserves
attracted C$23 billion ($23.2 billion) in spending last year.
Newfoundland and Labrador oil is priced off the global
benchmark, almost twice as high as western Canada&#8217;s heavy crude,
and will help Exxon add to profit growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Exxon and global competitors seek to lock up reserves in
increasingly hard-to-reach terrain, offshore Canadian oil in
Newfoundland and the Arctic is becoming more attractive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebron project puts Canada&#8217;s offshore assets, not
normally the subject of a lot of development &#8220;chatter,&#8221; back
on the map, Jennifer Stevenson, a vice president who helps
manage about C$100 billion at Dynamic Funds in Toronto, said on
Jan. 4. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imax Corp. (IMAX) rose to its highest price
in more than five months after JPMorgan Chase  Co. boosted its
sales and profit forecasts on higher-than-expected audience
turnout for 3-D films such as &#8220;The Hobbit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imax gained 5.4 percent in Toronto to C$23.75, the highest
price since July 25. It was also the biggest gain since Oct. 11
for the Mississauga, Ontario-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Hobbit,&#8221; a prequel to Peter Jackson&#8217;s &#8220;Lord of the
Rings&#8221; saga, grossed $46 million for Imax in December and
continues to perform well in January, said Townsend Buckles, a
JPMorgan analyst in New York, in a research note dated today. He
raised his expectations for Imax&#8217;s fourth-quarter box office
receipts to $146 million from $130 million and for adjusted
earnings to 18 cents a share from 17 cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Imax experience continues to be very engaging for
theatergoers,&#8221; said Paul Sweeney, a media analyst with
Bloomberg Industries, in a telephone interview from Skillman,
New Jersey. &#8220;Although the outlook for 3-D films may have
sobered up in 2012, Imax remains very robust.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Sweeney, 3-D now accounts for about 45 percent
to 50 percent of a given film&#8217;s box-office receipts, less than
industry analysts had expected since the technology regained
popularity with James Cameron&#8217;s 2009 blockbuster &#8220;Avatar.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imax has placed its theaters in city areas with
demographics that can afford the premium price, as well as
expansion into developing markets, especially Brazil, Sweeney
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Strong Profits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imax&#8217;s growth in emerging markets and its slate of
blockbuster movies will make profits &#8220;strong&#8221; this year and
next, Buckles said in his note. He didn&#8217;t immediately return a
phone message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film industry&#8217;s box-office growth in 2012 is expected
to continue this year, Sweeney said. Domestic box-office
receipts rose 6.1 percent in 2012 to $10.8 billion, the first
year-over-year increase since 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imax Chief Executive Officer Richard Gelfond wasn&#8217;t
immediately available for an interview, said Whit Clay, a
company spokesman who works for Sloane  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Tom Schoenberg" date="Jan 07, 2013  3:09 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-07/jpmorgan-seeks-liability-shield-in-wamu-bondholder-suit.html"><headline>JPMorgan Seeks Liability Shield in WaMu Bondholder Suit</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) asked a federal
judge to order the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to cover any
costs or liabilities in a bondholder case stemming from the
bank&#8217;s takeover of Washington Mutual Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, in a filing today in Washington, said that under
the terms of a 2008 agreement with the FDIC it shouldn&#8217;t be on
the hook for any damages, attorneys&#8217; fees or court costs in a
lawsuit filed by Washington Mutual bondholders accusing the bank
of being involved in a scheme to deprive them of their
investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it picked up Washington Mutual banking operations in
September 2008, JPMorgan &#8220;assumed only certain defined
liabilities,&#8221; which didn&#8217;t include WaMu&#8217;s bond obligations,
according to the filing. WaMu&#8217;s debt obligations -- including
the bonds at issue in the case -- were liabilities that remained
with the FDIC, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As a result of this action, the JPMC defendants have
suffered significant harm,&#8221; attorney Brent McIntosh of Sullivan
 Cromwell LLP wrote in the filing, referring to the suit. New
York-based JPMorgan has &#8220;been forced to litigate this action
for close to four years and incurred substantial costs and
expenses,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal judge dismissed the suit in 2010 after finding
that the bondholders hadn&#8217;t sought recovery through the FDIC&#8217;s
administrative claims process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Case Revived &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case was revived on appeal in 2011 by a three-judge
panel, which ruled that the court had jurisdiction because the
bondholders&#8217; allegations of wrongdoing were made against
JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If JPMorgan thinks the FDIC is responsible for the
damages my client suffered, that is between them,&#8221; Andrew J.
Mytelka, a lawyer for the bondholders, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Barr, an FDIC spokesman, said the agency doesn&#8217;t
comment on active litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is American National Insurance Co. v. Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp., 09-cv-01743, U.S. District Court,
District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By David McLaughlin" date="Jan 07, 2013  1:48 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-07/jpmorgan-asks-court-to-dismiss-n-y-mortgage-suit-as-late.html"><headline>JPMorgan Says New York Filed Bear Stearns Suit Too Late</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;New York&#8217;s fraud lawsuit against
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) over mortgage securities sold to investors
must be dismissed because the time for bringing the claims has
expired, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman&#8217;s complaint is
barred by a three-year statute of limitations, JPMorgan said in
papers dated Jan. 4 and filed in New York State Supreme Court in
Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schneiderman sued New York-based JPMorgan in October,
alleging that Bear Stearns, the investment bank it acquired in
2008, deceived investors about mortgage loans backing
securities, leading to losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schneiderman, who was named co-chairman of a state-federal
group formed to investigate misconduct in the bundling of
mortgage loans into securities, has said the JPMorgan case would
serve as a template for lawsuits against other issuers. The
state has also sued Credit Suisse Group AG (CS) on similar grounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York&#8217;s claims stem from Bear Stearns&#8217; role as sponsor
and underwriter of subprime and Alt-A mortgage-backed securities
before JPMorgan acquired the securities firm. Losses on $87
billion of securities from 2006 and 2007 total about $22.5
billion, according to the state&#8217;s complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Will Prevail&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are confident that our office will prevail, and that
those responsible for the misconduct that led to the crash of
the housing market and the collapse of the American economy will
be held accountable,&#8221; James Freedland, a spokesman for
Schneiderman, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is among 10 mortgage servicers that reached an
$8.5 billion settlement that will end reviews of foreclosure-
abuse claims, regulators said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lender argued in its court filing that New York can&#8217;t
take advantage of a six-year statute of limitations and that a
three-year period applies. JPMorgan and the state reached a
so-called tolling agreement effective April 5, 2012, that
stopped the statute of limitations from expiring, according to
the filing. Because the conduct at issue occurred before April
2009, the claims must be dismissed, JPMorgan argued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attorney general&#8217;s office contends a six-year period
applies under the state&#8217;s securities fraud statute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also said in its court filing that the case should
be dismissed because the state hasn&#8217;t outlined its allegations
with the &#8220;requisite particularity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even if the attorney general&#8217;s claims were not time-
barred, they would fail for lack of specificity and must
therefore be dismissed,&#8221; the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is People of the State of New York v. J.P. Morgan
Securities, 451556-2012, New York State Supreme Court
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By David M. Levitt" date="Jan 07, 2013  1:08 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-07/microsoft-leases-manhattan-offices-in-11-times-square.html"><headline>Microsoft Leases Manhattan Offices in 11 Times Square</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s biggest
software maker, signed a lease for offices at 11 Times Square, a
midtown Manhattan skyscraper that was completed in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology company, based in Redmond, Washington, will
join the law firm Proskauer Rose LLP in the 1.1 million-square-
foot (102,000-square-meter) tower, developer SJP Properties said
today in a statement. Terms, including rent payments and the
size of the leased space, weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Including the Microsoft and Proskauer deals and seven other
agreements signed last year, the building is more than 70
percent leased, Parsippany, New Jersey-based SJP said. The
company co-owns the tower, located across Eighth Avenue from the
Port Authority Bus Terminal, with a real estate investment unit
of Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) Proskauer Rose has more than
400,000 square feet in the building. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s lease was reported yesterday on the website of
the Wall Street Journal, which said the company was taking just
more than 200,000 square feet in the tower. Microsoft and the
landlords were represented by brokers from Jones Lang LaSalle
Inc. (JLL), with Lisa Kiell negotiating for the tenant and Mitchell Konsker leading a team working on behalf of SJP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Susan Decker" date="Jan 07, 2013  1:07 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-07/google-patent-offers-probably-won-t-end-microsoft-apple-suits.html"><headline>Google Patent Offers Probably Won&#8217;t End Microsoft Suit</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s requirement to make new
patent-licensing offers to Apple Inc. and Microsoft (MSFT) Corp. under
its settlement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission probably
won&#8217;t resolve lawsuits among the technology giants, according to
patent lawyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week&#8217;s agreement requires Google to offer competitors
&#8220;fair and reasonable&#8221; terms for using its patents included in
industrywide standards for smartphones, tablet computers and
other electronic devices, and to give them time to respond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Apple rejected earlier royalty demands,
accused Google&#8217;s Motorola Mobility unit of misusing its patents,
complained to U.S. and European regulators and filed breach-of-
contract suits in federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a more reasonable offer than last time -
- I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s going to be perfectly reasonable,&#8221; said
patent lawyer Robert Stoll of Drinker Biddle in Washington,
who&#8217;s not involved in the disputes. &#8220;You might see further
activity by the FTC if they think Google is not acting in good
faith.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global litigation has become central to shaping the
worldwide market for mobile devices, which includes phones,
tablets and e-readers, that reached $436 billion last year and
is projected to almost double to $847 billion by 2016, according
to Carl Howe, an analyst with Yankee Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Patent Abuse &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FTC agreement resolved claims that Motorola Mobility,
which Google bought for $12.4 billion last year, abused patents
essential to industry standards to extract higher royalties.
Industry-standard technology helps ensure products such as
mobile phones can operate together when made by different
manufacturers, meaning companies making those products must
conform with the standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the FTC settlement, Google can&#8217;t try to block sales
or imports of competitors&#8217; products during the license-offer
process and must report to the FTC on steps it&#8217;s taken to
comply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a filing with the U.S. International Trade Commission
today, Microsoft said that means Google must drop two video-
coding patents from a case in which it seeks to block imports of
the Xbox gaming system. The third patent, for a way to establish
communication between the Xbox and accessories, doesn&#8217;t relate
to any industry norm, so wouldn&#8217;t be affected by the FTC
agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As a result of the settlement Motorola and Google have
entered with the FTC, Microsoft expects that Motorola will
immediately dismiss from this investigation its claims&#8221; related
to the two patents, Microsoft said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wireless Claims &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission already has cleared Apple (AAPL) of claims it
infringed Motorola Mobility patents for wireless technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making offers to appease the FTC, and European regulators
who are investigating Google&#8217;s practices, may not be enough to
stop the litigation among the companies, said James Kulbaski, a
patent lawyer with Oblon Spivak in Alexandria, Virginia, who&#8217;s
not involved in the cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which said the FTC agreement does little to
resolve issues it raised over Google&#8217;s business practices,
probably will decide it would rather wait to hear from a federal
judge in Seattle who is considering what the appropriate royalty
should be, he said. Apple, in a different case, has told a judge
in Wisconsin that it won&#8217;t pay Motorola Mobility more than $1
per handset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple also is trying to get Motorola Mobility and other
makers of phones that use Google&#8217;s Android operating system to
stop what it calls copying of the iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Clear Rules&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It takes two entities to reach a settlement and Apple has
made clear they are doing everything they can to seek every
possible remedy,&#8221; Kulbaski said. &#8220;If Apple&#8217;s not willing to
settle, there can&#8217;t be a global settlement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristin Huguet, a spokeswoman for Apple, said the
Cupertino, California-based company had no comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement doesn&#8217;t require Mountain View, California-
based Google to drop lawsuits where it is seeking cash damages.
Nor is it precluded from trying to block imports or sales of
competitors&#8217; products after taking the steps required by the
FTC, including an offer of binding arbitration on issues that
can&#8217;t be resolved through negotiations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement &#8220;establishes clear rules of the road for
standards essential patents going forward,&#8221; Google said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thwarting Competition &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At issue are Motorola Mobility patents related to technical
standards on things like wireless transmissions and video
decoding, a legacy of the company&#8217;s history as a mobile-phone
pioneer. As one of the companies that helped establish
specifications for how the phones operate, Motorola Mobility
pledged to license any relevant patents on fair terms to anyone
who asked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It demanded royalties equal to 2.25 percent of the retail
prices of products and devices including Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox and
Apple&#8217;s iPhone. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said that
would amount to $4 billion a year, a figure Motorola Mobility
disputed. Motorola Mobility lowered the offer in June, to what
Microsoft said was still unreasonable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because companies that participate in standard-setting
groups have an advantage in getting their technology adopted,
the FTC and European Commission have argued standard-setters
shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to use those patents to thwart competition.
A patent gives its owner the right to exclude others from using
the invention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judges in Seattle and Chicago have said Motorola Mobility
isn&#8217;t entitled to orders halting U.S. sales of products based on
the use of standard-essential patents. The ITC, which has the
power to block imports, is considering similar rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Court Bans &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Apple pledged not to seek court bans based on
standard-essential patents to help gain Justice Department
clearance to join a group that bought Nortel Networks Corp.
patents in July 2011 for $4.5 billion. Apple, in a patent fight
with Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) that was settled in 2011, argued against the
Finnish company&#8217;s use of standard-essential patents in the
dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, while seeking regulatory approval to buy Motorola
Mobility, said it would continue the handset maker&#8217;s policy of
not seeking sales bans as long as licensing negotiations were
under way. The FTC agreement requires Motorola Mobility to take
extra steps to resolve royalty disputes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Less Relief&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Google is saying the same thing they said in February,
but with some more limitations,&#8221; said Jorge Contreras, an
associate law professor at American University in Washington.
&#8220;It still can go around and monetize the patents, but at the
end of the day that&#8217;s not what Google bought them for. They
didn&#8217;t buy them for a revenue stream as much as a defensive
measure.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Deputy General Counsel Dave Heiner, in a blog
posting, criticized the FTC for not going far enough on the
licensing question, Google&#8217;s practices related to its core
search business, or other issues on review by the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are disappointed that the FTC accepted less relief
from Google than the DOJ obtained from Microsoft and Apple last
year,&#8221; Heiner said. &#8220;The good news is that other antitrust
agencies, within the United States and overseas, are still
examining Google&#8217;s conduct.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung Electronics Co., which is facing an antitrust
complaint by European regulators, dropped efforts to block sales
of Apple products in Europe based on infringement claims related
to standard-essential patents. In an ITC filing, Apple argued
Samsung should do the same thing in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stoll, the Drinker Biddle patent lawyer, said the FTC
agreement with Google is &#8220;very confusing&#8221; and has &#8220;a lot of
holes.&#8221; Still, he said, it could be a good first step in
setting rules on how to handle standard-essential patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The FTC is trying, but I think they need more
specificity, more engagement,&#8221; Stoll said. &#8220;A few more of
these and they can hone something with more structure.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European naphtha declined as Vitol
Group sold two cargoes, bringing its total in the past two
sessions to six lots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diesel barges gained as Trafigura Beheer BV and Gunvor
Group Ltd. bought. Gasoil rose for the first time in three days
on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Light Products &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naphtha traded at $929 and $933 a metric ton, according to
a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
pricing window which showed Trafigura and Royal Dutch Shell Plc
as buyers. Deals were done Jan. 4 at $932 to $934 a ton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitol bought 17 naphtha lots in the last week of December,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naphtha&#8217;s crack, or discount to Brent crude, was unchanged
at $6.20 a barrel as of 2:14 p.m. local time, according to data
from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasoline barges traded from $970 to $981.50 a ton in the
Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp area, according to a similar survey
of the Argus Bulletin Board and the Platts. That compares with
deals from $967 to $978 on Jan. 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, Vitol, Gunvor and Total SA sold barges of the
Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is added to make finished fuel.
Trafigura, Shell and Gunvor bought barges that typically
comprise 1,000 to 2,000 tons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasoline&#8217;s crack, or premium to Brent crude, rose to $6.76
a barrel, compared with $6.66 on Jan. 4, according to PVM data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Middle Distillates &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diesel barges rose to trade at $20 to $21 a ton more than
January gasoil versus plus $20 in the previous session, the
survey of Platts showed. BP and Argos Groep BV sold, and Vitol
bought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heating oil barges traded from a $1 discount to January
gasoil to parity to the marker as Mercuria Energy Trading SA,
Shell and Mocoh SA bought from Vitol and Gunvor. That compares
with a discount of $1 on Jan. 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasoil for January delivery rose $8.25, or 0.9 percent, to
$936.75 as of 5:30 p.m. London time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contract&#8217;s discount to February futures was $1.75 a
ton, keeping the market in contango, a structure that can signal
falling demand or rising supply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasoil for January delivery last closed at a premium to the
next-month contract on Dec. 24. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasoil&#8217;s crack gained to $15.03 a barrel versus $13.64 in
the previous session. Brent fell 0.3 percent to $111.02 a barrel
on ICE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds and other money managers increased bullish bets
on the fuel, ICE data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money managers&#8217; net-long bets on gasoil increased to 52,985
positions in the week to Dec. 31 from 50,223 in the previous
period, the data showed. It is the highest since the week ended
Dec. 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Residues &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-sulfur fuel oil changed hands from $602.50 to $603.50
a ton, the survey of Platts showed. That compares with $601 to
$602.50 on Jan. 4. The low-sulfur grade traded at $624 to $625. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the bank
that sold its stake in Germany&#8217;s largest department store last
month, plans to sell shares in a unit that owns homes valued at
4.7 billion euros ($6.1 billion) in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An initial public offering of LEG Immobilien GmbH is
planned for the first half, LEG said in a statement today. The
sale may raise as much as 1 billion euros, said two people with
knowledge of the plan. Another person familiar with the IPO said
it will probably take place in early February. Both people asked
not to be identified because the matter is private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LEG would be Germany&#8217;s biggest property IPO if it raises 1
billion euros. The Dusseldorf-based landlord owns 91,000
apartments in North Rhine Westphalia, Germany&#8217;s most populous
state. Goldman Sachs&#8217; Whitehall Street Real Estate fund holds
about 95 percent of the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fundamentals for the segment are very good,&#8221; said
Thomas Martin, an analyst at HSBC Trinkaus  Burkhardt AG. (TUB)
&#8220;Because some of their competitors are trading expensively,
this could be an interesting way for stock investors to get
in.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Baubecon Bid &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is one of the most active foreign investors
in German property. In April 2011, Whitehall Street and Cerberus
Capital Management LP raised 468 million euros in an IPO of
Berlin-based residential landlord GSW Immobilien AG. Whitehall
Street also made an unsuccessful bid to buy Baubecon, the
residential property portfolio that Barclays Plc (BARC) agreed to sell
to Deutsche Wohnen AG in May in a deal valued at 1.24 billion
euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and LEG co-owner Perry Capital, which bought
the company from the state government for about 3.5 billion
euros in 2008, are seeking to profit from a boom in German
residential real estate. The FTSE EPRA/Nareit index of German
property stocks has gained 42 percent in the past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) will be lead managers
and bookrunners for the IPO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Annington Immobilien GmbH, Germany&#8217;s largest owner
of apartments, also plans an IPO this year. Annington, which has
186,000 apartments, is controlled by Guy Hands&#8217; Terra Firma
Capital Partners Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitehall Street agreed to sell its stake in 17 German
department stores, including Kaufhaus des Westens, the country&#8217;s
largest, in December. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)

strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cahilly, most recently a partner and global co-head of
media  telecommunications within Goldman&#8217;s investment banking
division, will report to Adam Silver, the NBA&#8217;s deputy
commissioner who takes over the top job in February 2014. He
will begin work on Jan. 14, according to the NBA, which has
annual revenue of more than $5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He is a proven leader with deep financial and strategic
experience across the media and entertainment industry,&#8221; Silver
said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cahilly spent 12 years at Goldman Sachs. He succeeds Carol Sawdye, who left the league to become the chief financial

&lt;p&gt;Equity Residential (EQR), the largest
publicly traded U.S. apartment landlord, agreed to sell 27
properties to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Greystar Real Estate
Partners LLC for as much as $1.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction values the apartments at about $187,000 per
unit, Chicago-based Equity Residential said in a statement
today. The joint venture is obligated to purchase at least $1.38
billion of assets. The 8,010 units are located in northern New
Jersey, Florida, Phoenix, Denver, Southern California and the
Washington, D.C., and San Francisco Bay areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity Residential, founded by billionaire Sam Zell, said
in November that it would sell some assets after agreeing to buy
part of rival landlord Archstone Inc. from Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc., a deal that will boost holdings in cities where
it already has properties. The real estate investment trust is
accelerating its disposal of properties outside its core growth
areas, with plans for as much as $4 billion in sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s deal is &#8220;evidence that they had their ducks in
order from the very beginning in terms of how they were going to
finance the Archstone transaction,&#8221; Richard Anderson, a REIT
analyst with BMO Capital Markets in New York, said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;They&#8217;re no dummies. They&#8217;re not going to
sign up for a several-billion-dollar transaction and not have a
pretty good plan in place before they announce it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Significant Progress&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity Residential agreed to purchase 60 percent of
Archstone in a cash-and-stock deal valued at about $6.5 billion.
AvalonBay Communities Inc. (AVB), the second-biggest publicly traded
apartment landlord, is buying the other 40 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale to Goldman and Greystar is expected to be
completed by the end of March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With this transaction we will have made significant
progress selling assets in our exit markets and non-core assets
in primary markets to fund our share of the acquisition of
Archstone,&#8221; David J. Neithercut, Equity Residential&#8217;s president
and chief executive officer, said in the statement. &#8220;Demand for
multifamily assets remains very strong.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $187,000 price per unit is more than the $149,000
average last year for the seven regions in which Equity
Residential sold assets, according to Ben Carlos Thypin,
director of market analysis at Real Capital Analytics Inc. in
New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is reasonable to assume these are assets of relatively
high quality,&#8221; Thypin said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The properties include the Ellipse at Government Center, a
newly renovated community in Fairfax, Virginia, with a pool and
tennis court where a two-bedroom apartment can be leased for
$1,450 a month, according to Equity Residential&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also included in the deal is Iron Horse Park, north of San
Francisco in Pleasant Hill, where apartments have views of Mount
Diablo and a two-bedroom unit rents for $1,825. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court left intact a
$70 million award assessed against an Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) unit for
failing to comply with a Puerto Rico law governing gasoline
prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices today turned down an appeal from the oil
company&#8217;s Puerto Rico gasoline wholesaler, which said the award
in the consumer class-action lawsuit violates the Constitution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1996 law was designed to ensure that wholesalers, in
the prices they charge to gas stations, account for the
expansion of fuel in warmer climates. The law requires
wholesalers to make a &#8220;temperature adjustment,&#8221; reducing the
price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its appeal, the Exxon unit said it had no way of
complying with the law until regulations implementing the
measure were adopted in 2005. The company said the
Constitution&#8217;s due process clause barred liability until those
regulations took effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suing consumers said the regulations concerned prices
at the pump and didn&#8217;t affect the wholesalers&#8217; obligation to
provide the temperature adjustment to retailers. The consumers
said the Exxon unit was receiving a windfall of 1.34 cents per
gallon before the law was enacted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puerto Rico&#8217;s Supreme Court let the award stand last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Esso Standard Oil Co. (Puerto Rico) v. Trilla
Pinero, 12-445. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A suspension of electronic payments
in Vatican City is threatening finances in the world&#8217;s smallest
state as pilgrims and tourists are forced to use cash in museums
and shops with yearly sales of more than $100 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit and debit card payments and cash withdrawals stayed
suspended Jan. 4 in the papal state for a fourth day after the
Bank of Italy refused a request to keep providing the services
by the operator, Deutsche Bank AG&#8217;s Italian unit. The central
bank acted because the Vatican doesn&#8217;t comply with international
money-laundering rules, a Bank of Italy official said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interruption to electronic payment services will be
&#8220;brief,&#8221; the Vatican said in a statement Jan. 3. The papal
state, home to Pope Benedict XVI, is in central Rome near the
Tiber river. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cash withdrawals from machines operated by the Vatican bank
IOR aren&#8217;t affected, a Vatican spokesman, who declined to be
named, said. Tourists will be able to buy tickets for the
Vatican museums online until Jan. 15, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rome-based central bank found in a 2010 inspection that
the Deutsche Bank unit, which started operating the papal
state&#8217;s point-of-service payment services in 1997, didn&#8217;t have
the authorization to operate in the Vatican City, a Bank of
Italy official said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank on Dec. 6 refused a permit request to
Deutsche Bank SpA because the state lacks required banking and
financial legislation, the official said. A Deutsche Bank
spokeswoman for Italy declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vatican authorities are trying to find another bank
provider, the Vatican press office said last week. A new
operator may be announced today, the Financial Times reported
Jan. 4, citing an unidentified person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Curbs to Prevent Stock Volatility May Be Delayed, Bats Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New curbs to limit rapid price moves in individual stocks
and changes to rules designed to prevent market-wide routs may
be delayed two months until April, according to exchange
operator Bats Global Markets Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shift from circuit breakers that make trading pause if
a stock rises or falls 10 percent in five minutes to curbs that
limit moves without automatically triggering a halt will take
effect April 8 instead of Feb. 4, subject to regulatory
approval, the Lenexa, Kansas-based company said in a notice on
its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes to an existing program that stops all equity-based
trading across stocks, options and futures will also be delayed,
Bats said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both measures are meant to protect investors from extreme
price moves. The gauge that will trigger the marketwide circuit
breakers is switching from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU) to
the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index, while the price drop for
trading to stop is being narrowed and the length of pauses
shortened in most cases. The so-called limit-up/limit-down plan,
which prevents individual stocks from moving outside a rolling
price band, will replace the automatic halts implemented after
the flash crash on May 6, 2010, when the 30-stock Dow average
briefly fell 9.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission must approve
the request to delay implementation of the limit-up/limit-down
plan by the 13 stock exchanges and Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority, which oversees more than 4,300 brokers, for it to go
into effect. A separate delay request would have to be submitted
by securities exchanges and Finra for the market-wide circuit
breakers, introduced after the October 1987 market crash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Nester, a spokesman for the SEC, declined to comment.
Also declining to comment were Keara Everdell, a spokeswoman for
NYSE Euronext, Robert Madden of Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ) and Jim
Gorman at Direct Edge Holdings LLC. Dow Jones reported the
planned delay earlier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vietnam plans to allow exchange-traded funds beginning
around the fourth quarter of this year, Vu Bang, chairman of
State Securities Commission, said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preparation to set up the funds will take nearly a
year, Bang said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator also proposes introducing covered warrants
this year. The SSC outlined six measures to attract foreign

&lt;h2&gt;Rule Could Make Hedge Funds Fraud Informers, Reuters Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, a part
of the Treasury, is working on rule that would require U.S.
hedge funds to file reports telling authorities of any
suspicious trading by employees and outside parties, Reuters
reported, citing the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule would require the hedge fund industry to monitor
itself in way similar to banks, mutual funds, and brokerages.
The proposal would cover white collar crime including money
laundering and insider trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule may be filed for public comment in the first half
of year, a FinCEN spokesman, Steve Hudak, said, according to
Reuters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule is expected to meet with opposition from the hedge
fund industry over concerns with costs and invasiveness, Reuters
reported. A spokesman for the Managed Funds Association, the
biggest hedge fund trade organization, didn&#8217;t respond to a
request for comment, Reuters said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Faces Sanction for Refusing to Provide Madoff Documents &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Treasury Department&#8217;s inspector general threatened
to punish JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) for failing to turn over
documents to regulators investigating the bank&#8217;s ties to the
Ponzi scheme of convicted con man Bernard L. Madoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspector General Eric Thorson gave the largest U.S. bank a
Jan. 11 deadline to cooperate with the Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency probe or risk sanctions for impeding the
agency&#8217;s oversight. JPMorgan, according to the Dec. 21 letter,
says the information is protected by attorney-client privilege. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thorson&#8217;s letter didn&#8217;t spell out what documents the OCC is
seeking or the focus of its investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previously undisclosed OCC probe adds to the lender&#8217;s
troubles in Washington, where several agencies and lawmakers are
investigating the bank&#8217;s loss of at least $6.2 billion on
botched derivatives trades. The losses have prompted regulators
including the Federal Reserve to consider tightening proposed
restrictions on proprietary trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, said the bank
&#8220;will of course continue to work together with our regulators&#8221;
on the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This dispute does not go to the merits of the matter but
it does raise an important issue of principle: Whether we and
other banks, large and small alike, have the fundamental right
long recognized in this country to communicate freely with and
seek confidential guidance from their lawyers,&#8221; Zuccarelli said
in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bryan Hubbard, an OCC spokesman, declined to comment on the
agency&#8217;s Madoff inquiry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the letter to JPMorgan general counsel Stephen Cutler,
the inspector general -- the Treasury&#8217;s internal watchdog --
dismissed JPMorgan&#8217;s arguments on attorney-client privilege,
saying the OCC &#8220;could not do its work&#8221; if banks were allowed
to withhold information on that basis. The OCC asked the IG
office to review the situation, Thorson said in the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Congress Probes SEC Spending on Booz Allen, Reuters Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has until Jan.
17 to turn over documents showing payments to consulting firm
Booz Allen Hamilton, Reuters reported, citing a Jan. 3 letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter, sent to SEC Chairman Elisse Walter by House
Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa, a Republican from California,
comes as part of a probe of agency spending on Booz Allen,
Reuters reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC spent more than $8.5 million on consultants to
advise on reforming workflow and back-office operations, Reuters
reported last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Booz Allen didn&#8217;t respond to a request for comment on the
letter, Reuters said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Weavering Founder Appears in Court Over Hedge Fund&#8217;s Collapse &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weavering Capital (UK) Ltd. founding director Magnus
Peterson appeared in a London court today facing six charges of
fraud, forgery, fraudulent trading and false accounting over the
collapse of the hedge fund in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Michael Snow ordered Peterson, 49, to appear at a
higher criminal court in 12 weeks and surrender his passport.
The defunct fund had about $640 million under management in late
2008 before discovering the counterparty for its biggest trading
position was controlled by the fund&#8217;s manager. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors at the Serious Fraud Office dropped their
initial criminal probe into Peterson over concerns it wouldn&#8217;t
win a conviction. The SFO reopened the case in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hedge fund&#8217;s administrators won a lawsuit to recover
$450 million from Peterson and other former employees in May. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Geithner Said to Plan to Depart Before Debt-Ceiling Debate Ends &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner has indicated to
White House officials he wants to carry through with his plan to
leave the administration by the end of this month even if debt-
limit negotiations aren&#8217;t concluded, according to two people
familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geithner contemplated leaving the position June 2011 while
the debt ceiling was being debated, and President Barack Obama
persuaded him to stay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His departure now would increase pressure on the president
to name his successor at Treasury. White House Chief of Staff
Jack Lew remains the leading contender, according to the people,
who requested anonymity to discuss the private talks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geithner, 51, is the only remaining member of Obama&#8217;s
original economic team and was a key figure in the taxpayer-
funded bailouts during the 2008 financial crisis. He&#8217;s also had
a principal role in negotiations with Congress on the budget
deal and in past deliberations over the debt ceiling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Lew has spent most of his career in government,
Obama may seek to name a Wall Street executive as deputy
Treasury secretary, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mailbox Bombing Probed at U.S. Treasury Inspector General&#8217;s Home &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. authorities are investigating the bombing last week of
a mailbox at the home of the Treasury Department&#8217;s inspector
general. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairfax County, Virginia, police officers were called to
Inspector General Eric Thorson&#8217;s home in suburban Washington on
Dec. 31 after he discovered his mailbox destroyed from what
appeared to be a pipe bomb. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The matter is under investigation by the Fairfax County
police and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and
Explosives, according to Rich Delmar, counsel to the inspector
general. Investigators are trying to determine if the bombing is
connected to the official&#8217;s work, said a person familiar with
the matter who asked to remain anonymous because the probe was
in its early stages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thorson&#8217;s office conducts independent audits of the
department and investigates cases of waste, fraud and abuse of
government resources. It handles some financially related
criminal cases, such as thefts of checks issued by the Treasury. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hambrecht Won&#8217;t Join BASF Supervisory Board This Year, FAS Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former BASF (BAS) Chief Executive Officer Juergen Hambrecht won&#8217;t
seek election before 2014 to the company&#8217;s supervisory board,
Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung reported, citing an
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate law rules would allow him to join the board in
2013 after a mandatory two-year waiting period since departing
from a management post, the FAS reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hambrecht said he will wait until the term of the current
supervisory board expires next year, according to FAS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eastman Kodak Co. (EKDKQ), the bankrupt
photography company, was sued by Japan&#8217;s Kyocera Corp. (6971) for
allegedly infringing more than a dozen U.S. patents with its
printers and digital cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kodak, based in Rochester, New York, will cause
&#8220;irreparable harm&#8221; to Kyoto-based Kyocera if the infringement
isn&#8217;t stopped, plaintiff&#8217;s lawyers said in a complaint filed
Dec. 4 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyocera is seeking a jury trial and unspecified damages
from Kodak, which has been trying to sell some of its own
patents to pay creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kodak sought bankruptcy protection in January 2012, citing
$5.1 billion in assets and $6.75 billion in debt, as the
transition to digital photography eroded the company&#8217;s film-
based business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher Veronda, a Kodak spokesman, didn&#8217;t immediately
return voice and e-mail messages seeking comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy case is In re Eastman Kodak Co., 12-10202,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disney Seeks U.S. Patent on Computer Game Controller With Lens &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Walt Disney Co. (DIS) has filed an application for a patent
on a gaming console that can use images from everyday reality
and allow a user to manipulate and animate those images. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Application 20130002698, published in the database of the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Jan. 3, covers what Disney
calls &#8220;virtual lens-rendering for augmented reality lens.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application noted that while some game devices already
capture images from outside the game, the colors shown on the
screen may not match up with the actual object. While some
devices can allow the user to make adjustments so the image more
closely aligns with the object, these adjustments may produce
&#8220;an unrealistic display&#8221; in other environments.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burbank, California-based Disney applied for the patent in
June 2011. CNet News reported Jan. 4 that the technology
described in the patent application may be related to the
forthcoming Toy Box console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;USPTO Seeks Public Input on Improvement of Software Patents &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office will hold two public
meetings aimed at the improvement of software patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a notice published Jan. 3 in the Federal
Register, roundtable meetings will be held in California and New
York in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford University is the site of the Feb. 12 meeting, and
the New York event will be held at New York University Feb. 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the topics under discussion is the establishment of
clear boundaries for patent claims that use functional language.
Another subject is the office&#8217;s request for comments on the
preparation of patent applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The office is also seeking input on topics for future
discussions related to software patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While attendees at both events will have opportunity to
provide input, the office said group-consensus advice won&#8217;t be
sought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advance registration may be made by sending an e-mail to
softwareroundtable2013@USPTO.gov. Applicants should specify
name, title, applicable company or organization, address, phone
number and e-mail address, and which presentation they wish to
attend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who wish to make a presentation should send final
electronic copies of their remarks to the same address. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potential attendees are asked to register by Feb. 4. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Scottish Wild Salmon&#8217; Now a Protected Name Indicator in EU &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Scottish Wild Salmon&#8221; is now a protected geographic name
indicator in the European Union, according to a December
publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use of the term to describe either non-wild salmon or
salmon from outside the specific geographic area was barred
beginning Dec. 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Salmon Net Fishing Association of Scotland is the
organization that had sought the designation, Scotland&#8217;s
Montrose Review reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Aberdeen, Scotland-based association&#8217;s
website, all rights of salmon fishing in that country are held
as private titles that can be inherited, regardless of whether
the fishing is done in fresh water or in the sea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 107-year-old association&#8217;s membership is comprised of
owners and lessees of salmon fisheries on the east coast of
Scotland, and is Scotland&#8217;s oldest fishermen&#8217;s organization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apple Fined in Beijing Court for Infringing Writers Copyrights &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL), the maker of the iPhone and iPod, must pay 1.03
million Chinese yuan ($165,300) in a Chinese copyright case,
XinHua&#8217;s English language news reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling came from Beijing No. 2 Intermediate People&#8217;s
Court, which found that Cupertino, California-based Apple had
violated the copyrights of eight Chinese writers and two
companies, XinHua reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suits were related to alleged unlicensed electronic
versions of books sold as downloads by Apple, according to
XinHua. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charge against Apple was violation of the writers
&#8220;right of communication through information networks,&#8221; XinHua
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DC Comics&#8217; &#8216;Batmobile&#8217; Case Set for Jan. 30 Motion Hearing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hearing is scheduled for Jan. 30 in the copyright-
infringement case Time Warner Inc. (TWX)&#8217;s DC Comics unit brought
against a builder of custom autos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DC Comics sued Mark Towle of Santa Ana, California, in
federal court in Los Angeles in March 2011, claiming he
infringed copyrights by producing replica Batmobiles through his
Gotham Garage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court will hear both sides&#8217; presentations on motions
for dismissal of the case, according to a Dec. 26 filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That document specifies that Towle has made and distributed
copies of the Batmobile seen in the 1996 &#8220;Batman&#8221; television
series, and car kits with which others could also reconfigure
their cars to resemble the Batmobile. Towel didn&#8217;t stipulate
that his replicas contained all the &#8220;separable, non-functional,
artistic elements&#8221; that DC Comics contends it owns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joint statement specifies that all the stipulations the
parties made in that document are valid only in connection with
the motion for dismissal of the case. Should the case go forward
beyond that point, the stipulations would have &#8220;no force and
effect,&#8221; according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is DC Comics v. Mart Towle, 2:11-cv-03934-RSWL-OP,
U.S. District Court, Central District of California (Los
Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdero&#8217;s Starfire, Extreme Environment Materials Settle Dispute &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verdero Capital LLC&#8217;s Starfire Systems said in a Jan. 3
statement that it has resolved a trade-secret and trademark-
infringement case against Extreme Environment Materials
Solutions unit and two former Starfire employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Starfire engineers polymer-based ceramic
components for its customers. They are used in armor, aerospace
and electronics. The company sued Extreme Environment and the
ex-employees in federal court in Syracuse, New York, in July
2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a Dec. 21 court filing, all the defendants are
permanently barred from developing , manufacturing, purchasing,
selling or brokering products based on a process outlined in
some &#8220;highly confidential&#8221; Starfire documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are also barred from using Starfire&#8217;s trademarks as a
name for or description of any products not made by Starfire.
They must also discontinue use of the &#8220;Starfire.co&#8221; Internet
domain name, and from any involvement with any other domain name
that directly or indirectly contains the terms &#8220;Starfire&#8221; or
&#8220;Starfire Systems.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No financial terms were mentioned in this court filing,
which specified that all claims and defenses are now dismissed
and parties had to pay their own litigation costs and attorney
fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Starfire Systems Inc. v. Extreme Environment
Materials Solutions LLC, 1:11-cv-00888-GLS-CFH, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of New York (Syracuse). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon has left the board of the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon is no longer on the board after the Dec. 31
expiration of his second term as a director, Jack Gutt, a
spokesman for the New York Fed, said today in a telephone
interview. Dimon was a Class A director, elected by the banks in
the New York Fed&#8217;s district. A replacement has not yet been
named. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers last year criticized Dimon for serving on the Fed
district bank&#8217;s board after JPMorgan reported a trading loss
that rekindled concern the New York Fed, the company&#8217;s principal
regulator, is too cozy with Wall Street. Senator Bernie Sanders,
a Vermont independent, along with Democrats Barbara Boxer of
California and Mark Begich of Alaska, introduced legislation
last year that would remove the industry&#8217;s executives from the
12 regional Fed banks&#8217; boards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress created the Fed in 1913 with public and private
features. Three bankers are on each of the 12 Fed district bank
boards, along with six other directors who represent the
borrowing public. They play no part in bank supervision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon said in June that the district banks benefit from
industry leaders&#8217; input. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If I had a board, I&#8217;d want to hear from a lot of
different types of people,&#8221; Dimon said June 19 at a hearing of
the House Financial Services Committee in Washington. &#8220;It&#8217;d be
funny to be talking about global markets and not have someone
involved in the global markets at the table. It certainly does
not have to be me.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for the bank, said Dimon
finished out his term, declining further comment. Dimon&#8217;s
departure from the board was earlier reported by the New York
Times. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan downgraded Northrop Grumman
Corp. (NOC), Raytheon (RTN) Co. and Harris Corp., three companies that were
among the best defense investments in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Following a year in which the group as a whole performed
surprisingly well, we are downgrading some of the top
performers,&#8221; analyst Joseph Nadol wrote today in a note to
clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nadol cut Raytheon, the largest missile supplier to the
U.S. Defense Department, to neutral from overweight. The
Waltham, Massachusetts-based company returned 23 percent in 2012
including dividend payments. Raytheon shares fell 1.1 percent to
close at $57.74 in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Northrop Grumman, maker of Global Hawk drones, was revised
to underweight from neutral. The Falls Church, Virginia-based
defense contractor returned 20 percent last year. Its shares
declined 1.9 percent to $67.34. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harris (HRS), a maker of communications equipment, was cut to
underweight from neutral. The Melbourne, Florida-based company
returned 40 percent last year. Harris shares fell 2.3 percent,
the biggest decline in more than two months, to close at $48.91. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defense contractors face automatic Pentagon cuts totaling
about $45 billion this year unless the White House and lawmakers
agree by March 1 to an alternate deficit reduction plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe that Republicans as a group put a higher
priority on spending cuts than they do on preserving the defense
budget,&#8221; raising the risk no deal will be reached before the
deadline, Nadol wrote in a separate note to clients today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Mary Childs and Dawn Kopecki" date="Jan 08, 2013 11:48 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-08/jpmorgan-s-staley-quits-to-join-bluemountain-hedge-fund.html"><headline>JPMorgan&#8217;s Staley Quits to Join BlueMountain Hedge Fund</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;James E. Staley, the JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) executive once seen as a candidate to become chief executive
officer, quit to join BlueMountain Capital Management LLC, the
$12 billion hedge fund that profited from the bank&#8217;s trading
loss last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staley, who was at JPMorgan for more than 34 years, will
become a managing partner and purchase a stake in BlueMountain,
the New York-based firm said today. The former investment
banking chief, Staley last year handed off day-to-day management
duties and became chairman of the corporate and investment bank
in a series of executive changes as JPMorgan grappled with
wrong-way bets in its chief investment office in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m very excited to be joining BlueMountain at a time
when sea changes in the financial industry combined with the
firm&#8217;s unique strengths open up enormous possibilities to
deliver value to clients,&#8221; Staley, 56, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staley, who rose from his post as an investment banker in
Brazil, took over JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bank in 2010 after chief
executive officer Jamie Dimon ousted co-heads Steve Black and
Bill Winters. He was stripped of all day-to-day management
duties and passed over for promotion in July. He had been
looking for a new job for several months, according to people
with knowledge of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlueMountain, co-founded in 2003 by Andrew Feldstein, who
helped create the credit-derivatives market while he worked for
JPMorgan in the 1990s, aided the bank last year as it unwound
trades at the heart of what became at least $6.2 billion in
losses at its CIO unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Ethical People&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Jes is one of the most experienced and successful leaders
in the industry and has played a key role at one of the world&#8217;s
most successful financial institutions,&#8221;Feldstein, the 48-
year-old chief executive and chief investment officer of
BlueMountain, said in the statement. &#8220;Not only has he had a
front row seat for the evolution of the financial industry, but
he&#8217;s also one of the most ethical people we&#8217;ve worked with.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlueMountain benefited after a trader in the JPMorgan CIO
unit, Bruno Iksil, had built a portfolio of credit derivatives
so large it distorted price relationships in the market, first
reported by Bloomberg News on April 5. The hedge fund compiled
offsetting index trades to help JPMorgan unwind the position,
people familiar with the trading said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staley warned Dimon that supervision and risk controls in
former Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew&#8217;s division weren&#8217;t
strong enough, current and former executives said last year.
Dimon brushed off the concerns, one of the people said. JPMorgan
has denied that assertion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Warning Dimon &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staley was moved to a new role in July when Dimon named
Matt Zames, who worked for Staley in the investment bank, co-
chief operating officer with Frank Bisignano. London-based
Barclays Plc and Baltimore-based Legg Mason Inc. both considered
hiring him as CEO during searches last year, the Wall Street
Journal and CNBC reported at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Jes has been an extraordinary leader and a valued partner
for many of us at JPMorgan over the years,&#8221; Dimon said in an e-
mail to senior managers today. &#8220;While Jes is leaving JPMorgan
Chase, he is joining a respected private investment firm,
BlueMountain Capital. BlueMountain is an important client of
ours, and we look forward to working with Jes in the future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feldstein co-founded BlueMountain with Harvard Law friend
Stephen Siderow in a spinoff from BlueCrest Capital Management
LLP. Affiliated Managers Group Inc., the company with stakes in
firms overseeing about $416 billion, last year increased its
minority stake in BlueMountain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proceeds from the stake sale to Staley will be invested in
new infrastructure, technology and people, BlueMountain said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Jesse Westbrook" date="Jan 08, 2013 10:51 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-08/goldman-sachs-said-to-swap-fees-for-stake-in-cantab-hedge-fund.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Said to Swap Fees for Stake in Cantab Hedge Fund</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) has taken a
stake in Cantab Capital Partners LLP after the two firms revised
the terms of a licensing agreement the hedge fund had used to
pay the New York-based bank for using its technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cantab paid Goldman Sachs fees as part of a deal when the
firm started in 2006, according to two people with knowledge of
the matter who declined to be identified because Cantab is
private. They restructured it last year, with Goldman Sachs
giving up the fees in exchange for a minority ownership stake in
Cantab, they said. Cantab, based in Cambridge, England, told its
investors of the change in a letter earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As you are aware, we have been spending 2012 building our
own&#8221; information-technology system, Cantab Chief Investment
Officer Ewan Kirk said in the letter, which was obtained by
Bloomberg News. &#8220;As part of this, the existing profit-share
arrangement with Goldman Sachs has been amended and as from
December 31, Goldman Sachs will become a partner.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirk, who has a doctorate in mathematics from England&#8217;s
University of Southampton, led a team of 120 employees at
Goldman Sachs focused on quantitative investing before he
founded Cantab with $60 million. The hedge fund, which relies on
computers and mathematical algorithms to spot trades, has grown
to manage $4.7 billion, according to the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quant Funds &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials at Cantab and Goldman Sachs declined to comment
on the size of the bank&#8217;s stake in the hedge fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs hasn&#8217;t invested in Cantab or paid any money
for the stake as part of the restricting of the licensing deal,
one of the people said. The Cantab position isn&#8217;t held by
Goldman Sachs&#8217; Petershill unit, which uses client money to buy
stakes in hedge funds, the person added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cantab, which has stopped accepting money from new
investors, gained 15 percent last year and 13 percent in 2011,
according to the client letter. Others have lost money as
political announcements whipsawed markets and broke up the
trends in asset prices that quant funds try to follow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Newedge CTA Trend Sub-Index, which tracks the
performance of the largest computer-driven hedge funds, fell 3.4
percent in 2012 and 7.9 percent in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Walters Plc (RWA) fell the most in
almost six months after the recruitment company said there were
no signs that &#8220;challenging&#8221; market conditions will improve in
2013. Hays Plc (HAS) and Michael Page International Plc (MPI) also declined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Walters fell as much as 5.9 percent, the biggest
intraday drop since July 13, and was down 5 pence or 2.5 percent
at 198 pence at 11:43 a.m. At least four analysts trimmed their
2013 profit estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Under current trading conditions we still believe most
recruiters remain significantly over-valued,&#8221; Paul Jones, an
analyst at Panmure Gordon  Co. who recommends selling the
stock, said in a note to clients. &#8220;Robert Walters is no
exception.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recession in Europe, the slowdown in emerging markets
and fewer banking sector hires are holding back job recruitment
and providing few signs of when markets will recover. Companies
such as Hays now earn most of their fees outside the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With market conditions remaining challenging, and the
nature of the downturn meaning that visibility is even lower
than usual, we are rebasing our forecasts to take a more
cautious stance on the pace of recovery,&#8221; Sebastien Jantet, an
analyst at Investec Plc (INVP) with a buy recommendation on the stock,
said in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Continued Uncertainty &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter net fee income rose 2 percent to 47.4
million pounds ($76.3 million) from a year earlier, and was 4
percent higher on a constant currency basis, London-based Robert
Walters said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company expects to meet its 2012 forecasts and had
already taken action to manage its cost base given the continued
uncertainty, Chief Executive Officer Robert Walters said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hays, the U.K.&#8217;s largest recruitment firm, is due to
provide a fourth-quarter trading update on Jan. 10. It fell as
much as 4.2 percent and was down 2.5 percent at 83.75 pence.
James Gilbert, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, yesterday raised
Hays to buy from hold on evidence of stabilizing global demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Page, which is due to make a trading statement a
week today, fell as much as 6.6 percent, the most since June,
and was down 3.7 percent at 399.4 pence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investec&#8217;s Jantet cut his estimate for 2013 pretax profit

Analysts at Canaccord, Panmure and Shore Capital also lowered
2013 pretax profit estimates. Oriel Securities said it would

&lt;p&gt;Banque Saudi Fransi (BSFR), whose fourth-
quarter profit topped estimates, will probably spur &#8220;upbeat&#8221;
earnings expectations for other banks in the largest Arab
economy, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fifth-biggest Saudi Arabian lender, part-owned by
Credit Agricole SA (ACA), said yesterday quarterly profit climbed 22
percent to 808 million riyals ($215 million). That beat the
average estimate of five analysts for a profit of 750 million
riyals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Total operating
income rose 16 percent, while net special commission income
increased 7 percent to 834 million riyals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is an encouraging start to the Saudi banks&#8217;
reporting,&#8221; JPMorgan analysts, including Naresh Bilandani and
Christian Kern, wrote in a note to clients. It &#8220;will likely set
upbeat expectations for full-year reporting of peers, given
investor concerns on the sector post a damp third quarter, which
was negatively impacted by higher-than-expected provisioning.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabian lenders are benefiting from lending to
government projects as the world&#8217;s top oil exporter pursues more
than $500 billion of investments to develop infrastructure and
create jobs. Al-Rajhi Bank (RJHI), the kingdom&#8217;s biggest lender by
market value, will probably post a 7 percent increase in 2012
net income next week to 7.92 billion riyals, according to the
mean estimate of fourteen analysts compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rising Provisions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Saudi banks underperformed the benchmark index
last year and third-quarter net missed estimates as rising
provisions against bad loans from construction companies
eclipsed the fastest loan growth in three years. The Tadawul All
Share Bank Index rose 0.4 percent in 2012, compared with a 6
percent gain for the Tadawul. Saudi Fransi shares tumbled 13
percent in the period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has an overweight recommendation on the stock with
a price estimate of 42 riyals. The shares, which are unchanged
so far this month, closed at 29.40 riyals in Riyadh trading
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Fransi&#8217;s &#8220;earnings have bounced sharply as non-
interest income recovered and provisioning costs normalized,&#8221;
EFG-Hermes Holding SAE said in a research note yesterday.
&#8220;However, balance sheet growth was sluggish, with loan growth
decelerating and deposits declining marginally. Net interest
spreads are likely to have been impacted by year-end hike in
deposit rates, and should recover in the first quarter of
2013.&#8221; EFG-Hermes also has a price estimate of 42 riyals for
the stock, with a buy recommendation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Executive
Officer Steve Ballmer, in a surprise appearance at a technology
trade show in Las Vegas, said the number of applications for new
Windows tablets has increased fivefold since late October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are four times more applications for Windows RT
computers now than there were when the device was introduced in
late October, Ballmer said yesterday at the International
Consumer Electronics Show. He said that more apps -- including
Twitter Inc., Dropbox Inc. and Time Warner Inc. (TWX)&#8217;s CNN -- are
coming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ballmer is striving to drum up interest in the latest
flavor of Microsoft&#8217;s flagship operating system while he plays
catch-up to Apple Inc. in the $63.2 billion market for tablets.
Early demand for some Windows tablets has appeared
&#8220;disappointing,&#8221; according to analysts at FBR Capital Markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The availability of a broad range of apps is crucial for
luring customers to mobile devices such as tablets. In December
alone, the number of new apps reached 10,000, Ballmer said.
Among them: Expedia Inc., Fitbit Inc. and AOL Inc.&#8217;s Huffington
Post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said in late 2011 that Ballmer&#8217;s address at the
2012 CES would be the company&#8217;s last keynote. He appeared
yesterday during a presentation by Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) CEO Paul Jacobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft sold five times more Windows Phone devices during
the week of Christmas than the same period a year earlier,
Ballmer said. He didn&#8217;t give specific numbers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sitting onstage in Washington&#8217;s Ronald Reagan Building in July, Lloyd C. Blankfein said Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) had stopped using its own money to make bets on the bank&#8217;s behalf. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We shut off that activity,&#8221; the chief executive officer told more than 400 people at a lunch organized by the Economic Club of Washington, D.C., slicing the air with his hand. The bank no longer had proprietary traders who &#8220;just put on risks that they wanted&#8221; and didn&#8217;t interact with clients, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That may come as a surprise to people working in a secretive Goldman Sachs group called Multi-Strategy Investing, or MSI. It wagers about $1 billion of the New York-based firm&#8217;s own funds on the stocks and bonds of companies, including a mortgage servicer and a cement producer, according to interviews with more than 20 people who worked for and with the group, some as recently as last year. The unit, headed by two 1999 Princeton University classmates, has no clients, the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team&#8217;s survival shows how Goldman Sachs has worked around regulations curbing proprietary bets at banks. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker singled out the company in 2009, saying it shouldn&#8217;t get taxpayer support if it focuses on trading. A section of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act known as the Volcker rule, drafted to prevent banks from taking on excessive risk, limits short-term investments made with firms&#8217; capital. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four of the top 10 U.S. money-market
fund providers said they&#8217;ll disclose daily fund values,
pressuring rivals to follow suit as regulators consider banning
the use of a constant $1 share price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock Inc. (BLK), the world&#8217;s biggest money manager, will
begin revealing daily net asset values for all its U.S. money
funds on Jan. 16. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) began today to
disclose the values for its funds that are eligible to purchase
commercial paper, or prime funds. JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) plans to
take that step for all money funds, starting with prime funds on
Jan. 14, and Bank of New York Mellon Corp. will make daily
market values available &#8220;going forward.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The prime goal here is to diffuse the misperception
that&#8217;s been created by regulators that fund share prices are an
accounting fiction,&#8221; Peter Crane, president of research firm
Crane Data LLC, said in an interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty good bet
the daily values will show that market-value NAVs don&#8217;t float.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators led by former U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro have worked to impose tighter
restrictions on money funds since the September 2008 collapse of
the $62.5 billion Reserve Primary Fund. Proposals to make the
funds stronger have included abandoning the $1 fixed share
price, an idea providers want to counter because they say it
would destroy the appeal of money funds, which investors use as
an alternative to holding cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money-market funds buy short-term debt securities and book
them based on their expected value at maturity. They also round
their share prices to the nearest 1 cent. Those practices
obscure small fluctuations in the funds&#8217; market values. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SEC &#8216;Encouraged&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rule changes enacted by the SEC in 2010 required funds to
disclose their market value, or &#8220;shadow net-asset value,&#8221; on a
monthly basis, with a 60-day lag. Some providers, including
Fidelity and Vanguard, opposed the change at the time, saying it
could confuse investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC Chairman Elisse B. Walter, who took over from Shapiro
last month, welcomed today&#8217;s announcements by the New York-based
fund managers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chairman Walter is encouraged when industry voluntarily
takes steps to provide greater transparency for investors,&#8221;
John Nester, an SEC spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fidelity Investments, the biggest U.S. money-fund manager
with $420 billion in such assets, is &#8220;considering&#8221; daily
disclosure of per-share market values, Stephen Austin, a
spokesman for the Boston-based company, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vanguard, Fidelity &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nancy Prior, Fidelity&#8217;s head of money funds, said in an
October speech in Washington the firm would support more
frequent disclosure of market values. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If regulators believe that providing this information
more often could improve the resiliency of the funds and the
overall stability of the financial system, then we would support
such disclosure,&#8221; Prior said in the speech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanguard Group Inc., the fourth-biggest provider, said it
wasn&#8217;t planning to increase the frequency of shadow NAV
disclosure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have not seen an increased demand for more frequent
disclosure from our clients, who are primarily retail
investors,&#8221; John Woerth, a spokesman for the Valley Forge,
Pennsylvania-based company said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woerth said market-value fluctuations in Vanguard&#8217;s largest
money fund, the $123 billion Vanguard Prime Money Market Fund,
has been &#8220;de minimus.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s asset-management unit was the first to
announce a change in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crane said he doubted the practical value of disclosing the
market values. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rounding Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The shadow NAVs don&#8217;t differ materially from the rounded
NAVs unless something blows up, in which case you don&#8217;t see it
until after it happens,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meghan McAndrew, a spokeswoman for Pittsburgh-based
Federated Investors, the second-largest money-market mutual-fund
manager in the U.S., declined to comment on the firm&#8217;s plans
regarding NAV disclosure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the run-up to the rule&#8217;s enforcement, some companies,
including Charles Schwab Corp. and T. Rowe Price Group (TROW) Inc.,
injected cash into funds that were carrying small losses to
boost their market values back to $1 before they were forced to
disclose the shortfalls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Schapiro&#8217;s Proposal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, industry leaders offered to increase fund
disclosure as part of a proposal made to regulators in October.
That plan would require funds to reveal shadow NAVs on a weekly
basis with a five-day lag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies made the proposal while continuing to resist
calls from Schapiro, the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department
for SEC commissioners to consider approving a floating share
price for funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schapiro, who left the SEC in December, had planned as
recently as August to propose that money funds be forced to
choose to either float their share value or adopt a combination
of capital buffers and withdrawal restrictions to protect
against credit losses and investor runs. She shelved the
proposal when three of her four fellow commissioners signaled
that they would reject it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A senior panel of regulators, the Financial Stability
Oversight Council, began a process in November by which it can
pressure SEC commissioners to reconsider the elements of
Schapiro&#8217;s plan. The panel includes the heads of the SEC and
central bank, and is headed by Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reserve Primary &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re not doing this in anticipation of a floating net-asset value,&#8221; JPMorgan&#8217;s Deutsch said. &#8220;Our decision was
informed by the extra scrutiny&#8221; money funds have come under
since 2008. &#8220;The world changed when the Reserve Fund broke the
buck and since then we&#8217;ve been making details of our holdings
more accessible.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Reserve Primary fund fell below $1 a share, or &#8220;broke
the buck,&#8221; in September 2008 because it held debt issued by
bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Its closing triggered a
wider run on prime money funds that helped freeze global credit
markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said it would expand the daily disclosure
next week to include money funds that invest in municipal and
government debt. The daily values will be available to investors
on the morning after the previous day&#8217;s close. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan manages about $233 billion in U.S. money funds,
according to Crane Data, based in Westborough, Massachusetts.
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s asset-management unit manages $856 billion in
client money. It is the eighth-biggest provider of money-market
funds in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest

relief and direct cash payments to settle home-loan abuse claims
with regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank will make a cash payment of $753 million and set
aside $1.2 billion toward foreclosure prevention efforts as part
of an $8.5 billion deal with 10 banks and their regulators
announced Jan. 7, JPMorgan said in a regulatory filing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will take a $700 million pretax charge in the
fourth quarter related to the settlement, according to the New
York-based lender. It&#8217;s scheduled to report earnings Jan. 16. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) lost an appeal of a
three-year-old Beijing court ruling that it exceeded the scope
of a licensing agreement for Chinese fonts, according to rights
holder Zhongyi Electronic Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Beijing Higher People&#8217;s Court upheld a November 2009
judgment that Microsoft infringed Zhongyi&#8217;s rights for Chinese
character fonts, the Chinese company said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday. &#8220;We respect the court&#8217;s decision but
continue to believe our fonts licensing agreement with Zhongyi
should have granted us perpetual rights to the fonts at issue,&#8221;
Microsoft said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker, used the
Chinese fonts &#8220;without authorization&#8221; in Windows 98, 2000,
2003, and XP Chinese editions as well as worldwide sales of
multilanguage versions of Windows products, Zhongyi said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This ruling will not impact Microsoft customers in China
as it pertains to older versions of Microsoft products that are
no longer available for purchase,&#8221; the Redmond, Washington-
based company said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls to Zhongyi&#8217;s headquarters in Beijing weren&#8217;t
immediately answered after business hours yesterday &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) dropped two patents
related to industrywide technical specifications from an
infringement complaint against Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) at the U.S.
International Trade Commission, where Google is seeking to block
U.S. imports of Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox gaming system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a motion filed yesterday at the Washington-based trade
agency, Google&#8217;s Motorola Mobility unit said it planned to
continue its ITC case against Microsoft regarding a third patent
that doesn&#8217;t affect industry standards essential to letting
products from different manufacturers work together. Google also
said it would continue to seek damages relating to all the
patents in federal-court lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google&#8217;s move comes after it agreed, as part of a
settlement last week with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, to
limits on its ability to seek orders blocking sales or imports
of competitors&#8217; products based on so-called standard-essential
patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It looks like Google is taking heed of the FTC&#8217;s
decision,&#8221; patent lawyer Robert Stoll of Drinker Biddle in
Washington, who&#8217;s not involved in the dispute, said in an
interview today. &#8220;There&#8217;s been some concern they hadn&#8217;t at the
same time dropped these claims.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is &#8220;pleased that Google has finally withdrawn
these claims,&#8221; David Howard, deputy general counsel for the
software maker, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Niki Fenwick, a spokeswoman for Mountain View, California-
based Google, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reasonable Terms &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FTC settlement requires Google to offer competitors
&#8220;fair and reasonable&#8221; terms for licensing the use of patents
included in industrywide standards for smartphones, tablet
computers and other electronic devices. It also requires Google
to offer to resolve disputes through binding arbitration before
seeking to ban sales or imports by alleging infringement of
standard-essential patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FTC agreement resolved claims that Motorola Mobility,
which Google bought for $12.4 billion last year, abused patents
essential to industry standards to extract higher royalties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two standard-essential patents that Google dropped from
its ITC case involve technology for video decoding. The patent
that remains in dispute at the agency is for a way to establish
communication between Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox
and accessories. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
largest U.S. bank by assets, will begin disclosing the daily net
asset value for its U.S. commercial paper money-market funds as
regulators are debating an overhaul that would make the vehicles
safer for investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management expects to expand the daily
disclosure next week to money funds that invest in municipal and
government debt, the New York-based company said today in a
statement. The values of the funds as of 3 p.m. will be
disclosed the following day, Goldman Sachs said in an investor
update on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As a leading provider of liquidity solutions, we believe
that more frequent disclosure and greater transparency will
benefit investors,&#8221; Goldman Sachs said in the statement. &#8220;This
will have no impact to how fund shareholders transact or the way
the funds are managed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almarai Co. (ALMARAI), Saudi Arabia&#8217;s largest
food processor by market value, rose to a one-month high as
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) initiated coverage with an overweight
recommendation based on a pick up in sales and margins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares climbed 1.5 percent to 66 riyals, the strongest
level since Dec. 8, at the close in Riyadh, on 97 percent of
three-month average daily volume. JPMorgan set Almarai&#8217;s 12-
month share-price estimate at 87 riyals. The stock helped the
gauge&#8217;s 1 percent gain to 7,126.71, the highest since Sept. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almarai, which is benefiting from a pick up in domestic
demand for poultry and dairy products, may post a 15 percent
advance in profit this year, JPMorgan said. Saudi Arabia, whose
$727 billion economy expanded 6.8 percent in 2012, is the most-
populous nation in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council. The
company trades at 16 times estimated 2013 earnings, compared
with 22 times for BRF-Brasil Foods (BRFS3) SA, the world&#8217;s largest
poultry exporter, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Almarai offers an appealing risk-reward balance to play
the region&#8217;s demographic and income growth,&#8221; JP Morgan analysts
including by Muneeza Hasan said in e-mailed report today. The
company&#8217;s shares trade at a 14 percent discount to global peers,
based on 2013 earnings, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almarai may next week report a 9 percent increase in 2012
profit to 1.4 billion riyals ($373 million), according to the
average estimate of 14 analysts on Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect near-to-medium term performance to come from
continued healthy volume growth and a quarter-on-quarter pick up
in poultry business sales and margins,&#8221; JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four analysts recommend buy Almarai, while 12 say hold and
two advise to sell, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
shares advanced 12 percent in 2012, outpacing the benchmark
index&#8217;s 6 percent gain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dimitrios Kavvathas, a Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) partner, co-head of Asia Pacific excluding Japan
securities distribution, and head of structuring in the region,
will retire, according to an internal memo seen by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, James Houghton, also a partner, will become
head of Asia Pacific ex-Japan fixed income, commodities and
currencies distribution, according to a separate memo seen by
Bloomberg. The contents of both documents were confirmed by
Connie Ling, a spokeswoman at Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kavvathas joined Goldman Sachs in 2001 on the interest rate
hedge fund sales desk in London and in 2008 became co-head of
Europe, Middle East and Africa credit flow sales. He took over

&lt;p&gt;Francois-Xavier de Mallmann, a
London-based partner at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., bought an
apartment on Manhattan&#8217;s Park Avenue for $13 million, 13 percent
less than what its owners initially sought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal for the four-bedroom co-op at 730 Park Ave., near
71st Street, was completed on Dec. 26, according to New York
City property records made public today. The apartment was once
home to Richard Mack, chief executive officer of AREA Property
Partners LP&#8217;s North America division. Mack transferred the
property in 2011 to his wife, Christine, who was listed as the
seller, property records show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 4,300-square-foot (400-square-meter) property includes
a library, a staff room and a hallway &#8220;ideal for displaying
your art collection,&#8221; according to the Corcoran Group brokerage
listing posted on StreetEasy.com. &#8220;An outstanding layout with
spectacular entertainment space and grand rooms.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal was completed amid a surge in year-end luxury-home
transactions made before an expected jump in capital-gains taxes
on Jan. 1. There were more sales of Manhattan luxury property in
the last three months of 2012 than in any other fourth quarter
since at least 1989, when New York appraiser Miller Samuel Inc.
began tracking the data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luxury sales, defined as the top 10 percent of transactions
by price, jumped 29 percent from a year earlier to 260, based on
data Miller Samuel collected from public records through Dec.
31. The figures capture 85 percent of all such deals in the
quarter and will climb higher as purchases completed in the
final days of last month are reported with the city finance
department, said Jonathan Miller, the appraiser&#8217;s president. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Price Cut &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mack declined to comment on the deal. De Mallmann, Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s head of investment banking services in Europe, the
Middle East and Africa, didn&#8217;t return an e-mail. Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apartment de Mallmann purchased was first listed for
sale in April for $15 million, according to StreetEasy. The
asking price was reduced to $13.5 million in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De Mallmann, 42, joined Goldman Sachs in 1993 and became a
partner in 2004, one year after being named a managing director.
He was head of the European financing group before taking his
current job in 2011. He has French and Swiss citizenship,
according to a Goldman Sachs filing in November. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, is weighing whether to ask U.S. regulators to
expedite their review of a potential $5 billion-a-year treatment
to slow a type of incurable breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The therapy, called PD 0332991, generated excitement among
oncologists in December after data showed the drug stopped
disease progression for more than two years in 165 patients.
That trial was done in the second of three stages of research
regularly required for Food and Drug administration approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA has cleared cancer drugs for sale before final
trial results are completed, including New York-based Pfizer&#8217;s
Xalkori for lung tumors in 2011 and Novartis AG (NOVN)&#8217;s Gleevec for
leukemia a decade earlier. While no company decision has been
made to push for early clearance, &#8220;There are some precedents
for approval after Phase 2,&#8221; said Mikael Dolsten, Pfizer&#8217;s head
of worldwide research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ll see whether there are ways to accelerate
availability of the drug for patients,&#8221; Dolsten said in an
interview at the JPMorgan Chase  Co. health conference in San
Francisco. &#8220;We&#8217;re obviously open to dialogues and advice from
FDA and the European agencies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer climbed 1.1 percent to $26.76 at the close of New
York trading. The shares have increased 22 percent in the last
12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker hopes to start the final-stage trial by the
end of March, said Geno Germano, who heads the company&#8217;s
oncology and specialty care businesses. The medicine is the
first in a new class of agents that works by blocking a protein
critical in the cancer cell cycle, lead researcher Richard Finn
said in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Metastatic Disease &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study unveiled in December included women with tumors
fueled by the hormone estrogen, the most common type of breast
cancer. All had metastatic disease, which had spread to other
parts of the body and is no longer considered curable. Almost
230,000 women in the U.S. will be diagnosed with breast cancer
this year, and more than 39,900 will die from it, according to
the American Cancer Society. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If cleared, Pfizer&#8217;s drug may generate as much as $5
billion in yearly sales, wrote Andrew Baum, an analyst at
Citigroup Inc., in a Nov. 29 note to investors. That comes as
Pfizer is seeking new treatments to replace the $10 billion in
losses from its cholesterol medicine Lipitor, the world&#8217;s best-
selling pill with $13 billion in sales before losing market
exclusivity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;By the end of this year, we&#8217;re going to have the Phase 3
enrolling, we&#8217;re going to have two Phase 2s done, and we&#8217;re
going to be talking to the agency about getting the product to
patients,&#8221; Germano said in an interview at the conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Data Available &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The positive Phase 2 results, which showed the drug was
safe, may give Pfizer much of the data it could use to justify
seeking an early ruling, even without the larger number of
patients usually tested in a late-stage study, Dolsten said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The patients tolerate it very, very well, and that brings
the two components of benefit and risk to the table,&#8221; he said.
The agency has been &#8220;very thoughtful when it comes to making
those judgments on when they can accelerate access of drugs and
approve them on a smaller dataset than a traditional approval.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baum, the Citigroup analyst, said in his note that Pfizer
is already at least two years ahead of its closest competitors,
Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY) and Novartis, with similar cancer drugs in
development. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) sold $35
million of one-year notes linked to the price of gold, the
bank&#8217;s largest offering tied to the precious metal in at least
three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The securities, issued Jan. 2, yield three times the gains
of the price of gold in London up to 15.6 percent, with no
protection against losses and all capital at risk, according to
a prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. The metal&#8217;s price increased 8.3 percent last year in
London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank sold $82.4 million of notes tied to gold in eight
offerings last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
New York-based JPMorgan issued $27.8 million of one-year
securities on Oct. 26, the next-largest deal since 2010, when
Bloomberg began collecting comprehensive data on U.S. structured
notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Seymour, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan Chase,
declined to comment on the latest offering or future gold notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computers running Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s
Windows software and Intel Corp. (INTC)&#8217;s processors will continue
losing market share to tablets and smartphones this year,
according to researcher Canalys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So-called Wintel machines will grab 65 percent of the
computer market this year, down from 72 percent in 2012, Canalys
said. In the fourth quarter of last year, combined shipments of
desktops, netbooks and notebooks declined about 10 percent from
the same period in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows 8, a new version of Microsoft&#8217;s flagship software
revamped to work with touch-screen machines, hasn&#8217;t helped boost
PC sales because many consumers resisted the need to learn a new
operating system, Canalys said. As PCs fall out of favor, the
market for tablets such as Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPad and touch-screen
devices running Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Android software will surge to
reach 59 percent of the market, or 389 million units, by 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Wintel PCs are becoming less likely as an individual&#8217;s
first choice of computing device for everyday tasks, such as
sending e-mail or Web browsing,&#8221; Pin-Chen Tang, an analyst at
Canalys, said in a research report. &#8220;Pads and, increasingly,
smartphones can perform many of the day-to-day computing tasks
that most people require.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks erased earlier gains as
Apple Inc. reversed a rally and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) tumbled,
dragging down technology shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index rose less than 0.1 percent
to 1,461.39 at 11:17 a.m. in New York, after an earlier advance
of as much as 0.6 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell
6.24 points, or 0.1 percent, to 13,384.27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple lost less than 0.1 percent to $516.90, erasing a
rally of 2.3 percent, as Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster cut
his price target on the shares to $875 from $900. Microsoft fell

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) racked up more U.S. patents than any other company for the
20th straight year, helped by increasing contributions from its
researchers in other countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s 6,478 patents in 2012 mark a record for the company,
research firm IFI Claims Patent Services said in a statement.
South Korea&#8217;s Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) and Tokyo-based Canon Inc. (7751)
ranked second and third. Google Inc. took a spot in the top 50
for the first time, with 15 more patents than Apple (AAPL) Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 30 percent of IBM&#8217;s patents were produced by
inventors outside the U.S., up from 22 percent in 2010. Research
centers in Germany, Japan, Canada, the U.K. and Israel were
especially productive, the Armonk, New York-based company said.
The percentage of its patents coming from overseas is expected
to continue growing as newer labs in Brazil and Kenya ramp up,
said Manny Schecter, IBM&#8217;s chief patent counsel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Intellectual property flows from where markets are
flourishing,&#8221; he said in an interview. &#8220;You&#8217;ll see upticks in
the amount of technology and intellectual property which we
generate outside the U.S.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s flow of patents lets the computer-services giant
produce about $1 billion a year in licensing revenue. The
intellectual property also gives it the freedom to move into new
businesses with less risk of being sued over technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Qualcomm&#8217;s Bounty &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, some other technology companies get much higher
royalty revenue from a smaller number of patents. Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM),
a designer of mobile-phone chips, made $6.33 billion in
technology licensing in the most recent fiscal year -- even
though it&#8217;s not in the top 10 of IFI&#8217;s list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple, whose innovations helped revolutionize computing and
mobile phones, also isn&#8217;t one of the biggest recipients of U.S.
patents. The maker of the iPhone and iPad spends about half as
much as IBM on research and development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, Apple did make gains in this year&#8217;s list, jumping
to No. 22 from 39th place. Google, Apple&#8217;s biggest rival in
smartphone software, rose to 21st place. Both companies are
embroiled in lawsuits over intellectual property -- along with
other mobile-phone makers such as Samsung -- giving them more
incentive to increase their store of patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Broader Trend &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies are applying for more U.S. patents in general,
Mike Baycroft, chief executive officer of Madison, Connecticut-
based IFI, said in the statement. This year, the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office issued a total of 253,155 patents, a record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, which has more than 430,000 employees worldwide,
invests about $6 billion in RD each year. With more than 67,000
patents since 1993, about half of which are active, it is easier
for the company to avoid courtrooms, Schecter has said. Eight
thousand inventors in 46 states and 35 countries contributed to
last year&#8217;s patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest crop of patents underscores the kinds of markets
IBM is trying to enter. In computer security, the company has a
patent for blocking attacks from an intruder to a network. In
the realm of IBM&#8217;s Smarter Planet initiative, the company was
granted one patent for predicting traffic patterns using GPS in
vehicles and another for remotely monitoring and adjusting power
usage across an electricity grid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patents also included a technique for providing precise
answers to natural-language questions. This is the technology
that IBM uses for Watson, the computer that beat humans on the
&#8220;Jeopardy!&#8221; quiz show and is now being applied to health care
and finance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our future intellectual property strategy is a reflection
of our business strategy,&#8221; Schecter said. &#8220;We like being the
leader and will continue to be very aggressive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fernandez, 47, left Goldman Sachs in April, where he had

serving existing ones, Bob Sloan, managing partner of S3, said
yesterday in a telephone interview. Fernandez will report to
Sloan in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S3, which Sloan founded 10 years ago, advises clients with
more than $140 billion in assets, he said. Investment banks and
securities firms provide a range of prime-brokerage services to
hedge funds, including securities lending, leveraged financing
and introductions to investors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing Automotive Group Co., which
makes vehicles in China with Daimler AG (DAI) and Hyundai Motor Co. (005380),
hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) for the Hong
Kong initial public offering of its car unit, three people with
knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Beijing-based company, known as BAIC, may seek more
than $1 billion in the IPO as soon as this year, said the
people, who asked not to be identified because the information
is private. The IPO would be the biggest by an automaker since
General Motors Co. (GM)&#8217;s $18.1 billion offering in 2010, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BAIC would use IPO proceeds to develop its own brand,
Chairman Xu Heyi said in September. The state-owned company,
which traces its roots to making sidecar motorcycles used in the
Korean War, has said it wants to make &#8220;world-class&#8221; cars by
2025 and hired Ferrari designer Leonardo Fioravanti to help
improve its brand appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IPO may get pushed into 2014 as BAIC restructures the
car unit, said one of the people. A press official at BAIC said
he couldn&#8217;t immediately comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New share sales by Chinese companies in Hong Kong have
slowed along with growth in the world&#8217;s second-largest economy.
Chinese companies raised $6.4 billion in Hong Kong IPOs last
year, the smallest amount since 2004, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) dropped two patents
related to industrywide technical specifications from an
infringement complaint against Microsoft Corp. at the U.S.
International Trade Commission, where Google is seeking to block
U.S. imports of Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox gaming system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a motion filed Jan. 8 at the Washington-based trade
agency, Google&#8217;s Motorola Mobility unit said it planned to
continue its ITC case against Microsoft regarding a third patent
that doesn&#8217;t affect industry standards essential to letting
products from different manufacturers work together. Google also
said it would continue to seek damages relating to all the
patents in federal-court lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google&#8217;s move comes after it agreed, as part of a
settlement last week with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, to
limits on its ability to seek orders blocking sales or imports
of competitors&#8217; products based on so-called standard-essential
patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is &#8220;pleased that Google has finally withdrawn
these claims,&#8221; David Howard, deputy general counsel for the
software maker, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Niki Fenwick, a spokeswoman for Mountain View, California-
based Google, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FTC settlement requires Google to offer competitors
&#8220;fair and reasonable&#8221; terms for licensing the use of patents
included in industrywide standards for smartphones, tablet
computers and other electronic devices. It also requires Google
to offer to resolve disputes through binding arbitration before
seeking to ban sales or imports by alleging infringement of
standard-essential patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FTC agreement resolved claims that Motorola Mobility,
which Google bought for $12.4 billion last year, abused patents
essential to industry standards to extract higher royalties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two standard-essential patents that Google dropped from
its ITC case involve technology for video decoding. The patent
that remains in dispute at the agency is for a way to establish
communication between Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox
and accessories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sony Seeks U.S. Patent on Method to Bar Second-Hand Game Use &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony Corp. (6758), maker of the PlayStation games console, is
seeking a patent on a technology that would block the use of
second-hand games on its device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Application 20130007892, published in the database of the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Jan. 3, covers a method of
restricting the use of electronic content stored in a recording
medium. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would be accomplished by embedding radio-frequency
identification tags in the medium that would have to match the
use-permission processing system in the console, according to
the application. It wouldn&#8217;t be necessary for the device to be
connected to the Internet for the use-permission system to
operate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tokyo-based Sony said it intends to sell the game disk and
the use-permission tag as an inseparable set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony applied for the patent in September, according to the
application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lack of Patent Notice Tipped POWs to Monopoly-Game Escape Maps &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monopoly games sent to allied prisoners detained in Nazi
concentration camps during World War II often contained escape
maps and secret messages, the U.K.&#8217;s Guardian newspaper
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waddingtons, the U.K. publisher of the Monopoly game,
worked with a secret department of the U.K. government to
develop game boards with hidden content, and they were
distinguished from those without special content by the omission
of the &#8220;patent applied for&#8221; notice, according to the Guardian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waddingtons, which was acquired by U.S.-based toymaker
Hasbro Inc. (HAS) in 1994, laminated silk escape maps within the
Monopoly boards, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The games were sent to the camps by fake charities, from
fake addresses or bombed-out buildings, the Guardian reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Patent Sought for Use of Bruker Device to Find Drug Resistance &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A precision scientific instruments made by Massachusetts-
based Bruker Corp. (BRKR) is a key element in a new technology to be
used to identify antibiotic-resistant diseases, the company said
in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam have
applied for a patent on the use of a specialized mass
spectrometry instrument to detect the patterns of chemical
degradation of an antibiotic in a particular patient that would
indicate that a particular antibiotic is ineffective, according
to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bruker signed an exclusive license with Erasmus University
for the use of this technology, which will enable rapid testing
for drug resistance in a clinical setting, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said the World Health Organization, a United
Nations agency, has reported that the resistance of some
pathogens has now reached 50 percent in some countries, and
about 400,000 such infections are occurring in Europe each year,
leading to 25,000 deaths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theo Luider, head of the Laboratories of Neuro-Oncology,
Department of Neurology at Erasmus University Rotterdam, said in
the Bruker statement that the patent application covers

&lt;h2&gt;Car-Freshner Gets $100,000 Judgment in Trademark Dispute &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Car-Freshner Corp., the company that makes tree-shaped
deodorizers for cars, has won $100,000 in a trademark-
infringement case against a Nevada company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a Jan. 4 ruling, Air Fresheners Inc. of Las
Vegas is ordered to quit making any reference to &#8220;Little
Tree&#8221;-related trademarks, and has to quilt selling any
infringing products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the $100,000 judgment, the court ordered Air
Fresheners to pay Watertown, New York-based Car-Freshner $10,000
for each future infringement plus $1 for each infringing product
produced or distributed after Jan. 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past decade, Car-Freshner has filed more than 30
trademark-infringement suits against a wide range of defendants,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company sued Air Fresheners in federal court in
Syracuse, New York, in December 2009, claiming its trademarks
were infringed by the sale of tree-shaped deodorizers and that
the defendants were using hidden text in Internet ads to drive
potential Car-Freshner customers to their site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Car-Freshner Co. v. Air Fresheners Inc., 7:10-
cv-01491, U.S. District Court, Northern District of New York
(Syracuse). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Microsoft Loses China Appeal on Font Copyright, Zhongyi Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) lost an appeal of a three-year-old Beijing
court ruling that it exceeded the scope of a licensing agreement
for Chinese fonts, according to rights holder Zhongyi Electronic
Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Beijing Higher People&#8217;s Court upheld a November 2009
judgment that Microsoft infringed Zhongyi&#8217;s rights for Chinese
character fonts, the Chinese company said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday. &#8220;We respect the court&#8217;s decision but
continue to believe our fonts licensing agreement with Zhongyi
should have granted us perpetual rights to the fonts at issue,&#8221;
Microsoft said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker, used the
Chinese fonts &#8220;without authorization&#8221; in Windows 98, 2000,
2003, and XP Chinese editions as well as worldwide sales of
multilanguage versions of Windows products, Zhongyi said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This ruling will not impact Microsoft customers in China
as it pertains to older versions of Microsoft products that are
no longer available for purchase,&#8221; the Redmond, Washington-
based company said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls to Zhongyi&#8217;s headquarters in Beijing weren&#8217;t
immediately answered after business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Literary Works by Woolf, Joyce, Babel Lose Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A blog in the U.K. that covers European copyright law has
released a list of writers whose works went into the public
domain Jan. 1. The law provides a term of life plus seventy
years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among those on The 1709 Blog&#8217;s list for 2013 are feminist
novelist Virginia Woolf, Russian writer Isaak Babel, Canadian
singer/songwriter Mary Rose-Anna Bolduc, &#8220;Waltzing Matilda&#8221;
author Banjo Paterson, and Irish novelist James Joyce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BSA Establishes Reward Program for Software Piracy Informants &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Business Software Alliance, a Washington-based advocacy
group of software producers, has set up a program rewarding
those who report software piracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the terms and conditions of the BSA program,
it applies only to piracy taking place in the U.S. or Canada and
is exclusive to business end users who use unlicensed software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BSA said it will reward those who provide information not
previously known to the organization, and that anyone who
reports must not be someone who has installed the software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of the reward is related to the amount of
settlement BSA receives from the organization accused of piracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the settlement paid is above $15 million, the potential
reward payment can be as much as $1 million, according to the
guidelines. The smallest settlement amount that can earn a
reward is $15,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organization said that if it or one of its member
companies files a lawsuit related to the facts reported by the
informant, no reward is payable. BSA said that at its
discretion, it could reimburse informants for their time and
&#8220;reasonable expenses&#8221; for submitting the report, responding to
the association&#8217;s follow-up questions and attending or
testifying at the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc. (AAPL), Intel Corp. (INTC) and Symantec Corp. (SYMC)
are among BSA&#8217;s members, according its website, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s private-
wealth-management unit expects hedge funds to return an average
of 4 percent to 5 percent over the next five years as the
industry struggles amid low interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Everybody hopes to get the five hedge funds, all of whom
are going to have 15 percent returns,&#8221; Sharmin Mossavar- Rahmani, chief investment officer of Goldman Sachs Private
Wealth Management&#8217;s Investment Strategy Group, said at a press
briefing today. &#8220;People need to be more realistic.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $2.19 trillion hedge-fund industry last year trailed
global stocks for the fifth time in seven years, posting a 6.7
percent gain, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The MSCI
All-Country World Index (MXWO) returned 17 percent in 2012, and the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index (SPX) rose 16 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve officials said last year they will keep
interest rates near zero as long as the jobless rate is above
6.5 percent and inflation is forecast to be 2.5 percent or less.
Previously they said they will keep rates low through at least
mid-2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mossavar-Rahmani said investors are &#8220;overestimating&#8221; how
much hedge funds can return in excess of market indexes. While
some managers may do well, the low-interest-rate environment
makes it difficult to produce double-digit returns, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They don&#8217;t walk on water,&#8221; Mossavar-Rahmani said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity funds and event-driven funds, those that invest in
companies undergoing transactions such as mergers or spinoffs,
may benefit if stock markets rise next year, she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Splunk Inc. (SPLK), a maker of software
that helps businesses analyze Web data, climbed the most in more
than four months on speculation that the company might be
acquired by International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares increased 8.4 percent to $32.27 at the close in
New York, the biggest gain since Aug. 31. Shares of the San
Francisco-based company have advanced 90 percent since an
initial public offering in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Splunk could lure offers of as much as $4 billion, James Gilman, an analyst at Drexel Hamilton LLC, said in an interview.
IBM, the largest computer services provider, or Oracle Corp. (ORCL),
the biggest provider of database software, might consider buying
Splunk to expand services for corporate customers, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have heard IBM,&#8221; Peter Goldmacher, an analyst at Cowen
 Co., said in an interview about potential buyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Sciales, a spokesman for IBM, said the company
doesn&#8217;t comment on rumors or speculation. Deborah Hellinger, an
Oracle spokeswoman, declined to comment. Tom Stilwell, a Splunk
spokesman, didn&#8217;t respond to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2004 by Erik Swan, Rob Das and Michael Baum,
Splunk is the first of the so-called big data companies to go
public, providing software that helps businesses monitor and
analyze information to improve service, cut operations costs and
reduce security risks. Its backers include venture firms  August
Capital, JKB Capital, Ignition and Sevin Rosen Funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has been expanding its efforts to analyze business data
to improve performance and security. The company plans to make
$16 billion from analytics by 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle Chief Executive Officer Larry Ellison is spending to
add cloud software that customers can rent and run over the
Internet, a tool Spunk provides. In December, Oracle agreed to
buy Eloqua Inc. for about $871 million, further expanding in
cloud computing and ratcheting up competition with
Salesforce.com Inc. and SAP AG. (SAP) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission will appeal a court restriction on its access to
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) e-mail in a probe of market manipulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The energy regulator will challenge a magistrate judge&#8217;s
November order blocking a review of unredacted copies of 25 e-
mails because they involve attorney communications, it said
today in a filing in federal court in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FERC sued New York-based JPMorgan July 2 demanding the e-
mails in an investigation of possible manipulation of power
markets in California and the Midwest by J.P. Morgan Ventures
Energy Corp. The agency opened the probe last year after
complaints from California and Midwest grid operators who said
JPMorgan&#8217;s bidding practices were abusive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Magistrate Judge Deborah Robinson said she agreed with
JPMorgan&#8217;s lawyers that the redacted portions are confidential
communications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to an e-mail message seeking comment on the
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Federal Energy Regulatory Commission v. J.P.
Morgan Ventures Energy Corp., 12-mc-352, U.S. District Court,
District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global securitization volumes jumped
20 percent last year to $511.6 billion as JPMorgan Chase (JPM)  Co.
widened its lead as the top underwriter, according to newsletter
Asset-Backed Alert. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan managed the sales for $66.2 billion, or 12.9
percent, of the total offerings of securities backed by assets
such as home mortgages, auto debt and speculative-grade company
loans, according to the newsletter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s share grew from 10.1 percent in 2011 as the New
York-based firm managed $39.9 billion in sales of asset-backed
securities tied to U.S. consumer or corporate borrowing, a
category that excludes mortgage debt and so-called
collateralized debt obligations. Barclays Plc (BARC) and Bank of
America Corp., the other top underwriters in that market,
remained the second- and third-ranked global bookrunners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays handled 10 percent of the global total last year,
up from 9.2 percent for the London-based bank, according to
Asset-Backed Alert. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of
America&#8217;s share climbed to 8.7 percent, from 8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide securitization volumes are down from the record
$2.57 trillion reached in 2006, a year before U.S. mortgage
securities and CDOs began a collapse that would spark the worst
financial crisis since the Great Depression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Securitization fell to $330.6 billion in 2009, excluding
bonds that were created outside the U.S. to be retained by the
issuers and pledged as collateral for loans from central banks,
according to Asset-Backed Alert. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newsletter&#8217;s securitization tallies exclude government-
backed U.S. home-loan bonds and repackagings of that debt called
agency collateralized mortgage obligations, asset-backed
commercial paper and the derivative portions of certain issues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) will become the
latest big bank ordered by U.S. regulators to clean up its
safeguards against money laundering, said a person briefed on
the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banking regulators including the Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency will soon order the largest U.S. bank to fix
compliance flaws in its Bank Secrecy Act responsibilities, said
the person, who declined to be identified because the talks
aren&#8217;t public. The order doesn&#8217;t include monetary penalties and
is similar to one issued to Citigroup Inc. (C) in April, the person
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan, and Bryan Hubbard, an OCC spokesman, declined to
comment on the order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the 2008 credit crisis companies reduced compliance
staff tasked with guarding the financial system against the flow
of illicit money, banking regulators said. HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA),
Europe&#8217;s largest bank, agreed last month to pay $1.9 billion to
settle a money-laundering probe by the U.S. Department of
Justice and banking regulators in the U.S. and U.K. Another
London-based bank, Standard Chartered Plc, was fined a total of
$667 million by U.S. regulators last year for facilitating
transactions with Iran in violation of sanctions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate OCC probe, Treasury Department Inspector
General Eric Thorson threatened to sanction the bank if it fails
to turn over documents to regulators investigating its ties to
Bernard Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme, giving JPMorgan a deadline of
today to cooperate with the regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OCC is also investigating the 2012 trading losses in
JPMorgan&#8217;s chief investment office and is preparing an
enforcement action, according to another person briefed on the
situation who asked not to be named because the matter isn&#8217;t
public. The cease-and-desist order would require the bank to fix
internal risk controls, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) racked up more U.S. patents than any other company for the
20th straight year, helped by increasing contributions from its
researchers in other countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s 6,478 patents in 2012 mark a record for the company,
research firm IFI Claims Patent Services said in a statement.
South Korea&#8217;s Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) and Tokyo-based Canon Inc. (7751)
ranked second and third. Google Inc. took a spot in the top 50
for the first time, with 15 more patents than Apple (AAPL) Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 30 percent of IBM&#8217;s patents were produced by
inventors outside the U.S., up from 22 percent in 2010. Research
centers in Germany, Japan, Canada, the U.K. and Israel were
especially productive, the Armonk, New York-based company said.
The percentage of its patents coming from overseas is expected
to continue growing as newer labs in Brazil and Kenya ramp up,
said Manny Schecter, IBM&#8217;s chief patent counsel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Intellectual property flows from where markets are
flourishing,&#8221; he said in an interview. &#8220;You&#8217;ll see upticks in
the amount of technology and intellectual property which we
generate outside the U.S.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s flow of patents lets the computer-services giant
produce about $1 billion a year in licensing revenue. The
intellectual property also gives it the freedom to move into new
businesses with less risk of being sued over technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, some other technology companies get much higher
royalty revenue from a smaller number of patents. Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM),
a designer of mobile-phone chips, made $6.33 billion in
technology licensing in the most recent fiscal year -- even
though it&#8217;s not in the top 10 of IFI&#8217;s list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple, whose innovations helped revolutionize computing and
mobile phones, also isn&#8217;t one of the biggest recipients of U.S.
patents. The maker of the iPhone and iPad spends about half as
much as IBM on research and development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, Apple made gains in this year&#8217;s list, jumping to
No. 22 from 39th place. Google, Apple&#8217;s biggest rival in
smartphone software, rose to 21st place. Both companies are
embroiled in lawsuits over intellectual property -- along with
other mobile-phone makers such as Samsung -- giving them more
incentive to increase their store of patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, which has more than 430,000 employees worldwide,
invests about $6 billion in RD each year. With more than 67,000
patents since 1993, about half of which are active, it is easier
for the company to avoid courtrooms, Schecter has said. Eight
thousand inventors in 46 states and 35 countries contributed to
last year&#8217;s patents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;EU&#8217;s Almunia Says Google May Be Diverting Traffic to Its Sites &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s dominance of the Web-search market in Europe
concerns regulators there, despite the company&#8217;s recent
settlement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, Joaquin
Almunia told the Financial Times in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almunia, the European Commission vice president with the
responsibility for competition, said an investigation of
Mountain View, California-based Google is continuing and &#8220;my
conviction is that they are diverting traffic&#8221; to their own
sites, the Financial Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has said that he will give the search-engine company
until the end of January to come up with a settlement that will
assuage antitrust concerns, according to the Financial Times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almunia said Google officials are handling the European
Commission&#8217;s investigation better than other antitrust targets
in the past, and that the company &#8220;has learned the way these
kind of cases should be done,&#8221; the Financial Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ikea&#8217;s Planned India Expansion May Hit Trademark Roadblocks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ikea of Sweden AB&#8217;s plans to open retail stores in India
may face trademark roadblocks, India&#8217;s Business Standard
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the newspaper, three Indian companies
registered with that country&#8217;s Registrar of Companies to use the
same brand name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ikea Home Decor Private Ltd., a furniture manufacturer, has
been registered since July 2011, and two other Indian companies
have earlier registration dates than that, the Business Standard
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Swedish furniture giant could go to Indian
courts and claim the registrants were trying to trade on Ikea&#8217;s
goodwill and fame, this could take a long time if the other
companies have actually registered trademarks, Business Standard
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MLS Application to Register &#8216;Cascadia Cup&#8217; Mark Irk Soccer Fans &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major League Soccer has responded to Pacific Northwest
soccer fans&#8217; concerns over a trademark application by promising
to meet three fan groups, the SounderAtHeart.com blog reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The league is seeking to register &#8220;Cascadia Cup&#8221; as a
trademark, even though fan groups own the trophy and came up
with the idea for the award, according to the blog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application was filed with the aim of halting potential
exploitation of the term &#8220;by parties unaffiliated with the
league and its supporters,&#8221; the league said in a statement, the
blog reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The league said it understood there were some fan concerns
about how the use of the mark would be managed, and hoped the
forthcoming meeting with the leadership of the fan groups would
assuage fears, according to the blog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Brabham Name, Trademark Back in Auto-Racing Family&#8217;s Hands &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A German court has resolved a trademark dispute between a
family associated with Formula 1 auto racing and a German who
registered the family&#8217;s name in Germany, the Motorsport.com
auto-racing news blog reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Registration of the Brabham trademarks have now reverted to
the family, which includes triple Formula 1 World Champion Jack
Brabham, according to Motorsport.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third generation of racing Brabham&#8217;s is &#8220;coming up
through the ranks,&#8221; David Brabham told Motorsports.com, and the
ruling will &#8220;help future plans for the Brabham brand.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A monitoring system has been set up to look for any
attempts worldwide to register the Brabham name without the
family&#8217;s consent, Motorsport.com reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gazprom Unit, Rostelecom Sued Over Use of Blur Song in TV Ad &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gazprom OAO (GAZP)&#8217;s NTV unit and Russian telecommunications
operator Rostelecom were sued for copyright infringement over
alleged unauthorized use of &#8220;Song2&#8221; from the British band
Blur, the Russian International News Agency reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court has been asked to force Rostelecom to publish the
text of an earlier infringement ruling related to the music&#8217;s
copyright, and to order payments of $115,100 from Rostelecom and
$16,435 from NTV, according to the news agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rostelecom was accused of using the song in an
advertisement, and NTV was sued for allegedly running that ad on
its television channel, the news agency reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit was filed by SGBA Music Publishing, a unit of Gala
Records, Russia&#8217;s first privately owned music recording company,
according to the news agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Faulkner Literary Rights, Northrop Grumman Settle Dispute &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A copyright-infringement lawsuit brought by the owners of
the rights to the late William Faulkner&#8217;s work against Northrop
Grumman Corp. (NOC) has been settled, according to a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faulkner Literary Rights LLC sued the Falls Church,
Virginia-based defense contractor for copyright infringement in
federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, in October. The rights
holder objected to the use of a Faulkner quote in an
advertisement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We must be free, not because we claim freedom, but
because we practice it,&#8221; is taken from a 1956 Faulkner essay,
&#8220;On Fear: The South in Labor,&#8221; according to court papers. The
Faulkner rights holder claims the quote was used without
permission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobel laureate Faulkner, a novelist who wrote about his
native Mississippi, died in 1962. He was also the winner of two
Pulitzer Prizes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terms of the settlement weren&#8217;t disclosed. According to the
court filing, each party was to pay its own litigation costs,
including legal fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Faulkner Literary Rights LLC v. Northrop
Grumman Corp., 12-cv-00732, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of Mississippi (Jackson). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The base salaries of analysts at
three major U.S. investment banks have declined since 2009,
while increasing 15 percent at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CHART OF THE DAY shows that from 2009 to 2012, the base
pay of analysts at Goldman Sachs increased to $76,250 on average
from $66,000 according to data provided by Glassdoor, a San
Francisco-based career website. The combined average pay at Bank
of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. over
the same period fell to $58,226 from $62,105. The data, which
exclude bonuses and other forms of compensation, were gathered
from verified surveys of analysts with one to three years of
experience at each firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower salaries are &#8220;consistent with what we&#8217;re hearing, so
it suggests to me that until there&#8217;s a turnaround in the banking
sector, until the next period of real growth, we may see more of
the same,&#8221; said John Challenger, chief executive officer of
Chicago-based Challenger Gray  Christmas Inc., an employment
consulting firm. &#8220;Goldman has continued to go out and pay for
and be the place that the very top talent wants to go. It&#8217;s a
conscious choice that they&#8217;ve made to not lose that position.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and
Citigroup declined to comment on the Glassdoor survey. Morgan
Stanley is planning to eliminate 1,600 jobs in the coming weeks
according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. This
accounts for 6 percent of the company&#8217;s investment banking
division. The nine largest investment banks announced more than
30,000 job cuts in the first nine months of 2012 according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s joint venture

Bei Duoguang, according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bei will remain with the firm, called JPMorgan First
Capital Securities Co., as vice chairman and focus on client
relationships, the memo showed. Lisa Liang, a Beijing-based
spokeswoman for JPMorgan, confirmed the memo&#8217;s contents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ren, who joined the China venture in June 2012 as deputy
CEO and head of investment banking, was previously at Bank of
China Ltd. and its investment-banking unit for 24 years,
according to the document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based JPMorgan started offering underwriting in
China in 2011, after forming a joint venture with First Capital
Securities Co. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) was the first Wall
Street firm to win an underwriting license in China in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;

Chinese stock sales last year, according to data compiled by

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) portrayed speech recognition pioneer Dragon Systems Inc. as rushing to close a $580 million deal without sufficiently vetting its buyer in a doomed union that triggered a negligence suit and landed the bank in Boston federal court. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Beginning its defense this week, Goldman Sachs made its case to jurors who have spent weeks hearing how the 2000 all- stock deal was quickly followed by an accounting scandal that led to the collapse of suitor Lernout  Hauspie Speech Products NV. Goldman Sachs, which advised Dragon on the deal, called witnesses to counter allegations by Dragon founders Jim and Janet Baker that its negligence cost them their life&#8217;s work. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Testifying Jan. 9 for Goldman Sachs, former Dragon president John Shagoury agreed with a bank attorney that Dragon&#8217;s board of directors was focused on &#8220;speed and certainty&#8221; in the months leading to the deal. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Because the company&#8217;s financial situation was getting worse instead of better, and at the same time we felt it was creating a huge distraction for the employees, we needed to get something done, or decide how the company was going to continue,&#8221; Shagoury testified. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Do you blame Goldman Sachs that the stock options became worthless in the merger?&#8221; Goldman Sachs attorney Paul Vizcarrondo asked. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;No,&#8221; said Shagoury, who became president of Lernout  Hauspie Holdings USA when the deal closed, and is now president of health care communications technology company Eliza Corp. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Gross Negligence &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dragon&#8217;s founders, who are seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages, claim that four Goldman Sachs bankers assigned to the transaction committed gross negligence by failing to pursue questions about Belgium-based Lernout  Hauspie&#8217;s finances that should have led them to avoid the deal. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They alleged in court papers that they lost their company and access to the technology they had spent their careers developing, including Dragon NaturallySpeaking dictation software, when Lernout  Hauspie filed for bankruptcy in November 2000. The deal closed in June of that year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs claimed its team gave Dragon competent advice and said it urged company management to press their accountants at Arthur Andersen LLP to probe Lernout  Hauspie&#8217;s finances. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Bakers, who started Dragon in 1982, claim the bankers failed to do due diligence and never advised them to back away from the sale despite lingering questions about LH&#8217;s unusual revenue spikes in Asia. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Due Diligence &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lawyers for New York-based Goldman Sachs have argued that due diligence wasn&#8217;t the bank&#8217;s responsibility under a five-page engagement agreement. Several members of the banking team who worked on the deal said in court testimony that Goldman Sachs properly shepherded the transaction to a final sale. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dragon paid Goldman Sachs $5 million for its advice. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the sale moving ahead in February 2000, Goldman Sachs sent Dragon an unsigned memo recommending the company have Arthur Anderson perform due diligence on Lernout  Hauspie, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Catherine Moy, who worked on the Dragon account for Arthur Anderson, testified Jan. 7 that her firm&#8217;s work was &#8220;very limited&#8221; on the deal. She said the accounting firm was never hired to do any of the tasks Goldman Sachs described in its Feb. 29 memo to Dragon. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Former Dragon President Shagoury testified that he remembered both Dragon&#8217;s chief financial officer, Ellen Chamberlain, and Goldman Sachs&#8217;s team wanted further due diligence. He said Chamberlain eventually declared it done. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Recalls Completion &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I recall she said the due diligence was completed,&#8221; Shagoury told jurors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chamberlain, who testified Dec. 18, told the jury that Dragon expected Goldman Sachs to conduct due diligence. She said no one from the bank ever expressed reservations about moving forward with the sale. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I had a level of expectation of bankers driving a process, making due diligence happen, being very active, detailed and that was not the way Goldman Sachs operated,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chamberlain also testified that no one on the Goldman team ever mentioned that the bank&#8217;s own investment division had investigated LH in the late 1990s, under work labeled internally as &#8220;Project Sermon,&#8221; and decided not to invest. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a videotaped deposition played for the jury Jan. 4, Goldman Sachs analyst Luca Velussi, who worked on Project Sermon, said he couldn&#8217;t remember specific reasons why that project didn&#8217;t move forward. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Abandoned Projects &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We abandon the vast majority of projects,&#8221; Velussi said under questioning by the Bakers&#8217; attorney, Alan Cotler. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;T. Otey Smith, a former member of the Goldman Sachs team who worked on the Dragon deal, testified in a taped deposition that the team&#8217;s leader, Richard Wayner, didn&#8217;t press the issue that there were unanswered questions about the merger when Dragon&#8217;s board of directors met and voted to approved it in March 2000. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wayner testified last month that Goldman Sachs had unanswered questions about Lernout  Hauspie&#8217;s suspicious surges in sales in Asia -- revenue that turned out to be fictitious -- but never sought to stop Dragon from selling. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wayner told the jury that, after informing Dragon that Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t receive satisfactory answers from LH, it was &#8220;the client&#8217;s decision whether or not they want to do the deal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Inadequate Standards &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A former investment banker testifying on behalf of Dragon this week told jurors Goldman Sachs&#8217;s team &#8220;didn&#8217;t provide the level of standards Goldman sets for itself,&#8221; nor did it meet industry standards. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Their failure to do that gave the folks at the March 27 meeting a flawed and inaccurate picture of what a merger with LH would actually look like,&#8221; said Donna Hitscherich, a former investment banker with JPMorgan Chase  Co. who now lectures at Columbia Business School, referring to the board meeting. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She said she spent more than 700 hours reviewing records from the case. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I was shocked,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It was grossly subpar and inadequate for the type of engagement they were assigned to.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She said she would have expected Goldman Sachs to take additional action after sending Dragon the February 2000 memo. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;In my mind, that&#8217;s a showstopper,&#8221; Hitscherich said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Next Week &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Testimony in the case, presided over by U.S. District Judge Patti Saris, is scheduled to resume Jan. 14. Goldman Sachs Vice President Chris Fine, who was chief technology strategist for the bank&#8217;s high-tech group during the Dragon sale, is to return to the witness stand. Goldman Sachs also said that it plans to call Wayner to testify again. Closing arguments are expected to begin at the end of next week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Jan. 9, Fine testified the Goldman Sachs team working on the deal developed a list of questions that needed answers in the months prior to the sale, and advised Dragon to obtain an accounting firm with knowledge of accounting regulations in Belgium. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Did Dragon follow up on the recommendation to do more due diligence?&#8221; a Goldman Sachs&#8217;s lawyer asked Fine. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Not that I recall,&#8221; he responded. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another case against New York-based Goldman Sachs filed by Paul G. Bamberg and Robert Roth, two other Dragon founders who held minority shares in the company, is being heard at the same time before Saris. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Lernout&#8217;s Collapse &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Lernout  Hauspie created bogus customers, booked circular transactions with shell companies and recorded loans as sales from 1996 to 2000. The company was forced to restate $373 million in earnings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The suit against Goldman Sachs was put on hold by agreement of both sides for years while the Bakers sued other participants and advisers in the deal. They&#8217;ve reached a total of about $70 million in settlements, their lawyer, Cotler, has told Saris. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Based on the value of Dragon at the time of the sale, the Bakers&#8217; lost as much as $288.8 million in the deal and its aftermath, they said in court papers. Bamberg and Roth have said they lost as much as $50 million. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In court filings, Goldman Sachs said the plaintiffs&#8217; damages are less than the amount they&#8217;ve already recovered. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Jan. 2, Bamberg, now a senior lecturer on mathematics at Harvard University, testified he initially opposed the merger and was shocked when the deal became an all-stock offering. In one conversation with Dragon board members, he said he compared partnering with Lernout  Hauspie to joining the Serbian Army. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bamberg said the Goldman Sachs team never raised any concerns about the deal at the board of directors meeting. He said he would have rejected the sale if they had. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Anything significant I would have said I&#8217;m not signing until we get more information about this,&#8221; Bamberg said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The case is Baker v. Goldman Sachs  Co., 09-cv-10053, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts (Boston). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Alexis Leondis" date="Jan 14, 2013 11:44 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-14/blackrock-hires-goldman-s-wang-to-lead-china-business.html"><headline>BlackRock Hires Ex-Goldman Executive for China Unit</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock Inc. (BLK), the world&#8217;s largest

to expand in Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang, who had been an advisory director at Goldman Sachs

chairman of BlackRock China, responsible for developing and
executing the firm&#8217;s business strategy there, Bobbie Collins, a
spokeswoman for the New York-based firm, said today in an e-
mail. Wang will report to Mark McCombe, chairman of BlackRock&#8217;s
Asia-Pacific operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laurence D. Fink, chairman and chief executive officer of
BlackRock, said during a conference call with analysts and
investors in 2011 that the firm is interested in expanding in
Asia and investor deposits there are &#8220;slower than we would
like.&#8221; Fink hired McCombe in 2011 and last year hired Philipp
Hildebrand, the former head of the Swiss central bank, to help
expand relationships with institutional clients overseas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang left Goldman in 2011, Edward Naylor, a spokesman for

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, is among companies weighing a purchase of the
injectable-medicines unit of Indian drug supplier Strides
Arcolab Ltd. (STR), said three people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer began due diligence last week for a possible
acquisition of the Bangalore-based company&#8217;s division known as
Agila Specialties, the people said, asking not to be identified
as the process is private. The unit may be valued at about $2
billion, two of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strides provides Pfizer with generic versions of off-patent
drugs through a partnership announced in 2010. Agila has also
drawn interest from Canonsburg, Pennsylvania-based Mylan Inc.,
Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG (NOVN), and Fresenius SE, which is based in
Bad Homburg, Germany, two of the people said. A deal could be
reached in the first quarter, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large drugmakers are seeking acquisitions to offset a
potential decline in revenue as U.S. patents expire. With drugs
losing patent protection this year and last, New York-based
Pfizer may lose as much as $2.75 billion in sales in 2013, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strides rose as much as 3.9 percent to 1095 rupees in
Mumbai today, the most since Dec. 24. Representatives for
Pfizer, Mylan and Novartis declined to comment, while a
spokesman for Strides didn&#8217;t respond to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cancer, Antibiotics &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As a market leader, Fresenius is very often brought into
contact with companies that potentially may be for sale,&#8221;
Fresenius spokesman Matthias Link said in an e-mail. He declined
to comment on any potential deal with Strides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strides started trying to sell Agila last year, three
people with knowledge of the matter said in August. Agila, which
makes cancer treatments and antibiotics, accounted for 74
percent of Strides&#8217;s earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization in the nine months through
September, a company release from October shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agila&#8217;s sales jumped to 10 billion rupees ($183 million) in
the nine-month period, from 7.4 billion rupees a year earlier,
according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 2009, Novartis paid about 4.7 times sales for
Unterach, Austria-based Ebewe Pharma&#8217;s injectable-drug unit in a
$1.2 billion purchase. Mylan acquired closely held injectable-
drug business Bioniche Pharma Holdings Ltd. for $550 million in
2010, paying about 4.2 times annual revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same year, Abbott Laboratories (ABT) announced the
acquisition of Mumbai-based Piramal Healthcare Ltd.&#8217;s branded
generic-medicine unit for $3.72 billion, paying about 8.7 times
sales. The deal was worth more than Piramal&#8217;s $2.5 billion
market value at the time, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strides&#8217;s profit will more than quadruple to 9.2 billion
rupees this year, according to the average of nine analysts&#8217;
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company has 14
manufacturing facilities in six countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strides sold Ascent Pharmahealth Ltd., its Australian and
Southeast Asian unit, to Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI) in January
2012 for A$375 million ($396 million) in cash. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An investigation of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) was opened by the U.K.&#8217;s finance regulator as to whether traders in London broke any rules related to wrong-way bets on credit derivatives that lost their unit $6.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Financial Services Authority said yesterday in an e- mailed statement that it&#8217;s probing the losses suffered by JPMorgan in the chief investment office, or CIO, at the firm&#8217;s London offices. Other agencies already investigating the matter include the U.S. Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bruno Iksil, the U.K. trader nicknamed the London Whale because he was responsible for a trading book large enough to move the market, made a wrong-way bet on credit derivatives that led to the company&#8217;s biggest trading loss. At one point, as much as $51 billion in shareholder value was erased by the trades. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The FSA is continuing to conduct a formal enforcement investigation into the trading losses,&#8221; the regulator said in the statement. &#8220;Conclusions will be reached in the enforcement investigation in due course and any further appropriate action determined at that time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;New York-based JPMorgan was ordered by U.S. regulators to strengthen risk and auditing controls. The firm also promised to bolster systems to prevent money laundering. After reviewing the unit that suffered the losses, the Federal Reserve faulted JPMorgan&#8217;s management and modeling of risks, as well as its auditing functions and the process for communicating problems to the board of directors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Central Bank &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The central bank and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency both issued cease-and-desist orders focusing on the CIO as well as broader anti-money-laundering controls. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the FSA, a move to a formal enforcement proceeding typically indicates the agency found sufficient evidence of financial rule violations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s board is considering releasing this week an internal report that faults Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon&#8217;s oversight of the division, two people familiar with the matter have said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The final report, which builds on a preliminary analysis released in July, is critical of senior managers including Dimon, 56, former Chief Financial Officer Doug Braunstein, 51, and ex-Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew, 56, for inadequately supervising traders in a U.K. unit that amassed an illiquid position in credit derivatives last year, the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lender&#8217;s analysis in July said that London traders may have intentionally mismarked some of their positions and sought to hide the full amount of their losses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan didn&#8217;t admit or deny wrongdoing in consenting to regulatory orders issued yesterday, and no fines were imposed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Dawn Kopecki, Jesse Hamilton and Lindsay Fortado" date="Jan 14, 2013  7:46 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-14/jpmorgan-s-whale-trade-subject-of-occ-order-to-fix-risk-controls.html"><headline>JPMorgan Ordered to Fix Controls, Pay Practices After Whale Bet</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) was ordered by U.S. regulators to strengthen risk controls and enhance executive compensation practices after losing more than $6.2 billion on a wrong-way derivatives bet last year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve found deficiencies in JPMorgan&#8217;s risk controls, loss modeling and audit functions as well as the process for alerting the board of directors to problems. The central bank and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency both issued cease-and-desist orders yesterday requiring JPMorgan to tighten its trading oversight, particularly in the chief investment office, and separate orders to bolster systems preventing clients from laundering money. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The orders show there are &#8220;significant control weaknesses beyond the CIO&#8217;s office that raises questions about whether JPMorgan is that much better than its peers at risk management,&#8221; said Josh Rosner, an analyst at New York-based Graham Fisher  Co. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They are the first regulatory sanctions against JPMorgan in response to the botched trades, which Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56, said in May stemmed from &#8220;egregious&#8221; lapses. Bruno Iksil, the U.K. trader nicknamed the London Whale because his positions were big enough to move markets, made the wrong- way bet on credit derivatives that fueled the losses. As much as $51 billion in shareholder value had been erased at one point. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The sanctions are relatively light, allowing JPMorgan to avoid fines, Rosner said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;U.K. Probe &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other U.S. agencies investigating the trading loss include the Securities and Exchange Commission and Federal Bureau of Investigation. The U.K.&#8217;s Financial Services Authority said yesterday that it&#8217;s undertaking a formal enforcement probe, which typically indicates the agency found sufficient evidence of financial rule violations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Conclusions will be reached in the enforcement investigation in due course and any further appropriate action determined at that time,&#8221; the FSA said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Fed gave JPMorgan&#8217;s board 60 days to submit a plan to enhance oversight of risk-management, internal-audit and finance functions. The panel also must overhaul its system for compensating top executives, accounting for &#8220;adverse risk outcomes and control deficiencies,&#8221; according to a Fed order. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Internal Report &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s board is considering releasing an internal report that faults Dimon&#8217;s oversight of the CIO when the company announces fourth-quarter results tomorrow, two people with direct knowledge of the matter have said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That report, which builds on a preliminary analysis released in July, is critical of senior managers including Dimon, former Chief Financial Officer Doug Braunstein, 52, and ex-Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew, 56, for inadequately supervising traders in the U.K., according to the people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The report will be presented to the board when it meets today. The directors will then vote on whether to disclose it, the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan didn&#8217;t admit or deny wrongdoing in consenting to the regulatory orders issued yesterday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve been working hard to fully remediate the issues identified in the consent order&#8221; on the trading losses, Joe Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An OCC order found that the bank also &#8220;has an inadequate system of internal controls and independent testing&#8221; for anti- money-laundering compliance. The company &#8220;failed to identify significant volumes of suspicious activity&#8221; and to file required reports alerting regulators, according to the order. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meeting those &#8220;responsibilities -- and going above and beyond -- is a top priority for us,&#8221; Evangelisti said. &#8220;We have already made progress addressing the issues cited in the consent orders, which contain no allegations of intentional misconduct by the firm or any of its employees.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By John Quigley" date="Jan 14, 2013  6:16 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-14/peru-targets-record-coca-eradication-this-year-minister-says.html"><headline>Peru Targets Record Coca Eradication This Year, Minister Says</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Peru will destroy a record 22,000
hectares (54,363 acres) of coca bushes this year to stem rising
production of the raw material used to make cocaine, the
government said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Ollanta Humala&#8217;s government will increase
eradication 57 percent from the 14,000 hectares of coca bushes
removed last year, Interior Minister Wilfredo Pedraza said in a
statement posted on the ministry&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humala is boosting counter-narcotic spending to halt a boom
in the coca crop that the United Nations says now rivals
Colombia&#8217;s as the world&#8217;s largest. For the first time the drive
to curtail cultivation will be extended to the valley of the
Apurimac, Ene and Mantaro Rivers, an area of jungle in the south
of the country where holdout members of the Shining Path, a
Maoist insurgency group, are active, Pedraza said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government seeks to &#8220;break all records&#8221; in the drugs
fight, including seizures of cocaine and chemicals used to
process the drug, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area under cultivation in Peru increased for a sixth
straight year to 62,500 hectares in 2011, from 61,200 hectares
in 2010, according to Sept. 26 report by the United Nations
Office on Drugs and Crime. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fire yesterday at Chevron Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s
El Segundo refinery, California&#8217;s largest, damaged equipment
associated with the plant&#8217;s fluid catalytic cracker, a person
with knowledge of the refinery&#8217;s operations said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blaze, which ignited at around 6 p.m. local time,
damaged the selective catalytic reduction plant, a unit that
removes particulates from gas produced by the catalytic cracker,
said the person, who asked not to be identified because the
information isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The El Segundo refinery, south of Los Angeles, can process
279,000 barrels of feedstock a day, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. It supplies 40 percent of the jet fuel to Los Angeles
International Airport and 20 percent of the region&#8217;s gasoline,
San Ramon, California-based Chevron said on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &#8220;incident&#8221; in one of the refinery&#8217;s process units
caused a power failure at the plant yesterday, resulting in the
slowdown of several units, Rod Spackman, a Chevron spokesman at
the refinery, said by e-mail. The upset occurred while the plant
was preparing the unit for planned maintenance, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from maintenance and the unit involved, the refinery
is running normally, Spackman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There was no significant fire at the refinery, and there
was nothing that would impact the process unit,&#8221; Spackman said
in a later telephone interview. He declined to comment on
whether yesterday&#8217;s incident damaged equipment at the plant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scheduled Maintenance &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery&#8217;s fluid catalytic cracker was scheduled to
shut for a 54-day maintenance turnaround that included work on
the alkylation unit, a person with direct knowledge of the plans
said Dec. 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alkylation units produce a high-octane blending component
for gasoline. Fluid catalytic crackers process vacuum gasoil
into gasoline or lighter crude products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The El Segundo Fire Department responded to an incident at
the refinery at about 5:56 p.m. local time yesterday, Richard
Guyer, a battalion chief for the department, said by telephone
today. The plant extinguished &#8220;a small ground fire&#8221; and was
flaring gases after pressure built up in a unit and a cap
dislodged, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incident ended at about 8:06 p.m. local time, he said.
Guyer said it wasn&#8217;t clear whether the fire was extinguished at
that time or whether the plant stopped flaring gases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The flare and the fire were all the same, really,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;The fire was contributing to the flare activity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The El Segundo refinery reported a &#8220;failure&#8221; at the fluid
catalytic cracker yesterday at 6 p.m. local time and planned to
flare gases until Jan. 23, notices to state and air regulators
show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) filled a fund started by billionaire Leonard Blavatnik with risky mortgage securities instead of the conservative investments it was told to make, lawyers for Blavatnik told a New York state judge today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blavatnik, 55, sued New York-based JPMorgan in New York state Supreme Court in June 2009, accusing the biggest U.S. bank by assets of putting more money into mortgage securities than his investment guidelines allowed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CMMF fund was started by Blavatnik&#8217;s Access Industries in 2006 as a &#8220;short-term, highly liquid and very conservative cash management account,&#8221; according to court filings. JPMorgan &#8220;stuffed&#8221; the account with risky mortgage securities, turning it into something it was never meant to be, said Richard I. Werder Jr., an attorney with Quinn Emanuel Urquhart  Sullivan LLP, which is representing the fund. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This was not supposed to be a high-risk, swing-for-the- fences investment,&#8221; Werder told state Supreme Court Justice Melvin Schweitzer at the start of a non-jury trial over Blavatnik&#8217;s lawsuit that began in Manhattan today. &#8220;This was supposed to be the opposite: conservative and safe.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan should be held responsible for the loss, Blavatnik, who is ranked 47th in Bloomberg&#8217;s billionaires index with a net worth of $15.3 billion, said in his lawsuit, because it loaded his Access Industries fund with subprime and Alt-A mortgages while Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon was unloading such securities from the bank&#8217;s books. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Sucker&#8217;s Bet&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This was a sucker&#8217;s bet,&#8221; Werder said in a pretrial brief. &#8220;If it paid off, CMMF would merely recoup its principal. By making this massive bet -- which was completely unnecessary to achieve the account&#8217;s conservative objectives -- JPM breached the parties&#8217; agreement, acted negligently and caused enormous and avoidable losses of approximately $100 million.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The securities being challenged by CMMF had &#8220;extraordinary protection&#8221; against &#8220;all but the most catastrophic losses,&#8221; hadn&#8217;t defaulted while the bank managed the account and were AAA-rated when purchased, Lewis R. Clayton of Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton  Garrison LLP, which is representing JPMorgan, told Schweitzer during opening arguments today. The securities had no downgrades until March 2008, Clayton said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Were Safe&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market believed these securities were safe,&#8221; Clayton said. &#8220;Their own investment advisers believed these investments were safe.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has argued that CMMF rejected the &#8220;most conservative strategy&#8221; it was offered in favor of one that sought a higher return than a money-market fund, with higher risk and less liquidity, Clayton said in a pretrial memorandum. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The account performed well until the fall of 2007, when events in the mortgage markets and the economy &#8220;began to have a negative impact,&#8221; Clayton wrote in the memorandum. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Investment Management believed that prices for the asset-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations in the account were depressed because of &#8220;short-term liquidity problems, not because of a realistic risk of loss of principal,&#8221; and thought CMMF should hold the investments for the long term and not take losses at &#8220;artificially depressed prices,&#8221; according to Clayton&#8217;s memo. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;View &#8216;Shared&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This view was shared by CMMF&#8217;s independent adviser, Nancy Zimmerman, a sophisticated financial professional who manages a multibillion-dollar hedge fund,&#8221; Clayton said in the pretrial memo. &#8220;CMMF also repeatedly made clear that it did not want to realize losses and objected vociferously when JPMIM sold one investment at a loss of approximately 5 percent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The account generated a net gain of almost $4 million until CMMF closed it in May 2008 and gave the securities to Zimmerman to manage, Clayton said in the memo. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The trial is set to last as long as two weeks. Blavatnik isn&#8217;t scheduled to testify, according to a list of witnesses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The case is CMMF LLC v. J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc., 601924-09, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Dina Bass" date="Jan 14, 2013 12:59 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-14/microsoft-surface-estimate-cut-in-half-to-1-million-units-at-ubs.html"><headline>Microsoft Surface Estimate Cut in Half to 1 Million Units at UBS</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s fiscal second-
quarter earnings will be less than previously expected due to
weak demand for personal-computers and the company&#8217;s new tablet,
Surface, according to Brent Thill, an analyst at UBS AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thill cut his estimate for Surface sales in half, to 1
million units for the period, which ended in December, citing
&#8220;gloomy sentiment&#8221; after the holiday shopping season, he wrote
in a research report today. He cut his earnings per share
projection for the quarter by 8 cents to 76 cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft initially limited sales of the device to its own
roughly 60 retail outlets and Surface also failed to draw many
customers away from Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPad and rival devices with
Google Inc.&#8217;s Android software. A new business-focused version
of Microsoft&#8217;s tablet, Surface Pro, is expected to go on sale
this month and may fare better against the iPad, Thill said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Surface Pro is the more promising&#8221; model, he wrote in
the report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) accused ACA
Financial Guaranty Corp. (MANF) of withholding thousands of audio
recordings the investment bank wants in its fight against a
lawsuit over a collateralized debt obligation called Abacus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs asked a New York state judge in court papers
Jan. 11 to order bond insurer ACA to produce the recordings,
pointing to one phone call that it says &#8220;utterly eviscerates&#8221;
ACA&#8217;s claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;ACA&#8217;s unjustified withholding of the additional
recordings impedes Goldman Sachs&#8217; ability to challenge, and the
court&#8217;s ability to examine,&#8221; the claims in the case, the New
York-based company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s bid for the recordings comes after ACA
sought court permission to file a revised complaint that adds
hedge fund Paulson  Co. as a defendant. ACA claims Goldman
Sachs and Paulson conspired to induce it to provide financial
guaranty insurance for Abacus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACA claims it was deceived into believing that Paulson was
a long investor in the deal when the hedge fund was in fact
betting against it. Goldman Sachs agreed to a $550 million
settlement in 2010 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission to resolve claims that it misled investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Doomsday&#8217; Strategy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its filing, Goldman Sachs quotes from a May 2007 call
between an ACA portfolio manager and a bond trader at Morgan
Stanley in which ACA is told Paulson was pursuing a &#8220;doomsday&#8221;
strategy and betting against the mortgage market. The recording
&#8220;demonstrates unequivocally&#8221; that ACA actually knew of
Paulson&#8217;s shorting strategy, Goldman Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc Kasowitz, an attorney for New York-based ACA, said in
an interview that the call wasn&#8217;t about Abacus and was instead
&#8220;anecdotal market chatter&#8221; about Paulson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACA, which is seeking to recover $120 million in damages,
cites in its complaint a recording in which a Goldman Sachs
managing director told ACA that Paulson was a &#8220;100 percent
equity&#8221; investor in the deal. ACA has produced 6,900 recordings
to Goldman Sachs and will turn over more as they become
available, Kasowitz said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s specific misrepresentation to ACA about
Paulson&#8217;s &#8216;100 percent equity&#8217; interest in Abacus trumps any
anecdotal market &#8216;color&#8217; by a third party,&#8221; Kasowitz said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is ACA Financial Guaranty Corp. v. Goldman Sachs 
Co., 650027-2011, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is set to face
new actions from U.S. and U.K. bank regulators as early as today
for botched trades that cost the company more than $6.2 billion
last year, according to two people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and
Federal Reserve, which have been investigating the loss, may
release some of their findings today, three people familiar with
the matter said. The U.K.&#8217;s Financial Services Authority, which
has also been informally looking into whether traders
intentionally mismarked some of their positions and tried to
cover up their losses, may open an official investigation,
according to one of the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators have yet to punish New York-based JPMorgan, the
biggest U.S. bank, for lapses in risk oversight that Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56, has called &#8220;egregious.&#8221; It
isn&#8217;t clear whether the Fed and OCC&#8217;s announcement will also
include sanctions, according to the people, who asked not to be
named because the matter hasn&#8217;t been made public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OCC is preparing a cease-and-desist order requiring New
York-based JPMorgan to fix internal controls that contributed to
its wrong-way bet on credit derivatives, a person familiar with
the matter said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chief investment office within JPMorgan&#8217;s national bank
suffered from &#8220;inadequate risk management,&#8221; Comptroller of the
Currency Thomas Curry said during U.S. Senate testimony in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Potential Gaps&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have been focusing on potential gaps or deviations
from accepted standards of risk management within that
particular office and looking to see whether similar gaps exist
in any other area,&#8221; Curry said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move to a formal enforcement proceeding by the FSA
typically indicates the agency found sufficient evidence of
financial rule violations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman at JPMorgan, Robert Garsson at
the OCC, Barbara Hagenbaugh at the Federal Reserve and
Christopher Hamilton at the FSA all declined to comment on the
regulatory actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s board of directors is also considering releasing
an internal report that faults Dimon&#8217;s oversight of the division
when the company announces fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 16,
two people with direct knowledge of the matter have said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Braunstein, Drew &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final report, which builds on a preliminary analysis
released in July, is critical of senior managers including
Dimon, former Chief Financial Officer Doug Braunstein, 51,
and ex-Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew, 56, for inadequately
supervising traders in the U.K. unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report will be presented to the board when it meets
tomorrow. The directors will then vote on whether to disclose it
when the bank announces fourth-quarter results the following
day, said the people, who asked not to be named because the
report isn&#8217;t yet public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bruno Iksil, the U.K. trader nicknamed the London Whale
because his trading book was big enough to move the market, made
a wrong-way bet on credit derivatives that led to the company&#8217;s
biggest trading loss. At one point, as much as $51 billion in
shareholder value was erased. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court signaled
interest in Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s bid for a shield from some asbestos
lawsuits connected to its Quigley Co. subsidiary, a bankrupt
unit that stopped most operations in 1992. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices today asked the Obama administration for
advice on Pfizer&#8217;s appeal of a ruling that opened the New York-
based drugmaker to some claims related to Quigley. That company
made asbestos-containing products for the steel industry from
the 1940s to the 1970s. Pfizer acquired Quigley in 1968.
Asbestos, once widely used an insulator, was later shown to
cause cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, contends that
Quigley&#8217;s bankruptcy proceedings insulate the parent company
from suits filed by the Baltimore law firm of Peter Angelos. The
firm began suing Pfizer in Pennsylvania state courts in 1999,
saying the company was legally responsible for some claims
because its logo appeared on Quigley products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer says it played no role in making or selling the
Quigley products. A federal appeals court in New York said the
claims against Pfizer could go forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court case is Pfizer v. Law Offices of Peter
Angelos, 12-300. The bankruptcy case is In re Quigley Co.,
04-15739, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sugar fell in New York as Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) cut the sweetener&#8217;s price forecast for the next
three, six and 12 months on ample global supply. Cocoa rose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raw sugar traded on ICE Futures U.S. in New York will be at
18.50 cents a pound in three and six months, down from a
previous estimate of 22 cents, Damien Courvalin, an analyst at
the bank in the city, said in a report dated yesterday. Sugar,
which slid 16 percent last year, will be at 19 cents a pound in
12 months, according to the bank&#8217;s forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Going forward, we expect the global sugar market to

said Courvalin. &#8220;We expect a further build in global
inventories.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raw sugar for March delivery retreated 0.6 percent to 19.06
cents a pound by 6:04 a.m. in New York. The price gained as much
as 1.2 percent in the previous trading session on Jan. 11.
White, or refined, sugar for March delivery slid 0.4 percent to
$512.90 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sugarcane in Brazil&#8217;s center south, the main growing region
of the world&#8217;s biggest producer, will keep expanding as farmers
continue to plant and because of &#8220;favorable&#8221; weather,
according to Goldman Sachs. The crop will climb to as much as
590 million metric tons in 2013-14 from 535.7 million tons in
2012-13, Datagro Ltd. forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This larger harvest will most likely allow for both an
increase in sugar and ethanol production,&#8221; Courvalin said. Both
ethanol and sugar are made from sugar cane in Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cocoa for March delivery gained 0.2 percent to $2,260 a ton
on ICE. Cocoa for March delivery was up 0.4 percent to 1,444
pounds ($2,326) a ton on NYSE Liffe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cocoa Consumption &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global cocoa consumption will exceed output by about
100,000 tons in the season that started in October after two
years of oversupply, according to Goldman Sachs. Output was
90,000 tons higher than demand in the 2011-12 season after a
record surplus of 341,000 tons a year earlier, according to the
International Cocoa Organization in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arabica coffee for March delivery rose 0.7 percent to
$1.5435 a pound in New York. Robusta for March delivery advanced
0.9 percent to $1,962 a ton in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see limited further downside to prices and expect
coffee prices to remain rangebound near-term before recovering
modestly in 2013,&#8221; Courvalin said, commenting on arabica beans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM) and Citgo Petroleum
Corp. are the last holdouts in an $800 million lawsuit by New
Hampshire alleging that oil companies knew a chemical added to
gasoline would contaminate residents&#8217; groundwater. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opening statements are set to begin today in Concord in a
trial that pits the state&#8217;s environmental claims against the
companies&#8217; efforts to comply with federal pollution standards.
It&#8217;s one of scores of cases involving the additive methyl
tertiary butyl ether that have been filed since 2000 against oil
refiners, fuel distributors and chemical makers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire says ExxonMobil and Citgo knew MTBE would
pollute water supplies. The companies say the federal Clean Air
Act overrides the state&#8217;s claims and by adding MTBE to gasoline,
they were complying with a U.S. mandate to supply fuel that
would burn more cleanly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The oil companies will say: Federal law made us do that
and that pre-empts any state lawsuit,&#8221; Keith Hylton, who
teaches law and economics at Boston University School of Law,
said in an interview before the trial began. &#8220;If the federal
regulatory body looked at all the issues that the state would
examine in a lawsuit, then there is pre-emption.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil refiners have added MTBE to gasoline since the 1970s to
replace lead. From 1995 to 2006, they increased the use of MTBE,
which boosts the oxygen level of the fuel and makes it burn more
efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Foul, Putrid&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to filings in the New Hampshire case, MTBE can
render drinking water &#8220;foul, putrid and unfit for human
consumption.&#8221; The state said it petitioned the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency in 2001 to get out of its
reformulated gasoline program because of awareness of MTBE&#8217;s
harmful effects. The additive has been banned in the state since
January 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2003, New Hampshire sued ExxonMobil and Citgo along with
Shell Oil Co., Sunoco Inc., ConocoPhillips (COP), Irving Oil Ltd.,
Vitol SA and Hess Corp. All have settled except Irving, Texas-
based ExxonMobil and Citgo, the Houston-based unit of
Venezuela&#8217;s state-owned oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA.
Shell and Sunoco agreed to pay New Hampshire $35 million in a
settlement announced in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state has said it has identified 229 sites that will
require cleanup from contamination by MTBE, which, according to
court filings, can cause cancer in animals. It said tests in
2005 and 2006 showed MTBE in 9.1 percent of private wells
throughout the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire is seeking $816 million to cover cleanup and
monitoring costs, Jessica Grant, a lawyer for the state, said at
a pretrial hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Second-Guessing&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state is &#8220;second-guessing decisions made by Congress,
the EPA and by the state&#8217;s own officials to rely on gasoline
with MTBE as the solution to air pollution,&#8221; Claire Hassett, a
spokeswoman for ExxonMobil, said in an e-mail. &#8220;Gasoline with
MTBE was a product that worked as it was intended -- it provided
significant health benefits by helping gasoline burn cleaner,
thereby reducing smog.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citgo said in an e-mailed statement that although it
doesn&#8217;t comment on pending litigation, its &#8220;strong safety and
environmental record speaks for itself.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state has said the oil companies could have used safer
additives, such as ethanol, and chose not to because MTBE is
inexpensive to produce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If they had an alternative product to use and the
alternative is just as good and avoids serious risk to
consumers, there&#8217;s a strong argument the defendants have failed
the risk-utility standard and can be held liable,&#8221; said Hylton,
the Boston University professor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Short Supply &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil companies have said ethanol wasn&#8217;t in large enough
supply at the time an additive was sought and that it presents
its own environmental hazards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This case is not about health risks or personal
injuries,&#8221; Hassett said. &#8220;There is not a single recorded case
of anyone getting sick from drinking water with MTBE. The
majority of the state&#8217;s damage claims are based on computer
models and projections not on actual testing or data.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil companies also said in court filings that a statute
of limitations should prevent the litigation from proceeding.
The state waited three years from the time it detected MTBE in
sites until it sued, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire Superior Court Judge Peter Fauver in August
rejected a series of motions by the oil companies seeking
judgment without a trial based on the arguments they raised.
Those issues can be brought up again for the jury&#8217;s
consideration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Water Sources &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2011, the New Hampshire Supreme Court denied a
motion by the companies to decide the case in their favor and
sent it back to the Superior Court. The state&#8217;s highest court
said New Hampshire could seek damages for contamination of
nonpublic sources of water, such as wells, as well as public
sources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Hampshire case was moved to federal court in New
York, where other lawsuits have been consolidated for pretrial
evidence-gathering and motions before U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin, who presided over the trial of New York City&#8217;s case
against ExxonMobil. In 2009, the jury in that case ordered
ExxonMobil to pay $104.7 million after finding it liable for
polluting wells in the city. ExxonMobil has appealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York sent New
Hampshire&#8217;s case back to the state court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases consolidated in New York may be tried separately
in courts around the U.S. if settlements aren&#8217;t reached. In the
New York litigation, the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection filed its fourth amended complaint in June. No date
has been set for a trial, which would probably take place in
federal court in New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Great Distances &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MTBE is produced by combining methanol, which is derived
from natural gas, and isobutylene, a byproduct of gasoline
refining. It can leak into the ground from gas stations, storage
tanks and automobile junkyards. It dissolves in water and
doesn&#8217;t biodegrade or stick well to soil particles, so it can be
carried with the water great distances from the site of a leak
or spill, according to court papers. The chemical is difficult
and expensive to find, treat and remove, according to court
filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the 1980s, the defendants knew that the addition of
MTBE would lead to widespread contamination,&#8221; Grant said in an
interview after a pretrial hearing Jan. 9. &#8220;Despite knowing
that MTBE posed a greater threat to drinking water resources,
they never posted a single warning.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spills Fault &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil&#8217;s Hassett said the fault lies with whoever
spilled the chemically treated fuel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;MTBE contamination has been found in New Hampshire
because someone spilled gasoline in New Hampshire, not because
it was added to gasoline in a refinery in another state,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;The state should be suing parties responsible for
spilling gasoline.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil rose 0.6 percent to $89.61 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading on Jan. 11. Citgo&#8217;s shares don&#8217;t
trade publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is State of New Hampshire v. Hess Corp. (HES), 03-
C-0550, State of New Hampshire Superior Court (Merrimack
County). The federal cases are consolidated as In re MTBE
Products Liability Litigation, 00-11898, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects software sales decline in 10th paragraph of
story published on Jan. 15.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS), working to improve
results at its interactive division, unveiled a video-game
system that reduces development costs by incorporating
characters from multiple movies in the same game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Infinity platform includes a base unit that connects to
computers and game consoles, Burbank, California-based Disney
said today in a statement. Plastic figures set on top of the
unit appear on screen in games. The company will sell the
figures, as well as discs that add scenery and features. A
starter kit with the base and three figures is priced at $75. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Infinity, Disney will be able to add content without
developing new games from scratch each time a film comes out,
according to John Pleasants, co-president of Disney interactive.
That&#8217;s critical for a division Disney Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Robert Iger has said will be profitable in
2013 after losses of $1.6 billion in the past six years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s something we expect to be able to live on for years,
and we can continuously add to it,&#8221; Pleasants said in an
interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s not just a game that we&#8217;re shipping.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pleasants, who joined Disney with the acquisition of
social-game maker Playdom in 2010, urged his designers to
&#8220;think big&#8221; in developing the system, according to John Blackburn, vice president of Disney&#8217;s Avalanche Software unit in
Salt Lake City, Utah, which oversaw the project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Player Freedom &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infinity is Disney&#8217;s largest game project in terms of the
cost and characters involved, Blackburn said, without giving
specifics on the finances. The initial release will involve 20
Disney and Pixar characters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adventures within Infinity leave a lot to the player, the
executives said. Captain Jack Sparrow, from the &#8220;Pirates of the
Caribbean&#8221; films, could go on missions with Buzz Lightyear, one
of the &#8220;Toy Story&#8221; characters, while riding in Cinderella&#8217;s
coach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s like your parent&#8217;s living room floor, where nobody
told you what to do with your toys,&#8221; John Vignocchi, an
executive producer of the game, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By combining collectible figures with video-game play, the
Infinity platform, which goes on sale in June, is similar to
Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI)&#8217;s &#8220;Skylanders&#8221; games, which generated
$500 million in sales of games and related merchandise last
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pirates Games &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney is changing direction as sales of traditional video
games have fallen. Video-game software sales declined 23 percent
to $6.71 billion in 2012, NPD said. Disney released six titles
for consoles last year, down from 23 in 2010, according to the
company and VGChartz.com, a research site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its products have sometimes disappointed consumers. A group
called Revive Potco gathered 2,000 signatures asking Disney to
invest more in its Pirates of the Caribbean game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brad Phillips, who follows the business on a blog called In
the Life of Nerd, was critical of that game and another called
&#8220;World of Cars,&#8221; tied to the popular Pixar films. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was a terrible waste of the Cars brand and one that
was likely designed and rushed out in an attempt to profit from
the movies,&#8221; Phillips wrote last February, the same month
Disney shut it down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Lasseter, chief creative officer for Disney animation
studios, also thought some movie-themed games lacked substance,
according to Blackburn. He was reluctant to include Pixar
content in Infinity until the game makers showed him designs
where the disparate characters shared a common look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Game Challenges &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney gained 1 percent to $51.09 at the close in New York.
The shares advanced 33 percent in 2012, compared with 13 percent
for the SP 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry Gerbrandt, a long-time media analyst now with Media
Valuation Partners in Los Angeles, said he is skeptical the
interactive unit can ever produce the consistent earnings of
Disney&#8217;s cable TV and theme-park businesses. He pointed to
challenges facing Zynga Inc. (ZNGA), the social game leader, which has
fallen 74 percent since it first sold shares in December 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a very streaky business,&#8221; Gerbrandt said. &#8220;All you
have to do is look at Zynga to see how hard it is to create hits
and come up with sequels. If they could be happy with the Disney
website, they&#8217;d be fine. It&#8217;s when they move beyond that they
run into problems.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pleasants, co-president of the unit, disagrees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Profitability is a goal for this division for sure, for
this year, for the future, for beyond,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We are very,
very focused on that. We are growing nicely.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO) has taken to television to fight back against an obesity epidemic the world&#8217;s largest soft-drink maker has been blamed for fueling. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company will air ads throughout the year, including one tomorrow on Fox Broadcasting Co.&#8217;s &#8220;American Idol,&#8221; to bring attention to the importance of exercise and calories in curbing obesity. The first two-minute spot aired yesterday on cable TV, highlighting Coca-Cola&#8217;s low- and zero-calorie products, the Atlanta-based company said yesterday in a statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The commercials are the most overt move yet in a more than three year campaign by Coca-Cola to counter criticism that it contributes to America&#8217;s obesity epidemic. Almost 36 percent of adults and about 17 percent of children are obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is part of Coke&#8217;s effort to blunt the opposition they are running into in all different sectors,&#8221; said Michael Jacobson, executive director of Washington-based Center for Science in the Public Interest, whose 1998 report &#8220;Liquid Candy&#8221; propelled criticism of sugary drinks. &#8220;The opposition is not sitting still these days.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of Coca-Cola&#8217;s new ads, called &#8220;Coming Together,&#8221; suggests consumers pay attention to the calories they consume in order to manage their weight. The commercial points out the company &#8220;can play an important role&#8221; in fighting obesity. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Smaller Packages &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A female narrator goes on to say the company offers more than 180 low- and no-calorie beverages among its more than 650 drinks. This helped reduce calories per serving across the U.S. beverage industry by 22 percent during the past 15 years, according to the ad. Coca-Cola will offer smaller packages in about 90 percent of the U.S. market by the end of the year, it said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The commercial to debut tomorrow on &#8220;American Idol&#8221; states that a can of Coca-Cola contains 140 calories and encourages consumers to find fun ways of burning those calories. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola will air 30- and 60-second versions of the ads throughout the year in national broadcast and Spanish language media, according to Diana Garza Ciarlante, a company spokeswoman. She would not disclose spending on the effort. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health advocates agree soft drinks are an unhealthy source of sugar in Americans&#8217; diets. Obesity in the U.S. comes at a &#8220;staggering&#8221; financial cost, the CDC has said. Everything from treatments for diabetes to lost work by obese employees cost Americans about $147 billion in 2008, according to one estimate cited by the agency. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Obesity Cost &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obesity is measured by using weight and height to calculate a number called body mass index, according to the CDC. An adult who is 5 feet, 9 inches tall and weighs 203 pounds or more is considered obese. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2009, President Barack Obama recommended exploring a federal tax on sugary drinks to help pay for health-care reform. Lawmakers in 30 states then proposed levying their own soda taxes on the $74 billion U.S. soft drink industry. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obama&#8217;s suggestion prompted Coca-Cola Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent to call the idea of a federal tax on soft drinks &#8220;outrageous.&#8221; Kent has argued that programs encouraging exercise and health education in schools and communities are more effective at curbing obesity. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have never seen it work where a government tells people what to eat and what to drink,&#8221; Kent said in September 2009, responding to an audience question at the Rotary Club of Atlanta. &#8220;If it worked, the Soviet Union would still be around.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;New York &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The comments marked a shift in Coca-Cola&#8217;s approach to soft drink critics. Until that point, the company let its chief lobbying association, the American Beverage Association, handle most of the push back. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Between 2009 and 2011, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) and the American Beverage Association spent as much as $70 million on lobbying and issue ads, according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a proponent of soda taxes. The money helped defeat efforts to enact such levies in 30 states. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last year, the beverage industry squared off against New York City, whose health department plastered placards all over New York&#8217;s subways comparing sugary drinks with globs of fat and packets of sugar. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ABA countered with its own subway ads touting lower- calorie options and package sizes as progress against obesity. They were part of a nationwide public relations campaign started in February, and an offshoot of similar ABA programs in recent years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In September, New York City&#8217;s Board of Health voted to restrict sales of sugary soft drinks to no more than 16 ounces a cup in restaurants, movie theaters, stadiums and arenas after it was proposed by Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The mayor is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Coke shares rose 0.9 percent to $37.32 at the close in New York. The stock advanced 3.6 percent in 2012, its fourth consecutive year of gains. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Drew Armstrong" date="Jan 15, 2013  4:10 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-15/pfizer-drug-units-shuffle-triggers-concers-about-breakup.html"><headline>Pfizer&#8217;s Possible Unit Shuffle Triggers Breakup Concern</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s four business units may be combined into two, a top company official said, triggering speculation by analysts that the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker is preparing to split in half. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s units cover oncology, primary care, specialty drugs, and so-called established products, which are medicines that have lost patent protection and are sold against generics. That&#8217;s &#8220;probably going to evolve to two, where there&#8217;s the innovative business and the value business,&#8221; Geno Germano, president of the specialty care and oncology businesses, said in a Jan. 8 interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Ian Read took over New York-based Pfizer in 2010, as the company was digesting the 2009 acquisition of Wyeth and preparing for the loss of its top- selling product Lipitor. Under Read, Pfizer has cut research and operations and is divesting non-drug businesses, such as animal health and infant nutrition. Those actions have created questions about whether a bigger breakup is on the horizon. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The possible reorganization outlined by Germano may be another step toward a split by Pfizer two to three years down the line, said Mark Schoenebaum, an ISI Group Inc. analyst. Such a move would be similar to the action by Abbott Laboratories (ABT), which spun off its brand-drug business Jan. 1 as the new company AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM) told a jury that a
gasoline additive to reduce air pollution never caused illness
to any resident of New Hampshire, which sued oil companies
claiming the chemical polluted its groundwater. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil and Citgo Petroleum Corp. made opening
statements today in a jury trial of an $816 million lawsuit in
which the state alleges the oil companies knew the chemical
would contaminate groundwater. The state court trial, which
began yesterday in Concord, pits the environmental claims
against assertions by companies that they were simply complying
with federal pollution standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s one of scores of cases involving the additive methyl
tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE, filed since 2000 against oil
refiners, fuel distributors and chemical makers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is not a personal-injury case,&#8221; David Lender, a
lawyer for ExxonMobil, told the jury. &#8220;There&#8217;s not any evidence
that anyone ever got sick or got cancer from MTBE.&#8221; He said
there has been no gasoline sold in the state containing MTBE for
more than six years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state claimed that the oil companies knew that if they
added MTBE to gasoline it would increase the risk and costs
associated with contamination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Exxon decided to disregard the recommendation of its own
employees and put MTBE in gasoline,&#8221; Jessica Grant, a lawyer
for the state, told jurors yesterday. &#8220;In 1984, Exxon
anticipated that if it added MTBE to its gasoline, the number of
contamination incidents would triple. These incidents would take
longer to clean up and cost five times as much.&#8221; Each cleanup
at that time would have cost as much as $7 million, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Federal Law &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies said the federal Clean Air Act overrides the
state claims, and that by adding MTBE to gasoline, they were
complying with a U.S. mandate to supply cleaner-burning fuel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil refiners began adding MTBE to gasoline in the 1970s to
replace lead. From 1995 to 2006, they increased the use of MTBE,
which boosts the fuel&#8217;s oxygen level, making it burn more
cleanly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We had no choice but to put oxygenates in our gasoline,&#8221;
Nate Eimer, a lawyer for Citgo, said today in his opening
statement. &#8220;Nothing worked better in cleaning the air than
MTBE.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keith Hylton, who teaches law and economics at Boston
University School of Law, said the oil companies are counting on
pre-emption, which turns on whether federal regulators &#8220;looked
at all the issues that the state would examine in a lawsuit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The oil companies will say, &#8216;Federal law made us do that,
and that pre-empts any state lawsuit,&#8217;&#8221; Hylton said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exxon Lawyer &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Quinn, a lawyer for ExxonMobil, told the jury
yesterday that there were &#8220;great benefits to using MTBE but
there were downsides. All of these downsides were known to all
the folks involved.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MTBE is produced by combining methanol, which is derived
from natural gas, and isobutylene, a byproduct of gasoline
refining. It can leak into the ground from gas stations, storage
tanks and auto junkyards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It dissolves in water and doesn&#8217;t biodegrade, so it can be
carried with the water great distances from the site of a leak
or spill, according to court papers. The chemical is difficult
and expensive to find, treat and remove, according to filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to New Hampshire case filings, MTBE can render
drinking water &#8220;foul, putrid and unfit for human consumption.&#8221;
The state said it petitioned the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency in 2001 to get out of its reformulated-gasoline program
because of awareness of MTBE&#8217;s harmful effects. The additive has
been banned in the state since January 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Warning &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Despite knowing that MTBE posed a greater threat to
drinking water, they never posted a single warning,&#8221; Grant
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire sued ExxonMobil and Citgo in 2003 along with
Shell Oil Co., Sunoco Inc., ConocoPhillips (COP), Irving Oil Ltd.,
Vitol SA and Hess Corp. All settled but Irving, Texas-based
ExxonMobil and Citgo, the Houston-based unit of Venezuela&#8217;s
state-owned oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA. Shell and
Sunoco agreed to pay $35 million in an accord announced in
November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire said it has identified 228 sites that will
require cleanup from contamination by MTBE, which according to
court filings can cause cancer in animals. Tests in 2005 and
2006 found MTBE in 9.1 percent of private wells throughout the
state, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire is seeking $816 million to cover cleanup and
monitoring costs, Grant said, and it will ask for damages from
ExxonMobil and Citgo based on their market shares of gasoline
sold in the state during the time the suit covers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Market Share &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil&#8217;s market share was about 30 percent, she said.
That means the state will seek $245 million in damages from the
company. Citgo&#8217;s market share ranged from 3 percent to
8.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lender said today that ExxonMobil&#8217;s market share in New
Hampshire was only 6.1 percent during that time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The majority of the state&#8217;s damage claims are based on
computer models and projections, not on actual testing or
data,&#8221; Claire Hassett, an ExxonMobil spokeswoman, said by e-
mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state said the oil companies could have used safer
additives, such as ethanol, and chose not to because MTBE is
inexpensive to produce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If they had an alternative product to use and the
alternative is just as good and avoids serious risk to
consumers, there&#8217;s a strong argument the defendants have failed
the risk-utility standard and can be held liable,&#8221; said Hylton,
of Boston University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Short Supply &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil companies said ethanol wasn&#8217;t in large enough
supply when an additive was being sought, and that it presents
its own environmental hazards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil&#8217;s Hassett said the fault lies with whoever
spilled the chemically treated fuel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;MTBE contamination has been found in New Hampshire
because someone spilled gasoline in New Hampshire, not because
it was added to gasoline in a refinery in another state,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;The state should be suing parties responsible for
spilling gasoline.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil companies also said in court filings that a statute
of limitations should prevent the litigation from proceeding.
The state waited three years from the time it detected MTBE in
sites until it sued, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Superior Court Judge Peter Fauver in August rejected oil
company motions seeking judgment without a trial based on the
arguments they raised. Those issues can be brought up again for
the jury&#8217;s consideration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Water Sources &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2011, the New Hampshire Supreme Court denied a
motion by the companies to decide the case in their favor and
sent it back to the Superior Court. The state&#8217;s highest court
said New Hampshire could seek damages for contamination of
nonpublic sources of water, such as wells, and public sources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Hampshire case had been moved to federal court in
New York, where other lawsuits have been consolidated for
pretrial evidence-gathering and motions before U.S. District
Judge Shira Scheindlin in Manhattan. In 2007, the U.S. Court of
Appeals in New York sent New Hampshire&#8217;s case back to the state
court there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scheindlin presided over the trial of New York City&#8217;s case
against ExxonMobil. In 2009, the jury in that case ordered
ExxonMobil to pay $104.7 million after finding it liable for
polluting wells in the city. ExxonMobil has appealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Consolidated Cases &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases consolidated in New York may be tried separately
in courts around the U.S. if settlements aren&#8217;t reached. In the
New York litigation, the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection filed its fourth amended complaint in June. No date
has been set for a trial, which would probably take place in
federal court in New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Hampshire trial may take more than four months,
lawyers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the jury was dismissed yesterday, Citgo&#8217;s Eimer asked
the judge to declare a mistrial, claiming that the state&#8217;s
lawyer misrepresented a document as one of Citgo&#8217;s in her
remarks to the jury. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a long road ahead of us,&#8221; Fauver told the
lawyers. &#8220;This will all be clarified. I don&#8217;t think it warrants
a mistrial.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is State of New Hampshire v. Hess Corp. (HES), 03-C-
0550, New Hampshire Superior Court, Merrimack County (Concord).
The federal cases are consolidated as In re MTBE Products
Liability Litigation, 00-11898, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. will participate in global
talks to lower barriers on trade of financial services and
telecommunications, a step toward a deal sought by companies
including JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and ATT Inc. (T) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negotiations will include 20 trading partners, including
the European Union, at the World Trade Organization in Geneva,
U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk said today in a letter to
congressional leaders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Every $1 billion in U.S. services exports supports an
estimated 4,200 U.S. jobs in America,&#8221; Kirk wrote to House
Speaker John Boehner and Senate President Pro Tempore Patrick Leahy. The negotiations will begin within 90 days, Kirk said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Services such as express package delivery, insurance,
telecommunications and electronic payments are becoming a
growing part of global trade, estimated by the WTO at about $8
trillion in 2011. U.S. exports of private services were worth
about $600 billion in 2011, according to Kirk&#8217;s office. The U.S.
had a $178.5 billion surplus in services trade that year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nations working toward an agreement represent about 70
percent of the world&#8217;s trade in services, according to the
Coalition of Service Industries, a Washington-based group whose
members include JPMorgan, ATT, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), FedEx Corp. (FDX) and
Aflac Inc. (AFL) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Economic Engine &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased that the United States is ready to fight
for new trade rules to enable the services sector to achieve its
potential as the engine of our economy,&#8221; Peter Allgeier, a
former U.S. ambassador to the WTO and president of the services
group, said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industry groups including the Washington-based U.S. Chamber
of Commerce and the Business Roundtable, whose members include
the heads of companies including Bank of America Corp., Visa
Inc. (V) and Verizon Communications Inc., cheered the announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a chance to tackle emerging trade barriers in
areas such as the digital economy while strengthening the global
rules-based trading system,&#8221; Myron Brilliant, the Chamber&#8217;s
senior vice president for international affairs, said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representative Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican and head of
the Ways and Means Committee that oversees trade legislation,
said the services agreement is a &#8220;critical trade policy&#8221; that
will help create U.S. jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WTO Members &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I am impressed with the group of 21 WTO members thus far
that plan to join the negotiations, representing dymanic
devleoping and developed markets for U.S. exports,&#8221; Camp said
in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nations in the talks are Australia, Canada, Chile, Taiwan,
Colombia, Costa Rica, Hong Kong, Iceland, Israel, Japan, Korea,
Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, Switzerland
and Turkey. The EU represents 27 nations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil, China and India have declined to join, saying the
efforts may impede broader global trade talks that have been
stalled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussions probably will cover the cross-border movement
of financial data, information and communications services,
maritime, environmental and energy services and government
procurement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Christine Harper" date="Jan 15, 2013  1:33 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-15/goldman-said-to-refrain-from-delaying-u-k-bonus-distributions.html"><headline>Goldman Is Said to Refrain From Delaying U.K. Bonus Payouts</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) won&#8217;t delay
distribution of U.K. bonuses to help minimize employees&#8217; tax
rates, a person with direct knowledge of the decision said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm had considered postponing incentive compensation
due to employees from 2009, 2010 and 2011 until after top
income-tax rates drop in April. Bank of England Governor Mervyn King said today it&#8217;s &#8220;depressing&#8221; that banks may be willing to
shift bonus payments to minimize workers&#8217; tax burden. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. Treasury minister Sajid Javid spoke with Goldman Sachs
representatives today, according to a person with knowledge of
the discussion. They gave assurances that bonuses would be paid
in the normal way and that there would be no changes to the
schedule. The call was set up yesterday, said the person, who
requested anonymity because the discussion was private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs accelerated delivery of $65 million in stock
awards last month to 10 executives, including Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, in a move that helped them avoid
higher U.S. taxes that take effect this year. That change, which
didn&#8217;t affect compensation for 2012, was made public in company
filings at about 8 p.m. New York time on Dec. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, the Financial Times and other media reported
that New York-based Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank
by assets, was reviewing whether to delay U.K. bonus payments
due from prior years to help employees pay lower rates. The
reports were met with criticism from U.K. politicians and King. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Management opted against proceeding with the plan, a
decision that was ratified today in a regular meeting of the
board&#8217;s compensation committee, said the person with knowledge
of the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;British Broadcasting Corp. editor Robert Peston reported
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s decision earlier today on Twitter.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Halia Pavliva" date="Jan 15, 2013  8:32 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-15/goldman-sparks-ctc-jump-as-shows-to-lift-sales-russia-overnight.html"><headline>Goldman Sparks CTC Jump as Shows to Lift Sales</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;CTC Media Inc. (CTCM) is rebounding from
the cheapest level versus peers since 2009 as Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. recommends buying the Russian television company on
prospects a focus on younger viewers will stoke revenue growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of CTC traded in the Nasdaq Composite Index (CCMP) jumped
7.3 percent yesterday to $8.70 in New York, the biggest advance
since Aug. 7. The Moscow-based company traded for 9.3 times
estimated earnings, the highest valuation since Dec. 13. CTC&#8217;s
rally, the steepest on the Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index
yesterday, narrowed its discount to companies on the MSCI
Emerging Markets Media Index (MXEF0MD) to 61 percent, from as wide as 67
percent Dec. 28, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CTC&#8217;s revenue will climb 10 percent next year and about 11
percent in 2014 and 2015 as it wins more viewers with original
programming and as the company cuts costs, Goldman analysts led
by Alexander Balakhnin, wrote in a report dated Jan. 11. CTC,
which tumbled 11 percent last year as it took on a new chief
executive officer, is debuting new shows including &#8216;Angel and
Demon&#8217; and &#8216;The Eighties&#8217; as it seeks out viewers aged 10 to 45. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The stock is undervalued, it&#8217;s a clear buy for those who
want exposure to Russia&#8217;s growth story,&#8221; Konstantin Chernyshev,
the Moscow-based head of research at UralSib Financial Corp.,
which has had a buy rating on CTC since May 2011, said by phone
yesterday. &#8220;CTC Media has a lot of potential for growth as the
company has a good management team, has stabilized its share of
viewers and is winning new ones.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Increased Volume &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN) rose 1.1 percent to
101.38 yesterday and RTS stock futures expiring in March held at
159,090 in the New York day. Trading volume in CTC Media&#8217;s stock
was almost four times the average daily volume for the past
three months, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX), the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, rose 1.3 percent to $30.14
yesterday. The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected
swings in the stock futures, decreased 0.3 percent to 20.58. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under CEO Boris Podolsky, who moved from the chief
financial officer position on June 14, CTC will post an 11
percent jump in 2013 revenue, after an predicted 2.8 percent
increase in 2012, according to the mean of 12 analysts&#8217;
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company&#8217;s 2013 revenue will
rise to $872.7 million, according to forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian television advertising will probably rise between
10 percent and 15 percent in 2013 from 2012, fueled by an
expanding economy, UralSib&#8217;s Chernyshev said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ad Spending &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia&#8217;s gross domestic product will climb 3.4 percent in
2013, according to the median of 25 economists&#8217;s estimates in a
Bloomberg survey last month. Economic growth probably
accelerated 3.5 percent in 2012, the government forecast last
year, slowing from 4.3 percent expansion in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total spending on Russian TV ads is expected to increase to
$5.9 billion in 2014, the biggest market in Europe, from $4.4
billion in 2011, CTC Media says on its website, citing estimates
by industry think-tanks, including Zenith Optimedia and Video
International. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CTC, which operates television channels in Russia,
Kazakhstan, Moldova and broadcasts its programs in countries
including Germany, the U.S., Thailand and Israel, is switching
its focus to a younger audience beginning this year as it seeks
to attract more advertisers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broadcaster will direct its content to viewers aged 10
to 45 years-old, compared with the previous target of six to 54-
year-olds, CEO Podolsky told analysts on a conference call Aug.
7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Local Shows &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proceeds from advertising accounted for more than 97
percent of company revenue in 2011, the highest level since
2005, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CTC TV, the company&#8217;s main television channel, has changed
its strategy and is winning more viewership by broadcasting
domestically made shows, rather than Hollywood-made
blockbusters, Goldman&#8217;s Balakhnin wrote, adding that the new
strategy also helps to cut costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest non-government television broadcaster in
Russia, CTC said its audience of viewers aged six to 54 for all
of its television channels increased to 14.8 percent in the
third quarter, from 14.7 percent a year ago, and was the third-
biggest after NTV Television and TNT TV. The company cited TNS
Global as a source for the data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CTC TV&#8217;s weekly audience of viewers aged 18 years and older
rose to 6.9 percent in the week to Jan. 6, from 5.3 percent in
the week to Dec. 30, TNS Global data showed Jan. 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;VimpelCom Gains &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The launch of the spring season, with new episodes of
existing titles and scheduled premieres, should support audience
share dynamics and unwind inventory erosion concerns,&#8221;
Goldman&#8217;s Balakhnin wrote. &#8220;The quality of programming has
improved and the company is able to retain audience share
through more cost-efficient means.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP), Russia&#8217;s third-biggest mobile phone company
by subscribers, rallied 1.5 percent to $10.75 yesterday in New
York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markus Bjerke, an analyst at Arctic Securities ASA in Oslo,
raised its recommendation on the shares to buy from hold and
lifted the price estimate on the shares to $13 from $10.60. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude for February delivery gained 0.6 percent to $94.14 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday, the
highest level since Sept. 18. It slid 0.5 percent to $93.68 by
8:25 a.m. today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent oil for February settlement increased 1.1 percent to
$111.88 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange
yesterday, before dropping 0.3 percent today to $111.58. Urals
crude, Russia&#8217;s chief export blend, rose 1.1 percent to $109.96,
and was down 0.1 percent today to $109.83 a barrel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruble added 0.2 percent to 30.2540 per dollar
yesterday, the highest level since May 11. It was little changed
at 30.275 today. Ruble futures showed the currency strengthening
0.2 percent to 30.520 per dollar in New York yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;United Co. Rusal (486), the world&#8217;s largest aluminum producer,
dropped 0.8 percent to HK$5.01 in Hong Kong today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the bid is accepted, the company would need to invest at

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of
America Corp. and Nomura (8604) Holdings Inc. are predicting Japanese
stocks will extend their longest streak of gains in 23 years as
extra economic stimulus boost earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Topix Index, Japan&#8217;s broadest gauge of share
performance, rose for nine straight weeks through Jan. 11, the
longest stretch since December 1989 (TPX), when it hit a record
2,886.5. Goldman Sachs boosted its estimate to 1,000 on Jan. 7
from 930, while Bank of America increased its 12-month estimate
to 1,250 from 1,050, according to a Jan. 11 note from Tokyo-
based chief equity strategist Naoki Kamiyama. That&#8217;s a gain of
39 percent from the last close of 898.69. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced 10.3 trillion yen ($116
billion) in additional stimulus measures on Jan. 11 and is
pressuring the Bank of Japan to double its inflation target to 2
percent after the third recession in five years. Goldman Sachs
is buying shares of exporters, financial firms and utilities,
Hiroyuki Ito, Tokyo-based head of equity investment at Goldman
Sachs Asset Management Co., said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Abe is not just talk, but is about action,&#8221; Jesper Koll,
head of equity research at JPMorgan Chase  Co. in Tokyo, said
Jan. 11. &#8220;In his first 30 days, it&#8217;s really quite impressive in
that you have a concrete supplementary spending.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koll has a 12-month target of 1,050 for the Topix. Analysts
surveyed in December said the Topix would rise to 905 by year-
end, according to the median of 14 estimates. Predictions have
been revised up after Abe&#8217;s Liberal Democratic Party was
returned to power at Dec. 16 elections. The Topix increased 0.8
percent to 906.22 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Earnings Boost &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All 33 industries on the Topix advanced since Nov. 14.
Securities companies led, as Nomura, the country&#8217;s biggest
brokerage, jumped 72 percent and Daiwa Securities Group Inc. (8601)
surged 49 percent as the market rallied. Gauges of shipping
companies and iron and steel manufacturers recorded the second-
and third-biggest increases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A weaker yen and Abe&#8217;s stimulus policies will boost
earnings, according to a Jan. 7 note from Goldman Sachs analysts
led by chief Japan strategist Kathy Matsui. The yen fell below
89 to the U.S. dollar last week and is trading at its lowest
level since June 2010. The currency has declined 11 percent
since the election was announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nikkei 225 Stock Average will advance 9.7 percent to
11,860 by year end, Jefferies Group Inc. analysts led by Sean
Darby, chief global equity strategist said Jan. 10, citing
improving trade ties with China as a catalyst for earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Earnings are forecast to rise more than 20 percent in
fiscal 2013 and Japanese stocks remain relatively cheap,&#8221; said
Masahiro Fukuda, investment director at Fidelity Worldwide
Investment in Tokyo. &#8220;Even before talk on Abe-nomics began,
Japanese stocks could&#8217;ve rebounded to this level without
counting the impact of a rapid drop in the yen on earnings.
Valuation justifies further gains when you take a weaker yen
into account.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1983 Levels &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Income per share on the Topix Index will climb 56 percent
in the next year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
That compares with a 13 percent increase for the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 Index and 27 percent for the Shanghai Composite
Index, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Topix trades for 1.06 times book value, up from 0.82
times the value of net assets in June, the lowest ever,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg going back to 1993. The
gauge closed at 695.51 on June 4, a level not seen since 1983. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nakayama Steel Works Ltd. (5408), which gets all its revenue from
Japan, almost doubled in value during the nine-week rally,
surging 97 percent and leading gains by makers of the material
on speculation Abe will pursue greater public-works spending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Export Prospects &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nippon Yusen K.K. (9101), Japan&#8217;s biggest shipping line by market
value, added 42 percent as the yen&#8217;s decline and signs of
recovery in the economies of China and the U.S. boosted the
propects for exports. Progress in halting the spread of Europe&#8217;s
debt crisis also improved the outlook for the company, which
receives 39 percent of revenue from routes to the continent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;rom Holdings Co. (2372), a supplier of equipment and management
services to medical institutions, gained the most among the
Topix&#8217;s 1,687 members, surging 224 percent from Nov. 14. Kubotek
Corp., a maker of inspection systems for display manufacturers
including South Korea&#8217;s Samsung Electronics Co., recorded the
second-biggest advance, jumping 178 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&#8217;t the first time analysts have called for a rally
in Japanese shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A surge from November 2010 through the start of 2011 was
cut short by the March 11 earthquake. Forecasts for a recovery
in share prices on the back of reconstruction spending were
dashed as the government of former Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda
proved unable to restart the economy. The yen rose as Europe&#8217;s
sovereign-debt crisis and an uneven recovery in the U.S
conspired sent investors in search of safer assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Growth Challenge &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Expectations for policy action will lead the market, but
I&#8217;m not sure how much impact it will actually have on
earnings,&#8221; said said Shintaro Shinohara, who helps oversee
about 11 trillion yen ($124 billion) as the head of equity
investment at Prudential Investment Management Japan Co. &#8220;It&#8217;s
not going to be a one-way rally. Globally, Europe&#8217;s growth will
be about 1 percent, the U.S. faces uncertainty and China&#8217;s not
going to expand as fast as previously.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan faces domestic problems as well. More than 25 percent
of people are older than 65 and the country&#8217;s government debt
has balooned to 185 percent of gross domestic product. The
country&#8217;s shares trade about 70 percent below their 1989 level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the stimulus package announced Jan. 11, about 3.8
trillion yen will be for disaster prevention and reconstruction,
with 3.1 trillion yen directed to stimulating private investment
and other measures, according to a statement released by the
Cabinet Office. Extra spending will increase gross domestic
product by about 2 percentage points and create about 600,000
jobs, the government said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Game Changer &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s currency slid below 120 per euro yesterday for the
first time since May 2011 after Abe said he wanted someone &#8220;who
can push through bold monetary policy&#8221; as the next Bank of
Japan (8301) governor. The BOJ meets next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This year may become a game-changing year for Japanese
stocks,&#8221; said Takashi Ito, an equity strategist at Nomura in
Tokyo. &#8220;The new government are aiming to support corporate
growth and let Japanese companies lead the Japanese economy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hochtief AG (HOT), the German builder
controlled by Spain&#8217;s Actividades de Construccion y Servicios
SA, jumped to the highest level since March after Goldman Sachs
Group added the company to its &#8220;conviction buy&#8221; list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares climbed as much as 4.4 percent to 47.49 euros in
Frankfurt trading, and traded 4.3 percent higher as of 11:04
a.m. That extends the gains this month to 7.9 percent and values
the company at 3.6 billion euros ($4.8 billion). The 148,235
shares traded after two hours represent 93 percent of the three-
month average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hochtief, whose historic projects include Frankfurt&#8217;s
Commerzbank Tower, once Europe&#8217;s tallest building, is benefiting
from an industry upturn that has resulted in a 12 percent gain
in the Stoxx 600 Construction and Materials Index over the past
year. Marcelino Fernandez Verdes, the former head of ACS&#8217;s
construction business who became Hochtief&#8217;s chief executive in
November, is scheduled to present a plan to increase
profitability and reduce participation in high-risk projects on
Feb. 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Hochtief has rallied since the new CEO was announced in
November, but with the rest of the sector up, we believe
Hochtief can go further,&#8221; Goldman said in a research note
today. &#8220;While execution will likely take time, we believe
clearer goals could increase investor interest.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profitability at the Essen-based company may be boosted by
anticipated process improvements in the coming years, Goldman
said. The investment bank previously rated Hochtief stock at
neutral. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM) told a jury that a
gasoline additive to reduce air pollution never caused illness
to any resident of New Hampshire, which sued oil companies
claiming the chemical polluted its groundwater. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil and Citgo Petroleum Corp. made opening
statements today in a jury trial of an $816 million lawsuit in
which the state alleges the oil companies knew the chemical
would contaminate groundwater. The state court trial, which
began yesterday in Concord, pits the environmental claims
against assertions by companies that they were simply complying
with federal pollution standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s one of scores of cases involving the additive methyl
tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE, filed since 2000 against oil
refiners, fuel distributors and chemical makers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is not a personal-injury case,&#8221; David Lender, a
lawyer for ExxonMobil, told the jury. &#8220;There&#8217;s not any evidence
that anyone ever got sick or got cancer from MTBE.&#8221; He said
there has been no gasoline sold in the state containing MTBE for
more than six years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state claimed that the oil companies knew that if they
added MTBE to gasoline it would increase the risk and costs
associated with contamination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Exxon decided to disregard the recommendation of its own
employees and put MTBE in gasoline,&#8221; Jessica Grant, a lawyer
for the state, told jurors yesterday. &#8220;In 1984, Exxon
anticipated that if it added MTBE to its gasoline, the number of
contamination incidents would triple. These incidents would take
longer to clean up and cost five times as much.&#8221; Each cleanup
at that time would have cost as much as $7 million, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Federal Law &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies said the federal Clean Air Act overrides the
state claims, and that by adding MTBE to gasoline, they were
complying with a U.S. mandate to supply cleaner-burning fuel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil refiners began adding MTBE to gasoline in the 1970s to
replace lead. From 1995 to 2006, they increased the use of MTBE,
which boosts the fuel&#8217;s oxygen level, making it burn more
cleanly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We had no choice but to put oxygenates in our gasoline,&#8221;
Nate Eimer, a lawyer for Citgo, said today in his opening
statement. &#8220;Nothing worked better in cleaning the air than
MTBE.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keith Hylton, who teaches law and economics at Boston
University School of Law, said the oil companies are counting on
pre-emption, which turns on whether federal regulators &#8220;looked
at all the issues that the state would examine in a lawsuit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The oil companies will say, &#8216;Federal law made us do that,
and that pre-empts any state lawsuit,&#8217;&#8221; Hylton said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exxon Lawyer &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Quinn, a lawyer for ExxonMobil, told the jury
yesterday that there were &#8220;great benefits to using MTBE but
there were downsides. All of these downsides were known to all
the folks involved.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MTBE is produced by combining methanol, which is derived
from natural gas, and isobutylene, a byproduct of gasoline
refining. It can leak into the ground from gas stations, storage
tanks and auto junkyards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It dissolves in water and doesn&#8217;t biodegrade, so it can be
carried with the water great distances from the site of a leak
or spill, according to court papers. The chemical is difficult
and expensive to find, treat and remove, according to filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to New Hampshire case filings, MTBE can render
drinking water &#8220;foul, putrid and unfit for human consumption.&#8221;
The state said it petitioned the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency in 2001 to get out of its reformulated-gasoline program
because of awareness of MTBE&#8217;s harmful effects. The additive has
been banned in the state since January 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Warning &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Despite knowing that MTBE posed a greater threat to
drinking water, they never posted a single warning,&#8221; Grant
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire sued ExxonMobil and Citgo in 2003 along with
Shell Oil Co., Sunoco Inc., ConocoPhillips (COP), Irving Oil Ltd.,
Vitol SA and Hess Corp. All settled but Irving, Texas-based
ExxonMobil and Citgo, the Houston-based unit of Venezuela&#8217;s
state-owned oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA. Shell and
Sunoco agreed to pay $35 million in an accord announced in
November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire said it has identified 228 sites that will
require cleanup from contamination by MTBE, which according to
court filings can cause cancer in animals. Tests in 2005 and
2006 found MTBE in 9.1 percent of private wells throughout the
state, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire is seeking $816 million to cover cleanup and
monitoring costs, Grant said, and it will ask for damages from
ExxonMobil and Citgo based on their market shares of gasoline
sold in the state during the time the suit covers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Market Share &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil&#8217;s market share was about 30 percent, she said.
That means the state will seek $245 million in damages from the
company. Citgo&#8217;s market share ranged from 3 percent to
8.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lender said today that ExxonMobil&#8217;s market share in New
Hampshire was only 6.1 percent during that time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The majority of the state&#8217;s damage claims are based on
computer models and projections, not on actual testing or
data,&#8221; Claire Hassett, an ExxonMobil spokeswoman, said by e-
mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state said the oil companies could have used safer
additives, such as ethanol, and chose not to because MTBE is
inexpensive to produce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If they had an alternative product to use and the
alternative is just as good and avoids serious risk to
consumers, there&#8217;s a strong argument the defendants have failed
the risk-utility standard and can be held liable,&#8221; said Hylton,
of Boston University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Short Supply &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil companies said ethanol wasn&#8217;t in large enough
supply when an additive was being sought, and that it presents
its own environmental hazards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil&#8217;s Hassett said the fault lies with whoever
spilled the chemically treated fuel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;MTBE contamination has been found in New Hampshire
because someone spilled gasoline in New Hampshire, not because
it was added to gasoline in a refinery in another state,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;The state should be suing parties responsible for
spilling gasoline.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil companies also said in court filings that a statute
of limitations should prevent the litigation from proceeding.
The state waited three years from the time it detected MTBE in
sites until it sued, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Superior Court Judge Peter Fauver in August rejected oil
company motions seeking judgment without a trial based on the
arguments they raised. Those issues can be brought up again for
the jury&#8217;s consideration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Water Sources &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2011, the New Hampshire Supreme Court denied a
motion by the companies to decide the case in their favor and
sent it back to the Superior Court. The state&#8217;s highest court
said New Hampshire could seek damages for contamination of
nonpublic sources of water, such as wells, and public sources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Hampshire case had been moved to federal court in
New York, where other lawsuits have been consolidated for
pretrial evidence-gathering and motions before U.S. District
Judge Shira Scheindlin in Manhattan. In 2007, the U.S. Court of
Appeals in New York sent New Hampshire&#8217;s case back to the state
court there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scheindlin presided over the trial of New York City&#8217;s case
against ExxonMobil. In 2009, the jury in that case ordered
ExxonMobil to pay $104.7 million after finding it liable for
polluting wells in the city. ExxonMobil has appealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Consolidated Cases &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases consolidated in New York may be tried separately
in courts around the U.S. if settlements aren&#8217;t reached. In the
New York litigation, the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection filed its fourth amended complaint in June. No date
has been set for a trial, which would probably take place in
federal court in New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Hampshire trial may take more than four months,
lawyers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the jury was dismissed yesterday, Citgo&#8217;s Eimer asked
the judge to declare a mistrial, claiming that the state&#8217;s
lawyer misrepresented a document as one of Citgo&#8217;s in her
remarks to the jury. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a long road ahead of us,&#8221; Fauver told the
lawyers. &#8220;This will all be clarified. I don&#8217;t think it warrants
a mistrial.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is State of New Hampshire v. Hess Corp. (HES), 03-C-
0550, New Hampshire Superior Court, Merrimack County (Concord).
The federal cases are consolidated as In re MTBE Products
Liability Litigation, 00-11898, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects story first published Jan. 16 to say Alibaba hasn&#8217;t hired banks for an IPO.) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd., China&#8217;s biggest e-commerce company, denied hiring Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to arrange an initial public offering in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have not hired any banks in connection with any IPOs,&#8221; John Spelich, a Hong Kong-based spokesman for Alibaba, said yesterday by telephone. Officials at Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investment banks are vying for a role on a possible Alibaba IPO, said three people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private. An offering could happen this year, and potentially raise $3 billion to $4 billion, according to an estimate from one of the people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A deal of that size could potentially be the largest Internet IPO since Facebook Inc., and would follow Alibaba&#8217;s re-purchase of a stake from Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) last year in a deal that valued the Hangzhou-based company at $35 billion. Alibaba this week announced billionaire founder Jack Ma&#8217;s decision to step down as chief executive officer following an organizational restructuring. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Dawn Kopecki and Hugh Son" date="Jan 16, 2013 10:08 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-16/jpmorgan-halves-dimon-pay-says-ceo-responsible-for-lapses-1-.html"><headline>JPMorgan Whale Report Spreads Blame as Dimon&#8217;s Pay Halved</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), detailing lapses behind its biggest-ever trading loss, said employees were overwhelmed by the complexity of their bets, risk managers were ill-equipped and leaders including Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon weren&#8217;t aggressive enough in responding. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a 129-page report issued yesterday, the bank described an &#8220;error prone&#8221; risk-modeling system that required employees to cut and paste electronic data to a spreadsheet. Workers inadvertently used the sum of two numbers instead of the average in calculating volatility. The firm also reiterated an assertion that London traders initially tried to hide losses that ballooned beyond $6.2 billion in last year&#8217;s first nine months. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The investigation, overseen by Dimon confidante Mike Cavanagh, is part of an effort to overhaul the bank and rebuild investor trust after the trading debacle helped cut shareholder value by as much as $51 billion last year. The report doesn&#8217;t explain why the chief investment office, a unit responsible for managing cash and mitigating risk, departed from more conservative strategies, eventually amassing a portfolio of complex credit derivatives. Dimon&#8217;s pay for last year was cut in half following the losses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The people who conduct these internal investigations walk a fine line,&#8221; said David Felt, a lawyer with Arnall Golden Gregory in Washington. &#8220;Their job is to find out what happened and prevent it from reoccurring, but not to provide evidence to prosecutors and other litigators.&#8221; Felt, who specializes in corporate inquiries, helped oversee the regulatory investigations into accounting fraud at Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac for the Federal Housing Finance Agency. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;London Whale &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan first disclosed losses on the trades in May, almost a month after Dimon dismissed initial news reports on the bets as a &#8220;tempest in a teapot.&#8221; Transactions were handled by London-based trader Bruno Iksil, nicknamed the London Whale because his positions were so big. Dimon, 56, said yesterday the bank is almost done with losses in the CIO and won&#8217;t disclose the size of future declines. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The board of directors cut the CEO&#8217;s compensation for 2012 to $11.5 million. The decision was announced as the firm reported a 53 percent jump in fourth-quarter profit to $5.69 billion, driven by earnings on mortgages. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Dimon bears ultimate responsibility for the failures that led to the losses in CIO and has accepted responsibility,&#8221; the bank said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cavanagh, who has worked with or for Dimon since 1993, led the management task force that produced the report. Dimon promoted him from chief financial officer to run the treasury and security services division in June 2010, and again last July to co-head the corporate and investment bank. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;More Independent&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would have much rather seen a more-independent report,&#8221; said Paul Miller, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets in Arlington, Virginia. &#8220;Let&#8217;s say that Cavanagh is a straight-up, straight-shooting guy who&#8217;s going to do this effectively. Nobody is going to believe it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for the bank, said Cavanagh answered to the independent committee of the board, which also conducted its own review. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The loss at JPMorgan, considered one of the industry&#8217;s best-managed firms after remaining profitable during the credit crisis, has prompted lawsuits and probes in the U.S. and abroad. This week, it led to the first regulatory sanctions, as banking watchdogs found internal-control &#8220;deficiencies.&#8221; It also has pushed lawmakers to tighten trading curbs included in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Too Trusting &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CIO unit used credit derivatives as part of a hedging strategy, and the trades became so large the bank couldn&#8217;t easily unwind them. The report blamed managers, many of whom were reassigned or left last year, for roles in failing to halt the loss. The executives include former Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew, Barry Zubrow, ex-head of companywide risk management, and former Chief Financial Officer Doug Braunstein. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Read the full JPMorgan Chase  Co. report&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon was faulted for trusting information given him by senior managers, according to the task force. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;He could have better tested his reliance on what he was told,&#8221; the firm found. &#8220;More should have been done regarding the risks, risk controls and personnel associated with CIO&#8217;s activities, and Mr. Dimon bears some responsibility.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon, who is also chairman of the board, wasn&#8217;t included in deliberations on his compensation, he told reporters on a conference call. The bank said its decisions took into account his replacement of senior managers, efforts to claw back their pay and the formation of a team to examine what went wrong. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Embarrassing Mistake&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Once Mr. Dimon became aware of the seriousness of the issues presented by CIO, he responded forcefully by directing a thorough review and an extensive program of remediation,&#8221; the company said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The board had to look at the positives, which I think are large, and the negatives,&#8221; Dimon said. &#8220;This is one huge embarrassing mistake and I respect their decision.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Executives failed to ensure that the CIO&#8217;s risk controls kept pace with the increased complexity of the unit&#8217;s activities, the task force said. The leaders didn&#8217;t verify that the unit was well managed or had the same level of risk controls as elsewhere at the firm, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Significant risk-management weaknesses developed within CIO that allowed the traders to pursue their flawed and risky trading strategies,&#8221; the bank said. &#8220;Senior firm management&#8217;s view of CIO had not evolved to reflect the increasingly complex and risky strategies CIO was pursuing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Traders Ousted &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon ousted three London traders involved in the loss, shuffled senior managers and accepted resignations from executives including Drew. Matt Zames, the former co-head of fixed-income trading, was promoted twice last year and, after helping overhaul the CIO, is now co-chief operating officer with Frank Bisignano. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Drew retired four days after the loss was disclosed May 10. Iksil, his supervisor Javier Martin-Artajo and the former CIO head in Europe, Achilles Macris, also left. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zubrow, who had overseen JPMorgan&#8217;s risk-management function while Iksil expanded his book, retired at the end of last year. Braunstein, 52, stepped down to become a vice chairman in the investment bank. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the years before the trading losses, Dimon had pushed the CIO to generate more profit by boosting the size and risk of its bets to include higher-yielding assets, Bloomberg News reported in April, citing former executives. The shift had made the unit an increasingly important customer to Wall Street&#8217;s trading desks, with bets that could move markets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Probe&#8217;s Focus &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The task force wrote in a footnote to its report that while it had reviewed &#8220;certain background information&#8221; on how the CIO expanded into credit derivatives, its focus &#8220;was on the events at the end of 2011 and the first several months of 2012 when the losses occurred.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The report also highlighted blunders tied to measuring risk. Dimon had previously said switching models understated the chance of losses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CIO exceeded its so-called value-at-risk limit &#8220;at several points&#8221; during a period in January 2012, driven by the synthetic credit portfolio, JPMorgan said in the report. The office recommended a temporary increase in the risk limit, as the new model was expected to show a &#8220;substantially&#8221; reduced measure of the amount in danger of being lost. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Jan. 23, a trader e-mailed the person who developed the new model to say he should &#8220;keep the pressure on our friends in model validation and [quantitative research],&#8221; the bank said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Flaws Overlooked &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is some evidence the Model Review Group accelerated its review as a result of this pressure, and in so doing it may have been more willing to overlook the operational flaws apparent during the approval process,&#8221; according to the bank. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The risk model was developed by a London-based quantitative expert who had not previously created or implemented such a model and wasn&#8217;t given the support he requested, JPMorgan said. The firm&#8217;s review of the model wasn&#8217;t &#8220;as rigorous as it should have been,&#8221; JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also found the spreadsheet used the sum of two numbers, rather than their average, as part of a risk calculation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This error likely had the effect of muting volatility by a factor of two,&#8221; according to the report. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency on Jan. 14 took the first regulatory actions stemming from the trade, ordering the bank to strengthen risk and auditing controls. The board of directors also was told to consider control weaknesses and &#8220;adverse risk outcomes&#8221; while awarding compensation for Dimon and other top managers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Karen Gullo" date="Jan 16, 2013  8:09 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-16/chevron-subpoenas-in-ecuador-suit-challenged-in-california-1-.html"><headline>Chevron Subpoenas in Ecuador Suit Challenged in Court</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), which faces a $19
billion damage award in an Ecuador environmental case, shouldn&#8217;t
be allowed to obtain information about the e-mail accounts of
lawyers, activists and scholars in contact with plaintiff
attorneys, a privacy rights group told a judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marcia Hofmann, an attorney for the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, asked U.S. Magistrate Judge Nathanael Cousins in San
Francisco today to block Chevron subpoenas, saying that free
speech and privacy rights are at stake. She alleged that the
company is trying to harass and intimidate activists associated
with the legal effort to hold Chevron responsible for
environmental damage in the Amazon basin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These people feel intimidated by this,&#8221; said Hofmann,
who&#8217;s trying to shield the identity of people she refers to as
&#8220;John Does&#8221; from Chevron in records it seeks from Google Inc.
and Yahoo Inc. &#8220;They&#8217;re all engaged in political activity, and
it&#8217;s public criticism against Chevron.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron is seeking information about when and where people
logged into e-mail accounts, not the content of e-mails, to use
as evidence in its racketeering lawsuit against Steven Donziger,
the lead U.S. legal adviser for the Ecuador plaintiffs, said
Theodore Boutrous, Chevron&#8217;s lawyer. The San Ramon, California-
based company alleges Donziger and others improperly influenced
a court expert in the case and committed fraud to win the
damages award. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Innocent Bystanders&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fight over the subpoenas isn&#8217;t a free-speech battle,
Boutrous said. Rather than &#8220;innocent bystanders,&#8221; the &#8220;John
Does&#8221; were part of the &#8220;pressure campaign&#8221; against Chevron
and their e-mail activity might provide proof of how the
plaintiff lawyers funneled information to the Ecuador judge and
ghost-wrote his decision against Chevron, Boutrous told Cousins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We know who every one of these people are,&#8221; Boutrous
said. &#8220;We allege some of them at least, many of them, were part
of the scheme, wittingly or unwittingly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donziger denies wrongdoing and the oil company is attacking
him to avoid responsibility for the damages and trying to
intimidate people who it thinks don&#8217;t have the resources to
fight back, Karen Hinton, a spokeswoman for the Ecuadorean
plaintiffs, said in an e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cousins said the underlying case, which is being litigated
in several countries and is the subject of international
arbitration, involves political issues. He questioned whether
there should be heightened concern about free speech rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Contract Dispute&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is not a run-of-the-mill contract dispute,&#8221; Cousins
told Boutrous. &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure I agree with your assessment&#8221;
that the case is about something &#8220;agnostic and commercial.
Isn&#8217;t this a political case?&#8221; He didn&#8217;t say when he would rule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The damages against Chevron were awarded in 2011 by a
provincial judge in Ecuador in a lawsuit brought by villagers
who said the company was responsible for toxic pollution from
oil drilling by Texaco Inc., which Chevron acquired in 2001.
Chevron, the world&#8217;s fourth largest oil company, says it cleaned
up its portion of the region and was released by the Ecuadorean
government from future damage claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has no assets in Ecuador; the plaintiffs have
gone to court in Canada, Brazil and Argentina to seize Chevron
funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Chevron v. Donziger, 12-80237, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects Boeing aircraft model under &#8216;Boeing Slumps&#8217; subhead.) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most U.S. stocks fell, following yesterday&#8217;s gain, as a cut in the World Bank&#8217;s growth forecasts offset a rally in Apple Inc. as investors watched earnings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Boeing Co. (BA) slumped 3.4 percent as All Nippon Airways Co. and Japan Airlines Co., the world&#8217;s largest users of the 787 jets, grounded their entire fleet of Dreamliners. Custody banks Bank of New York Mellon Corp. and Northern Trust Corp. (NTRS) dropped at least 2.7 percent. Apple, which slid below $500 a share yesterday for the first time in 11 months, rallied 4.2 percent to halt a three-day decline. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. added 4.1 percent after the bank&#8217;s profit almost tripled. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Three stocks retreated for every two rising on U.S. exchanges at 4 p.m. New York time. The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index advanced less than 0.1 percent to 1,472.63. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 23.66 points, or 0.2 percent, to 13,511.23. About 5.6 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, or 8.6 percent below the three-month average. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The cuts in growth forecasts are reminders that there&#8217;s still work to be done,&#8221; said Brad Sorensen, director of market and sector analysis at San Francisco-based Charles Schwab Corp. His firm has $1.92 trillion in client assets. &#8220;In the U.S., it&#8217;s early to talk about the earnings season, but so far we&#8217;re relatively pleased with what we&#8217;ve seen. We&#8217;ve had a good start to the year in stocks. There&#8217;s very little doubt that there&#8217;s quite a bit of money on the sidelines that could provide a nice boost higher.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Growth Forecast &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The World Bank cut its global growth forecast for this year as austerity measures, high unemployment and low business confidence weigh on economies in developed nations. German Chancellor Angela Merkel&#8217;s government cut its growth forecast for Europe&#8217;s biggest economy. Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean- Claude Juncker said the strength of the euro poses a threat to the region&#8217;s economy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. economy picked up across much of the country last month, boosted by auto and home sales, even as the outlook for unemployment showed few signs of improvement, the Federal Reserve said. Industrial production in the U.S. climbed for a second month in December as demand picked up for business equipment, showing factories expanded even as lawmakers battled over the federal budget. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Earnings Season &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Besides JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, nine other companies in the SP 500 were scheduled to report results today. Almost 75 percent of the 39 SP 500 companies which reported quarterly results beat analysts forecasts. Fourth-quarter profits grew 2.5 percent, according to analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That would be the second-slowest quarterly growth since 2009, the data show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 has risen 3.3 percent so far this year, extending 2012&#8217;s 13 percent surge. Yet the benchmark gauge is trading at 14.8 times reported earnings, compared with an average of 16.5 since 1954, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;On the positive side of the ledger we&#8217;ve got at least what I consider to be undemanding valuations for stocks in general,&#8221; said Norm Conley, chief executive officer at St. Louis-based J.A. Glynn  Co, which manages about $975 million. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got earnings season kicking off here and so far no huge bad surprise, so that is an incremental positive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, which measures the cost of using options as insurance against declines in the SP 500, lost 1 percent to 13.42. Earlier today, the gauge fell to the lowest level since 2007. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Boeing Slumps &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Boeing slumped 3.4 percent to $74.34. The 787 faces fresh scrutiny after the Japanese airlines grounded almost half the world&#8217;s Dreamliner fleet for at least two days following an emergency landing. All Nippon Airways pilots on a domestic flight got battery-fault warnings and saw smoke in the cockpit, the U.S. National Transportation Board said today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The groundings added to the questions plaguing a model that was targeted for a U.S. assessment because of a Jan. 7 fire in a lithium-ion battery pack on a Japan Airlines plane in Boston. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;BNY Mellon slumped 2.8 percent to $26.04 and Northern Trust dropped 5.7 percent to $49.78. Both banks have responded to near-zero interest rates by reducing staff and expenses to protect profit margins. While the banks benefited from rising stock prices, which increase fees for overseeing and managing investor money, low interest rates and slow capital-markets activity have hurt their ability to expand earnings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Chipotle, Dell &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (CMG) fell 5.5 percent to $280.94 after reporting preliminary fourth-quarter profit that trailed analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dell Inc. (DELL) dropped 4.3 percent to $12.61, after rallying 21 percent over the last two days. The third-largest PC maker is discussing a leveraged buyout with private-equity firms TPG Capital and Silver Lake, a person with knowledge of the matter said this week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Technology, which comprises the biggest group in the SP 500, rose the most among 10 industries. Apple (AAPL) rose 4.2 percent to $506.09, after slumping 7.2 percent over the previous three days. The company introduced installment payment plans for buyers of iPhones and MacBook laptops in China as it struggles to compete with low-cost devices in the world&#8217;s largest computer and mobile-phone market. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Bank Profits &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs rose 4.1 percent to $141.09. Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 58, has undertaken a $1.9 billion expense-reduction effort since mid-2011 and said he expected earnings growth to resume when the economy and markets improved. A stock-market rebound and a $500 million profit from selling a hedge fund-administration unit helped revenue recover from the lowest first half since 2005. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) gained 1 percent to $46.82. The largest U.S. bank by assets said fourth-quarter profit rose 53 percent, beating analysts&#8217; estimates as mortgage revenue more than doubled and the lender set aside less for future losses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Genworth Financial Inc. (GNW) rallied 8.9 percent to $8.85. The insurer that named a new chief executive officer this month said it is reorganizing to separate most of the company from the mortgage-guaranty operation that saddled the firm with losses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Smith  Wesson Holding Corp. rose 5.7 percent to $8.91. Sturm Ruger  Co. added 5 percent to $50.38. President Barack Obama proposed the most ambitious set of gun control proposals in decades, calling for a renewal of a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines and setting out 23 executive actions he&#8217;ll take such as ordering agencies to share data for background checks and addressing mental health issues. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Transportation Stocks &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;These proposals were widely expected to occur today,&#8221; said Rommel Dionisio, analyst at Wedbush Securities based in New York. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Constellation Brands Inc. added 6.2 percent to $38.65 after being rated buy in new coverage at Buckingham Research by equity analyst Alice Longley. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Dow is better positioned to set a record now that its transportation-stock counterpart has done so, according to Richard Moroney, editor of the Dow Theory Forecasts newsletter. The Dow Jones Transportation Average has led the Dow industrials throughout the rally which started in March 2009. Yesterday the Dow transports closed at 5,639.64, an all-time high. The average had climbed 6.3 percent for the year, its best performance through Jan. 15 since 1987. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a legitimate move,&#8221; Moroney, who serves as the chief investment officer at Horizon Investment Services LLC as well as the newsletter&#8217;s editor, said yesterday in a telephone interview. &#8220;I take it as a positive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All 20 companies in the Dow transports had gains for the year as of yesterday. Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL), the world&#8217;s second- largest airline, set the pace by rising 15 percent. Most beat the Dow industrials&#8217; 3.3 percent advance for 2013 as well. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter earnings reports will largely determine whether the industrials reach a record any time soon, according to Moroney. The average would have to advance 4.7 percent to surpass its peak of 14,164.53 in October 2007. It&#8217;s 0.6 percent away from beating last year&#8217;s high. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Christine Harper" date="Jan 16, 2013  5:35 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-16/goldman-sachs-profit-beats-analysts-estimates-on-investments.html"><headline>Goldman Profit Beats Analysts&#8217; Estimates on Investments</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) climbed the most in 10 months after quarterly profit beat estimates and full-year revenue grew for the first time since 2009. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The stock rose 4.1 percent to $141.09 at 4:09 p.m. in New York, the biggest gain since March 13, pushing the year-to-date increase to 11 percent. The firm said fourth-quarter earnings more than tripled to $5.60 a share, surpassing even the highest estimate of 26 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 58, who has undertaken a $1.9 billion expense-reduction effort since mid-2011, cut 900 jobs during the year and slashed the portion of revenue allocated to pay. A stock-market rebound and a $500 million profit from selling a hedge fund-administration unit helped revenue recover from the lowest first half since 2005. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a very cyclical business, highly dependent on capital markets,&#8221; said Michael Vogelzang, chief investment officer at Boston Advisors LLC, which manages $2.4 billion, including Goldman Sachs stock. &#8220;The capital markets were doing well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Return on average common stockholders&#8217; equity, a measure of how well the firm reinvests shareholder money, rose to 10.7 percent in 2012 from 3.7 percent in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest U.S. bank by assets, said fourth-quarter profit rose 53 percent, beating analysts&#8217; estimates as mortgage revenue more than doubled and the lender set aside less for future losses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Net income climbed to $5.69 billion, or $1.39 a share, from $3.73 billion, or 90 cents, a year earlier, the New York-based company said today in a statement. JPMorgan earned $1.35 a share excluding one-time items such as accounting adjustments and costs from a mortgage settlement, compared with the $1.22 estimate for adjusted earnings by 28 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The firm&#8217;s results reflected strong underlying performance across virtually all our businesses for the fourth quarter and the full year, with strong lending and deposit growth,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan capped its third-straight year of record profits with $21.3 billion in net income, even after suffering its biggest trading loss ever. The bank faces regulatory sanctions and investigations by U.S. and international authorities stemming from the loss over a wrong-way bet on credit derivatives. The mistake cost JPMorgan more than $6.2 billion in the first nine months of last year, and the board cut Dimon&#8217;s 2012 pay in half as a result. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Cobalt International Energy Inc (CIE),
the explorer seeking oil in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and West
Africa, fell the most in more than a month after Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) and other backers announced plans to sell 40 million
shares worth more than $1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cobalt fell 7.1 percent to $24.84 at the close in New York,
the biggest decline since Dec. 12. The share sale would reduce
the holdings of Goldman Sachs and First Reserve Corp. as well as
funds owned by Carlyle Group LP (CG) and Riverstone Holdings LLC from
about 15 percent each to less than 13 percent, according to a
filing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A successful sale would drop holdings by Cobalt&#8217;s biggest
investors below 50 percent, requiring the company to qualify a
majority of directors as independent within a year to meet New
York Stock Exchange standards, according to the filing. Cobalt
won&#8217;t receive any proceeds from the share sale. The shares have
climbed to as much as $34.03 since first offered to the public
at $13.50 in December 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cobalt, based in Houston, announced Dec. 5 a
&#8220;significant&#8221; discovery at its North Platte prospect in the
Gulf of Mexico. The company announced its second discovery off
the coast of Angola July 31. It has yet to report a profit as a
public company, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman intends to sell 13 million shares, paring its stake
to 12.15 percent from 15.33 percent, according to the filing.
Funds controlled by Carlyle and Riverstone will also offer 13
million shares, trimming their holdings to 12.15 percent. Funds
of First Reserve expect to sell 10 million shares to retain a
12.76 percent stake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KERN Fund, with investors that include Stanford University
and Caisse de depot et placement due Quebec, plans to sell 3.9
million shares, trimming its stake to 5.61 percent from 6.56
percent, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exploration Success &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cobalt&#8217;s $1.38 billion of 2.625 percent convertible notes,
which mature in December 2019 and can be swapped for shares at
about $35.69 each, dropped 3.4 cents to 103.5 cents on the
dollar and yielded 2.1 percent at 9:52 a.m. in New York,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have had successes in our exploration efforts in each
of our focus areas,&#8221; Cobalt said in the prospectus filed today
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Cobalt has
&#8220;long-lived leasehold positions that cannot be replicated,&#8221;
according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) and Citigroup Inc. (C) will handle the sale with
an option to buy as many as 6 million additional shares at the
offer price, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) agreed to offer a $557 million package of cash and other assistance for mortgage borrowers to settle a federal probe into allegations that the banks improperly seized homes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The sum includes $232 million in direct payments to more than 220,000 borrowers and $325 million in assistance such as loan modifications, the Federal Reserve said in a statement. Eric Kollig, a Fed spokesman, declined to say how much each of the New York-based firms will pay. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The deal adds to the $8.5 billion settlement announced last week among the Fed, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and 10 of the biggest U.S. lenders, including JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. Regulators probed allegations that lenders rushed home foreclosures by using flawed documents. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;With the addition of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, more than 4 million borrowers will receive a total of $3.5 billion in cash compensation while an additional $5.5 billion will be provided by the servicers for mortgage assistance,&#8221; the Fed said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley&#8217;s share of the accord totals $227 million, consisting of $97 million in cash and $130 million in other relief, according to two people briefed on the matter. Goldman Sachs will pay $135 million in cash plus $195 million in relief, said the people, who asked for anonymity because terms weren&#8217;t publicly announced. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Helping Borrowers &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cash payments in today&#8217;s deal range as high as $125,000 and cover borrowers whose homes were in foreclosure in 2009 and 2010, the Fed said. The loans were handled by Litton Loan Servicing LP, which formerly was owned by Goldman Sachs, and Saxon Mortgage Services Inc., which was a unit of Morgan Stanley, according to the Fed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, and Mark Lake of Morgan Stanley both said their firms were pleased to have resolved the probe. Lake declined to say whether the accord will result in a charge against fourth-quarter earnings, which are scheduled to be released Jan. 18. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs set aside $260 million in the fourth quarter to cover litigation and regulatory proceedings including today&#8217;s settlement, according to a statement today released with the firm&#8217;s earnings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Longer List &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs bought Litton in 2007 to get into mortgage servicing, and Morgan Stanley bought Saxon in 2006, before a housing market collapse that led to the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Litton started 135,586 foreclosures in 2009 and 2010, and Saxon initiated at least 60,313 actions in the same period, according to the Fed. Both banks later sold the servicers to Ocwen Financial Corp. (OCN) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The settlement with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley expands the industry payouts beyond the initial 14 firms that agreed in 2011 to hire outside consultants to review their foreclosures for errors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;HSBC Holdings Inc. (HBC) and Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY) are also preparing to sign on to the deal, two people briefed on the matter have said. Neil Brazil, a U.S. spokesman for HSBC, said the bank is still in discussions with regulators. Its mortgage- servicing operations were regulated by both the Fed and OCC. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The OCC continues conversations with the remaining servicers,&#8221; said Bryan Hubbard, an OCC spokesman. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IndyMac Bancorp&#8217;s successor OneWest Bank FSB and EverBank Financial Corp. (EVER) also haven&#8217;t reached an accord with regulators. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ally, with all its mortgage-servicing affiliates, represented the fifth-largest U.S. servicer with 2.5 million loans during the crisis, according to the Fed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Residential Capital LLC, the unit of Detroit-based Ally involved in the settlement, supports the idea that bank funds &#8220;should go toward consumers rather than consultants,&#8221; and has been delayed in considering the settlement because of its bankruptcy, said Susan Fitzpatrick, a bank spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Christine Harper and Michael J.

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said it&#8217;s
weighing whether to sell a stake in its reinsurance unit, which
generated $1.08 billion of revenue last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The business may be &#8220;better held in other people&#8217;s hands
and we can be a minority owner&#8221; after global capital rules take
effect, Harvey M. Schwartz, who is set to become chief financial
officer this month, said today on a conference call after New
York-based Goldman Sachs reported fourth-quarter results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the first time the bank disclosed the contribution
of its Goldman Sachs Reinsurance Group. Reinsurance revenue
climbed 23 percent last year from 2011 and accounted for 13
percent of the firm&#8217;s $8.21 billion of equities revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is in talks to sell a majority stake in the
business in a deal that would value the unit at about $1.1
billion, Insurance Insider reported yesterday. David Wells, a
company spokesman, declined to comment on the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The division has a global property and casualty reinsurance
business as well as life and annuity reinsurance operations
primarily in the U.S. Goldman Sachs agreed in March to buy Ariel
Holdings Ltd.&#8217;s Bermuda-based insurance and reinsurance
businesses to expand property and casualty coverage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased reserves in the reinsurance unit added to non-
compensation expenses, the firm said today without providing
figures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank, reduced its 2013 stock-repurchase request with
federal bank regulators by at least 20 percent after suffering
its biggest trading loss ever last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan asked the Federal Reserve if it could buy back
less than $3 billion per quarter when it submitted its annual
capital request in January, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon,
56, told analysts on a conference call today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed forced the New York-based company to suspend a $15
billion stock-buyback program last year after the bank in May
acknowledged losses in a credit-derivatives portfolio that
eventually swelled to more than $6.2 billion. JPMorgan&#8217;s board
of directors cut Dimon&#8217;s pay for 2012 in half after a review of
the losses in the chief investment office held him responsible
for the botched trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had repurchased $1.6 billion of the $15 billion in
authorized share buybacks when the Fed suspended the program.
The central bank later approved the repurchase of $3 billion in
additional shares in the first quarter, leaving $10.4 billion of
the original buyback goal unused. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon said he is inclined to buy back shares when the price
of the stock falls below tangible book value. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
generates the most revenue from equity trading of any bank in
the world, said $1.08 billion of that revenue comes from its
reinsurance business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit produced $880 million of revenue in 2011, Goldman
Sachs said today as it disclosed the contribution for the first
time in its fourth-quarter earnings report. Reinsurance revenue
accounted for 13 percent of the bank&#8217;s $8.21 billion of 2012
equities revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank is in talks to sell a majority stake in its
reinsurance business in a deal that would value the unit at
about $1.1 billion, The Insurance Insider reported yesterday.
David Wells, a spokesman for the New York-based firm, declined
to comment on the potential sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Reinsurance Group has a global property and
casualty reinsurance business as well as a life and annuity
reinsurance operations primarily in the U.S. The bank agreed to
in March to buy Ariel Holdings Ltd.&#8217;s Bermuda-based insurance
and reinsurance businesses to expand property and casualty
coverage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased reserves in the reinsurance unit added to non-
compensation expenses, the firm said today without providing
figures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217; equities division generated about $2 billion
more than its closest competitor in the first nine months of the
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Carla Main" date="Jan 16, 2013  8:44 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-16/goldman-bonuses-appraisal-rules-u-k-banks-compliance.html"><headline>Goldman Bonuses, Appraisal Rules, U.K. Banks: Compliance</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) won&#8217;t delay
distribution of U.K. bonuses to help minimize employees&#8217; tax
rates, a person with direct knowledge of the decision said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm had considered postponing incentive compensation
due to employees from 2009, 2010 and 2011 until after top
income-tax rates drop in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In remarks to lawmakers in London yesterday, Bank of
England Governor Mervyn King criticized the plan as &#8220;lacking in
care and attention to how others might react.&#8221; He said it&#8217;s
&#8220;depressing&#8221; that banks may be willing to shift bonus payments
to minimize workers&#8217; tax burden. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs accelerated delivery of $65 million in stock
awards last month to 10 executives, including Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, in a move that helped them avoid
higher U.S. taxes that take effect this year. That change, which
didn&#8217;t affect compensation for 2012, was made public by company
filings at about 8 p.m. New York time on New Year&#8217;s Eve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, the Financial Times and other media reported
that Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, was
reviewing whether to delay U.K. bonus payments due from prior
years to help employees pay lower rates. The reports were met
with criticism from U.K. politicians as well as King. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Management decided against proceeding with the plan, a
decision that was ratified yesterday in a regular meeting of the
board&#8217;s compensation committee, according to the person, who
asked to not be identified because deliberations were private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision by New York-based Goldman Sachs was reported
earlier yesterday by British Broadcasting Corp. editor Robert
Peston on Twitter.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Appraisal Standards for Higher-Risk Mortgages Approved by FDIC &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. mortgage lenders will get an additional year to
implement new appraisal standards for higher-risk loans after
regulators revised the Dodd-Frank Act measure to address
concerns raised by financial firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creditors issuing loans at above-average interest rates
that don&#8217;t meet the &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; standard will need to
get written reports by certified appraisers who physically
inspect homes under rules approved yesterday by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp., one of six regulators that must sign
off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders will get the full 12-month implementation period
permitted under the statute, according to John Fairbanks, a
spokesman for the National Credit Union Administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the initial physical inspection, the rule
requires a second appraisal when a home is being turned around
for a quick, higher resale. Fairbanks said the final rule
doesn&#8217;t require the second appraisal if the new sale price is
only slightly higher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The six U.S. regulators involved in the joint rule include
the FDIC, NCUA, the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency, Federal Housing Finance Agency and Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BBA Proposes Independent Board to Monitor Banking Standards &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The British Bankers&#8217; Association, a financial lobby group,
proposed creating an independent council to promote a new code
of conduct for bankers after scandals eroded trust in the
industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code would guide banks on pay, what&#8217;s expected of
boards and controls to prevent unethical behavior, the London-
based BBA said in a submission to parliament published
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan comes after banks set aside about 11 billion
pounds ($17.7 billion) to compensate customers mis-sold loan
insurance and for the Libor scandal. Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc, Britain&#8217;s biggest government-owned lender, may pay as
much as 500 million pounds in fines next week to settle
allegations traders tried to rig interest rates, two people with
knowledge of the matter said. Barclays Plc (BARC) was fined 290 million
pounds in June for manipulating Libor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed Banking Standards Review Council &#8220;would need
to be independent of the industry&#8221; with a non-banking chairman
and a majority of non-banking members, including customers, the
lobby group said in its submission to the Parliamentary
Commission on Banking Standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.K.&#8217;s Biggest Companies Lower Tax Rate With Overseas Business &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest U.K. companies paid taxes at a lower rate for
the fourth consecutive year, partly by garnering more profit
overseas, and caused public outcry by avoiding levies in
Britain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effective tax rate for FTSE 100 companies, the largest
traded on the London Stock Exchange, fell to 24.5 percent from
35.8 percent in 2009, according to UHY Hacker Young, a London-
based accounting company. The firm said in an e-mailed statement
that reductions in corporate taxes around the world, including
in the U.K., have helped multinational companies reduce their
tax payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. Business Secretary Vince Cable said in December that
governments should coordinate across borders to make companies
pay more tax. More than 20 companies left the U.K. for tax
reasons from 2007 to 2011, according to the accounting firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government will be encouraged by tax-law changes that
prompted a few to return, the firm said. An &#8220;anti-abuse&#8221; rule
that may be considered by the U.K. government to limit tax
avoidance could drive more companies away, the accountants said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The averages used in the study are taken from effective tax
rates reported by FTSE 100 companies in their latest annual
reports or by their investor relations teams in the 12 months
ended Oct. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;EU Lawmakers Back Sovereign-Debt Curbs for Ratings Companies &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-ratings companies will face European Union curbs on
how they update markets about the quality of government debt
under plans approved by the bloc&#8217;s lawmakers today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measures, intended to make it less likely that ratings
decisions roil markets, will also give investors the right to
sue if they lose money because of poor quality or deliberately
distorted credit assessments. European Parliament legislators,
voting in Strasbourg, France, backed the plans in a compromise
deal with the EU&#8217;s 27 governments, which must now rubber-stamp
the accord before it can take effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the EU plan, each credit ratings company would pick a
maximum of three days a year when they would be allowed to
publish so-called unsolicited assessments of governments&#8217;
creditworthiness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsolicited ratings are those that haven&#8217;t been requested
and paid for by a client. Ratings companies will be able to
issue such ratings outside of their three dates if they can
justify it to regulators. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Siemens Agrees to Pay $10 Million to Settle New York Fraud Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Siemens AG (SIE) unit agreed to pay $10 million to settle
allegations made by New York prosecutors that the company lied
about its qualifications to win more than $200 million in
infrastructure contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schlesinger-Siemens Electrical violated New York state law
by filing false documents with two city departments, the New
York District Attorney&#8217;s Office said in a statement on its
website Jan. 14. Siemens takes responsibility for misconduct
committed by its former business partner Schlesinger Electrical
Contractors Inc., Munich-based Siemens said in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York&#8217;s Department of Environmental Protection awarded
five contracts to Schlesinger-Siemens Electrical with a total
value of $234.8 million between Aug. 31, 2005, and Jan. 19,
2007, New York District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.K. Will Widen Review of Financial Firm Sales Incentives &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K.&#8217;s financial watchdog is widening a probe into
sales incentives at retail financial companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Services Authority will investigate practices
at &#8220;high street banks and other firms in addition to the 22
firms that were originally assessed,&#8221; the agency said in an e-
mailed statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, the regulator is in talks with banks to set a
cut-off date for claims arising from alleged improper selling of
payment protection insurance, the London-based Times reported,
citing unidentified people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The British Bankers Association has suggested a summer
deadline in return for agreement by banks to finance an
advertising campaign making the public aware, the newspaper
said. The FSA is sympathetic to banks&#8217; concern that without a
cut-off date, there may otherwise be no end to mis-selling
claims, the Times said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The British Bankers Association declined to comment, the
Times said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Broadband Research&#8217;s Kinnucan Gets 4 Years in Insider Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadband Research LLC founder John Kinnucan, the expert-
networker who refused to cooperate in a U.S. probe of insider
trading before admitting to passing tips to hedge-fund clients,
was sentenced to four years and three months in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Deborah Batts yesterday in Manhattan
federal court also ordered him to forfeit $164,000 he made in
illegal profit. Kinnucan, who was indicted in February, pleaded
guilty in July to one count of conspiracy and two counts of
securities fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his plea, Kinnucan said he both obtained and gave tips
to clients of his expert-networking firm, including two in New
York. Prosecutors said he got inside information about SanDisk
Corp. (SNDK), F5 Networks Inc. (FFIV) and OmniVision Technologies Inc. (OVTI),
including quarterly revenue numbers, after befriending employees
of technology companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kinnucan was arrested Feb. 16 at his home in Portland,
Oregon. Prosecutors said that in the two months leading up to
his arrest, he engaged in a &#8220;campaign&#8221; of threats and anti-
Semitic rants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a submission by his lawyer, which hasn&#8217;t been made
public and was referred to by the government in their court
papers, Kinnucan sought a 24-month prison term, saying his
conduct was &#8220;caused by stress, depression and alcohol abuse&#8221;
after he learned he was the subject of an insider-trading
investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Kinnucan, 12-cv-163, U.S District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apple Sued by Belgian Consumer Group Over Product Warranties &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL) is being sued by a Belgian consumer group over
its product-warranty practices, more than a year after the iPad
maker was fined by an Italian regulator over the same issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test-Aankoop/Test-Achats filed a lawsuit at the commercial
court in Brussels claiming Apple violates laws on consumer
guarantees, it said in a statement yesterday. It cited customer
complaints about information provided by Apple and authorized
distributors about the company&#8217;s legal warranty, its one-year
warranty and a warranty extension of as much as three years
through the AppleCare Protection Plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italy&#8217;s competition agency fined Apple 900,000 euros ($1.2
million) in 2011, saying the Cupertino, California-based company
misled consumers by &#8220;prominently advertising&#8221; that its
products had a one-year manufacturer warranty and selling an
extension when consumers have the right to an automatic two-year
warranty. European Union Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding
last year asked state governments to check whether Apple
retailers failed to advertise buyers&#8217; right to the two-year
warranty for products such as the iPhone and the iPad tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Hely, a spokesman for Apple in London, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to a call and an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;United Airlines Skirted Jet-Fuel Taxes, Illinois Agency Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;United Airlines Inc. (UAL) used a &#8220;sham&#8221; site outside Chicago
to avoid paying the full tax on jet fuel, the Illinois Regional
Transportation Authority said in a lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The airline&#8217;s United Aviation Fuels Corp. unit, which
purchases jet fuel for United and its regional carriers, used an
office in Sycamore, Illinois, that has no true sales activity,
the agency said in the complaint filed Jan. 14 in state court in
Chicago. The office has one staff member, who doesn&#8217;t work daily
and doesn&#8217;t have a computer, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;United Airlines and its unit have been engaging in the
sales since 2001, diverting tax money owed to the agency and
other municipalities, according to the lawsuit. The RTA asked
for a court order barring the practice, as well as recovery for
unpaid taxes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit is &#8220;without merit,&#8221; said Jennifer Dohm, a
spokeswoman for Chicago-based United Continental Holdings Inc.,
United Airlines&#8217; parent company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The operation of our fuel subsidiary in Sycamore has been
examined by tax authorities in the past and has been determined
to comply with all applicable laws,&#8221; Dohm said in an e-mail.
She said the company will fight the claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Regional Transportation Authority v. United
Aviation Fuels Corp., 2013CH01023, Circuit Court of Cook County,
Chancery Division (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interviews/Hearings &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;EU&#8217;s Barroso Expects Bank-Supervisor Regulations Within Weeks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Commission President Jose Barroso said regulations
to create a single bank supervisor at the European Central Bank
are proceeding quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I hope making the final step for formal adoption is a
matter of weeks, not months,&#8221; he said in the text of a speech
to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. Parliament
members have worked &#8220;very efficiently&#8221; with the council of
European nations to speed up work on the issue, he said
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Central Bank is slated to become the single
supervisor for euro-area banks around March 1, 2014, a year
after regulations are set to establish oversight operations. The
new supervisor is one condition for allowing the 500 billion-
euro ($667 billion) European Stability Mechanism to lend
directly to banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brussels-based commission will move swiftly on other
banking measures such as capital requirements, deposit-insurance
standards and how to handle failing lenders, Barroso said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Comings and Goings/Executive Pay &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Halves Dimon Pay, Says CEO Responsible for Lapses &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon
had his pay cut by half after a review of losses at the bank&#8217;s
chief investment office found he bears responsibility for the
blunders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CEO&#8217;s compensation for 2012 is $11.5 million, the New
York-based bank said today on its website, compared with $23
million a year earlier. The 2012 sum includes a $1.5 million
salary and $10 million of incentive compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Dimon bears ultimate responsibility for the failures
that led to the losses in CIO and has accepted responsibility
for such failures,&#8221; the New York-based company said today on
its website after spending about eight months reviewing what
Dimon, 56, has called &#8220;egregious mistakes&#8221; at the CIO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is working to rebuild investors&#8217; trust after
losing more than $6.2 billion in last year&#8217;s first nine months
on derivatives bets by U.K. trader Bruno Iksil, nicknamed the
London Whale because his positions were so big. The debacle
fueled legal claims against the company and its executives, and
regulatory probes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank said its review of Dimon took into account his
decisions to replace senior managers, efforts to claw back their
pay and the formation of a team to examine what went wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dijsselbloem a &#8216;Good&#8217; Possible Next Eurogroup Head, Faymann Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann praised Dutch Finance
Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem&#8217;s qualifications as the possible
next head of the group of euro-area finance chiefs, saying he is
a &#8220;good candidate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faymann made the remarks to reporters yesterday in
Strasbourg, France. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, who has led
the group of euro-area finance ministers since 2005, is
preparing to step down. His successor is due to be designated on
Jan. 21. Faymann said the 17-nation euro area has yet to reach
an agreement on Juncker&#8217;s successor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dijsselbloem, a member of the Labor Party in the

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s compensation expense climbed 6 percent in 2012, the first increase in three years, as revenue rose 19 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, benefits and deferred awards from previous years, advanced to $12.9 billion for the year from $12.2 billion in 2011, the New York-based company said today in a statement. The cost amounted to 38 percent of revenue, compared with 42 percent a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, led by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, has sought to lower annual costs by $1.9 billion since mid-2011 as the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets contended with slumping revenue. The pay increase for 2012 contrasts with a 3 percent decline in the number of employees to 32,400 during the year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The pay expense averages $399,506 per employee, up from $367,057 in 2011. The average compensation figures are derived by dividing the compensation pool by the number of employees and don&#8217;t reflect actual pay for individual workers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Michael J.

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s corporate and investment bank cut employee compensation costs 3 percent in 2012 to $11.3 billion as the division generated 1 percent more revenue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The expense was enough to give each of the division&#8217;s 52,151 employees $216,928, according to figures posted today on the New York-based company&#8217;s website. In 2011, the unit set aside $11.7 billion to pay traders, dealmakers and other personnel, or $217,600 for each of the 53,557 people on staff. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan combined its investment bank with the firm&#8217;s corporate bank and treasury and securities-services units last year, and placed Mike Cavanagh and Daniel Pinto in charge of the division. The fourth quarter was the first that the bank reported the combined results of the entire group, which has more than double the employees than the investment bank alone. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pay costs for the year were 33 percent of revenue at the corporate and investment bank, down from 34 percent in 2011. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The amount set aside for compensation includes salaries, bonuses, benefits and the cost of deferred pay from previous years. Figures for average pay don&#8217;t represent what individuals actually receive and are calculated by dividing the total compensation expense by the number of employees. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Ambereen Choudhury" date="Jan 16, 2013  6:26 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-16/jpmorgan-european-equity-sales-trader-thomas-candillier-dies.html"><headline>JPMorgan European Equity Sales Trader Candillier Dies at 37</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Candillier, the Paris-based
head of European cash equity sales at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), has
died at the age of 37. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan declined to comment on the cause of death.
Candillier is survived by his wife and children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Marchiony, a JPMorgan spokesman in London,
said Candillier will be &#8220;dearly missed.&#8221; The trader joined
JPMorgan in 2001 after starting his financial career in energy
derivative sales at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in 1999.
Candillier, who rose in the ranks at JPMorgan&#8217;s cash equity
sales unit in Europe, was educated at France&#8217;s ESSEC Business
School, according to his LinkedIn profile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He &#8220;was a wonderful leader, colleague, mentor, and
friend,&#8221; Patrick Burrowes, head of cash equities for Europe,
Middle East and Africa, and other senior colleagues at the New
York-based bank said in a memo to employees yesterday.
Candillier passed away on Jan. 14, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His previous roles at JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by
assets, included running the French sales team for cash
equities. He was promoted to executive director in 2005 at
JPMorgan and was most recently a managing director at the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our thoughts are with his family during this most
difficult time,&#8221; Burrowes and his colleagues said in the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was the third-largest broker by reported equity
trades in German exchanges last year, and fourth in London and
Paris, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Romania&#8217;s leu strengthened to its
highest level in a year after JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) said the
country&#8217;s domestic bonds are eligible for its emerging-market
government bond index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The currency advanced 0.1 percent to 4.3355 per euro by
11:30 a.m. in Bucharest, after adding as much as 0.4 percent to
the highest intraday level since Jan. 30 last year. The yield on
Romania&#8217;s June 2019 euro-denominated bonds slid one basis point,
or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.78 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exchange rate soared 1 percent yesterday, the most
since Aug. 6, after JPMorgan said Romania&#8217;s domestic bonds would
be added to its GBI-EM Index series from March 1, spurring
expectations of orders from fund managers seeking to replicate
the benchmark gauge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Since yesterday&#8217;s announcement was made after the home
market closed, the central bank had no chance to react to the
rapid appreciation,&#8221; Dan Bucsa, a London-based economist at
UniCredit SpA (UCG), wrote in a note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inclusion in the index would be phased over a three-month
period ending May 1, JPMorgan said in a note to clients
yesterday. Romania&#8217;s weighting on completion is estimated at
0.54 percent of the GBI-EM Global Diversified index. Its entry
is &#8220;subject to final determination,&#8221; JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank, which has restricted its supply of leu at
its weekly repurchase auctions since October to help prop up the
currency, increased the limit to 6 billion lei ($1.8 billion) on
Jan. 14 from 4 billion lei a week earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the central bank is unlikely to &#8220;hint at any desired
euro/leu level nor to strongly intervene to force the leu to
depreciate significantly,&#8221; it prefers a more stable currency
closer to 4.4 per euro, Bucsa said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iron ore will see another year of
&#8220;exceptional prices&#8221; before supplies start to outpace demand,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said today as it increased its forecast
for the seaborne commodity used in steel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices will probably average $144 a dry ton in 2013, up
from $140 estimated previously, the bank said in an e-mailed
report. The ore may decline to $126 in 2014 before averaging $90
in 2015 and $80 in 2016, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron ore surged 76 percent since dropping to a three-year
low in September on optimism China, the biggest buyer, is
recovering. JPMorgan Chase  Co. today increased its 2013
estimate to an average $130 from $110, while Deutsche Bank AG
said Jan. 8 prices may climb to $170 in the first half before
falling below $120. Rio Tinto Group, the second-biggest
exporter, posted yesterday better-than-expected output for the
fourth quarter and said it will press ahead with expansion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;market is headed for a long period of significant
oversupply, but in our view this is still two years away,&#8221; said
Goldman. &#8220;We expect iron ore producers will see one last year
of exceptional prices and profit margins&#8221; as the &#8220;restocking
phase continues, supply starts to tighten and market sentiment
becomes more bullish,&#8221; the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ore with 62 percent iron content delivered to the Chinese
port of Tianjin declined a fourth day, dropping 1.1 percent to
$152.90 yesterday, according to data from The Steel Index Ltd.
Prices climbed to $158.50 on Jan. 8, the most expensive since
Oct. 13, 2011 after rallying 39 percent in the three months
through December, the most since at least 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unwilling Buyers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rally prompted Chinese steelmakers to use more domestic
supplies, a survey by Mysteel.com showed. Higher prices will
stop mills from rebuilding inventories, according to Hebei Iron
 Steel Group and Maanshan Iron  Steel (323) Co. The country&#8217;s
steelmakers are unwilling to buy imported ore at above $150, UBS
AG analyst Hubert Tang said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices will drop from an average $145 in the first quarter
this year to $120 in the fourth quarter as new supply comes on
stream, Fraser Jamieson, an analyst at JPMorgan, said in a
report. The bounce in prices from September while China&#8217;s
production was stable suggests restocking, &#8220;which we estimate
will come to an end around Chinese new year in early February
when activity typically slows,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imports last month climbed to a record 70.94 million tons
from 65.78 million tons in November, customs data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Strong demand growth in China has induced the development
of low-grade, high-cost operations that require relatively high
prices in order to remain viable,&#8221; said Goldman. &#8220;As long as
those mines remain in operation, we believe the seaborne price
will be supported at a high level.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growth in the China&#8217;s steel output will accelerate to
4.9 percent in 2013, while inventory levels in the country&#8217;s
ports of 73 million tons are at their lowest since January 2011,
said Goldman. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A chemical additive to gasoline
meant to make it burn more thoroughly poses a long-term threat
of contamination in New Hampshire, a witness testified at the
trial of ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Graham Fogg, a professor of hydrology at the University
of California, Davis, took the stand yesterday in state court in
Concord as the first witness in the state&#8217;s $816 million
lawsuit. New Hampshire sued oil companies for allegedly using
the additive, MTBE, while knowing its potential for groundwater
pollution as long as 29 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A problem like this is not going to disappear in a mere 6
years or 16 years or, I would say, 26 years,&#8221; Fogg testified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil and Citgo Petroleum Corp. said the additive,
meant to reduce air pollution, never caused illness to any
resident of New Hampshire. The trial, which began Jan. 14, pits
state environmental claims against assertions by companies that
they were complying with federal pollution rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fogg testified the additive can zigzag through fractured
bedrock in unpredictable patterns and remain in groundwater
longer than other compounds. Fogg said the additive poses unique
risks to drinking water when leaked from underground storage
tanks, based on its chemical properties and the state&#8217;s geology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The contaminant will tend to move along fractures that
are open and connected,&#8221; he told jurors. &#8220;Those fractures can
be quite complex.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Creates Hazard &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, MTBE creates a hazard that is difficult to
detect and equally difficult to clean up, Fogg said, showing
jurors slides that demonstrated the way MTBE can bleed into
water supplies. The state sought to counter claims by the oil
companies that MTBE has largely disappeared from the water
supply, as well as claims that the additive is safer than some
of the chemicals it displaces when mixed with gasoline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemicals such as benzene &#8220;don&#8217;t move very fast or very
far, Fogg said. &#8216;&#8216;They tend to stabilize because of
biodegradation.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state claimed in opening arguments that the oil
companies knew that if they added MTBE to gasoline it would
increase the risk and costs associated with contamination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;Exxon decided to disregard the recommendation of its own
employees and put MTBE in gasoline,&#8217;&#8217; Jessica Grant, a lawyer
for the state, told jurors Jan. 14. &#8216;&#8216;In 1984, Exxon anticipated
that if it added MTBE to its gasoline, the number of
contamination incidents would triple. These incidents would take
longer to clean up and cost five times as much.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each cleanup at that time would have cost as much as $7
million, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clean Air &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies said the federal Clean Air Act pre-empts the
state claims, and that by adding MTBE to gasoline, they were
complying with a U.S. mandate to supply cleaner-burning fuel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil refiners began adding MTBE to gasoline in the 1970s to
replace lead. From 1995 to 2006, they increased the use of MTBE,
which boosts the fuel&#8217;s oxygen level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;We had no choice but to put oxygenates in our gasoline,&#8217;&#8217;
Nate Eimer, a lawyer for Citgo, said yesterday in his opening
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit is one of scores of cases involving the
additive methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE, filed since 2000
against oil refiners, fuel distributors and chemical makers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defendants sought to emphasize to jurors that no one
has been injured. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;This is not a personal-injury case,&#8217;&#8217; David Lender, a
lawyer for ExxonMobil, said in his opening statement. &#8216;&#8216;There&#8217;s
not any evidence that anyone ever got sick or got cancer from
MTBE.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Gasoline &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lender contended that there has been no gasoline sold in
New Hampshire containing MTBE for more than six years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MTBE is produced by combining methanol, which is derived
from natural gas, and isobutylene, a byproduct of gasoline
refining. It can leak into the ground from gas stations, storage
tanks and auto junkyards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It dissolves in water and doesn&#8217;t biodegrade, so it can be
carried with the water great distances from the site of a leak
or spill, according to court papers. The chemical is difficult
and expensive to find, treat and remove, according to filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to New Hampshire case filings, MTBE can render
drinking water &#8216;&#8216;foul, putrid and unfit for human consumption.&#8217;&#8217;
The state said it petitioned the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency in 2001 to get out of its reformulated-gasoline program
because of awareness of MTBE&#8217;s harmful effects. The additive has
been banned in the state since January 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Warning &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;Despite knowing that MTBE posed a greater threat to
drinking water, they never posted a single warning,&#8217;&#8217; Grant
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire sued ExxonMobil and Citgo in 2003 along with
Shell Oil Co., Sunoco Inc., ConocoPhillips (COP), Irving Oil Ltd.,
Vitol SA and Hess Corp. All settled but Irving, Texas-based
ExxonMobil and Citgo, the Houston-based unit of Venezuela&#8217;s
state-owned oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA. Shell and
Sunoco agreed to pay $35 million in an accord announced in
November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire said it has identified 228 sites that will
require cleanup from contamination by MTBE, which according to
court filings can cause cancer in animals. Tests in 2005 and
2006 found MTBE in 9.1 percent of private wells throughout the
state, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire is seeking $816 million to cover cleanup and
monitoring costs, Grant said, and it will ask for damages from
ExxonMobil and Citgo based on their market shares of gasoline
sold in the state during the period covered by the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Market Shares &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil&#8217;s market share was about 30 percent, she said.
That means the state will seek $245 million in damages from the
company. Citgo&#8217;s market share ranged from 3 percent to 8.7
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lender said yesterday that ExxonMobil&#8217;s market share in New
Hampshire was only 6.1 percent during that time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;The majority of the state&#8217;s damage claims are based on
computer models and projections, not on actual testing or
data,&#8221; Claire Hassett, an ExxonMobil spokeswoman, said in an e-
mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state said the oil companies could have used safer
additives, such as ethanol, and chose not to because MTBE is
inexpensive to produce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If they had an alternative product to use and the
alternative is just as good and avoids serious risk to
consumers, there&#8217;s a strong argument the defendants have failed
the risk-utility standard and can be held liable,&#8221; said Keith
Hylton, who teaches law and economics at Boston University
School of Law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Short Supply &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil companies said ethanol wasn&#8217;t in large enough
supply when an additive was being sought, and that it presents
its own environmental hazards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil&#8217;s Hassett said the fault lies with whoever
spilled the chemically treated fuel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;MTBE contamination has been found in New Hampshire
because someone spilled gasoline in New Hampshire, not because
it was added to gasoline in a refinery in another state,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;The state should be suing parties responsible for
spilling gasoline.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil companies also said in court filings that a statute
of limitations should prevent the litigation from proceeding.
The state waited three years from the time it detected MTBE in
sites until it sued, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire Superior Court Judge Peter Fauver in August
rejected oil company motions seeking judgment without a trial
based on the arguments they raised. Those issues can be brought
up again for the jury&#8217;s consideration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Water Sources &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2011, the New Hampshire Supreme Court denied a
motion by the companies to decide the case in their favor and
sent it back to the Superior Court. The state&#8217;s highest court
said New Hampshire could seek damages for contamination of
nonpublic sources of water, such as wells, and public sources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Hampshire case had been moved to federal court in
New York, where other lawsuits have been consolidated for
pretrial evidence-gathering and motions before U.S. District
Judge Shira Scheindlin in Manhattan. In 2007, the U.S. Court of
Appeals in New York sent New Hampshire&#8217;s case back to the state
court there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scheindlin presided over the trial of New York City&#8217;s case
against ExxonMobil. In 2009, the jury in that case ordered
ExxonMobil to pay $104.7 million after finding it liable for
polluting wells in the city. ExxonMobil has appealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases consolidated in New York may be tried separately
in courts around the U.S. if settlements aren&#8217;t reached. In the
New York litigation, the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection filed its fourth amended complaint in June. No date
has been set for a trial, which would probably take place in
federal court in New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Hampshire trial may take more than four months,
lawyers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is State of New Hampshire v. Hess Corp. (HES), 03-
C-0550, New Hampshire Superior Court, Merrimack County
(Concord). The federal cases are consolidated as In re MTBE
Products Liability Litigation, 00-11898, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission doesn&#8217;t have to restore purged files on Bernard Madoff and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) that were sought by a
government watchdog group, a federal judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington sued
the agency for allegedly violating federal records law by
refusing to recover investigative files that had been destroyed.
The group asked for documents related to the agency&#8217;s
preliminary probes under the Freedom of Information Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington ruled
today that the government was only required to seek recovery of
records that were physically removed from the agency&#8217;s custody
rather than those that were done away with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The SEC was under no duty to undertake restoration
efforts,&#8221; the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit sought records of so-called Matters Under
Investigation, which under a policy dating back to 1998 weren&#8217;t
stored as official files of the SEC, according to a Sept. 14,
2011, letter to Congress from then-SEC enforcement director
Robert Khuzami. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CREW, as the group is known, sued for materials related to
the SEC&#8217;s initial probes of Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme, Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s trades of American International Group Inc. credit-
default swaps in 2009, insider-trading probes of Deutsche Bank
AG, Lehman Brothers and SAC Capital Advisors LP, and
investigations of possible financial fraud at Wells Fargo  Co.
and Bank of America Corp. in 2007 and 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Early Stages &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group, according to the lawsuit, wanted to know why
those probes were closed at an early stage without any action by
the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darcy Flynn, a 13-year SEC employee, claimed in a letter to
U.S. Senator Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, that the
agency destroyed documents related to those investigations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The most troubling aspect of the judge&#8217;s opinion is his
conclusion that the SEC is under absolutely no obligation to
conduct any recovery efforts,&#8221; Anne Weismann, chief counsel of
the group, said. She said the group was considering whether to
appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group sought recovery of deleted electronic files as
well as any physical documents that may still exist elsewhere in
the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Messy Details&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the group filed its lawsuit, Weismann said in a
statement that &#8220;the public deserves to know all the messy
details about how these investigations were conducted, and why
they were closed at such an early stage without taking any
action against the Bernie Madoffs of the world.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the SEC&#8217;s policy on closed preliminary
investigations, the only information it retained was the title
of the matter, its source, general subject matter, the staff
members involved, the date it was opened and closed and other
parties related to the inquiry, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In light of Grassley&#8217;s questions and continuing discussions
with the National Archives and Records Administration, the SEC
halted the policy, requiring all documents created or received
for all enforcement matters to be retained until the agency is
certain that the policies meet federal standards, according to
Khuzami&#8217;s letter to Congress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the top arranger for renewable-energy stock offerings last year, is accelerating its funding efforts as it anticipates a rebound in an industry that&#8217;s slumped every year since 2009. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman overtook Morgan Stanley as the biggest lead manager for share offerings with three deals valued at $405.6 million, according to an annual ranking by Bloomberg New Energy Finance. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The investment bank is backing renewable energy that it expects will gain favor in a global shift it says is inevitable. That&#8217;s why short-term volatility will be trumped by long-term gains as emerging technologies first become commonplace and then become indispensable, according to Stuart Bernstein, the Goldman partner overseeing its renewables unit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It feels like the worst is behind us,&#8221; Bernstein, 49, said in an interview from his office in San Francisco. &#8220;I&#8217;m a contrarian, so when everyone else is capitulating, I think it&#8217;s time to invest.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman may boost its financing efforts this year as it seeks to meet a pledge made in May to invest and finance more than $40 billion in the industry in the next decade. Worldwide, more than $395 billion will be invested annually in renewable energy by 2020, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company has made equity investments in solar developer BrightSource Energy Inc. (BRSE) and Horizon Wind Energy, which it sold to EDP-Energias de Portugal SA in 2007. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Goldman&#8217;s Deals &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In September, Goldman underwrote a $225 million follow-on offering for the electric-car company Tesla Motors Ltd. (TSLA), along with IPOs for the rooftop photovoltaic developer SolarCity Corp. (SCTY) in December and the biofuel crop developer Ceres Inc. (CERE) in February. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Backing renewable energy isn&#8217;t just an investment strategy, it&#8217;s a necessity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The industry is so important that when Goldman&#8217;s top executives visit the West Coast, up to Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, &#8220;they don&#8217;t just visit our largest market-cap clients, they also spend time with our early stage clean-tech companies,&#8221; Bernstein said. Clean energy is &#8220;central to the Goldman Sachs franchise.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The WilderHill New Energy Global Innovation Index (NEX), known as the NEX, slumped 5.5 percent last year, adding to 40 percent and 15 percent declines in the two previous years as investors pared their appetite for risk and governments slashed incentives for the industry. The Bloomberg Industries Large Solar Energy (BISOLAR) index of 17 companies fell 26 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Renewable Rebound &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Renewable shares have rebounded in the past few months as risk appetite returned. The NEX, which tracks 94 clean-energy stocks, has climbed more than 20 percent since Nov. 16, and the Large Solar index surged 81 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market appears to have toughed in the fourth quarter of last year and several sectors have rallied meaningfully since then,&#8221; Bernstein said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His comments coincide with a deal in the U.S. to extend a tax credit that supports wind-turbine installations. The policy was due to expire Dec. 31 and lobbying efforts to renew it received a boost after President Barack Obama&#8217;s re-election. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The solar industry is also gaining, with the first consecutive monthly increases in polysilicon prices since January 2012. Polysilicon, the raw material in most solar panels, has risen 1.3 percent since Dec. 24 to $16.03 a kilogram on Jan. 7, according to data from New Energy Finance. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman has been investing in renewable energy since at least 2005, and has a long-term view, said Ethan Zindler, an analyst with New Energy Finance. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Credibility&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;They have considerable credibility within this sector,&#8221; he said in by e-mail. &#8220;They have seen the various ups and downs, so they have significant perspective as well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman last took the top position in 2010, losing the slot to Morgan Stanley (MS) both in 2011 and in 2009. Morgan Stanley and UBS AG (UBSN) were co-lead managers on China Longyuan Power Group Corp. (916)&#8217;s $375 million stock offering in December, the biggest fund-raising in the public markets in 2012. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"This is going to be an extraordinarily large emerging market much the same way we viewed the BRICs."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deals by Goldman last year trumped the $363.8 million managed by Shanghai-based Guotai Junan Securities Co. Ltd., according to data compiled by New Energy Finance, a Bloomberg research company. The Chinese company handled the secondary stock placement of power-generator Shanghai Aerospace Automobile Electromechanical Co. (600151) and Shenzhen Jiawei Photovoltaic Lighting Co. (300317)&#8217;s IPO. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tesla, based in Palo Alto, California, has more than doubled since its June 2010 IPO, and its shares are up 49 percent in the past year. SolarCity has gained 77 percent since trading began. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Bring Investors&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The success of SolarCity&#8217;s IPO may bring investors back to the markets and create future financing and MA opportunities,&#8221; Bernstein said. &#8220;There will be interesting IPOs in several sectors over the next few years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bernstein, a Goldman partner, has also worked in private equity and is on the selection committee for the company&#8217;s clean technology and renewables group. He spends most of his time at Goldman&#8217;s office on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, California, famous for its venture capital culture. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The investment bank created Bernstein&#8217;s unit about three years ago to focus exclusively on renewable energy and take advantage of what it saw as a promising long-term play, he said. He compared the industry to the technology market in the 1990s, which was once seen as fraught with risky new technologies that are now the backbone of the information age. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have a growing global population coupled with an increasing per capita consumption of energy, while fossil resources are finite and shrinking,&#8221; he said. Backing renewable energy isn&#8217;t just an investment strategy, it&#8217;s a necessity, he said. &#8220;How can one not consider clean energy and renewable alternatives?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Maria Kolesnikova" date="Jan 17, 2013  1:14 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-17/jpmorgan-tops-banks-for-third-year-as-loans-retreat-commodities.html"><headline>JPMorgan Tops Banks for Third Year as Loans Retreat: Commodities</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) led lending to
commodities companies for a third consecutive year even as
global financing to the industry fell to the lowest since 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. bank by assets arranged $44.1 billion of
loans, giving the New York-based company a 7.8 percent market
share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Bank of America
Corp. and Citigroup Inc. (C) came next. Three Canadian banks were in
the top 10, from one a year ago, as European lenders retreated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loans fell 23 percent to $568 billion last year after
mergers and acquisitions diminished to the lowest annual total
since 2010. Deals accelerated in the fourth quarter to the
highest in five years, including OAO Rosneft&#8217;s $55 billion
purchase of oil producer TNK-BP, as economic growth improved.
Stock markets are rising for a third consecutive month after
U.S. lawmakers reached a budget agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Since there hasn&#8217;t been much MA for the past couple of
years, there is some pent-up demand,&#8221; said Thomas Cassin, co-
head of investment-grade finance at JPMorgan in New York.
&#8220;Having more clarity around the fiscal cliff, the debt ceiling
and just the direction of the economy in general will bring to
bear a bit more confidence and willingness to go out and look at
the MA.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Raw Materials &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities stagnated in 2012, with the Standard  Poor&#8217;s
GSCI gauge of 24 raw materials rising 0.3 percent, the least in
five years. The 140-member Bloomberg World Mining Index (BWMING) advanced
2.9 percent, lagging behind the 13 percent gain in the MSCI All-
Country World Index of equities. Natural-resource and energy
companies announced $610 billion of mergers and acquisitions,
8.3 percent less than in 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, the second-biggest U.S. lender by assets,
arranged $30.8 billion of loans, and New York-based Citigroup
$30.6 billion, giving them both a 5.4 percent market share.
Combined lending by the top three banks fell 36 percent from a
year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) overtook BNP Paribas SA (BNP) to take the
fourth slot after buying $9.5 billion of the French bank&#8217;s
energy loans in February. The Paris-based lender retreated 10
places in the rankings, as rival Societe Generale dropped to
19th from 15th. The figures as of yesterday reflect transactions
involving more than one bank and include credit lines, project
or term loans and trade finance. Wells Fargo&#8217;s total was $29.3
billion in loans, for a 5.2 percent share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Syndicated Loans &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Declines in syndicated loans in the commodity and energy
sector are consistent with trends in the broader market,&#8221; said
Peter Hall, the global head of investment-grade loan syndicates
at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in London. &#8220;The next big wave
of refinancing is due in two years, so 2014 and 2015 are going
to be much busier.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average interest banks charge for loans to commodity
companies has risen to 325 basis points more than benchmark
lending rates, from 268 basis points in 2011, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globally across all industries, banks charged 323.4 basis
points above lending rates compared with 282.3 basis points in
2011. Syndicated loans across industries declined 21 percent to
$2.99 trillion in 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Canadian Banks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBC Capital Markets, a unit of Royal Bank of Canada (RY), led
the advance by Canadian banks last year, taking fifth place with
$28.4 billion of loans, little changed from a year earlier. TD
Securities Inc., part of Toronto Dominion Bank, arranged almost
$19.9 billion for seventh place, and was one of only two in the
top 10 to increase overall lending, along with Barclays Plc. (BARC)
Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS), based in Toronto, oversaw $16 billion of
loans to take 10th place. Wells Fargo, Barclays, Nova Scotia and
BNP Paribas declined to comment for this story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Resource financing will go up this year,&#8221; said Burke Smyth, the co-head of Canadian credit origination at TD
Securities in Toronto. &#8220;There is nothing to prevent it from
seeing an increase as commodity prices recover a bit, foreign
companies start to look at Canada and the U.S. starts to grow.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canadian banks have been ranked as the world&#8217;s soundest for
five consecutive years by the Geneva-based World Economic Forum.
They are also buying more assets, including Bank of Nova
Scotia&#8217;s agreement in August to purchase ING Groep NV&#8217;s Canadian
unit for C$3.1 billion ($3.15 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;banks are playing off the strength of their balance
sheets and expertise that we have in metals and mining,&#8221; said
Mark Chandler, the head of Canadian syndicated and leveraged
finance at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto. Canada is home to
Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX), the largest gold miner, and Potash Corp. of
Saskatchewan Inc., the biggest fertilizer producer. Commodities
are about half of Canada&#8217;s exports, government figures show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mergers Data &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural-resource and energy companies announced $202.8
billion of mergers and acquisitions in the fourth quarter,
accounting for 33 percent of the annual total, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Rosneft raised $16.8 billion in loans last month
to finance the TNK-BP acquisition, to become the world&#8217;s largest
publicly-traded crude-oil producer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loans to commodity companies in North America declined 24
percent to $317.9 billion while those in Europe, Middle East and
Africa tumbled 31 percent to $140.9 billion, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. There was an 8.7 percent drop in the Central
Asia and Pacific Rim region to $92.7 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Key Event&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A key event in 2012 was the return to stability of
funding to the commodity finance market, even if the overall
financing market volumes are down due to the pullback in metals
prices and slower global economic growth,&#8221; said Federico Turegano, the global head of natural resources and energy
finance at Societe Generale in Paris. &#8220;The big question for
2013 will be how fast the Asian markets return to purchasing
commodities, particularly China on the metals side.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China is the biggest consumer of everything from copper to
cotton to coal and it probably returned to faster economic
growth in the final three months of 2012, having slowed for
seven consecutive quarters, the mean of 35 economist estimates
compiled by Bloomberg show. Chinese banks probably will lend
more this year, with a focus on financing the nation&#8217;s commodity
cargoes, said Simon Tyler, the head of corporate banking at
China Construction Bank Ltd. in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Chinese banks are starting to compete more in the
loans space,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This year there will be much more. We
are expanding from a relatively low base, so we are not going to
be a major player yet but we will be doing a lot more.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any return of funding won&#8217;t be fully reflected in
syndicated loans, said Turegano of Societe Generale. &#8220;A huge
part of the commodity finance business is done on an uncommitted
bilateral basis, therefore undisclosed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Higher Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lending may increase this year should commodity costs
rebound. A Bloomberg survey of 131 analysts, traders and
investors last month predicted higher prices across industrial
and precious metals and agriculture. Brent crude will trade
above $100 a barrel for a third consecutive year, according to
the median of 30 estimates compiled in December. It traded at
$111.09 a barrel today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The world needs commodities,&#8221; said David Basra, the head
of debt financing for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at
Citigroup in London. &#8220;We have a growing global population, we
have growth in the emerging markets and that all puts demand on
natural resources. The requirement for liquidity and funding
remains high.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s Bing Internet

&lt;p&gt;Answers to queries on the Bing site will feature five times

Microsoft said in a statement today. Earlier this week, Facebook
unveiled its own search service, which also relies on Bing to

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, an investor in Facebook, competes with Google

&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Inyoung Hwang" date="Jan 17, 2013  9:32 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-17/mfp-s-price-says-he-wouldn-t-buy-goldman-sachs-shares.html"><headline>MFP&#8217;s Price Says He Wouldn&#8217;t Buy Goldman Sachs Shares</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;MFP Investors LLC&#8217;s Michael Price
said he wouldn&#8217;t add to his holdings in Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
at the current price because the fifth-largest U.S. bank by
assets is trading at fair value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t buy it here,&#8221; Price, said in a &#8220;Bloomberg
Surveillance&#8221; television interview with Tom Keene and Sara Eisen today. &#8220;It&#8217;s fair value.&#8221; He said, &#8220;You buy things when
people are selling and you sell when the sun is shining.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Price, who made his reputation as a value investor in the
1980s by buying shares of beaten-down lenders, owned a $4.5
million stake in Goldman Sachs, according to a September
regulatory filing. The New York-based firm rallied 4.1 percent
yesterday, the most in 10 months, after reporting quarterly
profit that beat analysts&#8217; estimates and full-year revenue grew
for the first time since 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs shares are trading at about 10 times earnings
and 1 times book value, Price said. The bank reported yesterday
that fourth-quarter earnings more than tripled to $5.60 a share,
surpassing even the highest estimate of 26 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re the smartest guys in the room,&#8221; Price said.
&#8220;When you&#8217;re looking at financials -- banks, brokers, insurance
companies -- who&#8217;s going to be smarter than Goldman? And you
don&#8217;t want to pay more than one times book and 10 times
earnings. That to me is the center point.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dell LBO &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Price doesn&#8217;t own shares of Dell Inc. (DELL), he said the
chances of a leveraged buyout for the personal-computer maker
are greater than 50 percent. The company is in discussions with
private-equity firms including Silver Lake Management LLC,
Bloomberg News reported on Jan. 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tender offer for the company could be about $14 to $15 a
share, Price said. Dell shares have surged 16 percent to $12.61
this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is the time to do it,&#8221; Price said on Dell&#8217;s
potential buyout. Hewlett-Packard Co.&#8217;s &#8220;probably too big to
do. Dell is big, but not too big, to do,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Price said he owns shares of Citigroup Inc. (C), the third-
biggest U.S. bank, and foreign-exchange broker FXCM Inc. He is
also bullish on McGraw-Hill Cos., the educational publisher and
financial services provider that is planning on splitting its
two businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Christine Harper" date="Jan 17, 2013  5:04 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-17/goldman-keeping-lid-on-pay-amid-rebound-cheers-investors.html"><headline>Goldman Keeping Lid on Pay Amid Rebound Cheers Investors</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
securities firm that set a Wall Street compensation record in
2007, is now demonstrating how little it can pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The portion of revenue allotted for salaries, bonuses,
stock awards and benefits was 38 percent in 2012, down from 42
percent a year earlier and the lowest since 2009, the company
said yesterday in a statement. The move helped the bank post a
fourth-quarter profit that beat analysts&#8217; estimates and pushed
return on equity to 10.7 percent for the year, up from 3.7
percent in 2011. The stock climbed the most in 10 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a better time to be an investor than when bonuses
are becoming ridiculous,&#8221; said Michael Vogelzang, chief
investment officer at Boston Advisors LLC, which manages $2.4
billion including Goldman Sachs shares. &#8220;You&#8217;re seeing a
massive amount of overcapacity in the business and it&#8217;s
continuing to push down the price of labor.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs still may be one of few Wall Street firms
that pay employees more for 2012 because revenue surged 19
percent and it cut staff by 3 percent. JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the
biggest U.S. bank by assets, cut total compensation expense at
its corporate and investment bank 3 percent last year as revenue
at that division rose 1 percent. The pay expense was 33 percent
of revenue for the year, down from 34 percent in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Operating Leverage&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, which is eliminating 1,600 jobs, will defer
100 percent of bonuses for some senior bankers and traders over
three years as it reins in costs, a person briefed on the matter
said earlier this week. Deutsche Bank AG is weighing 2012 bonus
cuts of as much as 20 percent for investment bankers in Europe,
while those in New York will see smaller declines, four people
briefed on the matter said this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anton Schutz, president of Rochester, New York-based Mendon
Capital Advisors, said control of expenses, which rose 1 percent
during 2012 even as revenue climbed 19 percent, is something
Goldman Sachs investors have craved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;One of the things we&#8217;ve been looking for in this space
for a long time is operating leverage,&#8221; said Schutz, whose firm
has about $150 million under management including Goldman Sachs
stock. &#8220;That&#8217;s exciting for shareholders. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s so
good for employees unless they own a lot of stock.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs rose 1.7 percent to $143.50 by 10:52
a.m. in German trading after climbing 4.1 percent yesterday in
New York to $141.09, the biggest advance since March. The shares
have gained 11 percent this year on top of a 41 percent advance
in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Market Rebound &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank derived about 70 percent of its revenue last year
from investments with the firm&#8217;s own money or trading with
clients. The performance of those businesses is often tied to
the rise or fall of asset prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stock-market rebound and a $500 million profit from
selling a hedge-fund-administration unit helped revenue recover
from the lowest first half since 2005 as the company booked its
first annual revenue gain in three years. Revenue in Investing 
Lending, the segment that includes the firm&#8217;s stakes in stocks,
bonds, real estate, private equity and hedge funds, almost
tripled last year to $5.89 billion from $2.14 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ed Najarian, an analyst at International Strategy 
Investment Group LLC, said he raised his estimates for Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s earnings per share through 2015 because he expects the
annual compensation ratio to hold below 40 percent. He kept a
neutral rating on the stock because he expects gains from
private-equity and debt holdings to be lower this year and
predicts regulations will limit trading revenue, according to a
research note yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reinsurance Business &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said yesterday that $1.08 billion of the
firm&#8217;s $8.2 billion of equity trading revenue was from the
bank&#8217;s reinsurance business, marking the first time that the
company disclosed revenue from that segment. The firm is
considering selling a majority stake in that unit, said Harvey M. Schwartz, who will replace Chief Financial Officer David A. Viniar, 57, at the end of this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank still doesn&#8217;t have enough information on proposed
regulatory changes to give a target for future return on equity,
Schwartz, 48, said on a conference call with investors. The 10.7
percent figure for 2012 was &#8220;not particularly aspirational,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;We&#8217;d like to do better.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central bank policies have boosted asset prices, and that&#8217;s
likely to continue to contribute to higher profits at firms like
Goldman Sachs, said Boston Advisors&#8217; Vogelzang. He said he
expects the bank&#8217;s return on equity to reach the &#8220;mid-teens.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The way we view the ROE target is this is a very cyclical
business, highly dependent on capital markets,&#8221; Vogelzang said.
&#8220;Our outlook for particularly the U.S. equity markets is quite
strong, and they&#8217;re going to be levered to that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Better Balance &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 58, has
undertaken a $1.9 billion expense-reduction effort since mid-
2011. That helped reduce the compensation ratio, which was part
of an effort to strike a better balance between rewarding
employees and shareholders, Schwartz told analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This year we hope we got the balance right,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank employed 32,400 people as of Dec. 31, 900 fewer
than the end of 2011. It allocated $12.9 billion for
compensation, up from $12.2 billion in 2011. That averages
$399,506 per employee. While that&#8217;s up from $367,057 in 2011,
it&#8217;s 40 percent less than the $661,490 average for 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s a reflection of how much the market has changed,
Vogelzang said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a very interesting case study in the supply-demand
equation for high wage-earning, white-collar workers,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve certainly seen it in manufacturing, we&#8217;ve seen it in
lower-level services, but we&#8217;re now seeing it at places like
Goldman and Morgan Stanley. (MS)&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baltimore Orioles manager Buck Showalter, who directed the franchise to its most wins in 15
years and a playoff spot last year, was given a contract
extension through 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan Duquette, the Orioles&#8217; executive vice president of
baseball operations, received a similar extension, the Major
League Baseball team said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Showalter, 56, has accumulated a 196-185 record since
joining the Orioles during the 2010 season. Baltimore&#8217;s
appearance in the 2012 playoffs was its first since 1997. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 1, Showalter became the 58th manager in major league
history to win 1,000 games. He enters the 2013 season ranked
49th on the career list with 1,078 wins and is sixth among
active managers. He also has managed the Texas Rangers, Arizona
Diamondbacks and the New York Yankees in 1992-95. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duquette, 54, has spent 11 seasons as general manager with
the Montreal Expos, Boston Red Sox and Orioles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Chris Dolmetsch" date="Jan 18, 2013  7:02 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-18/ex-goldman-sachs-programmer-seeks-dismissal-of-n-y-charges-1-.html"><headline>Ex-Goldman Sachs Programmer Seeks End of N.Y. Prosecution</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;A former Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
programmer who won reversal of a federal conviction for stealing
internal code from the bank asked a New York judge to dismiss
state charges against him based on the same allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a hearing today in New York State Supreme Court in
Manhattan, Kevin Marino, an attorney for Sergey Aleynikov, asked
Justice Ronald Zweibel to dismiss the charges, arguing that
Aleynikov had the right to copy the code and that the charges
are barred by the state&#8217;s double-jeopardy statute as well as the
Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov, 42, was charged in August by the Manhattan
District Attorney&#8217;s Office and indicted the following month on
two counts of unlawful use of scientific material and one count
of unlawful duplication of computer-related material. He has
pleaded not guilty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The reality is Sergey Aleynikov has suffered enough,&#8221;
Marino said in court. &#8220;He has been punished enough.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Russia, was
freed from federal prison in New Jersey in February after a U.S.
appeals court reversed his December 2010 conviction for stealing
the bank&#8217;s trading code, saying the two laws that prosecutors
used to charge Aleynikov -- the National Stolen Property Act and
the Economic Espionage Act -- didn&#8217;t apply to his case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;June 2009 &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors claimed that, on his last day of work
at New York-based Goldman Sachs in June 2009, Aleynikov uploaded
hundreds of thousands of lines of source code from the firm&#8217;s
high-frequency trading system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov, a vice president in the bank&#8217;s Global Equities
Division until June 30, 2009, was part of a team responsible for
developing and improving source code related to high-frequency
trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York prosecutors have said that while the federal
appellate judges ruled Aleynikov&#8217;s conduct didn&#8217;t constitute a
federal crime, they suggested it could be a violation of state
law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While New York&#8217;s statute on previous prosecutions is
broader than the double-jeopardy protection provided by the
state and U.S. constitutions, it isn&#8217;t unlimited and the case
falls within one of the rules that allows for successive
prosecutions, prosecutors said in court papers responding to
Marino&#8217;s bid to dismiss the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Same Acts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. courts have held that a federal prosecution doesn&#8217;t
bar a subsequent state prosecution of the same person for the
same acts under the principle of dual sovereignty, prosecutors
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York prosecutors argued that they weren&#8217;t a party to
the federal case and had no relationship to anyone who was. They
said the jury and the judges in the federal case found beyond a
reasonable doubt that Aleynikov had misappropriated computer
data and that the prosecution failed only because of elements
irrelevant to the state case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Marino argued that the state wouldn&#8217;t have prosecuted
the case without the encouragement from the FBI and federal
prosecutors, Aleynikov can&#8217;t &#8220;seriously suppose&#8221; that the
Manhattan District Attorney&#8217;s Office would have declined to
prosecute if the victim had contacted it first, according to the
response. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In every case, the prosecutors rely not on bombast but on
evidence,&#8221; Chief Assistant District Attorney Daniel R. Alonso
said in a statement. &#8220;The Second Circuit reversed the
defendant&#8217;s conviction on federal jurisdictional grounds in the
face of insistent arguments by this same lawyer that the case
was a quintessential state crime. We look forward to proceeding
with the case.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Broader Scope &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama signed a measure on Dec. 28
broadening the scope of the Economic Espionage Act to include
services intended for use in commerce beyond state lines,
including computer source codes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1996 law had applied only to products made specifically
for use in interstate or foreign commerce, such as manufactured
goods. It was broadened to apply to cases such as Aleynikov&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marino said his client has lost his life savings, his
marriage, his home, his job, his reputation and his opportunity
to work in his chosen field. Aleynikov has already served more
than a year in federal prison for the conduct he is being
accused of, Marino said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a word for this prosecution, your honor,&#8221;
Marino said. &#8220;It&#8217;s inhuman.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zweibel adjourned the case until Feb. 15 for a decision,
although the judge said he may rule before then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is New York v. Aleynikov, 04447-2012, New
York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). The New Jersey case is
Aleynikov v. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), 12-cv-05994, U.S.
District Court, District of New Jersey (Newark). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, plans to consolidate its electronic trading
system for corporate bonds with other asset classes in the early
part of this year as lenders seek to adapt to regulatory changes
and reduce costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re trying to figure out how our customers would like
to execute,&#8221; Scott Wacker, the London-based head of FX Sales
EMEA at JPMorgan, said today in a telephone interview. &#8220;Our
target is the end of the first quarter, maybe into the second
quarter that we intend to start to offer the ability to execute
online for fixed-income products.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the most-active underwriter of dollar-denominated
debt, is beginning the effort as Wall Street&#8217;s biggest banks
have pared their corporate-bond inventories by 76 percent since
the 2007 peak with new risk-curbing regulations forcing them to
reduce their roles as market makers. Firms are capitulating to
the growing use of electronic systems to broker bonds that
traditionally were bought and sold over the counter with traders
as middlemen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clients are already using the web-based platform, JP Morgan
Markets, for purposes including trading currencies and commodity
futures and accessing research, according to Wacker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Citigroup Inc., the third-biggest U.S. bank by
assets, announced the start of an electronic bond-trading
service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. spent a year developing an
electronic trading system for corporate bonds called GSessions
that started operating in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The profitability of Wall Street firms is being challenged
by regulations requiring that they hold more capital as a buffer
against potential losses from assets such as corporate debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holdings of company debt at the 21 primary dealers that
trade with the Federal Reserve shrank 74 percent to $56.4
billion as of Jan. 9 from the end of 2007, according to the
Federal Reserve. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Iger, chairman and chief
executive officer of Walt Disney Co. (DIS), collected $40.2 million in
total compensation last fiscal year, based on regulatory
reporting rules, a 20 percent increase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger&#8217;s pay included $2.5 million in salary, $9.53 million
in stock awards, $7.75 million in option awards and a bonus of
$16.5 million, according a regulatory filing today. A change in
the value of his pension plan and other compensation added
almost $4 million more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increase came in a fiscal year when shares of Burbank,
California-based Disney returned 76 percent including dividends,
compared with 30 percent for the SP 500 index. Iger, 61, also
took on the added role of chairman. Walt Disney&#8217;s profit rose 18
percent to $5.68 billion in the year ended Sept. 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s largest entertainment company, will
hold its annual meeting March 6 in Phoenix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At last year&#8217;s meeting 57 percent of shareholders supported
the company&#8217;s executive pay plan, down from 77 percent the year
before. In today&#8217;s filing, Disney said the vote &#8220;fell below our
expectations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company reconfigured its bonus terms after management
and the chairwoman of the compensation committee met with the
largest shareholders, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the previous plan allowed management to collect 100
percent of their bonuses even if shareholder returns were weak,
the new plan bases awards equally on stock performance and
earnings, according to the filing. The company said 92 percent
of Iger&#8217;s targeted compensation is performance based. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connecticut Retirement Plans  Trust Funds is proposing at
the annual meeting that investors vote to split the chairman and
CEO roles in the future, according to today&#8217;s filing. Disney&#8217;s
board opposes that plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney fell 0.1 percent to $52.34 at the close in New York.
It has gained 5.1 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Financiero Santander Mexico
SAB (SANMEXB), the Mexican unit of Spain&#8217;s biggest bank, had its biggest
two-day slide in three months after JPMorgan Chase  Co. said
earnings growth is slowing and cut its rating on the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares have tumbled 9.4 percent in the past two days to
40.19 pesos at 1:11 p.m. in Mexico City, the lowest in a month.
The stock is down 11 percent from a record 45.15 on Jan 14.
Santander Mexico fell 3.8 percent today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan analyst Saul Martinez wrote in a Jan. 16 report
that he expects the Mexico City-based company&#8217;s earnings growth
to slow &#8220;to the single-digit range as cost pressure mounts and,
eventually, tax rates rise.&#8221; He cut his rating on the stock to
the equivalent of sell from neutral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some investors took the JPMorgan report as a signal to
lock-in gains, according to Martin Lara, a Mexico City-based
analyst with Corp. Actinver SAB, who has a hold recommendation
on the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That was an excuse for everybody to take profits,&#8221; Lara
said in a telephone interview. &#8220;If it continues to fall it&#8217;s a
good long-term investment opportunity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Completing Dodd-Frank rules,
including those governing cross-border swaps, tops the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s agenda this year, SEC
Chairman Elisse Walter said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2010 Dodd-Frank overhaul of financial regulation
required the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to
draft rules to increase transparency in the swaps market. The
SEC&#8217;s rules would address the overseas reach of regulations
governing security-based swaps. The agencies missed a July 2011
deadline to complete most of their Dodd-Frank regulations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter said finishing Dodd-Frank rules would lead her
agenda as the commission, divided between two Democrats and two
Republicans, tries to move forward under her leadership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That is what is first on the agenda and really stands as
the most important thing we have to do as a prelude to adopting
anything else,&#8221; Walter told the SEC&#8217;s Investor Advisory
Committee today in Washington. &#8220;We will put that out for robust
public comment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter described the swap rules as &#8220;the critical
linchpin&#8221; of Dodd-Frank because of the &#8220;global nature of the
market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until Dodd-Frank was enacted in 2010, swaps were largely
unregulated, often uncleared and traded directly between banks
and other consumers of derivatives. Dodd-Frank requires traders
including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) to
have most swaps cleared and traded on exchanges or swap-
execution facilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Timetable &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter declined to say when the commission would propose
the rules. She also said she would prioritize rules required by
the so-called JOBS Act, which sought to ease access to capital
for startup firms and small businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC in August proposed a rule mandated by the 2012
measure to lift a ban on mass marketing by hedge funds and other
private offerings. Some consumer groups want Walter to add
investor protections to a final rule, including a means to
verify that that investors are sophisticated enough to
participate in private offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC&#8217;s two Republican commissioners have said the ban
should be lifted without imposing new restraints. Democratic
Commissioner Luis A. Aguilar voted against the August proposal
over concerns that it opened up vulnerabilities for investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chairman Walter is on the hot seat,&#8221; said Barbara Roper,
director of investor protection for the Consumer Federation of
America. &#8220;She&#8217;s going to make someone really angry no matter
what she does.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter said the commission would lift the ban and was still
considering the details of a final rule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Once a statute is passed, we will carry it out,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;It is not our job to undo congressional
determinations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LEG Immobilien AG, the apartment
landlord owned by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), plans to raise as
much as 1.4 billion euros ($1.9 billion) in an initial public
offering poised to be the largest by a German property company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LEG will sell as many as 30.5 million shares for 41 euros
to 47 euros each, the Dusseldorf-based company said in a
statement today. That&#8217;s 57.5 percent of LEG&#8217;s shares. The stock
will begin trading in Frankfurt on Feb. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which bought the company for about 3.5
billion euros including debt in 2008, is seeking to profit from
a boom in German residential real estate. The FTSE EPRA/Nareit
index of German property stocks has gained 38 percent in the
past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;An investment in LEG shares offers the opportunity to
invest in a large pure-play residential property company with
high growth,&#8221; LEG Chief Executive Officer Thomas Hegel said in
the statement. &#8220;In order to achieve future growth, we
constantly screen the market for potential acquisitions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LEG owns 91,000 apartments in North Rhine-Westphalia,
Germany&#8217;s most populous state. Goldman Sachs&#8217; Whitehall Street
Real Estate fund holds about 95 percent of the company. Perry
Capital owns the rest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offer period for the IPO will run from Jan. 21 to Jan.
31. Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) will be lead managers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Guy Hands &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Annington Immobilien AG, Germany&#8217;s largest owner
of apartments, also plans an IPO this year. Annington,
controlled by Guy Hands&#8217; Terra Firma Capital Partners Ltd., has
about 186,000 homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the share sale, LEG will be Germany&#8217;s second-largest
publicly traded residential landlord by properties with 91,000
apartments. The biggest is Gagfah SA (GFJ), controlled by Fortress
Investment Group LLC (FIG), which has about 145,000 apartments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LEG&#8217;s profit from its main business of renting apartments
was 243 million euros in 2011 and its funds from operations were
111.8 million euros, according to its last annual report. FFO
measures a property company&#8217;s ability to generate cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By comparison, Gagfah generated a rental profit of 419.6
million euros in 2011 and its FFO was 159.5 million euros,
according to its annual report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Active Investor &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is one of the most active foreign investors
in the German real estate market. In April 2011, Whitehall
Street and Cerberus Capital Management LP raised 468 million
euros in an IPO of Berlin-based residential landlord GSW
Immobilien AG. (GIB) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitehall Street also made an unsuccessful bid to buy
Baubecon, the residential property portfolio that Barclays Plc (BARC)
agreed to sell to Deutsche Wohnen AG (DWNI) in May in a deal valued at
1.24 billion euros. Whitehall Street agreed to sell its stake in
17 German department stores, including Kaufhaus des Westens, the
country&#8217;s largest, in December. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corn traders are the most bullish in
seven weeks as forecasts for the smallest stockpiles relative to
demand since 1974 prompted the longest rally in a year and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to predict near-record prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eighteen analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect futures to
gain next week and six were bearish. A further five were
neutral, making the proportion of bulls the highest since Nov.
30. Global consumption will exceed output for the second time in
three years after drought from Europe to the U.S. parched crops,
the U.S. Department of Agriculture says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grain rose for eight successive days to $7.3125 a
bushel by Jan. 16 as the USDA said global inventories by Sept.
30 will be 1.4 percent lower than previously expected and,
relative to consumption, the smallest since 1974. Prices had
slumped for five weeks and hedge funds cut bets on a rally by 59
percent since December on expectations that South American
harvests in the first half of the year would boost supply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re going to see a destocking in the world of grains
and products, and everyone is going to finish the season very
tight,&#8221; said Chris Gadd, an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. in
London. &#8220;Prices need to go to $8 a bushel at least in the
second quarter to do the job of slowing down demand.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Corn Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corn rose 4 percent to $7.26 on the Chicago Board of Trade
this month, extending last year&#8217;s 8 percent advance. Prices will
jump 14 percent to $8.25 in three months, 2.8 percent below the
Aug. 10 record, Goldman said Jan. 13. The Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI
gauge of 24 commodities gained 1.8 percent since the start of
January and the MSCI All-Country World Index (MXWD) of equities
increased 3.3 percent. Treasuries lost 0.5 percent, a Bank of
America Corp. index shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World stockpiles will drop 12 percent to a six-year low of
115.99 million metric tons by October, the USDA said Jan. 11.
Inventories in the U.S., the top grower and exporter, slid 17
percent from a year earlier to 8.03 billion bushels (204 million
tons) on Dec. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supplies dwindled as dry weather curbed yields, boosting
prices to a record $8.49 in August. There was still moderate to
exceptional drought across 53 percent of a nine-state Midwest
region by Jan. 15, the U.S. Drought Monitor showed. U.S. corn
planting begins in April. The International Grains Council said
yesterday that global output will drop 3.6 percent to 845
million tons in the 2012-13 crop year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Livestock Feed &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slump in prices to a six-month low on Jan. 7 may boost
demand for livestock feed. The USDA said domestic meat and
poultry production this year, as well as feed consumption, will
be bigger than previously expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds and other speculators cut bullish bets for five
consecutive weeks and held a net-long position of 115,113
futures and options by Jan. 8, the least since June 26, U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. Futures for
delivery in September, just before the next Northern Hemisphere
harvest, are trading at $6.12 in Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some growing nations may bolster supply. The USDA raised
its forecast for Argentina&#8217;s harvest by 1.8 percent to a record
28 million tons. Brazil, the third-biggest shipper, after the
U.S. and Argentina, will reap 71 million tons, about 1 million
tons more than the agency had predicted in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. export sales of corn in the four weeks though Jan. 10
were 68 percent lower than in the same period a year earlier,
the USDA said yesterday. The London-based IGC expects corn
consumption to drop 1.1 percent this year to 865 million tons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Grain Stockpiles &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costlier crops may curb demand from biofuel producers. U.S.
ethanol production fell to 784,000 barrels a day in the week
ended Jan. 11, the lowest since the Department of Energy began
compiling the data in June 2010. Stockpiles are up 14 percent
since reaching a 10-month low in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More U.S. output and bigger harvests in China and Europe
are needed to ease the mounting concern about supply, said
Liliana Balbi, a senior economist at the United Nations&#8217; Food 
Agriculture Organization. An index of the cost of 55 food items
tracked by the Rome-based FAO slipped for a third month in
December, falling 1.1 percent. The gauge is still 6.7 percent
above the five-year average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other commodities, 17 of 30 people surveyed anticipate
higher soybeans prices next week and nine said the oilseed will
drop, while 17 of 28 said wheat will gain and seven expect a
retreat. Soybeans rose 1.1 percent to $14.245 a bushel in
Chicago this year as wheat added 1 percent to $7.86 a bushel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nine of 17 surveyed expect raw sugar to fall next week and
seven predicted a gain. The commodity slid 5.4 percent to 18.45
cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Metal Exchange &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixteen people surveyed said copper will rise next week,
seven predicted a drop and five were neutral. The metal for
delivery in three months, the London Metal Exchange&#8217;s benchmark
contract, increased 1.7 percent to $8,067.25 a ton this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nineteen of 33 traders and analysts surveyed said gold
would advance next week and 10 were bearish. Bullion rose 0.8
percent to $1,688.15 an ounce in London this year after
advancing the previous 12 years, the longest run of gains in at
least nine decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP GSCI gauge of raw materials climbed for five
straight weeks through Jan. 11, the best run since September,
and global equities reached a 20-month high this week. The U.S.
economy picked up across much of the country last month, boosted
by auto and home sales, the Federal Reserve said Jan. 16.
China&#8217;s economy expanded for the first time in two years in the
fourth quarter and will accelerate this quarter and next,
according to as many as 36 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Economic data out of the U.S. and China has surprised to
the upside and that&#8217;s increased economic optimism,&#8221; said
Carsten Fritsch, an analyst at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt.
&#8220;There&#8217;s still potential for further gains from here. China is
the most important consumer of commodities and the most
important driver of growth in demand.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s $6.2 billion
trading loss last year is little more than a fading memory for
bondholders who awarded the lender its cheapest U.S. borrowing
costs ever at a debt sale yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. bank by assets sold $6 billion of
securities, including $2.75 billion of 10-year notes with an
unprecedented 3.2 percent coupon, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The extra yield investors demanded to hold those
securities rather than government debt was 56 basis points
tighter than where average comparable JPMorgan spreads traded
before the scandal came to light in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s bond offering came a day after it reported a
record profit for the third straight year even after posting the
trading gaffe at the hands of an employee known as the London
Whale. Aided by rising loan demand in a recovering economy, the
New York-based bank boosted mortgage fees and related revenue
almost threefold to $2.03 billion in the fourth quarter. The
trading losses are close to being a &#8220;non-issue&#8221; Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Having the capacity to brush away a whale-sized problem
and still be able to generate such significant earnings should
make a bondholder sleep well at night,&#8221; Joel Levington,
managing director of corporate credit for Brookfield Investment
Management Inc. in New York, which manages $150 billion, said in
an e-mail. The lender &#8220;should generate north of $21 billion in
profit annually for the next few years. That profile is highly
unlikely to experience near-term default concerns.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Record Coupon &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s three-part debt sale was its biggest in the U.S.
since the lender issued $7.2 billion of bonds in April 2011,
Bloomberg data show. The bank sold $1.25 billion of five-year
notes at its record low coupon of 1.8 percent to yield 103 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, and $2 billion of
five-year, floating-rate bonds at 90 basis points more than the
London interbank offered rate. The 10-year portion had a spread
of 133 basis points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average spreads on 10-year, A rated JPMorgan bonds plunged
to 140 basis points Jan. 16, down from 243 basis points on May
18, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data, a
week after Fitch Ratings cut the bank&#8217;s debt as a result of the
trading loss. That compares with 189 basis points on March 26,
before reports of the credit-derivative trades surfaced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tasha Pelio, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan in New York,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Solid Position&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank earned $21.3 billion in net income last year on
improving credit quality, according to Kathleen Shanley, a bond
analyst at New York-based researcher Gimme Credit LLC. A
provision for credit losses declined by more than half to $3.4
billion from $7.6 billion in 2011, Shanley wrote yesterday in a
report. It&#8217;s the third straight year the lender has earned at
least $15 billion in profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They continue to be a very solid position for a lot of
fixed-income investors,&#8221; Marc Pinto, head of corporate bond
strategy at Susquehanna International Group LLP, said in a
telephone interview from New York. &#8220;They continue to perform
extremely well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan first disclosed the trading losses on May 10,
after Dimon initially dismissed concern as a &#8220;tempest in a
teapot&#8221; the month before. London-based trader Bruno Iksil, who
worked in the chief investment office, built up positions in
credit derivatives so large he was nicknamed the London Whale.
The bank released a 129-page report Jan. 16 that blamed managers
for roles in failing to halt the loss, as well as an &#8220;error
prone&#8221; risk-modeling system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Biggest Loss &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s shares fell 9.3 percent May 11, the biggest drop
in nine months, after JPMorgan estimated its trading losses at
$2 billion. Fitch reduced the firm&#8217;s long-term default rating to
A+ from AA- the same day, following the close of trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost to protect JPMorgan debt from losses for five
years climbed 21 basis points to 132.5 basis points after the
disclosure, Bloomberg prices show. Those credit-default swaps
traded at 78.5 basis points at 11:26 a.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDS prices typically fall when investor confidence improves
and rise when it deteriorates. A basis point equals $1,000
annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re five years on from the beginning of the financial
crisis and investors have now recognized that many banks have
increased their capital dramatically, non-performing loans have
come down or their asset quality has improved dramatically,&#8221;
Pinto said. &#8220;They&#8217;re much more comfortable investing today in
bank paper.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bank Spreads &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lender set aside $656 million in provisions against
future mortgage loan losses, compared with an average estimate
by analysts of about $1.5 billion, according to a Jan. 16
earnings statement. Mortgage fees and related revenue increased
to $2.03 billion in the fourth quarter from $723 million a year
earlier as the unemployment rate fell to 7.8 percent, indicating
a strengthening economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gap between spreads on investment-grade bank bonds and
the broader high-grade market reached the narrowest level in
more than five years, when relative yields on bank debt dropped
to 154 basis points, or 9 basis points more than corporates, on
Jan. 7, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Everything is driven by what the Fed is doing,&#8221; said Pri de Silva, a bank analyst at New York-based CreditSights Inc.,
&#8220;Banks are opportunistically locking in the lower rates.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Reserve has held interest rates near
record lows for an unprecedented fifth straight year, pushing
investors to riskier assets in the search for yield. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The CIO fiasco blemished JPMorgan&#8217;s previously stellar
reputation as a savvy risk control manager,&#8221; wrote Gimme
Credit&#8217;s Shanley, who rates the bank&#8217;s debt a buy. &#8220;Jamie Dimon
is no doubt glad to bid farewell to the year of the London
Whale.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patent dispute settlements including
so-called pay-for-delay deals between branded and generic drug
companies jumped to 40 in the year ended in September from 28
the previous year, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreements, the most since the agency began collecting
data in 2003, involved 31 different brand-name drugs with
combined sales of more than $8.3 billion, the FTC said yesterday
in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 40 settlements, almost half involved agreements by
the branded firm not to market a so-called authentic generic
that would compete with the generic company&#8217;s product, the FTC
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This year&#8217;s report makes it clear that the problem of
pay-for-delay is getting worse, not better,&#8221; FTC Chairman Jon
Leibowitz said in the statement. &#8220;Until this issue is resolved,
we will all suffer the consequences of delayed generic entry --
higher prices for consumers, businesses and the U.S. taxpayer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By delaying the entry of cheaper generics into the market,
pay-for-delay deals cost Americans $3.5 billion annually, the
FTC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FTC has challenged several patent settlements in court,
contending that they are anticompetitive and violate U.S.
antitrust laws. One case, involving a generic testosterone
treatment called Androgel, is pending before the U.S. Supreme
Court. The agency also has supported legislation in Congress
that would restrict pay-for-delay settlements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DuPont Shareholder Sues Managers Over $1 Billion Court Loss &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A DuPont Co. (DD) shareholder sued company directors and Chief
Executive Officer Ellen Kullman, claiming mismanagement of the
seed business led to a $1 billion judgment that threatens to
wipe out the company&#8217;s cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a complaint filed Jan. 16 in U.S. District Court in
Wilmington, Delaware, shareholder Robert Zomolosky asked a judge
to force Kullman and the board to pay any damages stemming from
DuPont&#8217;s loss of a patent lawsuit involving Monsanto Co. (MON)&#8217;s weed
killer, Roundup. The jury award, the third-biggest last year,
could grow to $3 billion depending on future legal rulings,
according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent case grew out of the company&#8217;s effort to compete
with Monsanto&#8217;s Roundup Ready crop business, which held 90
percent of the market for soybean and cotton seeds as of 2008,
according to the lawsuit. Because DuPont&#8217;s research wasn&#8217;t
producing results, company managers used Monsanto&#8217;s technology
to try to create seeds that could resist Roundup, a key
requirement for farmers, Zomolosky claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wilmington-based company plans to appeal the jury&#8217;s
verdict, according to the complaint, and has asked the judge to
overturn the award. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DuPont&#8217;s General Counsel Thomas L. Sager said in an e-mail
statement that the company handled the Monsanto patent case
appropriately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are confident in the appropriateness of all our
actions and the points raised in this lawsuit are simply a
repetition of those we have repeatedly addressed in the course
of the Monsanto litigation,&#8221; Sager said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During that patent lawsuit, U.S. District Judge Richard Webber ruled that DuPont &#8220;knowingly perpetrated a fraud against
the court,&#8221; by lying in court and to investors about its right
to use Monsanto&#8217;s seed technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shareholder complaint, filed on behalf of the company
as a so-called derivative lawsuit, seeks a jury trial, corporate
governance improvements and unspecified damages from directors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Zomolosky v. Kullman, 13-cv-00094, U.S.
District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Seeks Patent on &#8216;Inconspicuous Mode&#8217; Phone Technology &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., (MSFT) the world&#8217;s largest software company, has
applied for a U.S. patent on a technology that could make the
use of a mobile phone less conspicuous in dark rooms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Application 20130012270, published in the database of the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Jan. 10, is for what the
Redmond, Washington-based company calls &#8220;inconspicuous mode for
mobile devices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the application, the technology permits the
adjustment of brightness and contrast to be less conspicuous,
either by an adjustment initiated by the user or by sensors
detecting environmental conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft says that with mobile devices now having the
capacity to perform many different functions, sometimes they are
used in settings where others may be disturbed by a bright
display, such as a bedroom, boardroom or movie theater. Also,
the home screen of the device, when operating in the
inconspicuous mode, would be less obtrusive than when in normal
operation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software company applied for this patent in July 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;T.J. Maxx, Harris Tweed Authority Settle Trademark Dispute &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TJX Cos. (TJX)&#8217; T.J. Maxx unit and the authority governing the
use of the &#8220;Harris Tweed&#8221; standards have settled a trademark
dispute, the Scotsman newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Harris Tweed Authority complained that the Framingham,
Massachusetts-based off-price retailer promoted and sold
garments that weren&#8217;t made in accord with the standards required
for the use of the mark, according to the Scotsman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulations for the use of the name require that the fabric
be hand-woven of pure virgin wool dyed and spun in Scotland&#8217;s
Outer Hebrides and woven in at-home workshops by island
residents, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terms of the settlement weren&#8217;t disclosed, according to the
Scotsman. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pennsylvanian Pleads Guilty to Hockey Broadcast Infringement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Pennsylvania resident pleaded guilty to criminal
copyright infringement related to broadcasts of hockey games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Moore, 45, of Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, admitted
copying and selling recordings of hockey games and other hockey-
related material. He did so through his www.HDHockey.Tv,
according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s office in
Philadelphia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He sold the DVDs for $19.99, and also operated a website --
www.BroadStreetBully.com -- through which subscribers could
download video clips of copyrighted television broadcasts of
hockey games and related material. This included broadcasts of
an Olympic Games hockey match and National Hockey League games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Bureau of Investigation raided Moore&#8217;s house in
2008 and seized more than 2,000 unauthorized videotapes, as well
as commercial-grade equipment for copying the tapes to DVDs. He
also had equipment to record satellite broadcasts and to copy
multiple DVDs at a time, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moore is set for sentencing April 15, according to court
filings. He faces a potential maximum sentence of five years in
prison, a fine of as much as $250,000, and has agreed to forfeit
some of the seized items and $155,612 in proceeds from his
business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S.A. v. Moore, 2:11-cr-00666, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Advanced Micro Devices Sues Ex-Employees Over Trade Secrets &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD), a maker of processors for
personal computers, accused ex-employees in a lawsuit of taking
&#8220;sensitive&#8221; company documents when they went to work for
competing chipmaker Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former employees transferred more than 100,000
electronic files pertaining to its graphics business in the days
before they left the company, Advanced Micro said in a filing
dated Jan. 14 in federal court in Boston. The employees also
recruited other AMD workers to leave, the company claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is an extraordinary case of trade secret
transfer/misappropriation and strategic employee solicitation,&#8221;
Sunnyvale, California-based Advanced Micro said in the
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documents included confidential information on
licensing agreements with significant customers, proposed
strategies concerning licensing and technical information about
new products and processes the company is developing, the
company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Timothy Hillman issued a temporary
restraining order requiring the defendants to preserve all
copies of AMD materials and computer storage devices and to
refrain from disclosing confidential AMD information and
attempting to hire any AMD employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Mee, a lawyer for the four defendants, said he had no
immediate comment. Bob Sherbin, a spokesman for Santa Clara,
California-based Nvidia, said the company doesn&#8217;t comment on
pending litigation. Nvidia isn&#8217;t a defendant in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three of the former employees -- Robert Feldstein, Manoo
Desai and Nicolas Kociuk -- transferred secret files to storage
devices, according to the complaint. Feldstein, Desai and a
fourth defendant, Richard Hagen, violated agreements not to
solicit other employees for a period of time after leaving the
company, AMD claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They all worked at AMD&#8217;s site in Boxborough, Massachusetts,
according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanced Micro asked for monetary damages and a permanent
injunction to prevent disclosures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Advanced Micro Devices v. Feldstein, 13-40007,
U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts (Boston). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;RIM Patents Anti-Espionage Technology for Mobile Devices &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM), the Canadian maker of the
BlackBerry mobile device, received a U.S. patent that may make
it more difficult to use cameras in mobile phones to commit
industrial espionage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to patent 8,346,072, the technology would make it
impossible to shoot a photo using the mobile device unless the
device has been focused steadily on the subject for a
predetermined length of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of this restriction is to make the process of
taking the photo more conspicuous and thus more readily
detected. Additionally, boundaries and restrictions could be
communicated to the device as part of an information technology
policy, according to the patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIM said that while consumers enjoy using cameras embedded
in their mobile phones and other hand-held devices, &#8220;many
corporations and governmental agencies are wary of small
portable cameras.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portable cameras can be used to take photos of confidential
documents, which may then be stored and transmitted wirelessly,
and confidential material &#8220;can be improperly divulged and/or
used for improper purposes,&#8221; according to the patent. The
&#8220;ubiquitous presence of handheld communication devices in the
business environment makes it difficult for businesses to
control their use,&#8221; RIM said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embedded cameras could be configured so they couldn&#8217;t shoot
photos in specific geographic areas, or they wouldn&#8217;t take and
record a photo unless they had been held in a steady position
for as long as 10 seconds, according to the patent. RIM says
that with these time limits, surveillance procedures would be
more likely to identify unauthorized photos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Canadian company applied for the patent in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Ellen Rosen" date="Jan 18, 2013 12:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-18/debevoise-goodwin-procter-norton-rose-business-of-law.html"><headline>Debevoise, Goodwin Procter, Norton Rose: Business of Law</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Mary Jo White, the former U.S.
attorney in Manhattan, is under consideration to become the next
chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, three people
with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White, now a partner at Debevoise  Plimpton LLP in New
York, would succeed Elisse Walter, who took over as SEC chairman
last month, said the people, who asked not to be named because
the matter isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choice of White, who was known as a no-nonsense
prosecutor, would be a departure for the agency, which has
tended to be run by lawyers steeped in financial policy making
and the securities industry. Her relative inexperience in those
areas, along with her work defending corporate clients including
Ken Lewis, the former chief executive officer of Bank of America
Corp. (BAC), is likely to draw fire from some lawmakers and advocates
for investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York from
1993 to 2002, White became a leading terrorism prosecutor,
winning the conviction of four followers of Osama bin Laden for
the 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa. Under her
direction, prosecutors won convictions for the 1993 World Trade
Center bombing and a failed plot to blow up the United Nations
headquarters and other New York landmarks. During that time, she
supervised Robert Khuzami, the SEC&#8217;s outgoing enforcement
director, and George Canellos, his deputy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC spokesman John Nester declined to comment on her
possible nomination. White didn&#8217;t respond to an e-mail seeking
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White&#8217;s husband, John W. White, was head of the SEC&#8217;s
division of corporation finance, which is responsible for
disclosure policies, under Republican SEC chairman Christopher Cox from 2006 to 2008. He&#8217;s now a partner at law firm Cravath
Swaine  Moore LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In the Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lawyer Sues San Antonio Spurs After Starters Skipped Miami Game &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fan of the Miami Heat basketball team is suing the San
Antonio Spurs because four of their starters didn&#8217;t play in the
team&#8217;s Nov. 29 game in Miami. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his complaint filed in state court in Miami, Lawrence
McGuinness, a partner at McGuinness  Gonzales PA in Miami,
accused Spurs coach Gregg Popovich of inflicting economic
damages on fans who attended the game. The San Antonio Express-
News first reported the suit Jan. 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, which seeks class-action status, asks the
Spurs to refund the difference between premium tickets charged
for more popular games and lower-priced tickets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Spurs were fined $250,000 by the National Basketball
Association a day after the players missed the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NBA said in an e-mailed release Dec. 1 that the move
violated league policy &#8220;against resting players in a manner
contrary to the best interests of the NBA.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the players pulled from the lineup and sent back to
San Antonio were 36-year-old Tim Duncan, 30-year-old Tony Parker
and 35-year-old Manu Ginobili. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom James, the senior director of communications for the
Spurs, declined to comment on the litigation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Harry Winston Says Ekati Investor Files Suit to Block BHP Sale &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harry Winston Diamond Corp. (HW) said a holder of 10 percent of
the Ekati diamond mine sued to block the company&#8217;s proposed
acquisition of BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)&#8217;s 80 percent stake in the
Canadian operation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C. Fipke Holdings Ltd. alleged in an action in Ontario
Superior Court of Justice that offers made by BHP to Fipke
didn&#8217;t comply with Fipke&#8217;s rights under joint-venture agreements
for Ekati, Toronto-based Harry Winston said in a statement. The
suit also names Harry Winston, Stewart Blusson, who is another
minority owner, and Blusson-controlled Archon Minerals Ltd. (ACS),
according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harry Winston said Nov. 13 it had agreed to pay about $500
million for Melbourne-based BHP&#8217;s interests in the diamond mine
as well as gem marketing operations. Minority shareholders held
pre-emptive rights to purchase BHP&#8217;s stake in the mine within 60
days in the event of a sale, BHP said in a separate statement on
Nov. 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chuck Fipke and Blusson discovered the Ekati deposit in the
Northwest Territories in 1991. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harry Winston and BHP believe that the claim by C. Fipke,
known as Fipco, &#8220;is entirely without merit, and intend to
vigorously defend the action in order to proceed with the
purchase and sale of the Ekati Mine,&#8221; Harry Winston said in the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fipke didn&#8217;t immediately return a call for comment outside
of regular business hours. The filing couldn&#8217;t be immediately
confirmed in court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe that we have complied with our obligations
under the Right of First Refusal provision and will work to
resolve the dispute as soon as practical to ensure the sale
process can be completed,&#8221; Ruban Yogarajah, a BHP spokesman,
said by e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blusson didn&#8217;t immediately return a call for comment to his
Vancouver office outside of normal business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Delaware Court Dismisses Waste Claim Over Bonus Payments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A complaint challenging a corporate board&#8217;s decision to pay
more than $130 million in executive bonuses without adopting a
plan that could make the bonuses tax deductible doesn&#8217;t state a
claim for waste, the Delaware Supreme Court ruled Jan. 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The decision to sacrifice some tax savings in order to
retain flexibility in compensation decisions is a classic
exercise of business judgment,&#8221; Justice Carolyn Berger wrote
for the en banc court. &#8220;Even if the decision were a poor one&#8221;
as alleged by the plaintiff, &#8220;it was not unconscionable or
irrational,&#8221; the court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court said Susan Freedman was a stockholder of XTO
Energy Inc., a Delaware corporation that, before its acquisition
by ExxonMobil Corp., was in the oil and gas production business.
In 2008, Freedman filed a derivative action alleging that XTO&#8217;s
board committed waste by failing to adopt a plan that could have
made its bonuses tax deductible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court said that from 2004 to 2007, XTO allegedly paid
executive bonuses totaling more than $130 million, and those
payments weren&#8217;t tax deductible. The XTO board was aware that
under a qualified Section 162(m) plan, bonuses could be tax
deductible, &#8220;but it did not think that its compensation
decisions should be &#8216;constrained&#8217; by such a plan,&#8221; the court
recounted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after Freedman filed her complaint, the court said,
XTO&#8217;s board approved a Section 162(m) plan. The plan was cleared
by stockholders at XTO&#8217;s 2009 annual meeting. The court said XTO
never made use of the plan, because it merged with and into an
Exxon subsidiary in June 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freedman agreed to dismiss her complaint; she then filed a
motion for $1 million in attorneys&#8217; fees based on her assertion
that the complaint benefited the company by causing XTO to adopt
the Section 162(m) plan. The chancery court rejected Freedman&#8217;s
suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waste claims, the court said, usually involve a transaction
in which a corporation allegedly exchanges its assets for
&#8220;disproportionately low consideration. To state a claim for
waste, a stockholder must allege, with particularity, that the
board authorized action that no reasonable person would consider
fair.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Freedman v. Adams, No. 230, Delaware Supreme
Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DuPont Shareholder Sues Managers Over $1 Billion Court Loss &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A DuPont Co. (DD) shareholder sued company directors and Chief
Executive Officer Ellen Kullman, claiming mismanagement of the
seed business led to a $1 billion judgment that threatens to
wipe out the company&#8217;s cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a complaint filed January 15 in U.S. District Court in
Wilmington, Delaware, shareholder Robert Zomolosky asked a judge
to force Kullman and the board to pay any damages stemming from
DuPont&#8217;s loss of a patent lawsuit involving Monsanto Co. (MON)&#8217;s weed
killer, Roundup. The jury award, the third-biggest last year,
could grow to $3 billion depending on future legal rulings,
according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The DuPont board lost sight of its mandate and its
responsibilities, and acquiesced in unlawful legal maneuvers and
deceptive public statements in conscious disregard of its
obligations,&#8221; Zomolosky claimed in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wilmington-based company plans to appeal the jury&#8217;s
verdict, according to the complaint, and has asked the judge to
overturn the award. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DuPont&#8217;s General Counsel Thomas L. Sager said in an e-
mailed statement that the company handled the Monsanto patent
case appropriately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are confident in the appropriateness of all our
actions and the points raised in this lawsuit are simply a
repetition of those we have repeatedly addressed in the course
of the Monsanto litigation,&#8221; Sager said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Zomolosky v. Kullman, 13-cv-00094, U.S.
District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Law Firm Moves &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clifford Chance in Australia Hires Antitrust Lawyer &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave Poddar, an antitrust lawyer who advised Emirates on a
proposed joint venture with Qantas Airways Ltd., has joined
Clifford Chance, the U.K.&#8217;s highest-grossing law firm, in its
Sydney office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clifford Chance is boosting its workforce in the Asia-
Pacific region, where its revenue rose 28 percent in the year
ended April 30, helped by offices in Sydney and Perth added in
2011 and a new alliance in Singapore last year. Poddar joined
Jan. 7, according to a statement from the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Adding dedicated antitrust expertise has been a priority
since our establishment in Australia,&#8221; Peter Charlton, Clifford
Chance&#8217;s Asia Pacific managing partner, said in a statement.
&#8220;When overseas clients invest in Australia, or local companies
acquire or expand domestically, antitrust issues are very likely
to arise.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of mergers and acquisitions in Australia slumped
41 percent to $86 billion last year from 2011 and compared with
$148.8 billion in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The slowdown during the past two years doesn&#8217;t mean there&#8217;s a
lack of work for competition lawyers, with companies planning
six to 12 months in advance, Poddar said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concentration in Australian industries from news media to
retail mean tie-ups and acquisitions face regulatory scrutiny,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For competition lawyers giving strategic advice, there is
plenty of work,&#8221; Poddar said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poddar worked at Mallesons Stephen Jaques for 22 years, and
in 2011 joined Allen  Overy, which he left last year. He
declined to discuss his departure from Allen  Overy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Norton Rose Says Stanley Hartt Joins as Counsel From Macquarie &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanley Hartt was hired by Norton Rose LLP in Canada from
Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG)&#8217;s Canadian unit, where he was chairman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hartt, a former chief of staff to former Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney, will provide &#8220;strategic advice to
domestic and international clients,&#8221; Norton Rose said in an
announcement on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hartt left Macquarie and joined Norton Rose&#8217;s Toronto
office this month, Peter Zvanitajs, a spokesman for Norton Rose
said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mulroney, Canada&#8217;s Prime Minister from 1984 to 1993, is
listed as a senior partner in Montreal on Norton Rose&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Yan, a Macquarie spokesman, declined to comment on
Hartt&#8217;s move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goodwin Procter Expands Financial Institutions Group &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodwin Procter LLP said Brynn D. Peltz joined the firm&#8217;s
financial institutions group in New York as a partner in its
transactions and investment management regulation practices, as
well as the firm&#8217;s private investment funds practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peltz joins from Latham  Watkins LLP, where she was a
partner in its financial regulatory and investment funds
practices. Previously, she was a partner at Clifford Chance LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peltz has more than 20 years&#8217; experience advising financial
institutions, including private equity, real estate and hedge
fund sponsors; alternative asset managers; business development
companies; and registered investment companies on strategic
matters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodwin Procter has offices in Boston, Hong Kong, London,
Los Angeles, New York, San Diego, San Francisco, Silicon Valley

&lt;p&gt;Admiral Group Plc (ADM), the insurer of
3.6 million U.K. vehicles, rose the most in three months after
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) upgraded the stock, saying the company
will benefit from the falling cost of automotive claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admiral advanced 4.9 percent to 1,211 pence in London
trading, the biggest climb in the FTSE 100 Index (UKX) of leading U.K.
shares. Analysts at Goldman Sachs led by Ravi Tanna upgraded the
stock to buy from hold and said it has the potential to return
30 percent over the next 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admiral has underperformed the Stoxx Europe 600 Insurance
Index (SXIP) over the last six months as U.K. auto-insurance premiums
declined while claims for bodily injury continued to rise. The
British government is proposing a series of legislative changes,
such as capping whiplash claims and limiting fees paid to so-
called &#8220;no win no fee&#8221; lawyers, to hold down costs and
premiums, which doubled in the three years through 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe there is potential for claims inflation to
decline faster than the market expects,&#8221; Tanna wrote in a note
to clients today. &#8220;As a result of renegotiated reinsurance
terms, the group has significant gearing towards lower claims
inflation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insurer, led by chief executive officer, founder and
biggest shareholder Henry Engelhardt, reinsures about half its
premiums with companies including Munich Re. After renegotiating
terms with its reinsurers, Admiral is entitled to 90 percent of
its underwriting profit while taking 25 percent of the risk,
Tanna said in the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This makes it the most geared company in our coverage to
improving trends in motor claims,&#8221; Tanna said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bridgepoint Advisers Ltd., a U.K.
private-equity firm with more than $12 billion in committed
funds, will choose JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) to consider Swedish
renal-care provider Diaverum&#8217;s future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bridgepoint &#8220;is close&#8221; to completing JPMorgan&#8217;s
appointment to look at strategic options for Lund-based Diaverum
for the next 12 months, James Murray, a spokesman for the firm,
said by phone today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diaverum provides renal care to more than 20,000 patients
at about 250 clinics in 17 countries, including in South
America, Australia, Europe and the Middle East, according to
information on its website. The company employs 6,900 people and
reported sales of 398 million euros ($530 million) in 2011.
Companies owned by London-based Bridgepoint employ 72,000 people
in more than 40 countries, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gold may climb over the next three
months as U.S. lawmakers attempt to tackle the country&#8217;s debt
ceiling and the world&#8217;s largest economy slows, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. said, advising investors to place bets on advances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see current prices as a good entry point to re-
establish fresh longs,&#8221; analysts Damien Courvalin and Alec Phillips wrote in a Jan. 18 report. The bank reiterated a three-
month target of $1,825 an ounce, as well as a forecast for
prices to weaken in the second half as the U.S. economy
rebounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold fell 5.5 percent last quarter, the worst performance
since 2008, on expectations for a recovery and potential end to
central bank stimulus in the U.S. An advance to $1,825 would be
consistent with rallies into debt-ceiling decisions, the
analysts wrote. Since 1960, Congress has raised or revised the
debt limit 79 times, according to the Treasury Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The uncertainty associated with these issues, combined
with our economists&#8217; forecast for weak U.S. GDP growth in the
first half of 2013 following the negative impact of higher taxes
will push gold&#8221; to the three-month target, they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold, which rallied for a 12th year in 2012, traded at
$1,687.90 an ounce on the Comex at 9:49 a.m. in New York.
Holdings in exchange-traded products reached a record last
month, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Most-active prices last
traded above $1,825 an ounce in September 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Borrowing Limit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Treasury has said the U.S. will exceed its $16.4
trillion borrowing authority sometime from mid-February to early
March. Financing for government agencies is set to lapse March
27, and lawmakers must pass new spending or cause a shutdown.
Also in March, Congress will confront the $110 billion in
automatic spending cuts, half from defense, that were postponed
in a Jan. 1 tax deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman restated its outlook for lower prices in the second
half of this year, a call echoed by Credit Suisse Group AG and
Allan Hochreiter(Pty) Ltd., as the U.S. recovers. As growth
improves, prices will likely decline even with continued central
bank and exchange-traded fund demand, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold&#8217;s bull market is over, Allan Hochreiter Chief
Executive Officer Rene Hochreiter, the top forecaster in the
London Bullion Market Association&#8217;s 2012 poll, said this month.
The metal&#8217;s appeal is set to diminish as so-called fear trades
fade, according to Credit Suisse&#8217;s Tom Kendall, head of
precious-metals research and the most accurate precious-metals
forecaster in the past eight quarters tracked by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. bank by assets, named Kyril Courboin head of France,
replacing Isabelle Seillier, who is becoming head of the firm&#8217;s
financial institutions group for Europe, the Middle East and
Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courboin, who joined JPMorgan in 1990 and currently heads
the financial institutions team in Europe, will report jointly
to Emilio Saracho, deputy chief executive officer of EMEA, and
Viswas Raghavan, head of banking for the region, according to an
internal memorandum to employees. The contents of the document
were confirmed by a spokeswoman for the lender today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seillier, who joined the firm in 1993 and has been in
charge of France since 2008, will be responsible for covering
banks and other clients in the financial-services industry in
the region. She will report to Raghavan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan combined its investment bank with the firm&#8217;s
corporate bank and treasury and securities-services units last
year, and named Raghavan head of banking for Europe as part of a
revamp. Fourth-quarter revenue at the newly combined corporate
and investment bank rose 21 percent to $7.6 billion, New York-
based JPMorgan said last week, the first time it reported
results of the entire group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courboin&#8217;s &#8220;knowledge of the financial sector is second to
none, and his international profile will help further develop
our business in France,&#8221; Raghavan said. &#8220;Isabelle has
positioned JPMorgan as a top international bank in France, which
will prove invaluable in her new regional role.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courboin has worked on deals including Credit Agricole SA&#8217;s
2003 acquisition of Credit Lyonnais and the privatization of
Credit Industriel et Commercial. Seillier served as head of
investment banking activities for France from 2005 to 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the bank
that generates the most revenue from equity trading worldwide,
named R. Martin Chavez, one of the leaders of that business, to
its management committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman announced Chavez&#8217;s appointment in an internal memo
from Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and President
Gary D. Cohn that was obtained by Bloomberg News. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the New York-based firm, confirmed the
contents of the memo. Chavez runs the equity-trading business
with Michael D. Daffey and Paul M. Russo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chavez, 48, is a director of the International Swaps and
Derivatives Association and oversees Goldman Sachs&#8217;s principal
strategic investments group, which invests in exchanges and
other trading facilities. He has co-founded technology companies
Quorum Software Systems and Kiodex, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Marty&#8217;s previous work in the technology industry, his
cross-divisional experience and his deep insight into regulatory
reform, market structure and operational infrastructure will add
a unique perspective to the management committee,&#8221; Blankfein
and Cohn wrote in the memo. &#8220;This will be particularly valuable
as our sales and trading businesses, and the ways in which our
clients transact, continue to evolve.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs generated $8.2 billion of revenue from equity
trading, almost $3 billion more than its closest U.S.
competitor, Morgan Stanley. Goldman disclosed last week that
$1.08 billion of that revenue came from its reinsurance
business, which it is considering selling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The management committee will remain at 30 members once
David Viniar, the firm&#8217;s chief financial officer until the end
of this month, departs and joins the board of directors. Reuters
reported the appointment earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dell Inc. (DELL) is getting closer to clinching a leveraged buyout with Silver Lake Management LLC, and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is planning to provide part of the funding, people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Silver Lake and Dell are negotiating a price in the range of $13.50 to $14.25 a share, said one of the people, who asked not to be named because the talks are private. Microsoft is discussing contributing about $2 billion for the deal, which could be announced this week, the person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft stands to benefit from propping up Dell, one of its largest partners in selling personal computers that run Windows software. Both companies are racing to make up for an industrywide slump by working together on tablets, a market led by Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG) Microsoft could also use Dell&#8217;s help selling to business customers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;For Microsoft to continue to be healthy, it needs strong enterprise partners,&#8221; said Tim Bajarin, founder of technology consulting firm Creative Strategies Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gemma Hart, a spokeswoman for Silver Lake, declined to comment, as did Frank Shaw, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington- based Microsoft, and David Frink, a spokesman for Round Rock, Texas-based Dell. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the deal isn&#8217;t completed this week, that would indicate that price has become an obstacle, and that the transaction is at risk of falling through, one of the people said. CNBC earlier reported that Microsoft plans to help finance the deal. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tablet Strategy &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dell is just one of a handful of vendors selling a tablet machine with Windows RT, a version of Microsoft&#8217;s operating system for chips running ARM Holdings Plc (ARM)&#8217;s technology. Dell will also begin shipping a separate tablet using the main operating system, Windows 8, later this month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft needs the support of PC makers as Apple, Amazon.com Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. lure consumers with tablet devices. Microsoft has also shifted its longstanding tactic by competing with its own partners in selling a tablet machine of its own, called Surface. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft hasn&#8217;t commented on Surface sales, leading some analysts to speculate that the machine may not be selling well. Windows 8 also had a disappointing debut, said Todd Bradley, executive vice president at the largest PC maker, Hewlett- Packard Co. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;PC Slump &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Computer makers and Microsoft are facing a prolonged downturn as PC shipments are forecast to drop for the second year in a row in 2013. They fell 4 percent in 2012 and will slide a further 1.5 percent this year, JPMorgan analysts estimate. Tablet sales rose 72 percent last year and will surge 54 percent this year, JPMorgan forecasts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This isn&#8217;t the first time Microsoft has considered bolstering a potential Silver Lake deal. In 2011, the software maker offered to help fund an offer by Silver Lake and others to acquire a minority stake in Yahoo! Inc., people familiar with the matter said at the time. The deal never materialized. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Microsoft investment in Dell could make it difficult for the software company to work with other PC makers, according to Bajarin. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It would complicate their relationship with their current partners, but it could potentially shore up a partner that is losing ground to Lenovo and HP,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft fell less than 1 percent to $27.15 at the close in New York. Dell rose 2.2 percent to $13.12. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Sarah Earle and Don Jeffrey" date="Jan 22, 2013  3:44 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-22/exxonmobil-says-state-s-expert-foresees-natural-mtbe-drop.html"><headline>ExxonMobil Says State&#8217;s Expert Foresees Natural MTBE Drop</headline><body>

gasoline additive that the state&#8217;s own research indicates the
chemical&#8217;s level will decrease over time without having to be
cleaned up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil company today concluded its cross-examination of
the state&#8217;s chief witness, Graham Fogg, a professor of
hydrology, in the state court trial in Concord. Fogg responded
by saying ExxonMobil&#8217;s lawyer was selecting isolated pieces of
information and taking them out of context in his questioning.
The trial began Jan. 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil is a defendant in the state&#8217;s $816 million
lawsuit on claims the oil companies knew that the chemical MTBE,
or methyl tertiary butyl ether, would contaminate groundwater. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire&#8217;s suit is one of scores over MTBE against
refiners, fuel distributors and chemical makers. New Hampshire
Superior Court Judge Peter Fauver agreed last week to excuse
another defendant in this case, Citgo Petroleum Corp., while the
company and the state work to complete a settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil company&#8217;s lawyer was trying to show the jury that
Fogg&#8217;s own research indicated that the amount of MTBE in the
groundwater would naturally decline to levels that aren&#8217;t
hazardous. Fogg replied that while that was true of some wells,
others would have a higher concentration of the additive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fogg testified last week that about 2 percent of the
state&#8217;s private wells are polluted with hazardous levels of
MTBE, determined by the state to be 13 million parts per
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Falling Levels &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In six years you were projecting that 40 percent of the
private wells that you estimate were above 13 million parts per
billion would already be down to 2 million parts per billion,
correct?,&#8221; David Lender, a lawyer for ExxonMobil, said during
cross-examination of Fogg today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fogg said that would be &#8220;true for some wells.&#8221; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I made calculations that did not assume that it&#8217;s going
to keep growing forever and ever,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I also projected
there would be other wells that would see an increase in
concentration.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A professor at the University of California, Davis, Fogg
estimated that about 40,000 wells are contaminated with MTBE in
the state, and that about 5,590 are contaminated at levels
determined to be unfit for drinking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of contaminated wells is one element in the
determination of monetary damages if ExxonMobil is found liable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state is also seeking damages based on the companies&#8217;
market share of gasoline sales in New Hampshire during the
period covered by the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Market Share &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil&#8217;s share was about 30 percent, the state said.
Based on the state&#8217;s estimated cost of $816 million to test for,
monitor and clean up the contamination, New Hampshire could be
seeking about $245 million from the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citgo&#8217;s market share during that time ranged from
3.1 percent to 8.7 percent, the state said. Based on those
figures, New Hampshire could be seeking $25 million to
$71 million from Citgo in a settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two sides have until Feb. 15 to agree. If they don&#8217;t,
Citgo will be reinstated to the case, barring an extension. The
New Hampshire attorney general&#8217;s office declined to comment on
terms of any proposed settlement. Fernando Garay, a spokesman
for Citgo, declined to comment on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2003, New Hampshire sued ExxonMobil, Citgo, Shell Oil
Co., Sunoco Inc., ConocoPhillips (COP), Irving Oil Ltd., Vitol SA and
Hess Corp. All settled before the trial except Irving, Texas-
based ExxonMobil and Citgo, the Houston-based unit of Petroleos
de Venezuela SA, the country&#8217;s state-owned oil company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Earlier Accord &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell and Sunoco agreed to pay New Hampshire $35 million in
a settlement announced in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire has collected more than $100 million so far
from the defendants, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state contends that the oil companies knew MTBE
presented a risk of groundwater contamination when they decided
to use it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil and Citgo argued that they were complying with
federal regulations that pre-empt state law. They said MTBE was
added to gasoline to make it burn more thoroughly and thus
comply with a federal mandate to reduce air pollution. They also
said MTBE never caused any New Hampshire resident to become ill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MTBE lawsuits have also been consolidated in federal court
in New York for pretrial evidence-gathering and motions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, a federal jury ordered ExxonMobil to pay New York
City $104.7 million after finding it liable for polluting wells
in the city. ExxonMobil has appealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today&#8217;s cross-examination, Lender questioned Fogg about
the money his firm has received for work on the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s been a significant amount of money,&#8221; Fogg said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Could it be more than a million dollars?&#8221; Lender asked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you want to suggest I&#8217;m getting rich off this, I think
you&#8217;d be sadly disappointed,&#8221; Fogg replied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is State of New Hampshire v. Hess Corp. (HES), 03-C-
0550, New Hampshire Superior Court, Merrimack County (Concord). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) director
Rajat Gupta asked a federal appeals court for a new insider-
trading trial, arguing that evidence in his favor was kept from
the jury and evidence against him was wrongly allowed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta, 64, who sat on the board of New York-based Goldman
Sachs and Cincinnati-based Procter  Gamble Co., was sentenced
to two years in prison after being convicted of passing
information he gathered at board meetings to Galleon Group LLC
co-founder Raj Rajaratnam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan erred when he
allowed the government to present wiretaps of conversations not
involving Gupta and limited Gupta&#8217;s defense case by barring
evidence that Rajaratnam had alternative sources of nonpublic
information about Goldman Sachs, defense lawyers Gary Naftalis
and Seth Waxman said Jan. 18 in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The court&#8217;s decidedly asymmetrical interpretation of the
rules of evidence left the jury with a distorted picture, in
which Gupta was accused by the self-serving hearsay of a known
fabulist beyond Gupta&#8217;s power to cross-examine, but was unable
to explain to the jury that he had neither the motive nor the
inclination to benefit that person, and that there was a
plausible alternative perpetrator,&#8221; the defense lawyers wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Remains Free &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a rare move, a federal appeals court in Manhattan in
December granted Gupta&#8217;s request to remain free while he fights
his conviction. Rakoff, who presided over the trial, originally
ordered Gupta to begin serving his sentence on Jan. 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rakoff &#8220;significantly curtailed&#8221; Gupta&#8217;s principal
defenses and made erroneous rulings in the prosecution&#8217;s favor
that &#8220;decisively tipped the scales&#8221; against him, Gupta argued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta challenged the government&#8217;s use of court-authorized
wiretaps, saying Rakoff shouldn&#8217;t have permitted prosecutors to
play recordings of September and October 2008 telephone calls
between Rajaratnam and others that didn&#8217;t include Gupta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wiretaps Attacked &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The prosecution&#8217;s case rested exclusively on
circumstantial evidence and predominantly wiretap statements --
not of Gupta, but of Rajaratnam, a highly unreliable declarant,
speaking with other people with no connection to Gupta,&#8221; his
lawyers wrote. &#8220;The district court admitted these hearsay
statements -- which Gupta could not cross-examine given
Rajaratnam&#8217;s unavailability.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta&#8217;s lawyers argued that Rakoff wrongly allowed
prosecutors to use three recordings of telephone calls in which
Gupta wasn&#8217;t a participant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rakoff also erred when he didn&#8217;t allow Gupta&#8217;s daughter to
testify that he told her he had discovered that Rajaratnam had
&#8220;swindled&#8221; him when he&#8217;d withdrawn money from the fund. Gupta
lost $10 million, his lawyers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rajaratnam&#8217;s Sentence &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam is serving an 11-year prison term for insider
trading at the Federal Medical Center Devens in Ayers,
Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta, who also served as managing partner of McKinsey 
Co. from 1994 to 2003, was convicted by a jury in June of one
count of conspiracy and three counts of securities fraud. He was
accused of passing illegal information about New York-based
Goldman Sachs to Rajaratnam, his friend and business partner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal jury in Manhattan convicted Gupta of twice
passing information about Goldman Sachs to Rajaratnam, once on
Sept. 23, 2008, and again on Oct. 23, 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Gupta, 12-4448, U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

versions of the machine powered by Intel Corp. chips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surface Windows 8 Pro, which runs on an Intel Core i5

$899, the company said today in a statement. It will be
available with 64 or 128 gigabytes of memory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An earlier iteration of Surface that contains a chip with

&lt;p&gt;The yen may strengthen to a two-week
high versus the dollar based on resistance levels before Japan&#8217;s
currency resumes a bearish path, according to JPMorgan Chase 
Co., citing trading patterns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The dollar/yen can correct a bit more over the short term
and retrace into the 87.80/86.80 yen zone,&#8221; Niall O&#8217;Connor, a
technical analyst at JPMorgan Securities, wrote in an e-mail.
During the next two months, O&#8217;Connor predicted the yen will
weaken to around 92.25, the lowest level since June 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yen rose to 88.54 per dollar at 11 a.m. New York time.
It has weakened against the dollar for 13 of the past 14 weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The currency may reach 86.80 yen, a level last reached on
Jan. 3, after the Bank of Japan under outgoing Governor Masaaki
Shirakawa said it will buy 13 trillion yen ($146.6 billion) in
assets from January 2014 and target a 2 percent inflation rate,
O&#8217;Connor said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The medium-term JPY underperformance trade does not seem
complete, and corrective retracements are still viewed as

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s non-consensus call that Turkey&#8217;s central bank would act to stem capital inflows at the risk of higher loan growth was vindicated as the bank cut interest rates today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Ankara-based bank lowered its overnight lending and borrowing rates by 25 basis points each, while leaving the 5.5 percent benchmark one-week repurchase rate unchanged, in line with Goldman Sachs economist Ahmet Akarli&#8217;s call on Jan. 18. The reductions were made to &#8220;contain risks on financial stability&#8221; amid accelerating capital inflows that have boosted the lira and helped prolong the best bond rally in emerging markets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Akarli was the only one of 12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg to correctly predict today&#8217;s move, with the median forecast calling for no change in rates as rising loan growth threatens to increase the inflation rate and widen the current-account deficit. The central bank&#8217;s priority last year was to limit lending growth that had exploded in 2011, driving the deficit up and leading to an 18 percent decline in the lira against the dollar. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The bank has shifted focus towards the financial stability risks posed by accelerating capital inflows, and away from inflation,&#8221; Akarli, who was not immediately available for comment today, said in an e-mailed note before the rates decision. Interest-rate cuts &#8220;will be used to lean against these inflows and their subsequent currency appreciation pressures,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Credit Rating &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Accelerating inflows meant &#8220;the proper policy would be to keep interest rates at low levels&#8221; and to deliver &#8220;a limited downward shift in the interest rate corridor,&#8221; the central bank said in a statement accompanying its rate cuts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The interest-rate corridor is a policy tool unique to Turkey, allowing central bank Governor Erdem Basci to adjust the effective borrowing rate daily by extending funding through a duo of rates. At today&#8217;s meeting he cut the overnight borrowing rate to 4.75 percent and the overnight lending rate to 8.75 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lira appreciated against 27 out of 31 major currencies this month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That brought the central bank&#8217;s real effective exchange rate close to the 120 reading which Basci said in November would be a cause for concern. The index measures the lira&#8217;s purchasing power against the currencies of Turkey&#8217;s main trading partners. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Lira Gains &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lira strengthened to 1.7530 per dollar on Jan. 17, the strongest level since Feb. 29 last year, on bets Moody&#8217;s Investors Service will raise Turkey&#8217;s credit rating to investment grade. Barclays Plc, Societe Generale SA and Morgan Stanley are among banks that have said Moody&#8217;s may upgrade Turkey this year, a move that would help include the country in more global bond indexes and generate additional investment flows, after Fitch Ratings raised government debt to investment-grade ranking in November. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s today said it was scheduling a teleconference on Jan. 28 to discuss Turkey&#8217;s &#8220;strengthening profile&#8221; and shift &#8220;closer to an investment grade sovereign rating.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lira dropped 0.4 percent to 1.7719 at 6:55 p.m. in Istanbul after the rate cuts, erasing as much as 0.3 percent of gains on the Moody&#8217;s announcement. Yields on two-year benchmark bonds dropped three basis points to 5.9 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Credit Expansion &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Excessive currency appreciation increases &#8220;systemic risk and can have a damaging effect on macroeconomic and financial stability,&#8221; Basci said Dec. 25. The governor has used the rates corridor to control the flow of money and curb the current-account deficit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The central bank wants to keep credit growth within a 14 percent to 15 percent range, Deputy Governor Turalay Kenc said during a roundtable discussion arranged by Euromoney Institutional Investor Plc (ERM) in Vienna Jan. 15. Bank loans grew 17 percent to 805 billion liras ($457 billion) in the 12 months to Jan. 11, according to data from the banking regulator yesterday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think that the cut in the upper end might support overall economic activity, which was not necessarily needed since economic activity already started to gain momentum,&#8221; Ozgur Altug, chief economist at brokerage BGC Partners in Istanbul, said in an e-mailed report today. &#8220;The central bank&#8217;s signal via cutting the lower end hints that it will not allow the lira to become an overvalued currency.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Real Rate &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Five-year credit-default swaps on Turkey were unchanged at 126 basis points today. That compares with 135 for Russia, 82 for Poland and 156 for South Africa. Rising prices show worsening perceptions of a borrower&#8217;s creditworthiness, and declining prices the reverse. The contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for the underlying securities or cash if a borrower fails to adhere to its debt agreements. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to hold Turkish debt denominated in dollars rather than U.S. Treasuries fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 178, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s EMBI Global Index. The premium compares with the emerging-market average at 265. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lira&#8217;s gain this month has come after the central bank&#8217;s real effective exchange rate fell to 118.3 in December from 119.4 in November. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The real effective exchange rate has approached the central bank&#8217;s threshold of 120,&#8221; Emre Tekmen and Selim Cakir, Istanbul-based analysts at BNP Paribas SA, said by e-mail yesterday. &#8220;Strong risk appetite&#8221; may lead to renewed appreciation pressure on the lira, prompting the central bank to cut its overnight borrowing rate, they said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Andras Gergely" date="Jan 22, 2013 11:01 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-22/forint-drops-as-goldman-sees-slump-minister-varga-warns-on-imf.html"><headline>Forint Drops Most in Week as Goldman Sees Slump on Policy Change</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The forint weakened the most in
almost a week as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. forecast a slump in
the currency on concern a change in leadership at the central
bank may bring monetary loosening via unconventional methods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forint depreciated 0.6 percent to 294.76 per euro by
4:31 p.m. in Budapest, the biggest drop since Jan. 16. Yields on
the government&#8217;s benchmark 10-year local-currency bonds rose
eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 6.41 percent,
the highest in a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forint has slumped 1.7 percent in the past month on the
expectation that the new president due to take over at Hungary&#8217;s
central bank in March will ease monetary policy in a non-
traditional way. Goldman Sachs cited such a threat from the
Magyar Nemzeti Bank while revising its forecast for the forint
to 292, 303 and 303 in 3, 6, and 12 months, from 282, 285, and
288, respectively. Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI) and broker
Equilor Befektetesi Zrt. also projected a forint slump, citing
the same reason. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The actual shift to more accommodative policies is likely
to lead to a sell-off,&#8221; Goldman analysts Magdalena Polan and
Themistoklis Fiotakis wrote in a report yesterday. The
currency&#8217;s decline was &#8220;driven primarily by increasing market
concerns over the succession in the leadership of the National
Bank of Hungary and policy statements indicating government&#8217;s
higher tolerance for weaker forint.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government may nominate Economy Minister Gyorgy
Matolcsy to replace central bank President Andras Simor in
March, hvg.hu reported late yesterday. Matolcsy has urged the
bank to &#8220;bravely use unorthodox tools&#8221; and follow the European
Central Bank in providing stimulus for the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Prolonged Depreciation&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forint may weaken &#8220;well beyond 300&#8221; in the first half
of 2013 because of the expected shift in monetary policy,
Budapest-based broker Equilor said in a report today. A
subsequent change in government rhetoric may then bring the
forint back to 290 by year-end, Equilor said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The government&#8217;s tolerance for prolonged depreciation is
still limited,&#8221; the Goldman analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government targets a forint rate of 285 per euro as
substantial depreciation would be dangerous, Mihaly Varga,
Hungary&#8217;s chief aid negotiator, said Jan. 20. Varga&#8217;s comments
helped recoup forint losses after Matolcsy said Jan. 10 he
opposes strengthening the forint to fight inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forint appreciated 8.1 percent against the euro and 10
percent to the dollar last year, the biggest advance among more
25 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg after the
Polish zloty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IMF Aid &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hungary, which requested International Monetary Fund aid in
November 2011, stands little chance of obtaining a bailout as
views on the type of bailout and Hungary&#8217;s growth prospects
differ too much between the IMF and the Cabinet, Varga said in
an M1 television interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forint may weaken to 300 per euro by March, Wolfgang Ernst, a Vienna-based analyst at Raiffeisen, wrote in a research
report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ernst cited the unresolved question of the central bank
succession, the &#8220;unlikely&#8221; success in IMF talks, Hungary&#8217;s
&#8220;bleak&#8221; economic outlook and last week&#8217;s warning from Fitch
Ratings that it&#8217;s not planning to upgrade the country to
investment grade in the near future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) has named
former UBS AG (UBSN) banker Hussein Hassan to head global Islamic
finance as the biggest U.S. lender strives to boost its share of
an industry whose assets are set to double by 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based JPMorgan said Hassan, previously global head
of Islamic structuring for UBS, would focus on clients in
countries including Saudi Arabia and Malaysia, according to an
e-mailed statement today. Malaysia hosts the world&#8217;s biggest
market for Islamic bonds, or sukuk, while Saudi Arabia boasts
the world&#8217;s biggest share of Shariah-compliant assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As we have observed a significant increase in the demand
for Shariah-compliant banking products, we have decided to
invest in high-caliber people, systems and technology,&#8221; Sjoerd Leenart, JPMorgan&#8217;s senior country officer for the Middle East
and North Africa, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global banks including HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) and Standard
Chartered Plc have set up Islamic banking units to take
advantage of growing demand for financial products that comply
with the religion&#8217;s ban on interest. Global Islamic financial
assets are set to double to as much as $3 trillion by 2015,
according to Standards  Poor&#8217;s estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Islamic Offering &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hassan, who also headed Zurich-based UBS&#8217; Middle East and
North Africa structuring, will be based in Dubai, a Persian Gulf
emirate striving create a hub for Shariah-compliant banking that
would take on such centers as Malaysia and Bahrain. He will lead
JPMorgan&#8217;s effort to &#8220;further build out its Islamic offering
across different lines of business and regions,&#8221; the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global sales of Islamic bonds surged 26 percent last year
to $46 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Issuers
in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, accounted for almost half
of the total after sukuk sales tripled and borrowing costs
plunged to records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan helped arrange $119 million of global sukuk sales
last year, or 0.3 percent of the total, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. That compares with $11 billion, or almost a
quarter of the total, for HSBC, the world&#8217;s top underwriter of
Islamic bonds. Dubai, which is home to the world&#8217;s tallest
skyscraper, plans to sell 10-year dollar-denominated sukuk
today, four people familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks rose, after benchmark indexes reached five-year highs, as lawmakers voted to temporarily suspend the federal debt limit and technology stocks rallied amid better-than-forecast earnings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Futures on the Nasdaq 100 Index slid 1.8 percent following the close of U.S. markets as Apple Inc. (AAPL) tumbled 11 percent after reporting first-quarter sales below forecasts. Google Inc. (GOOG) and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) jumped more than 4.4 percent in regular trading after earnings topped estimates. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) surged 11 percent after revenue beat forecasts, helped by sales of chips that run servers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index gained 0.2 percent to 1,494.81 at 4 p.m. in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 67.12 points, or 0.5 percent, to 13,779.33. About 6.1 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, in line with the three-month average. Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 1.7 percent to 2,712 as of 6:18 p.m. on Apple&#8217;s earnings report. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Right now it&#8217;s all earnings related and the fact that maybe we can put the debt ceiling to rest for maybe a couple more months,&#8221; Frank Ingarra, who helps manage $1.4 billion at Greenwich, Connecticut-based NorthCoast Asset Management LLC, said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waterfund LLC, which provides
financial risk management to the water industry, signed an
agreement with International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) to develop
a water cost index. Terms weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our initiative with IBM Research will finally bring real
financial transparency to the water sector,&#8221; Chief Executive
Officer Scott Rickards said today in a statement. By calculating
the unsubsidized cost of freshwater production using IBM
analytics, New York-based Waterfund can offer &#8220;flexibly-
tailored financial tools to investors in water infrastructure.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the United Nations, water use has been growing
at more than twice the rate of population increase over the last
century as urbanization and climate change accelerate demands on
supplies. An estimated 41 percent of the world&#8217;s population now
lives in water-stressed areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water utilities face the most obvious financial risks from
supply disruptions, though industries in which water
availability is critical include the mining, beverage, chemical
and energy sectors, Waterfund said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rand may weaken to an almost
four-year low versus the U.S. dollar as the South African
currency breaches so-called resistance levels, according to
JPMorgan Chase  Co., citing technical trading patterns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The next big target is around 9.20, 50 percent
retracement from the 2008 high,&#8221; Niall O&#8217;Connor, a technical
analyst at JP Morgan Securities, wrote in an e-mail. &#8220;The rand
can maintain the underperformance bias, so upside risks for
dollar/rand look to be intact.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rand last touched 9.20 per dollar on April 15, 2009.
The South African currency fell today to as low as 9.044, the
least since April 22, 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rand weakened beyond 9 per dollar for the first time in
nine weeks as accelerating inflation added to concern about
slowing growth amid labor protests and civil unrest in Africa&#8217;s
biggest economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer inflation jumped to a seven-month high in
December, reducing the central bank&#8217;s room to stimulate the
economy. Protests by township residents opposed to a government
plan to redraw municipal boundaries in Sasolburg left two people
dead yesterday, police spokesman Motantsi Makhele said. The riot
comes a week after Anglo American Plc&#8217;s platinum unit announced
plans to fire workers amid labor unrest in the mining and
agricultural industries. Africa&#8217;s biggest economy has an
unemployment rate of 25.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The rally in dollar/rand has extended into the critical
9.00 medium term range highs,&#8221; O&#8217;Connor wrote in a note to
clients. &#8220;An eventual bullish breakout is expected.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a bond,
commodity, currency or index. Resistance is an area on a price
graph where technical analysts anticipate sell orders to be
clustered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.K. homebuilders fell the most in
four months after JPMorgan Chase  Co. said a moderate housing
market improvement is already accounted for in their share
prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg EMEA Homebuilders Index (BEUHBLD) slumped by 2.6
percent, the biggest drop since Sept. 26. Redrow Plc led the
declines at 4.3 percent and Barratt Developments Plc (BDEV), the U.K.&#8217;s
largest homebuilder by volume, fell 3.6 percent. Both were cut
to underweight by analyst Emily Biddulph. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The index, composed of the U.K.&#8217;s seven biggest publicly
traded homebuilders, gained 70 percent last year as higher
selling prices and improved margins helped overcome the
country&#8217;s stuttering economy and a lack of mortgage lending.
While some economic indicators show signs of improvement, it&#8217;s
unclear how those will affect the market, Biddulph wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The sector is now pricing in a near-term meaningful
improvement in housing market conditions,&#8221; Biddulph wrote in
the note. &#8220;Although we continue to see some medium-term value
in the sector and see little risk to consensus earnings
estimates, we see near-term risk to sentiment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bovis Homes Group Plc was also cut to underweight. Bellway
Plc and Taylor Wimpey Plc were downgraded to neutral by the New
York-based bank and Persimmon Plc was kept at neutral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britain is facing the prospect of a triple-dip recession
this year, hurting efforts by potential homebuyers to save for a
deposit. Weekly pay growth slowed to an annual 1.5 percent in
the three months through November, while pay increases excluding
bonuses eased to 1.4 percent, the lowest since June 2010. That
compares with an inflation rate of 2.7 percent in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taylor Wimpey remains Biddulph&#8217;s preferred stock because of
its valuation and its land for building, she said. Shares of the
U.K.&#8217;s second-biggest homebuilder by volume fell 3.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), after straining ties with computer makers by releasing its own tablet computer last year, risks further fissures with partners by planning to make a strategic investment in Dell Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dell is close to clinching a leveraged buyout by Silver Lake Management LLC, and Microsoft is discussing providing part of the funding, people with knowledge of the matter said yesterday. Microsoft may contribute about $2 billion for the deal, which could be announced this week, one person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An investment would shore up a partner and help Microsoft gain influence in business computing as it loses ground with consumers gravitating toward competing tablets and smartphones. PC makers also may fret that the arrangement will give Dell an advantage, such as through an early look at new software, deeper insight into strategy or preference in product marketing and promotion. Microsoft became a competitor to hardware manufacturers with the release of the Surface tablet last year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you&#8217;re a vendor that wasn&#8217;t happy with Surface, the idea of Microsoft owning part of Dell is not going to cheer you up,&#8221; said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at market-research firm Gartner Inc. &#8220;But if you&#8217;re Microsoft and you feel you need to do more devices, and that hardware and software need to be more integrated, the ability to have major influence on a big PC vendor opens some interesting opportunities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman (GS) Sachs International sold 1
billion euros ($1.33 billion) of a Sept. 15, 2026, Madrid region
note today as the second-biggest contributor to Spain&#8217;s economy
seeks to benefit from a rally in the nation&#8217;s securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman placed the notes privately while five banks took
part in the syndicated sale of a 2018 note, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The five-year notes were sold at a spread of 190
basis points over the reference 2018 Treasury bond, according to
people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named
because they&#8217;re not authorized to speak about it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The region tapped the markets after the Treasury yesterday
saw record demand for a 10-year bond. Spain&#8217;s Cabinet last week
gave Madrid, Galicia, Navarra and Aragon a green light to issue
4.4 billion euros of bonds amid a surge in investor interest for
Spanish shares as well as government and corporate debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madrid&#8217;s economy department said it has sold the 2.3
billion euros of debt it was authorized to issue on Jan. 18 and
that details will be given today at 5 p.m. in Madrid. The amount
represents about 60 percent of the region&#8217;s 2013 funding needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analistas Financieros Internacionales, a Madrid-based
consultancy, estimates gross debt sales from the regions of
about 30 billion euros this year, excluding short-term debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Treasury plans to raise 23 billion euros for the
nation&#8217;s regional rescue fund known as FLA, created last year to
prevent any regional default, and that was tapped by nine of 17
semi-autonomous regions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Budget Ministry has imposed a debt ceiling of 172
billion euros on the regions this year, or 16 percent of gross
domestic product. That compares with outstanding debt of 167
billion euros in the third quarter and includes 102 billion
euros of bank loans, with the remainder mostly in bonds,
according to the Bank of Spain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is the bank that generates the
most revenue from equity trading worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goodwin Procter LLP advised Cole
Credit Property Trust II Inc. on its agreement to merge with
Spirit Realty Capital Inc. (SRC) in a stock transaction that would
create a company with 2,012 properties in 48 U.S. states. Ropes
 Gray LLP represented the Special Committee of CCPT II. Latham
 Watkins LLP advised Spirit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CCPT II will exchange 1.9 shares for each share of Spirit
common stock, the Arizona-based companies said in a statement
today. Spirit shareholders will own about 44 percent of the
combined real estate investment trust with the remainder held by
CCPT II shareholders. Shares of the joint company will be listed
on the New York Stock Exchange under Spirit&#8217;s stock symbol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pro-forma enterprise value of the new company is about
$7.1 billion, and the acquisition will create the second-largest
publicly traded triple-net lease REIT in the U.S., according to
the statement. The combined company will be led by Spirit&#8217;s
management. Seven of the nine board members will be from Spirit,
it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goodwin Procter deal team was led by Gil Menna and
included partners Suzanne Lecaroz, John Haggerty, Andrew Sucoff,
Mark Opper and Samuel Richardson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ropes  Gray partners on the deal are John Loder,
investment management; Amanda Morrison, corporate; and Peter
Welsh, business and securities litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Latham  Watkins LLP&#8217;s corporate deal team consists of Los
Angeles partners Julian Kleindorfer and Bradley Helms and Orange
County partner Charles Ruck.  Advice was also provided by New
York finance partner David Teh; Chicago real estate partner
Robert Buday; Los Angeles tax partners Michael Brody and Ana
O&#8217;Brien; and Los Angeles benefits and compensation partner David Taub. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction is expected to be completed in the third
quarter, according to the statement. Triple-net lease structures
mean the tenant is responsible for paying all the property&#8217;s
costs including maintenance, property taxes, utilities and
insurance, minimizing expenses for the REIT. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prudential Loses U.K. Top Court Ruling on Privileged Tax Advice &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. Supreme Court said tax advice given to Prudential
Plc (PRU) by accountants wasn&#8217;t protected by legal privilege and
should be disclosed to the British government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K.&#8217;s highest court said only advice from lawyers was
protected by the privilege, according to a press summary of the
judgment today. When tax authorities asked Prudential for
information about a tax avoidance scheme created by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the company argued it didn&#8217;t have to
hand over any documents containing advice from accountants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Accountants will be crying into their soup tonight, and
tax lawyers will be dancing in the streets,&#8221; said Peter Clough,
a partner at U.K. law firm Osborne Clarke. &#8220;The case presents a
clear cut choice for clients: if you want confidential tax
advice, you&#8217;re better off going to a law firm.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies including Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) and Google Inc. (GOOG) have
been criticized by lawmakers for trying to reduce their U.K. tax
liabilities with complex accounting methods. &lt;/p&gt;

Laetitia Lynn declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

partner-in-charge of the firm&#8217;s Tokyo office. He succeeds Nobu
Yamanouchi, who has been partner-in-charge in Tokyo since 2008.
Yamanouchi will continue to advise clients, particularly in the
automotive, electronic, and pharmaceutical industries, in cross-
border mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures and other
corporate matters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaron Agenbroad, a partner in Jones Day&#8217;s labor and
employment practice, has been named to succeed Bob Mittelstaedt
as partner-in-charge of the San Francisco office. The firm also
announced that David Kiernan, a partner in the U.S. business and
tort litigation practice, will become the administrative partner
of the San Francisco office, responsible for the day to day
operation of the office. Kiernan replaces Louise Rankin, who
left Jones Day to become general counsel of ABHOW, a housing and
health care provider for senior citizens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As head of the real estate practice in Tokyo, Suzuki has
experience representing major Japanese real estate companies as
well as foreign companies and funds involved in real estate
transactions in Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As partner-in-charge, Agenbroad will be responsible for the
overall leadership, strategic vision, and management of Jones
Day&#8217;s San Francisco office. His labor and employment practice
has a focus on representing corporate clients in complex labor
and employment disputes. Mittelstaedt, who has served as
partner-in-charge since 2006, has been asked to assume new
responsibilities coordinating and expanding the firm&#8217;s
litigation practices in California. He has more than 30 years of
experience as a trial lawyer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Department of Defense GC Johnson Returns to Paul Weiss &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeh Charles Johnson, the former general counsel of the
Department of Defense, has returned to private practice as a
partner in Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton  Garrison LLP&#8217;s
litigation department in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are so proud of Jeh&#8217;s public service and of his
contributions to our nation,&#8221; Paul, Weiss chairman Brad S. Karp
said in a statement. &#8220;We are thrilled to welcome a lawyer of
his distinction back to our partnership.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson was appointed to his post by President Barack Obama
in February 2009. As chief legal officer at the Defense
Department, he oversaw the work of more than 10,000 lawyers. His
accomplishments during four years in the post included handling
reforms to the military commissions system adopted by Congress
in 2009, co-authoring the report that paved the way for the
repeal of the military&#8217;s &#8220;Don&#8217;t Ask, Don&#8217;t Tell&#8221; policy by
Congress in 2010, and overseeing the military&#8217;s counterterrorism
policies, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move marks the third time Johnson has returned to the
firm after leaving for government posts. In 1998, he was
appointed by President Bill Clinton to be general counsel of the
Air Force. He held that position for 27 months and returned to
Paul, Weiss in January 2001. In 1989, Johnson left Paul, Weiss
to become an assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan, where he
prosecuted public corruption cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a privilege and a pleasure to return to my
professional home, Paul, Weiss, and I look forward to rejoining
my partners and serving the firm&#8217;s clients,&#8221; Johnson said in
the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul, Weiss has more than 700 lawyers at eight offices in
the U.S., Europe and Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WilmerHale Hires Ex-Federal Circuit Judge Gajarsa in Boston &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP hired Arthur J.
Gajarsa, formerly a judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit, in its Boston office. Gajarsa joins the firm as
senior counsel in the intellectual property litigation practice
and will provide counsel to the firm&#8217;s clients on IP-related
issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gajarsa was nominated to the Federal Circuit in 1996 by
President Clinton and confirmed by the U.S. Senate in 1997. He
retired in June 2012. Prior to his appointment, Gajarsa was a
litigator who also practiced corporate law. His worked at the
Commerce Department, the Interior Department and Defense
Department, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WilmerHale&#8217;s IP litigation practice has more than 140
lawyers and technology specialists with scientific or technical
degrees. The firm has more than 1,000 lawyers at offices in 12
cities in the U.S., Europe and Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Linklaters Appoints Banking and Restructuring Partner in Spain &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spanish banking lawyer Juan Barona joined Linklaters LLP&#8217;s
Madrid office from Allen  Overy LLP where he was a partner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our banking practice, and the Madrid office as a whole,
has enjoyed significant success over the last few years. The
addition of Juan to our team is the result of such success and
is an appropriate and timely response to our commitment to best
serve our clients&#8217; demands,&#8221; Sebasti&#225;n Albella, Linklaters
senior partner for Spain, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linklaters finance practice in Spain covers restructuring
work, leveraged financing, corporate financing, equity and debt
capital markets and other matters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linklaters opened an office in Spain in 2000. The firm has
a team of about 100 lawyers in its Spanish office. The firm has
lawyers at 28 offices worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Edwards Wildman Hires Hogan Lovells Public Finance Partner &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alethia N. Nancoo joined Edwards Wildman Palmer LLP as a
partner in the Public Finance Department, in the firm&#8217;s
Washington office. She was previously with of Hogan Lovells LLP,
where she was a partner in the infrastructure, project and
public finance practice group, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nancoo&#8217;s background is in public and project-debt
financings, with a clientele comprised of municipalities, public
issuers and authorities, nonprofit corporations, and investment
banks, the firm said. She has advised clients in the U.S. and
Caribbean in infrastructure construction; airport, toll road and
surface transportation; mixed-use multifamily housing; and water
and sewer matters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edwards Wildman has 625 lawyers at 15 offices in the U.S,
Europe and Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Litigation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Glaxo Plaintiff Lawyers Settle Dispute Over $143 Million in Fees &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers who won what may be a $2.3 billion settlement with
GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) over its Avandia diabetes drug resolved
their own fight over the allocation of almost $144 million in
legal fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight lawyers on a court-appointed fee committee agreed to
take a smaller portion of the fee fund after nine objectors
challenged their payouts, a special master assigned to review
the recommendations said in court papers made public Jan. 18 in
federal court in Philadelphia. The fee committee had asked for
71 percent of the fund set aside by U.S. District Judge Cynthia Rufe for the Avandia cases before her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Allocating a limited pot of common benefit fees among
numerous counsel, all of whom are talented and capable attorneys
and many of whom have made a significant contribution to the
ultimate success of (a) case, is an unenviable task that is sure
to lead to hurt feelings and bruised egos,&#8221; Bruce Merenstein,
the special master, wrote in the filing. &#8220;Yet, all of the
parties involved handled this difficult task with care and
equanimity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fee fund is 6.25 percent of the total settlement,
according to court records. That means the total accord may be
worth $2.3 billion and the average payout for the 40,000 users
of Avandia involved in the litigation would be about $57,500 --
before legal fees. People familiar with the settlement, who
didn&#8217;t want to be named because the terms weren&#8217;t public, have
said the fee fund was 7 percent of the total. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glaxo, the U.K.&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, has said it paid more
than $3 billion to settle federal and state government claims
that it illegally marketed Avandia, once the world&#8217;s best-
selling diabetes pill, and other medications. Company officials
haven&#8217;t said what the drugmaker spent to settle the Avandia
lawsuits before Rufe, and in state courts, alleging executives
failed to properly warn consumers about the drug&#8217;s risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fee-advisory group, led by Philadelphia attorney Dianne Nast, agreed to a lower payout as part of the accord. Nast
agreed to take $6.3 million, down from $6.7 million, according
to court papers. Joseph Zonies, a Denver-based attorney who was
slated to get the highest recommended fee, will see his firm&#8217;s
payout reduced to $22.5 million from $24.4 million for 18,232
hours of work. Vance Andrus, another Denver-based lawyer, saw
the biggest reduction, a cut of about $3 million that left him
with a payout of $14.6 million, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other lawyers in the group, including Thomas Cartmell,
Bryan Aylstock, Stephen Corr, Paul Kiesel and Bill Robins III

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Bristol-Myers Squibb
Co. (BMY)&#8217;s Eliquis won the backing of the U.K.&#8217;s health-cost
regulator for people with an irregular heartbeat, putting the
drug in line to be the third new treatment recommended for such
patients in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence
issued draft guidance recommending the blood thinner to prevent
strokes in patients with atrial fibrillation, the agency said
today in an e-mailed statement. NICE asked patients and doctors
to talk before using Eliquis about whether to choose one of the
other two new drugs or the older medicine warfarin instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eliquis will compete with Bayer AG (BAYN) and Johnson  Johnson (JNJ)&#8217;s
Xarelto and Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH&#8217;s Pradaxa to replace
warfarin, a decades-old medicine that had previously been the
standard of care for people with an erratic heartbeat. Both of
the other drugs won a recommendation from NICE last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The appraisal committee heard from patient experts that
warfarin can have a greater impact on a person&#8217;s quality of life
than atrial fibrillation itself,&#8221; Carole Longson, director of
NICE&#8217;s Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said in the
statement, citing the older drug&#8217;s interactions with food,
alcohol and other medicines, and the regular monitoring it
requires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICE, which advises the state-run National Health Service
on getting medical value for its money, said it will probably
issue final guidance on Eliquis, also known as apixaban, in
February. The agency recommended the pill in January 2012 for
people who have undergone hip or knee replacement surgery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recommendation &#8220;confirms the value of apixaban as a
cost-effective oral anticoagulant,&#8221; Amadou Diarra, vice
president of the U.K. and Ireland for Bristol-Myers, said in an
e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 46,000 new cases of atrial fibrillation are
diagnosed in the U.K. each year, according to the NHS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debt markets that have seen junk-
bond yields drop to record lows may face a &#8216;&#8216;substantial
repricing&#8217;&#8217; if interest rates spike or investors begin pulling
money out of fixed-income, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) President
Gary Cohn said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sudden or large increase in rates would be a shock to
markets, presenting &#8216;&#8216;a big risk&#8217;&#8217; with &#8216;&#8216;a low probability,&#8217;&#8217;
Cohn, 52, said in an interview today with Bloomberg Television&#8217;s
Erik Schatzker at the World Economic Forum in Davos,
Switzerland. Such a move would potentially be heightened by a
liquidity shortage as large banks cut holdings to comply with
new capital requirements, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;I&#8217;m concerned when money starts flowing out of fixed-
income funds, with firms trying to reduce their risk-weighted
assets and firms trying to reduce their balance sheets, who will
be the ultimate buyer of those fixed-income products?&#8221; Cohn
said. &#8220;Someone has to buy them, and maybe it takes a fairly
substantial repricing of fixed income to find the next round of
buyers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors have funneled cash into junk bonds at a record
pace as the Federal Reserve holds benchmark interest rates
between zero and 0.25 percent and buys back bonds to suppress
borrowing costs. Bond sales by Spain and Portugal this week are
among signs that the European sovereign-debt crisis has eased.
Buyers of fixed-income products must be told that &#8220;just because
it is a bond doesn&#8217;t mean that it trades at par,&#8221; Cohn said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inventories Drop &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 13 largest investment banks have announced plans to cut
$1.03 trillion in risk-weighted assets, consulting firm McKinsey
 Co. said in a report yesterday. Inventory holdings of
corporate bonds by top dealers have dropped about 40 percent
from two years ago and are less than a quarter of their 2007
peak, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A lot of the banks have a new plan of de-risking their
balance sheets, getting their risk-weighted assets down to try
to improve their equity ratios,&#8221; Cohn said. &#8220;And I&#8217;m not sure
that that capital can come back into the market quick enough&#8221;
if there&#8217;s a sell-off, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohn is not the first to warn of a potential liquidity
squeeze for institutional investors that have driven junk bond
yields to record lows. Greenwich Associates, a consulting firm
that surveys large investors, said in a report this month that
banks have increasingly relied on electronic trade crossing, a
process that depends on a large number of buyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When everyone wants to sell, there will be no one on the
other side to cross trades with and capital-constrained banks
will have no interest in assuming their traditional role of
liquidity backstops,&#8221; Andrew Awad, a Greenwich consultant, said
in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Widest Gap &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on dollar-denominated junk bonds dropped to an
unprecedented 6.46 percent on Jan. 22, and prices rose to 105.6
cents from as low as 54.8 cents in December 2008, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields over benchmarks for junk debt owned by exchange-
traded funds are 2.03 percentage points less than for below-
investment-grade bonds that they don&#8217;t hold, the widest gap on
record, according to Bank of America Corp. The difference
between yields on offerings above and below $400 million has
widened to about the highest level since February 2009, as
investors favor bonds sold in the most liquid batches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portugal sold 2.5 billion euros ($3.34 billion) of five-
year bonds through banks, the first offering of that maturity in
almost two years. Spain sold 7 billion euros of 10-year bonds on
Jan. 22, a sale Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said had the
biggest demand in the nation&#8217;s history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At some point, interest rates will go higher again, and
all of the money that has piled into fixed income over the past
three years, some of it will come out,&#8221; Cohn said. &#8220;We will
clearly be there to facilitate, we will clearly be there to
provide balance sheet and liquidity to our clients, but
ultimately, we can&#8217;t be the buyer of last resort.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A computer hacker from the online
activism group &#8220;Anonymous&#8221; was sentenced in Britain to 18
months in jail for conspiring to attack the websites of Visa
Inc. (V), PayPal Inc., MasterCard Inc. (MA) and others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prison term was handed down today, according to a clerk
at Southwark Crown Court in London. Christopher Weatherhead was
found guilty in December, while three co-defendants -- Jake
Birchall, Ashley Rhodes and Peter Gibson -- pleaded guilty
earlier to conspiring to impair the operation of computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britain&#8217;s Crown Prosecution Service described Weatherhead
in December as a &#8220;cyber-criminal who waged a sophisticated and
orchestrated campaign of online attacks&#8221; on computer systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gibson was ordered to perform 100 hours community service
and given a six-month suspended sentence for two years, meaning
he faces jail if he offends again during that period. Birchall&#8217;s
sentence will be discussed at a hearing scheduled for Feb. 1,
the clerk said. Rhodes&#8217;s sentence hadn&#8217;t been discussed today,
the clerk said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four also targeted the British Recorded Music Industry,
Ministry of Sound and the International Federation of the
Phonographic Industry, prosecutors said. The attacks cost the
companies more than 3.5 million pounds ($5.5 million) in extra
staffing, software and sales losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. police have been investigating &#8220;hacktivist&#8221;
collectives Anonymous and LulzSec for conducting denial-of-
service attacks, which flood computer networks with requests for
information until they shut down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) President Gary Cohn said he&#8217;s &#8220;fairly bullish&#8221; on global stock markets as investors will shift money from bonds to equities as interest rates rise. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The cause of interest rates going up, which is greater economic activity and greater growth, will be very positive for our business,&#8221; Cohn said in an interview today with Bloomberg Television&#8217;s Erik Schatzker at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shares in top companies also offer attractive dividend yields relative to where interest rates are, Cohn said. The dividend yield of the Dow Jones Industrial Average is 2.51 percent, compared with the 1.86 percent yield of 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;I look at the dividend yield that you can receive in relatively blue-chip companies around the world, and I look at that versus risk-free yields, and I think that is an interesting opportunity,&#8221; Cohn said. &#8220;You are long some global growth, you&#8217;re long some inflation, and you get paid a decent return to own those.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cohn contrasted his view on stocks with that on bonds. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Fixed income on the other hand, interesting,&#8221; Cohn said. &#8220;At some point, interest rates will go higher again, and all of the money that has piled into fixed income over the past three years, some of it will come out.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Dow Chemical
Co. (DOW), big-dollar lobbying allies on many issues in Washington,
are on opposite sides of a high-stakes fight over how much of
rising U.S. natural gas supplies should be sold overseas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the nation&#8217;s largest producer of natural gas, says
exports will create jobs, encourage more production and lower
the trade deficit. Dow, the largest U.S. chemical maker by
revenue, uses gas and its byproducts and leads a coalition that
wants to keep prices low by limiting the amount that leaves the
country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two are among the most active corporations in lobbying
Washington, spending a combined $23 million in 2012, according
to public records. They are more often allies than enemies. Both
supported a bill to improve trade relations with Russia last
year, for example. Now they&#8217;re sniping at one another through
competing trade organizations and blog postings on the gas
issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It means a lot of wealth for them, so they are going to
spend a lot of money on an issue that&#8217;s fairly narrow in the
minds of most Americans,&#8221; said James Thurber, director of the
Center for Congressional  Presidential Studies at American
University in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fight shows that while &#8216;&#8216;big business&#8217;&#8217; tends to get
lumped as a single entity in the public&#8217;s mind, in truth
&#8216;&#8216;powerful companies fight each other all the time,&#8217;&#8217; Thurber
said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine&#8217;s economy is set to shrink
in 2013, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said, contradicting Prime
Minister Mykola Azarov&#8217;s 3 percent-4 percent growth forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross domestic product will probably contract 1.8 percent
this year, Andrew Matheny, a Moscow-based analyst at Goldman,
said today by e-mail. GDP, which fell 1.3 percent from a year
earlier in the third quarter, dropped 1.8 percent in the fourth
as industry and export weakness pushed Ukraine into its first
recession since 2009, Goldman Sachs estimated in a Jan. 23 note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ukraine has seen its macroeconomic fundamentals
deteriorate in the past year as a result of a sharp negative
terms-of-trade shock, rising external government redemptions,
and a worsening fiscal position,&#8221; Goldman Sachs wrote. &#8220;The
economy is now likely in a recession.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ukraine is seeking international aid as its economy suffers
from weaker demand for exports such as steel. An International
Monetary Fund mission is due to arrive next week for talks on a
third bailout since 2008 after foreign reserves fell to the
lowest level in almost three years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kitano was ranked Japan&#8217;s No. 2 equity researcher for 2012

held the previous year. JPMorgan spokeswoman Yukako Yoshino
declined to comment. Kitano was not immediately available when

&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL) surrendered the title of the world&#8217;s most valuable company to Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) after concern over slowing growth drove the shares to the biggest loss in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple&#8217;s 12-month reign as the No. 1 stock ended after the shares slumped 17 percent this year, worse than any other companies in the benchmark gauge for U.S. equities. The decline reduced its market capitalization to $413 billion, below Exxon Mobil&#8217;s $418 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The switch in rankings reflected fading confidence in Apple, whose 15 years of transformation from a near-bankrupt personal-computer maker to a technology leader dominating the smartphone and tablet market helped it become the most valuable U.S. company ever in 2012. Apple shares have fallen by 37 percent from a record in September amid concern that mounting costs and competition may curtail growth. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;You have one company that had pretty high expectations for it for the future and you have Exxon that continues to chip away slow and steady,&#8221; Jason Cooper, who helps oversee $2.5 billion in South Bend, Indiana, at 1st Source Investment Advisors, said in a phone interview. His firm owns both Apple and Exxon shares. &#8220;People are coming to the realization that Apple is losing a little bit of gloss and shine.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;iPads, iPhones &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;About $245 billion has been erased from Apple&#8217;s value since the Cupertino, California-based company rose to an all-time high in September. Even as Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook guided Apple to record iPad and iPhone sales, investors worry about management&#8217;s ability to keep producing hit products more than a year after the death of co-founder Steve Jobs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) and others have followed Apple&#8217;s lead into the era of mobile touch-screen devices and are grabbing market share by introducing smartphones in various designs and prices. In the tablet market, Apple&#8217;s dominance is threatened by rivals such as Google Inc. (GOOG), which made its first foray with its Nexus 7 device. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple sank 12 percent yesterday after posting the slowest quarterly profit growth since 2003. Earnings will continue to worsen in the current quarter, with analysts projecting a 14 percent drop, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There was little room for imperfection,&#8221; Mark Moskowitz, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase  Co. in San Francisco, said in a phone interview. &#8220;Investors jumped into the parade alongside growth in tech. They forgot that Apple is taking on a herculean effort.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Earnings Rebound &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil regained its No. 1 rank, which the Irving, Texas-based company had kept in four out of the six years through 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The stock is up almost 6 percent this year as profit is forecast to rebound from three quarters of declines. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alan Jeffers, an Exxon spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The energy producer may say on Feb. 1 that fourth-quarter earnings increased 2 percent, analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg show, as Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson stepped up acquisitions and capital spending to reverse the longest stretch of quarterly production slides in 13 years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re getting closer to maybe an inflection point as we enter 2014, where that growth could improve,&#8221; Brian Youngberg, an analyst with Edward Jones  Co. in St. Louis, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;Investors pick up on that ahead of time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple may reclaim its top spot if analysts&#8217; price estimates come true. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Valuation Premium &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shares of Apple will climb to $627.79 (AAP) over the next 12 months, implying a market value of about $589.5 billion, according to analyst projections compiled by Bloomberg. At the same time, Exxon Mobil&#8217;s market value will reach $434 billion, based on the average share-price forecast of $95.17. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investors are now willing to pay more for Exxon Mobil&#8217;s earnings, driving its valuation premium over Apple&#8217;s to levels not seen in 12 years. The energy producer is trading at 11.7 times reported income, compared with Apple&#8217;s multiple of less than 10, data compiled by Bloomberg. The gap was biggest since December 2000. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Apple is cheap, nobody disputes that, but somehow all the good facts are interpreted through a different lens now than they were six months ago,&#8221; Daniel Arbess, who runs Perella Weinberg Partners LP&#8217;s Xerion hedge fund, said in a Bloomberg Television interview on &#8220;Surveillance&#8221; with Tom Keene. &#8220;Apple is a perfect allegory for what investment sentiment is all about in this world.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Hannah Benjamin" date="Jan 25, 2013 12:16 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-25/goldman-sachs-selling-first-benchmark-euro-bonds-for-18-months.html"><headline>Goldman Sells Its First Benchmark Bonds in Euros for 1 1/2 Years</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) raised 1
billion euros ($1.3 billion) from its first benchmark sale in
the currency for 1 1/2 years, just a week after issuing $6
billion of debt in its biggest deal ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank sold 3.25 percent senior, unsecured 10-year
notes that were priced to yield 155 basis points more than the
swap rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The deal
lifts total corporate bond sales in Europe this week to about 19
billion euros, matching the previous week&#8217;s volume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is borrowing money as the European Central
Bank said today that banks will hand back more of its three-year
emergency loans than forecast by economists in a Bloomberg News
survey. That boosted investor confidence and helped send the
cost of insuring bank debt down from near a four-week high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s still strong demand for financial debt in
Europe,&#8221; said Georg Grodzki, the head of credit research at
Legal  General Investment Management in London, which manages
more than $600 billion of bonds. &#8220;Yields may be heading up soon
and fast if Goldman Sachs&#8217;s own economic optimism proves
correct&#8221; and interest rates rise, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

since early August, analysts led by Matthew O&#8217;Connor wrote in a
research note by Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank. JPMorgan, which
reported its third record year of profits with $21.3 billion in
net income last year, may see annual operating expenses drop as
much as $5 billion in coming years partly because costs to
service mortgages will drop, according to the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think JPM is the best-positioned market-sensitive bank
for a pickup in consumer loan growth,&#8221; O&#8217;Connor wrote,
referring to New York-based JPMorgan by its stock ticker.
Deutsche Bank upgraded JPMorgan to buy from hold and raised its
12-month price target to $53 from $48. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank lowered Goldman Sachs to hold from buy
because the New York-based bank is trading close to its 12-month
price target of $144. The firm doesn&#8217;t have the same
opportunities for cost savings as JPMorgan, and is trading at a
premium to other large investment banks, O&#8217;Connor said in the
note. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s Lloyd Blankfein, whose bonus for last year almost doubled, said he
would stay as chief executive officer even if the company cut
his pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Not today, no,&#8221; Blankfein said today in an interview on
CNBC, responding to a question about whether he would leave if
the New York-based firm paid him less. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, 58, was granted $13.3 million in restricted
stock for last year that comprises about 70 percent of his total
bonus, a person with knowledge of the matter said last week. On
that basis, the total bonus is about $19 million including $5.7
million in cash, up from a $10 million stock-and-cash award for
2011. Blankfein, who is also the bank&#8217;s chairman, receives a $2
million salary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;ve been in this firm for 30 years,&#8221; Blankfein said in
the interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos. &#8220;Most of my
interest in Goldman Sachs comes from trading in my partnership
interest for stock. So I&#8217;m more of a shareholder than an
employee.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A $21 million total compensation package would be
Blankfein&#8217;s highest since his $68.5 million record in 2007, when
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s earnings per share were 75 percent higher. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein is optimistic that the
worst of the financial crisis is over, according to an interview
with the British Broadcasting Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The moment of crisis is over,&#8221; Blankfein told the BBC.
&#8220;I find a lot of things to be optimistic about, including the
worst expected or worrisome problems that everyone talked about
last year are off the table,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, who became CEO in 2006, has overseen the New
York-based firm&#8217;s highest profits and biggest losses as a public
company. He also warned about the potential for a credit crisis
during a June 2007 conference, 15 months before the collapse of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Problems related to the financial crisis have been chewed
through,&#8221; he told the BBC. &#8220;Net, net I&#8217;m optimistic. That is
my predictive self.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein said the firm&#8217;s deliberations over whether to
defer the payment of incentive compensation due to U.K.
employees until after the top rate of income tax drops April
weren&#8217;t linked to &#8220;tax evasion or tax avoidance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs won&#8217;t delay its distribution of U.K. bonuses
to help minimize employees&#8217; tax rates, a person with direct
knowledge of the decision said earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Koji Wada, a Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) banker in Tokyo, was appointed head coach of the Keio
University rugby team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wada, vice president and salesman in the fixed income,
currency and commodity division, will start the role on Feb. 24,
according to a statement released today by the Keio University
rugby alumni association. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It hasn&#8217;t been decided whether Wada, 34, will remain
employed by Goldman Sachs, said Sumiko Iwadate, a spokeswoman
for the U.S. bank in Tokyo. The Asahi newspaper reported his
appointment earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wada joined New York-based Goldman Sachs in 2001 after
graduating from Keio, where he played rugby and helped the team
win the university championship in the 1999-2000 season,
according to the statement. Keio hasn&#8217;t won it since then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;College rugby matches in Japan, such as the annual fixture
between Keio and Tokyo rival Waseda University, regularly draw
thousands of fans. Masanori Mochida, head of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
Japan unit, played fullback for Keio. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iraq&#8217;s oil minister asked Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM) to stop dealing with Kurds if it wants to work with
the central government even as he proceeded with plans for BP
Plc (BP/) to develop fields in northern areas claimed by the Kurdish
authorities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), Total SA (FP) and Exxon, which operates the West
Qurna-1 oil field in southern Iraq, are among companies that
have angered the central government with proposals to explore in
the Kurdish area. While the Baghdad authorities don&#8217;t recognize
contracts signed by the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional
Government without their permission, foreign investors say
Kurdish authorities offer them more attractive terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Any company that signs deals without the approval of the
central government, we don&#8217;t deal with them,&#8221; Oil Minister
Abdul Kareem al-Luaibi said in Baghdad today. &#8220;We can&#8217;t allow
Exxon to step over the constitution. It can&#8217;t continue to work
in both places at the same time, they have to choose to work
either in Iraq or in Kurdistan. We are waiting for a final
answer in the coming few days.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central government and the Kurds are entangled in a
feud over disputed land and the sharing of energy revenue. The
Kurdistan Regional Government halted exports of crude by
pipeline last month, with shipments currently limited to volumes
being trucked to Turkey. Iraq is seeking to boost oil sales to
rebuild the economy after decades of wars and sanctions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disputed Territory &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In turn, the Kurdish authorities said in a Jan. 17
statement that the central government would be acting illegally
if it proceeds with a plan to allow BP, Europe&#8217;s second-biggest
energy company, to work on oil fields in disputed territory. BP
made a &#8220;good offer&#8221; to develop the Kirkuk fields and the Oil
Ministry in Baghdad has sent the proposal to the government
energy committee for approval, al-Luaibi said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq started to export crude through a second single-point
mooring facility in the south of the country, al-Luaibi told
reporters today. The nation also signed an agreement with Kuwait
Energy Co. and Dubai-based partner Dragon Oil Plc (DGO) to explore and
develop oil in Block 9 along Iraq&#8217;s border with Iran. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuwait Energy plans to invest $125 million in the field as
the company is optimistic about finding commercial quantities of
oil, Chief Executive Officer Sara Akbar said at a ceremony in
Baghdad. Iraq replaced Turkiye Petrolleri AO with Kuwait Energy
for the project to develop the block in November, without giving
any public explanation. The agreement is one of four licenses
awarded since an energy auction last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq holds the world&#8217;s fifth-largest crude reserves,
according to BP&#8217;s Statistical Review of World Energy. The nation
is the biggest producer, after Saudi Arabia, in the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) sold $29.9 million of six-month structured notes tied to Apple Inc. (AAPL) the day before the company announced earnings that sent its stock plunging 12 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The securities, issued Jan. 22, yield 10 percent a year, plus any gains of the stock up to 11.25 percent, according to a prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. If Apple drops, the notes -- which were sold at a face value about the same as a share of the Cupertino, California-based company -- decline at the same rate, providing no protection against losses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The notes are Goldman Sachs&#8217;s largest offering tied to the company since Feb. 24, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Structured notes, which are bank debt packaged with derivatives, allow individual investors to take bets on everything from the price of gold to movements in stock volatility. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tiffany Galvin, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, declined to comment on the offering. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related story: A Devil''s Bargain Faces Investors in Popular Structured Notes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notes tied to single stocks or indexes tend to limit the amount that investors can lose by including so-called barriers or principal protection, Bloomberg data show. Goldman sold $14 million of automatically callable three-year notes tied to the iPad maker on Jan. 4, the second-largest Apple note this month, that yield 9.2 percent a year and shield investor capital as long as the stock doesn&#8217;t fall more than 30 percent, according to a prospectus filed with the SEC. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple shares tumbled on Jan. 24 after the company posted the slowest profit growth since 2003 and the smallest sales increase in 14 quarters. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Popular Reference &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last year, investors bought $1.75 billion of structured notes tied to Apple, making it the second-most popular reference measure after the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index, Bloomberg data show. Notes linked to Apple surpassed those tied to the London interbank offered rate for the first time since at least 2010, when Bloomberg began collecting comprehensive data on the securities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investors have bought $65.6 million of Apple-linked notes in January. On the day before the earnings report, HSBC Holdings Plc&#8217;s U.S. banking unit also sold $710,000 of notes tied to the company, and UBS AG issued $120,000 of securities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Structured notes offer customized bets to retail investors while banks earn fees and raise money from selling the products.

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) paid about
$35.7 million for an interest in eight Ormat Technologies Inc. (ORA)
geothermal power plants in California and Nevada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan plans to pay Ormat an additional $8.7 million for
25 percent of the value of production tax credits generated by
the plants through the end of 2016, the Reno, Nevada-based
developer said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called tax equity investment gives JPMorgan
production tax credits and accelerated depreciation benefits
that Ormat isn&#8217;t able to use, because &#8220;we generate more
deductions for tax purposes than we are currently able to
utilize,&#8221; Ormat Chief Executive Officer Dita Bronicki said in
the statement. The production tax credit for geothermal is 2.2
cents a kilowatt-hour and applies to the first 10 years of a
plant&#8217;s operation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eight plants are part of Ormat&#8217;s Ormesa, Heber and
Mammoth complexes in California and its Steamboat and Brady
complexes in Nevada, Bronicki said today in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan invested $24.9 million in four of Ormat&#8217;s Nevada
facilities in a similar transaction in February 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) to boost its image abroad as the most corrupt country among the Group of 20 last year seeks to attract foreign investors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Economy Ministry and the Russian Direct Investment Fund have signed a memorandum with Goldman under which the New York-based bank will advise on issues such as communicating government decisions, according to Deputy Economy Minister Sergei Belyakov. State-owned banks including OAO Sberbank (SBER) and VTB Group will also assist, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t know how to communicate with investors,&#8221; Belyakov told reporters today in Moscow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;President Vladimir Putin last year ordered the government to improve Russia&#8217;s standing in the World Bank&#8217;s Doing Business rating to 20th by 2018. It climbed eight positions to 112 in the latest study, issued in October. While that&#8217;s better than BRIC peers India and Brazil, Russia is still the worst among major economies in terms of graft, Transparency International said last month in its annual Corruption Perceptions Index. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest energy exporter plans to raise a record $10 billion from asset sales this year, First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov said in an interview with Bloomberg Television this month. While corruption continues to be an issue, it&#8217;s less of an issue for foreign investors who have already committed to Russia, Shuvalov said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Stocks, Ruble &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Russia&#8217;s benchmark Micex Index (INDEXCF) has gained 6 percent this year, beating the MSCI&#8217;s Emerging Markets Index&#8217;s 0.7 percent advance. The ruble-denominated equity gauge was little changed at 1,563.37 by the close of trade in Moscow. The ruble, which has gained 1.3 percent against the dollar in 2013, fell 0.5 percent to 30.1920. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A working group will draw up a list of measures to bolster Russia&#8217;s image next month, according to Belyakov. The group will include Economy Ministry, Goldman and state bank representatives, as well as Finance Minister Anton Siluanov and central bank Chairman Sergey Ignatiev, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The death in custody in 2009 of Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer for Hermitage Capital Management Ltd. who accused officials of embezzling $230 million, is a symbol of Russia&#8217;s failure to tackle corruption, according to Christopher Granville, managing director of Trusted Sources, a London-based emerging-markets research group. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tax Charges &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Magnitsky and Hermitage head William Browder are being tried in absentia on tax-evasion charges. Browder, who denies wrongdoing, has lobbied for U.S. and European legislation targeting Russian officials who he says are responsible for Magnitsky&#8217;s death with visa bans and asset freezes. Hermitage was once Russia&#8217;s biggest foreign equity investor. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;To say that Russia is equal only to this tragedy is not quite right,&#8221; Belyakov said, referring to Magnitsky&#8217;s death. &#8220;To some degree the work that we announced today is to ensure that all our actions won&#8217;t be annulled by statements like those from Browder.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. in December imposed a visa ban and asset freeze on Russian officials implicated in Magnitsky&#8217;s death. In retaliation, Russia banned the adoption of Russian children in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that Magnitsky&#8217;s death has been &#8220;politicized&#8221; by investors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Hannah Benjamin" date="Jan 28, 2013 11:23 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-28/jpmorgan-sells-bonds-as-new-issues-make-slowest-start-since-2008.html"><headline>JPMorgan Sells Euro Bonds in Slowest New Issue Start Since 2008</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), which sold 10-
year dollar bonds at a record low 3.2 percent two weeks ago,
priced similar-maturity notes in euros as debt sales in the
currency head for the slowest January since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. bank by assets, which last issued euro
debt in November, sold 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) of bonds
to yield 95 basis points above the swap rate, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with the 155 basis-point
spread Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) paid on 10-year debt it sold
Jan. 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are poised to overtake industrial companies as the
safest borrowers in the $5.1 trillion U.S. corporate bond market
for the first time since the start of the financial crisis,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investors demand an
extra 154 basis points in yield over benchmarks to buy bonds of
JPMorgan, Wells Fargo  Co. and other lenders, compared with 138
basis points for companies from Alcoa Inc. (AA) to Ford Motor Co.,
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Financials are perhaps dominating sales so far this year
as they issued about 30 percent less debt in 2012 than they had
in redemptions,&#8221; said Jonathan Pitkanen, the London-based head
of credit research at Threadneedle Asset Management Ltd. &#8220;The
macro environment in Europe doesn&#8217;t look to be improving which
is why perhaps investors are becoming more wary of buying the
bonds of non-financial corporates.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interest Payments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost for banks to convert euro interest payments into
dollars is holding near a 20-month low. The three-month cross-
currency basis swap was little changed at 14 basis points below
Euribor, the lowest cost to swap since May 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s 1.5 billion euros of 2.75 percent bonds due in
10 years which it sold in August yield 83 basis points more than
swaps, 17 tighter than at issue, Bloomberg data show. The spread
on Goldman Sachs&#8217; 3.25 percent debt due February 2023 has
tightened five basis points since issue last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick Burton, a spokesman for JPMorgan in London,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s sales lift corporate bond issuance in euros and
pounds to 60.1 billion euros ($80.8 billion) so far this year,
the slowest start to a year since 2008 when 34 billion euros
were issued in the first three weeks of January, according to
Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BASF SE (BAS) offered the only non-financial benchmark-sized bond
in the single currency, Bloomberg data show. It priced 500
million euros of eight-year notes to yield 38 basis points more
than swaps, the tight end of the 40 basis point range initially
marketed, a person with knowledge of that deal said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Good Value&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There has been lots of seven-year to 10-year maturity
issuance which is desirable if you are a treasurer but
introduces an element of volatility for investors versus more
traditional five-year paper,&#8221; said Jens Vanbrabant, lead
portfolio manager at London-based investment firm ECM Asset 
Management Ltd. &#8220;Nevertheless there are areas that still 
represent good value.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In derivatives markets, the Markit iTraxx Financial Index
of credit-default swaps on the senior debt of banks and insurers
rose one basis point to 136 at 3:35 p.m. in London. The Markit
iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with investment-grade
ratings increased one basis point to 106. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps
on 50 companies with mostly high-yield ratings added two basis
points to 422. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros of debt from default for five years is equivalent
to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Siemens AG (SIE) has chosen Goldman Sachs

Reuters reported, citing two people familiar with matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale may officially begin in the second quarter, the
news agency said, citing the sources. Siemens announced plans to
dispose of the water unit, which has annual sales of about 1
billion euros ($1.35 billion), in November. Siemens and Goldman
Sachs declined to comment, Reuters said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several potential bidders have approached Munich-based
Siemens, according to the news agency. It said industry sources
expect Xylem Inc. (XYL) and Pentair Ltd. (PNR) to be interested as much of
Siemens&#8217;s water business is focused on North America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asian suitors may include Kurita Water Industries Ltd. (6370),
Hyflux Ltd. (HYF), Hitachi Ltd. (6501) and Marubeni Corp. (8002), one of the people

interest, Reuters said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) is closing Junction
Point Studios, the maker of the &#8220;Epic Mickey&#8221; video games, as
the world&#8217;s largest media company works to boost results in its
money-losing interactive division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Disney declined to say how many jobs were
eliminated by shuttering the Austin, Texas-based studio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger is
restructuring the company&#8217;s interactive division, which designs
games and websites, and has said it will be profitable in 2013
after six years of losses totaling $1.6 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month, Burbank, California-based Disney unveiled a new
game platform called Infinity that is designed to reduce some of
the cost in releasing new games. Characters and storylines from
new Disney movies can be added to the Infinity system without
all of the expense of developing games from scratch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junction Point, founded by game designer Warren Spector,
designed the 2010 &#8220;Epic Mickey&#8221; game, a merger of current
video-game technology with classic Disney characters that sold
2.6 million copies. Last year&#8217;s sequel, &#8220;Epic Mickey 2,&#8221; has
sold 529,000, according to market researcher NPD Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was with much sadness that we informed our teams today
of changes to our games organization, which include the closure
of Junction Point Studios,&#8221; Disney said in a statement. &#8220;These
changes are part of our ongoing effort to address the fast-
evolving gaming platforms and marketplace and to align resources
against our key priorities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares fell 0.7 percent to $53.96 at 2:39 p.m. in New
York. Disney rose 33 percent last year compared with a 13
percent gain for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost-cutting comes as sales of games for consoles such
as Sony Corp.&#8217;s (SNE) PlayStation and Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s (MSFT) Xbox are in

&lt;p&gt;U.S. companies from Pfizer Inc. (PFE) to
3M Co. (MMM) are beating analysts&#8217; quarterly sales estimates at the
highest rate in 1 1/2 years, undeterred by political gridlock in
Washington and slowing demand in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 175 companies in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index that
have reported fourth-quarter results so far, 67 percent have
exceeded analysts&#8217; average revenue projections. That&#8217;s the
highest percentage since the second quarter of 2011, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Fewer than half the companies had
surprise sales gains in the second and third quarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, today reported
revenue of $15.1 billion, beating the estimate of $14.4 billion
in its biggest positive surprise in five quarters. 3M, which
reaches both companies and consumers with products from
sandpaper to Post-it sticky notes, last week exceeded
projections on its best sales gain in a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are seeing a pickup in global growth and business
activity, so companies are beating&#8221; estimates, Nick Raich,
research director at KeyCorp&#8217;s private banking unit in
Cleveland, said yesterday. The unit manages about $25 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford Motor Co. (F) topped fourth-quarter sales estimates today
with a 5.8 percent increase on higher F-Series pickup demand.
Ford&#8217;s automotive revenue rose to $34.5 billion, ahead of the
$33 billion average prediction on higher F-Series pickup demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO), the largest U.S. Web portal, yesterday posted
a 4.5 percent sales increase for its biggest jump in more than
four years. The Sunnyvale, California-based company in 2012
recorded its first revenue gain in four years after collecting
higher prices for ads placed on the company&#8217;s pages and
increasing revenue from search-related marketing messages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Markets Respond &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo&#8217;s profit also beat estimates, putting it among the 76
percent of SP 500 companies reporting so far that exceeded
earnings projections. The third-quarter rate was 71 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While sales gains for SP 500 (SPX) companies may more than
quadruple to 4.6 percent by this year&#8217;s third quarter, based on
estimates compiled by Bloomberg, the results may be uneven.
Ford, for example, today said its 2013 loss in Europe may be
bigger than its previous projection because a possible recession
would sap demand for cars. And yesterday, Yahoo&#8217;s sales
forecasts for the current quarter and 2013 fell short of
analysts&#8217; predictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, stock markets worldwide are reflecting companies&#8217;
improving performances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 rose 5.2 percent this year through yesterday,
aided by low interest and mortgage rates that have spurred
borrowing and demand for housing. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)
rose about 3.5 percent in the same period while the FTSE MIB
Index (FTSEMIB), consisting of 40 stocks listed on the Borsa Italiana,
climbed 10 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Sustained Growth&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The economic fundamentals are increasingly warming for
sustained economic growth and higher equity prices,&#8221; Ed Hyman,
chairman of New York-based International Strategy  Investment
Group, wrote today in a note to clients. &#8220;Despite tax hikes and
budget-negotiations overhang, weekly, monthly and first-quarter
preliminary economic data seems robust.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;St. Paul, Minnesota-based 3M boosted sales by 4.2 percent
with higher demand in the U.S., Latin America and China. Sales
from existing businesses climbed 16 percent in China, even as
economic growth slowed in Asia last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For the base business we see a recovery coming and we
feel optimistic about that,&#8221; 3M Chief Executive Officer Inge Thulin told analysts last week. &#8220;We&#8217;re still cautious.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting that caution, some of the companies are matching
or beating previously lowered forecasts. Peoria, Illinois-based
Caterpillar Inc. (CAT), the largest maker of construction and mining
equipment, yesterday reported revenue sank 6.8 percent, matching
the average estimate, as machinery dealers cut orders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Caterpillar Forecasts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The second half of 2012 really sputtered,&#8221; Caterpillar
CEO Doug Oberhelman said in a Jan. 28 interview on Bloomberg
Television. &#8220;We had the fiscal cliff, the steady din of that,
we had the uncertainty of an election.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, Oberhelman said he is &#8220;pretty optimistic about
&#8217;13 around the world.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worldwide economy may grow at least 2.5 percent this
year, up from about 2.3 percent in 2012, Caterpillar projected.
The company sees U.S. economic growth of at least 2.5 percent,
helped by housing, and 8.5 percent expansion in China as its
government boosts credit growth and infrastructure spending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., economic growth shows signs of withstanding
political debates about federal deficits and spending. Orders
for durable goods rose in December for an unprecedented fourth
straight month, indicating manufacturing will improve in 2013, a
Commerce Department report showed Jan. 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8220;Broad-Based Gain&#8221; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see just basically broad-based gain,&#8221; John Herrmann,
president of Herrmann Forecasting LLC in Summit, New Jersey,
said in an interview yesterday on Bloomberg Radio&#8217;s &#8220;Bloomberg
Surveillance.&#8221; &#8220;This is just a solid report. We are seeing
more risk taking by businesses and by investors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Businesses don&#8217;t yet know whether lawmakers will avert
across-the-board government spending cuts scheduled to begin
March 1, even after the fiscal pact passed by Congress on Jan. 1
avoided sweeping tax increases that had threatened to crimp
consumer spending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our visibility to forecast the coming couple of months is
extremely limited,&#8221; Erik Gershwind, CEO of MSC Industrial
Direct Co., told analysts earlier this month. Fiscal first-
quarter revenue for the Melville, New York-based company missed
analysts&#8217; estimates, as did its profit forecast for the second
quarter, after customers restrained orders, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, Caterpillar&#8217;s CEO said 2013 is shaping up for
improved performance worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;China certainly is stronger today,&#8221; Oberhelman told
Bloomberg Television. &#8220;Latin America looks pretty good. Boy,
the drumbeat out of Europe is sure behind us. All the bad news
is out, at least for a while.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;ll take more than an Excel
spreadsheet to help you figure out the latest version of
Microsoft (MSFT) Office. Maybe a degree from the London School of
Economics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s been awhile since a new version of Office stirred a
lot of excitement. So much has already been built into the
world&#8217;s most popular productivity suite over the years that it&#8217;s
hard to get too worked up over new features. Threaded comments
in Word! Recommended PivotTables in Excel! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the new Office is worth paying attention to for a
couple of reasons. It&#8217;s the first one designed for use in the
era of cloud-connected devices, touchscreens and tablets. And
Microsoft is radically changing how it&#8217;s priced and sold to
consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cloud -- in this case, Microsoft&#8217;s Office.com website
and SkyDrive service -- is integral to the new offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facing a threat from Google (GOOG)&#8217;s online suite of productivity
applications, Microsoft has adopted a hybrid model. Unlike the
Google Docs approach, major Office components are still
installed locally on your computer, giving you full access and
flexibility even when you are offline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#8217;re signed into Office.com, your files, formatting
and preferred settings will be seamlessly saved to SkyDrive,
giving you access to your work even if you&#8217;re signing in from
another computer -- or a Windows Phone, for that matter. If
you&#8217;re not online, changes you make locally to a file will be
automatically synced the next time you connect. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IRobot Corp. (IRBT), the company that makes
robotic vacuum cleaners, floor-scrubbers and gutter-cleaners,
has applied for a patent on robotic assembly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to application 20130015596, published in the
database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Jan. 17, this
technology is related to the three-dimensional printing and
manufacturing process. IRobot said in the application that this
would be a fully automated process without human intervention
and labor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bedford, Massachusetts-based manufacturing company said
the technology would increase the quality of a finished product
because it would be made all in one, without the need to attach
additional components. In what it calls &#8220;traditional 3-D
printing,&#8221; connectors and fasteners are often required to
attach component parts to each other, and these connection
points are often the site of product failure, IRobot said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The machine that performs this operation would be a six-
axis industrial robot that handles product from seed component
to mature product, through the use of 3-D printing, milling and
drilling, according to the application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IRobot filed this patent application in June 2012.
According to the application, the two assignees or owners of the
patent are IRobot and Raytheon BBN Technologies Corp. of
Cambridge, Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Allergan Wins Appeal Upholding Patent for Lumigan Eye Treatment &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allergan Inc. won a U.S. appeals court ruling yesterday
that prevents Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) and Novartis
AG (NOVN)&#8217;s Sandoz unit from selling a generic version of the glaucoma
treatment Lumigan until August 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A disputed patent -- 5,688,819 -- which covers Lumigan&#8217;s
active ingredient bimatoprost and its use to treat ocular
hypertension or glaucoma is valid and infringed, the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington said in an
opinion posted on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allegan had filed the suit in federal court in Delaware in
May 2009. The appeals court upheld a September 2011 lower-court
victory for Allergan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeal is Allergan v. Barr Labs, 12-01040, U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The lower court case is
Allergan Inc. V. Barr Laboratories Inc., 1:09-cvc-00333-SLR-MPT,
U.S. District Court, District of Delaware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Merial Sued Over Patent for Frontline Pet Flea, Tick Treatment &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merial Ltd., an animal-health products unit of Sanofi (SAN),
France&#8217;s largest drugmaker, was sued by Horizon Valley Generics
Inc., which asked for a ruling that it doesn&#8217;t violate Merial&#8217;s
patent for Frontline flea and tick control products for pets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the complaint, filed yesterday in federal court in
Delaware, Horizon Valley claims that Merial has &#8220;consistently
and aggressively litigated or threatened to litigate&#8221; its
patent  6,096,329 in attempts to stop potential competitors from
developing or selling any products that could compete with
Frontline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilmington, Delaware-based Horizon Valley said it&#8217;s already
sought approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for a
competing flea and tick product for cats and dogs, and plans to
introduce it into the market as a generic alternative for
Frontline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Horizon Valley Generics Inc. v. Merial Ltd.,
U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mega Brands Claims Amloid&#8217;s Big Blocks Infringe Trade Dress &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mega Brands Inc., a Canadian maker of construction toys,
sued a New Jersey-based competitor for infringing its trade
dress. Trade dress is protected under U.S. trademark law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the suit filed Jan. 23 in federal court in
Santa Ana, California, Amloid Corp. of Denville, New Jersey, is
accused of producing a line of construction toys that are
confusingly similar to Mega&#8217;s Mega Blocks toy line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Montreal-based toymaker says in its pleadings that
Amloid&#8217;s Big Blocks toy line is too similar to the MEGA products
in terms of the configuration of the blocks, the packaging and
some of the construction toys that are to be used with the
blocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mega claims that the infringement is intentional, will
cause consumer confusion, and that the lookalike products will
harm its own reputation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company asked the court to bar further infringement,
and an order for the destruction of all infringing products,
packaging and promotional material, and for awards of money
damages, litigation costs and attorney fees. Mega is also
requesting additional damages to punish Amloid for its actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amloid didn&#8217;t respond immediately to an e-mailed request
for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Mega Brands Inc. (MB) v. Amloid Corp., 8:13-cv-
00108-CJC-MLG, U.S. District Court, Central District of
California (Santa Ana). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Microsoft Sues Electronic-Products Recycler for Infringement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s largest software company, sued
a company that offers electronic-equipment recycling for
copyright infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint filed Jan. 25 in federal court
in Arizona, E-Waste Harvesters Inc. is accused of advertising
and selling computers with unauthorized copies of Microsoft
software installed. The Redmond, California-based software
company said that the sales have continued even after it warned
E-Waste Harvesters of the consequences of its actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to copyright infringement, Microsoft also
accused Phoenix-based E-Waste Harvesters of infringing
trademarks and of using false representations of the software
company&#8217;s packaging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public is likely to be confused by E-Waste Harvester&#8217;s
actions, and to assume falsely that the software company has
authorized the use of its copyrighted material and trademarks,
Microsoft claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It asked the court to order the Arizona company to halt its
allegedly infringing activities, and to order the seizure of all
infringing products in E-Waste Harvesters&#8217; possession. Microsoft
has requested awards of money damages, profits derived from the
infringing actions, attorney fees and litigation costs. It also
asked for a tripling of the damages and profits awards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E-Waste Harvesters didn&#8217;t respond immediately to an
e-mailed request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) v. E-Waste Harvesters Inc.,
2:13-cv-00169-DKD, U.S. District Court, District of Arizona
(Phoenix) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Life of Pi&#8217; Tops List of Films Most Illegally Downloaded &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the number of unauthorized downloads of a movie were an
indication of which film would win the best-picture Academy
Award, &#8220;Life of Pi,&#8221; would win, according to a chart posted on
the TorrentFreak anti-copyright news website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second place goes to &#8220;Silver Linings Playbook,&#8221; followed
in order by &#8220;Skyfall,&#8221; &#8220;Django Unchained,&#8221; and &#8220;Argo.&#8221; The
movies were downloaded through the use of the BitTorrent file-
sharing protocol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Academy Awards ceremony will be held Feb. 24 in Los
Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Colombian Constitutional Court Rejects New Copyright Law &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombia&#8217;s copyright law was ruled unconstitutional by the
nation&#8217;s constitutional court, according to Columbia Reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law had been passed as part of the free trade agreement
between the U.S. and Colombia that went into effect last year,
according to the Colombia Reports website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court agreed with Colombian Senator Jorge Robledo, who
had argued against the law, saying it unfairly limited Internet
users&#8217; rights to have access to and share information, the
website reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Antigua Given WTO Approval to Suspend IP Treaty Obligations &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Trade Organization has granted Antigua and
Barbados authorization to suspend treaty obligations it has with
the U.S. related to intellectual property rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a statement posted on the island nation&#8217;s
website yesterday, the remedy, &#8220;contrary to what the United
States has publicly stated, will not constitute &#8216;piracy&#8217; or
theft of intellectual property rights.&#8221; The government went on
to say that it has tried for almost a decade to resolve a
dispute with the U.S. with respect to what it calls &#8220;remote
gaming.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actions by the U.S. to block U.S. residents access to the
online gambling websites in Antigua &#8220;has resulted in the loss
of thousands of good paying jobs and seizure by the Americans of
billions of dollars belonging to gaming operators and their
customers in financial institutions across the world,&#8221;
according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The online gambling industry was at one point the second-
largest employer in Antigua, which was worth &#8220;over $3.4 billion
to the Antiguan economy,&#8221; the government said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative responded to
the news of the WTO actions. USTR spokesman Sean Spicer said in
a statement that the U.S. is presently &#8220;engaged in compensation
negotiations with Antigua and six other WTO members that have
claimed to be affected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that once the process of &#8220;clarifying the U.S.
schedule of commitments is completed,&#8221; the issues of the
nation&#8217;s dispute with Antigua will be moot and there will no
longer be any basis for suspending WTO commitments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WTO had previously found that the U.S. gambling laws
related to Internet gambling on horse racing weren&#8217;t in
compliance with treaty obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. had taken exception to the $3.4 billion figure put
forth by Antigua. According to the USTR statement, that amount
is more than three times the size of Antigua&#8217;s entire economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Izumi, an executive director who covered industrial and

&lt;p&gt;Total SA and Chevron Corp. both
failed to buy North Sea Forties crude at a lower price than
yesterday. There were no bids or offers for Russian Urals grade
in northwest Europe or the Mediterranean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PT Pertamina, Indonesia&#8217;s state-owned oil company, issued a
tender to buy low-sulfur crude for delivery for three months
from April to June, said a company official. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;North Sea &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total sought to buy Forties at 50 cents a barrel more than
Dated Brent for loading Feb. 17 to Feb. 23, a Bloomberg survey
of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window
showed. That&#8217;s 5 cents less than its equivalent bid yesterday
and compares with cargoes it bought on Jan. 22 at premiums of 35
cents and 40 cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron was also unsuccessful with its bid at plus 45 cents
for a cargo loading on the same dates, according to the survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days rose 6 cents to 69 cents a barrel more than Dated
Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent for March settlement traded at $114.71 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $114.28 in the previous session. The April
contract was at $113.69, a discount of $1.02 to March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mediterranean/Urals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were no bids or offers for Urals crude, the Platts
survey showed. Gunvor Group Ltd. bid unsuccessfully yesterday
for 100,000 metric tons at a discount of 90 cents a barrel to
Dated Brent on a delivered basis to Rotterdam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Urals differential to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
widened by 2 cents a barrel to minus 30 cents, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. In northwest Europe, the discount
increased to 88 cents from 86 cents yesterday, the data showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PKN Orlen SA bought 100,000 tons of Urals from Glencore
International Plc for loading Feb. 19 to Feb. 23 from either
Primorsk or Ust-Luga via an informal closed tender, according to
three people with knowledge of the matter. The company yesterday
bought a Feb. 15 to Feb. 19 cargo from Vitol Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OAO Surgutneftegas sold two lots of Urals to Gunvor and
Repsol SA for loading next month from Ust-Luga, according to
four traders who participate in the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gunvor bought the Feb. 13 to Feb. 14 consignment while
Repsol purchased the Feb. 15 to Feb. 16 lot, the people said,
asking not to be identified as the information is confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surgut issued a separate tender today, offering shipments
of 100,000 tons each for loading on Feb. 19 and Feb. 20 and Feb.
21 to Feb. 22 from Ust-Luga and for Feb. 23 to Feb. 24 from
Primorsk, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since taking office in 1999, Hugo Chavez has spread his socialist revolution in Venezuela by
seizing more than 1,000 companies. For bondholders that stuck by
him, he&#8217;s also delivered returns that are double the emerging-
market average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 681 percent advance, equal to 14.7 percent annually,
has enriched investors from OppenheimerFunds Inc. to Goldman
Sachs Asset Management LP that counted on Chavez&#8217;s willingness
to siphon the country&#8217;s oil wealth to pay its creditors in the
face of start-stop growth and falling reserves. While his
policies drove away enough investors to keep Venezuela&#8217;s
borrowing costs over 12 percent on average during his tenure, or
4 percentage points higher than those of developing nations,
he&#8217;s never missed a bond payment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a really great high-income and high-total-return
investment for your portfolio,&#8221; said Sara Zervos, an emerging-
market debt manager at New York-based OppenheimerFunds, which
oversees $176 billion in assets and has invested in Venezuelan
notes for more than a decade. &#8220;Chavez hasn&#8217;t done a lot of good
for his country, but he has the objective to service the bonds.
Our interests are aligned.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as the 58-year-old leader battles cancer, the nation&#8217;s
outsized returns may be nearing an end. While Venezuela&#8217;s
benchmark bonds have climbed to a five-year high since Chavez
said on Dec. 8 that he needed more surgery, they&#8217;re unlikely to
replicate the gains they&#8217;ve posted in the past decade once the
rally drives yields down closer in line with regional peers,
according to Russell Dallen, the head trader at Caracas Capital
Markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Missed Inauguration &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chavez&#8217;s deteriorating health has triggered a 41 percent
bond gain in the past year on speculation that a new regime will
retreat from policies that curtailed oil production in the
country that holds the world&#8217;s largest reserves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chavez missed the inauguration for his third six-year term
on Jan. 10 as he recovered from surgery to treat an undisclosed
type of cancer. Information Minister Ernesto Villegas told
reporters on Jan. 27 that the president is healthy enough to
make economic policy decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former paratrooper and an ally of former Cuban President
Fidel Castro, Chavez has nationalized farms and energy
companies, imposed price caps on products such as toothpaste and
toilet paper and championed companies where workers participate
in decision-making. He has devalued the bolivar four times since
imposing currency controls in 2003, shut down more than 50
foreign-exchange brokerages in 2010 and threatened to jail
people who trade in the black market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oil Surge &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policies have led to shortages of everything from
electricity to sugar and beef, fueled the world&#8217;s third-highest
inflation rate and inflated Venezuelan bond yields. That&#8217;s
rewarded investors willing to buy the debt at discounted prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest-rate payments on Venezuelan bonds exceeded price
gains by 1.4 times since 1999, versus 0.3 for Brazilian bonds
and 1.09 for Mexican securities, according to data compiled by
Bank of America Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chavez has made good on debt payments as crude oil prices
surged to $97 a barrel from $12 in 1998. The government will
earn about $81 billion from oil exports this year, almost 10
times the amount of interest-rate payments and debt redemptions
from the government and state-owned oil company Petroleos de
Venezuela SA, known as PDVSA, according to Citigroup Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 22 percent of gross domestic product, Venezuela&#8217;s net
government debt is lower than the median level of 36 percent
among similar-rated countries, according to Standard  Poor&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;More Fragile&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While the story has been deteriorating, Venezuela will
continue to pay their debt,&#8221; Sam Finkelstein, an emerging-
market bond manager at Goldman Sachs Asset Management in New
York, said in a telephone interview on Jan. 25. &#8220;The situation
will have to be much tighter, more fragile for a default to be
likely.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finkelstein has been an investor in Venezuelan bonds over
the past 15 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venezuelan bonds accounted for about 6.7 percent of the
holdings of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s $2.9 billion Growth  Emerging
Markets Debt Fund (GSEMKDP), the third-biggest investment, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The fund returned 12.8 percent over
the past three years, outperforming 90 percent of its peers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While calling debt the tool used by the U.S. &#8220;empire&#8221; to
exploit Venezuela, Chavez honored his obligations even after a
three-month nationwide strike in 2003 all but shut down the
country&#8217;s oil industry and caused the economy to shrink 7.6
percent that year. He made an interest payment on a bond that is
tied to oil prices in 2005 after a four-month delay prompted SP
to temporally downgrade Venezuela&#8217;s credit rating to selective
default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Makes Noise&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chavez paid off the debt because non-payment would lead
creditors to seize Venezuelan oil shipments, which supply half
of the government&#8217;s revenue, according to Simon Nocera, a former
economist at the International Monetary Fund. Bond investors can
also freeze Venezuelan assets overseas, including refineries and
gas stations of Citgo Petroleum Corp., a subsidiary of PDVSA, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chavez makes noise, but he will never come out and say:
&#8216;We are going to restructure our bonds,&#8217;&#8221; Nocera, now chief
investment officer at Lumen Advisors LLC, said in a telephone
interview from San Francisco on Jan. 23. &#8220;He knows if he does,
he won&#8217;t sell the only product that allows him to survive.
There&#8217;s no reason to be scared.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Default Swaps &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Finance Ministry declined to comment on the country&#8217;s
bond performance in an e-mailed response to questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors have had to endure swings in the value of
Venezuela&#8217;s bonds to reap their gains. Their yield relative to
Treasuries touched an all-time low of 163 basis points, or 1.63
percentage points, in May 2006, before spiking to 1,887 in
December 2008. Investors demand an extra yield of 722 basis
points to hold Venezuelan bonds instead of Treasuries yesterday,
versus 319 basis points for Sri Lanka and 307 for Zambia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the average yields on Venezuelan bonds have fallen to
the lowest since January 2008, their current 9.04 percent level
is still double the emerging-market average of 4.49 percent,
according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. At 605 basis points yesterday,
the country&#8217;s five-year credit-default swaps suggest a 35
percent chance that Venezuela will default by 2018, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The spreads reflect the risk existing in the Venezuelan
economy, and the perception of that risk is real,&#8221; Francisco Rodriguez-Caballero, an economist at Bank of America, said in a
telephone interview on Jan. 23. &#8220;You are always happy when you
win, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s a bet that you should feel
comfortable making.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Zambia Levels &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venezuela&#8217;s credit rating of B+ at SP is four levels below
investment grade and on a par with those of Zambia and Sri
Lanka. Brazil, which was ranked the same as Venezuela 14 years
ago, has been upgraded five steps to BBB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Finkelstein said he still holds a
&#8220;modest&#8221; overweight position in Venezuelan bonds as the
economy is likely to improve after Chavez relinquishes power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to own Venezuela bonds
instead of Treasuries will narrow to about 500 basis points
should the opposition win presidential elections in the post-
Chavez era, leaving them at levels similar to those of Ukraine,
he said. Venezuelan bonds traded at a spread of 722 basis points
over Treasuries at 10:29 a.m. in New York, according to
JPMorgan&#8217;s EMBI Global index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Significant Cushion&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The constitution states that elections must be held within
30 days should Chavez step down or die. Vice President Nicolas Maduro, a Chavez ally, is running the government in his absence.
Henrique Capriles Radonski, who lost to Chavez in October, leads
the opposition party Primero Justicia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors are expecting a regime change,&#8221; Finkelstein
said. &#8220;The new government will be more pragmatic and less
idealist, and bondholders can benefit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Venezuela, other Latin American countries including
Brazil, Panama and Peru rewarded bondholders with gains fueled
by economic growth, slowing inflation and surging foreign
reserves. Brazilian bonds returned 662 percent during the past
14 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rally has squeezed most of the gains out of Brazilian
bonds, leaving Venezuelan securities as a more attractive
option, according to Oppenheimer&#8217;s Zervos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For Brazil, we just don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a lot of
upside,&#8221; Zervos said. &#8220;Chavez squandered a lot of money, but
there&#8217;s still significant cushion and the ability to pay is
still there. The spreads can definitely compress more.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) signed on McDonald&#8217;s Corp. (MCD)&#8217;s South Africa division as a
customer for its business-focused social-networking software,
landing the highest-profile client yet for the product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McDonald&#8217;s will have 8,000 employees in South Africa using
the Connections software, IBM said today in a statement. The
product is part of an effort to create internal networks for
companies, letting employees use Facebook-style tools to
communicate, sign off on documents and report expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM aims to build on the McDonald&#8217;s contract by winning
deals with other retail and food-services business. After years
of sluggish revenue, the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services
provider sees social-networking software as a source of growth.
The company declined to give financial terms for the contract
with McDonald&#8217;s, the largest fast-food chain by sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s really going to attract more companies,&#8221; said Sandy
Carter, vice president of social-business strategy for Armonk,
New York-based IBM. &#8220;McDonald&#8217;s South Africa also demonstrates
that the power of social has moved beyond major markets into the
emerging opportunity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a $1.3 billion acquisition of Kenexa Corp.&#8217;s human-
resources software last year -- along with several data-analysis
companies -- IBM is betting its social software can compete with
offerings from Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Salesforce.com Inc. and Jive
Software Inc. By making it easier for employees to access and
share data, social-networking services will help IBM make $16
billion from business analytics by 2015, the company has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM shares fell less than 1 percent to $203.07 at the close
today in New York. The stock gained 4.2 percent last year,
compared with a 13 percent gain for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
Index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group (GS) Inc. picked
Raanan Agus to manage Liberty Harbor after the credit investment
unit&#8217;s Chief Investment Officer Gregg Felton quit this week,
ending a six-year tenure there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brendan McGovern and Sal Lentini will be the co-heads of
Liberty Harbor&#8217;s investment team, reporting to Agus, who is also
global co-head of Goldman Sachs Investment Partners, according
to an internal memo sent on Jan. 28. Andrea Raphael, a
spokeswoman for the New York-based bank, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McGovern was head of research and Lentini was head of
credit trading in the Liberty Harbor team, according to the
memo. Both were also senior portfolio managers. Agus will
continue to run GSIP, a hedge fund that handles client money,
with Ken Eberts, the firm said in the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McGovern and Lentini were part of a 17-person team led by
Felton that Goldman Sachs hired in 2006 from defunct hedge fund
Amaranth Advisors LLC. Liberty Harbor, which is part of Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s asset management group, is a global multi-strategy fund
that seeks to profit from mispriced securities in credit
markets, according to the bank&#8217;s website. Liberty Harbor manages
about $5 billion in assets, according to a fund prospectus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer (PFE) Inc. is taking its animal- health unit public in the biggest U.S. initial offering since Facebook Inc., a bet that growing affluence means more spending on caring for livestock and pets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s Zoetis Inc. is seeking to sell 86.1 million shares today for $22 to $25 each, giving the unit a market value of about $11.8 billion at the midpoint of the range, regulatory filings show. The IPO, which may raise as much as $2.2 billion, would make Zoetis the largest public company of its kind -- and one of the only focused solely on medicines for animals, competing with businesses owned by such drugmakers as Sanofi and Merck  Co. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The IPO is well-timed -- coming as stocks hit 5-year highs -- and represents another step by Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read to slim down and focus on developing new prescription drugs. Both Novartis AG and Bayer AG explored a purchase of Zoetis last year, according to people familiar, reflecting the attractiveness of the animal-health industry. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Globally, people are feeling wealthier, which tends to mean more demand for meat for human consumption,&#8221; said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan&#8217;s Ross School of Business. &#8220;They&#8217;re also more likely to have pets and more likely to take better care of their pets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. energy company, said fourth-quarter profit increased 41
percent to a record $7.25 billion as it reported stronger
refining results and a gain from an Australian natural gas field
swap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income rose to $3.70 a share from $2.58, or $5.12
billion, a year earlier, the San Ramon, California-based company
said in a statement today. Chevron was expected to report per-
share profit of $3.06, based on the average of 19 analysts&#8217;
estimate compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales fell 3 percent to $56.3
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s refining segment returned to profit from a loss a
year earlier as rising supplies from U.S. shale formations
lowered crude input costs and processing margins climbed 46
percent. Chevron also benefited as crude prices rose in
international energy markets. About 75 percent of the company&#8217;s
crude is pumped from non-U.S. wells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John S. Watson
plans to spend $36.7 billion this year to explore for oil, build
gas export terminals and upgrade oil refineries. The company
expects to reach output equivalent to 3.3 million barrels a day
in 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Strong cash flows allowed us to invest aggressively in
our major capital projects and to acquire several important, new
resource opportunities,&#8221; Watson said. &#8220;We also raised the
dividend on our common shares for the 25th consecutive year and
continued our share repurchase program.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvey M. Schwartz, who became
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s chief financial officer yesterday,
owns stock and options in the bank worth about $75 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwartz owns 175,493 shares of Goldman Sachs, along with
171,419 restricted stock units that have been awarded over the
past three years, according to his initial ownership filing as
CFO today. He also has 302,888 options that expire in 2018, the
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At today&#8217;s closing price of $149.90, the shares and
restricted stock units, which are fully vested, are worth $52
million. The options, which have strike price of $78.78, are
worth about $22.8 million, according to Bloomberg calculations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwartz, 48, was one of three global co-heads of the sales
and trading division before the New York-based firm announced in
September that he would succeed David A. Viniar as CFO at the
end of January. Viniar, whose 12 years in the role made him the
longest-serving CFO on Wall Street, is joining the bank&#8217;s board

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Chevron Corp. (CVX),
the largest U.S. energy producers, are boosting profits with oil
refineries that some analysts and investors urged them to divest
as recently as last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings from processing crude into fuels such as gasoline
and diesel more than made up for lagging returns from oil and
natural gas exploration during the final three months of 2012,
Exxon and Chevron reported today. Fuel refining helped propel
fourth-quarter net income to a five-year high of almost $9.95
billion for Exxon and a record $7.25 billion for Chevron. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the world&#8217;s biggest refiner, and Chevron, operator
of fuel plants from South Korea to Mississippi, have resisted
the trend among peers such as Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO) and
ConocoPhillips of spinning off refineries to focus on oil
drilling. The persistence is paying off: Exxon posted the
second-highest annual profit in U.S. history last year,
surpassed only by its own all-time high from 2008, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even though refining has long been seen by some as a drag
on earnings, it has now been vindicated,&#8221; said Ernie Cecilia,
who helps manage $6.7 billion as chief investment officer at
Bryn Mawr Trust Co. in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. &#8220;We like
integration.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM)&#8217;s plan to spend almost $15 billion on deals through 2015
is turning NetApp Inc. (NTAP) and Splunk Inc. (SPLK) into takeover candidates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM finds itself looking for deals after sales increased
just 0.8 percent in four years, the worst rate since the period
that ended in 2002, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Investors have taken notice, with its shares lagging behind
those of rivals Oracle Corp. and SAP AG by the most in at least
nine years in 2012, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, with a market value of $232 billion, has
identified areas for expansion through the end of 2015. Sterne
Agee  Leach Inc. sees NetApp, which has almost doubled revenue
since 2008, strengthening IBM&#8217;s standing in cloud storage.
Splunk, which has rallied almost twofold since its initial
public offering last year, would help IBM meet a goal of growing
in data analytics, according to Credit Agricole SA. Royal Bank
of Canada says Imperva Inc. (IMPV) would bolster its position in
security products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;ll probably be a surprise acquisition that will really
get things going,&#8221; Laurence Balter, an analyst with Oracle
Investment Research in Fox Island, Washington, said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;Unless IBM does something real
interesting, an acquisition down the road or something that will
stir up growth, we&#8217;re at a little bit of a plateau.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Biggest Deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Sciales, a spokesman for Armonk, New York-based IBM,
said the company doesn&#8217;t comment on potential acquisition
targets. NetApp&#8217;s Roger Villareal, Splunk&#8217;s Ken Tinsley and
Imperva&#8217;s Rob Rachwald also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM shares rose 1 percent to $205.18 today, closing at the
highest price in more than three months. NetApp climbed 0.7
percent to $36.25, Splunk rallied 2.9 percent to $33.90, and
Imperva added 2 percent to $35. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has faced pressure for years to expand through deals,
with investors saying in 2010 that profit growth hinged on doing
a multibillion-dollar acquisition. The company managed to
increase net income to $16.6 billion last year, up 12 percent
from $14.8 billion in 2010, even without announcing any
transactions that eclipsed its two biggest: the 2008 purchase of
Cognos Inc. for $4.5 billion and the $3.9 billion deal for
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP&#8217;s consulting business in 2002. Both
figures include net debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s preference is to strike deals valued at $200
million to $1.5 billion, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge
said in May. &#8220;We are not looking at big acquisitions, nor do we
want to communicate that we&#8217;re looking at big acquisitions,&#8221; he
said during the presentation at a conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Larger Scale&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make a difference in IBM&#8217;s revenue, which totaled $104.5
billion last year, up just 0.8 percent since 2008, the company
may have to consider bigger transactions, said Joe Foresi, a
Boston-based analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Clearly, given the size of the company, acquisitions will
have to be on a larger scale,&#8221; he said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has a goal of doing $20 billion of deals from the start
of 2011 through the end of 2015. Counting already announced
transactions, IBM has $14.5 billion left to spend. IBM completed
11 purchases in 2012, including five in data analysis and two in
cloud computing, according to the company. It bought Worklight
Inc. for mobile tools and spent $1.2 billion including net cash
on Kenexa Corp. to add social business capabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Takeover Speculation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Splunk, a $3.3 billion company based in San Francisco,
could help IBM grab a larger slice of the global market for
analyzing large, complex databases that should reach $48.3
billion by 2018, up from $6.3 billion in 2012, according to
Transparency Market Research. Splunk also has intellectual
property for data analysis that would be valuable to IBM, said
Edward Maguire, a New York-based analyst at Credit Agricole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Splunk&#8217;s shares rose 6.9 percent on Jan. 15 amid
speculation it could be bought by IBM or Oracle, according to
Brian White, an analyst at Topeka Capital Markets Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Buying Splunk makes sense from a products perspective,
because Splunk is a gigantic analytics engine,&#8221; Peter Goldmacher, a San Francisco-based analyst at Cowen Group Inc.,
said in a phone interview. &#8220;It can take data from data centers
or cars or planes, and that&#8217;s what IBM is all about.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts estimate Splunk&#8217;s sales increased 60 percent in
the fiscal year that ended in January, according to the average
of projections compiled by Bloomberg. It went public in April
and has since rallied 94 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM today said it&#8217;s buying Star Analytics Inc. for an
undisclosed amount. The Redwood City, California-based company
integrates business information and helps sort out what&#8217;s
important, eliminating time-consuming steps for data analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Weak Areas&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NetApp, valued at $13 billion, has been speculated as an
IBM target for years, said Shaw Wu, a San Francisco-based
analyst at Sterne Agee  Leach. The computer-storage company
would bolster IBM&#8217;s cloud-computing plans, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Storage is definitely one of the weak areas for the
company,&#8221; Wu said in a phone interview. &#8220;For them to get
stronger there would make sense.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analyst said IBM may have to pay a 30 percent to 100
percent premium for NetApp, which at current prices would exceed
the $14.5 billion left in IBM&#8217;s projected takeover budget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding Imperva, valued at $842 million, would help IBM&#8217;s
customers better protect applications and data, particularly
information on remote servers referred to as the cloud, said
Amit Daryanani, a San Francisco-based analyst at RBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Juniper, Akamai &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales at the Redwood Shores, California-based company rose
30 percent in 2012, according to the average of analysts&#8217;
forecasts compiled by Bloomberg. Imperva&#8217;s software for managing
databases, files, Web applications, servers and hardware
appliances is used by more than 2,000 customers -- including top
telecommunications providers, U.S. banks and government agencies
-- in over 60 countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sterne Agee&#8217;s Wu said that a purchase of Juniper Networks
Inc. (JNPR) would add higher-margin hardware, helping IBM compete with
Cisco Systems Inc., while adding security capabilities. Akamai
Technologies Inc. (AKAM) would bolster IBM&#8217;s cloud plans, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juniper&#8217;s Cindy Ta and Akamai&#8217;s Rob Morton declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, shares of Juniper declined 0.3 percent to $22.32.
Akamai rallied 2.7 percent, the most in a month, to $41.81. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM rallied 4.4 percent on Jan. 23, the most in a year,
after the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider forecast
profit that exceeded analysts&#8217; estimates. Last year, shares of
Redwood City, California-based Oracle rallied 30 percent, versus
IBM&#8217;s 4.2 percent gain, while SAP of Walldorf, Germany, rose 49
percent. Oracle won by the most since 1999, while SAP last
outperformed IBM by that amount in 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re probably aware that the absence of top-line
growth hurts the stock price,&#8221; David Grossman, a San Francisco-
based analyst at Stifel Financial Corp., said in a phone
interview. &#8220;They&#8217;re constantly evolving their strategy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Billionaire Leonard Blavatnik&#8217;s
lawyers asked a New York judge to hold JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
responsible for stuffing a fund with risky mortgage securities
and losing 10 percent of his $1 billion investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blavatnik, 55, ranked 49th on Bloomberg&#8217;s billionaires
index with a net worth of $16.2 billion, sued JPMorgan in New
York state court in June 2009, accusing the biggest U.S. bank by
assets of putting more money into mortgage securities in his
CMMF fund than investment guidelines allowed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard I. Werder Jr., an attorney with Quinn Emanuel
Urquhart  Sullivan LLP who is representing Blavatnik, today
asked Supreme Court Justice Melvin Schweitzer to order JPMorgan
to pay more than $100 million in damages to the billionaire for
the losses to the fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re talking about this account being converted into a
totally different kind of account than the one it was supposed
to be,&#8221; Werder said during closing arguments in a two-week,
nonjury trial in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorneys for New York-based JPMorgan have argued that CMMF
rejected the &#8220;most conservative strategy&#8221; it was offered in
favor of one that sought a higher return than a money-market
fund, with higher risk and less liquidity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lewis R. Clayton, an attorney with Paul Weiss Rifkind
Wharton  Garrison LLP, representing JPMorgan, told Schweitzer
today that the losses were the result of unexpected market
conditions and that the mortgage securities purchased for the
fund were &#8220;remarkably liquid&#8221; until the financial crisis hit
in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is classic backward-looking, after-the-fact second-
guessing,&#8221; Clayton said during his closing argument. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schweitzer didn&#8217;t indicate when he planned to rule. Werder
said he expected a decision within several months, while Clayton
declined to comment after today&#8217;s proceedings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is CMMF LLC v. J.P. Morgan Investment Management
Inc., 601924-09, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s
largest company by market value, expects to begin bitumen
production at its Kearl oil sands project in Alberta before the
end of March after weather delays, a company executive said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, is stockpiling ore and
preparing to introduce solvent to the processing plant, David Rosenthal, vice president of investor relations, said during a
conference call today. Initial production will be about 37,000
barrels a day, increasing to 110,000 by the end of 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The weather situation was a major factor in the startup
moving from what we had originally said by the end of the year
to the first quarter,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Weather came earlier than
normal, and then it has just been brutally cold up there. And so
we&#8217;ve had to adjust accordingly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lagging infrastructure has created a glut of oil in Alberta
that pushed prices to a record discount to U.S. crude in
December. Western Canada Select oil in Alberta was priced at a
$42.50-a-barrel discount to West Texas Intermediate in Cushing,
Oklahoma, on Dec. 14, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It was at $31.50 below the U.S. benchmark at 12:13 p.m. New York
time today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon can run all 110,000 barrels of Kearl production in
its own refineries, Rosenthal said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We may elect to put some into third-party refineries, but
we do not have an issue in terms of logistics moving those
barrels outside of the Kearl project and into the market,&#8221; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission Chairman Elisse B. Walter said her designated
successor Mary Jo White will be a quick study as the nation&#8217;s
top financial-markets regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter was appointed chairman after Mary Schapiro left the
post in December. Walter&#8217;s tenure as chairman may be brief as
President Barack Obama last week said he will nominate White, a
former prosecutor and corporate lawyer with no experience as a
regulator, to succeed her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;She&#8217;s a very quick study and she&#8217;s a very smart woman and
I look forward to working with her as she comes,&#8221; Walter told
reporters today in Washington. &#8220;I think she&#8217;s terrific.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter, 62, said she would remain chairman until White, a
former U.S. Attorney in Manhattan, is confirmed by the Senate.
White is a partner at law firm Debevoise  Plimpton LLP in New
York and served on the board of the Nasdaq Stock Market Inc. (NDAQ) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter, who became a commissioner in July 2008, said she
hasn&#8217;t decided how long she&#8217;ll remain on the commission once
White joins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have decided not to think about it for now because that
may be a very short time and that may be a very long time,&#8221; she
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter said the commissioners are &#8220;working well together&#8221;
on an effort to overhaul rules governing the $2.7 trillion money
market mutual-fund industry. The SEC has been working to change
the rules since the September 2008 collapse of the $62.5 billion
Reserve Primary Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Schapiro Plan &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A plan by Schapiro to force money funds to choose between a
floating share value or a combination of capital buffers and
withdrawal restrictions was dropped in August after a majority
of the five-member commission didn&#8217;t support moving forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commissioners renewed consideration of a proposal after the
Financial Stability Oversight Council issued recommended rules
in November. The FSOC, a panel of regulatory chiefs lead by the
Treasury secretary, was created by the Dodd-Frank Act to address
systemic risks in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The whole dynamic around that project has changed,&#8221;
Walter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC Commissioner Daniel M. Gallagher, a Republican
appointee, said commissioners are studying options for new
money-fund regulation prepared by the SEC staff. He declined
to describe the proposals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think there is a path forward developing,&#8221; Gallagher
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LEG Immobilien AG, which completed
the largest initial public offering for a German property
company yesterday, unchanged on its first day of trading as
analysts questioned whether its homes will grow in value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Considering their portfolio, the pricing was very
ambitious,&#8221; said Georg Kanders, an analyst at Bankhaus Lampe
KG. Many of LEG&#8217;s apartments are in small cities whose
population is shrinking, he said. Some are in regions with
struggling economies. &#8220;The quality of the properties&#8217; locations
doesn&#8217;t justify the price.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LEG Immobilien, which became Germany&#8217;s largest publicly
traded property company by market value through the IPO, closed
at 44 euros in Frankfurt, giving the company a market value of
2.3 billion euros. Before the IPO, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
owned 95 percent of the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German property stocks have been in demand as investors
seeking a safe haven amid the European sovereign debt crisis.
Stocks of companies that own homes in booming cities such as
Berlin trade more expensively than those with properties in
smaller cities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re comfortable with our share price development
today,&#8221; LEG Chief Executive Officer Thomas Hegel said in an
interview. &#8220;Our IPO was clearly oversubscribed. We&#8217;re a long-
term product.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Wohnen, Germany&#8217;s second-largest listed property
company has about 50% of its apartments in the German capital
and trades at 19 percent above its net asset value, according to
data compiled by Warburg Research GmbH. NAV measures the value
of a property company&#8217;s buildings excluding debt. By contrast,
TAG Immobilien AG (TEG), whose holdings are more widely scattered
among smaller cities, trades at a 5 percent discount, according
to Warburg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The share is expensive compared to its peers,&#8221; said
Torsten Klingner, an analyst at Warburg Research. LEG&#8217;s IPO was
priced at 16 percent above its net asset value, which is higher
than the average of other German residential companies, he said.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any upside.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;LEG Regions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LEG owns 91,000 apartments in North Rhine-Westphalia,
Germany&#8217;s most populous state. The state&#8217;s gross domestic
product is the country&#8217;s highest, according to data compiled by
the state government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some cities, especially former mining centers such as
Dortmund and Essen, have falling populations and declining
economies, said Ralph Henger, an economist at the IW Koeln
economic institute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LEG has about 70% of its apartments in cities with
shrinking populations, according to data compiled by Warburg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;North Rhine-Westphalia has the highest population density
in Germany, and it&#8217;s a place where people rent their homes,&#8221;
Hegel said. &#8220;We have properties in extraordinary locations and
they&#8217;re widely spread.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Elisha Bala-Gbogbo" date="Feb 01, 2013  6:23 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-01/nigeria-fines-on-shell-chevron-not-backed-by-law.html"><headline>Nigeria Spill Fines on Shell, Chevron, Not Backed by Law</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Fines amounting to $8 billion sought
by Nigeria from Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) and Chevron Corp. (CVX) for oil
spills are not backed by law, said Bukola Saraki, chairman of
the country&#8217;s Senate Committee on Environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Under the existing law, there is no penalty for oil
spills apart from just to clean it up,&#8221; Saraki, a senator
representing the ruling People&#8217;s Democratic Party from central
Kwara state, said in an interview in Abuja on Jan. 29. &#8220;You
only pay 1 million naira ($6,362) for late reporting.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without the backing of law it is difficult for the National
Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency, or Nosdra, to enforce
fines levied on oil companies, he said. Lawmakers have moved to
amend the law and stipulate tougher penalties, according to
Saraki. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell, Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Chevron, Total SA (FP) and Eni SpA (ENI) run
joint ventures with state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum
Corp. that pump more than 90 percent of the output of Africa&#8217;s
top oil producer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nosdra recommended to the government in July that Shell
should pay $5 billion for a December 2011 rupture from its
offshore Bonga field that spilled about 40,000 barrels of oil,
the country&#8217;s worst in more than a decade. The agency is also
seeking $3 billion from Chevron for a rig explosion that caused
a 46-day blaze in January last year on Nigeria&#8217;s Atlantic coast.
It has been unable enforce the penalties because &#8220;there&#8217;s no
law,&#8221; Saraki said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Additional Penalties &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government is studying existing laws as they relate to
oil spills and will make pronouncements in due course,
Environment Minister Hadiza Mailafia said yesterday in Abuja
without giving further details. Precious Okolobo, Shell
spokesman in Nigeria, declined to comment when contacted on his
mobile phone. Chevron obeys the laws of the countries in which
it operates and won&#8217;t &#8220;comment on political matters,&#8221; Jim
Craig, a San Ramon, California-based spokesman, said in an e-
mailed response. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new National Oil Pollution Management Agency Bill
proposes fines of 250,000 naira for every barrel of oil spilled
and will compel producers to pay compensation to affected
communities, Saraki said. The bill proposes additional penalties
of 15 billion naira for every onshore spill incident and 5
billion naira if it happens offshore, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While improving the law will &#8220;definitely strengthen&#8221;
Nosdra&#8217;s capacity to monitor energy producers, tough measures
are unlikely to be enforced against companies engaged in
partnerships with the government, Nnimmo Bassey, executive
director of Environmental Rights Action, an affiliate of Friends
of the Earth campaigning against oil pollution in Nigeria, said
by phone today from Benin City. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s the political
issue we still have to confront, no matter how good the law will
be.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigeria, Africa&#8217;s most populous country with more than 160
million people, relies on oil for 95 percent of export earnings
and 80 percent of government revenue, according to the Petroleum
Ministry. With pipeline networks spread over the 70,000 square-
kilometre (43,500 square-mile) Niger River delta region and
largely unguarded, oil companies blame sabotage for most of the
spills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Dutch District Court in The Hague ruled on Jan. 30 that
Shell must pay compensation in one of five claims by Nigerian
villagers from the Niger delta for a spill from its facility
that affected their livelihood. Judge Henk Wien said Shell
wasn&#8217;t liable for four other claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonny Light crude, Nigeria&#8217;s leading export grade, rose
less than 1 percent to $117.41 as of 10.06 a.m. in London. The
naira declined 0.1 percent to 157.20 a dollar as of 11.08 a.m.
in Lagos, the commercial capital, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
