&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s unwillingness to commit
to a patent royalty set by a federal court prompted a judge
yesterday to throw out its breach-of-contract claims against
Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Motorola Mobility unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb canceled a trial that was
scheduled to begin yesterday in Madison, Wisconsin, over the
fees Motorola Mobility could reasonably charge Apple for using
patents related to industry-standard technology. Apple said it
wouldn&#8217;t license the patents unless the judge set the rate at $1
or less for each iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge&#8217;s action shows how entrenched Apple, Google,
Microsoft Corp. and other competitors are in their global legal
battle over patent rights and licensing agreements over
smartphones, tablet computers and gaming devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Companies like Microsoft and Motorola have signed
thousands of agreements,&#8221; said Erin-Michael Gill, managing
director of MDB Capital Group LLC, a Santa Monica, California-
based investment bank that specializes in patent issues. &#8220;It
seems strange that these companies can no longer figure out what
is fair and reasonable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wisconsin dispute is one of two, in courtrooms 2,000
miles apart, in which judges were to hear complaints from Apple
and Microsoft that Motorola Mobility is demanding excessive
royalties on patents deemed essential to standards for how
electronic devices function and work with one another.
Regulators in the U.S. and Europe are investigating whether
Motorola Mobility is misusing those patents to curb competition
in the $219 billion smartphone market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Licensing Obligations &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases were to be the first in which courts were asked
to define licensing obligations of patent owners who help create
technological specifications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focus now turns to the trial in Microsoft&#8217;s complaint
against Google, scheduled to start next week in Seattle, said
Jorge Contreras, an associate law professor at American
University in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle has said he
will set a range for what is the appropriate rate, so a jury
could later determine if Motorola Mobility&#8217;s offer was fair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wisconsin trial was sidetracked on the issue of whether
any decision by the judge would resolve the companies&#8217; dispute
about what amount of royalty would fit the definition of fair
and reasonable -- the standard for payments on standard-
essential patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crabb on Nov. 2 questioned the need for a trial if Apple
wouldn&#8217;t pledge to license the Motorola Mobility patents on a
rate she set. Apple, in a filing yesterday, said Motorola
Mobility&#8217;s failure to make a fair offer &#8220;was, in Apple&#8217;s view,
the single greatest impediment to a successful negotiation of a
worldwide license.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristin Huguet, an Apple spokeswoman, said the company had
no comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reaching Agreement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re pleased that the court has dismissed Apple&#8217;s
lawsuit,&#8221; Jennifer Erickson, a Motorola Mobility spokeswoman,
said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;Motorola has long offered
licensing to our extensive patent portfolio at a reasonable and
non-discriminatory rate in line with industry standards. We
remain interested in reaching an agreement with Apple.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Related patent-infringement claims between Apple and
Motorola Mobility, originally filed before Crabb, were thrown
out by Circuit Judge Richard Posner in June after he rejected
each company&#8217;s damages theories. That decision is on appeal.
Other patent claims are pending in federal court in Miami, with
trial scheduled for 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple and Microsoft raised the breach-of-contract claims
based on demands for royalties of 2.25 percent on the retail
price of each product, which Motorola Mobility has said was its
standard opening offer. The company has said neither Microsoft
nor Apple would negotiate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dollar Dispute &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, in court papers, said that would amount to $4
billion a year in royalties on sales of the Xbox and Windows
operating system, a figure no company would agree to pay. Apple,
in its own case, said the technology is worth at most $1 per
unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all of the patents asserted by Motorola Mobility at the
ITC or in district court involve standard-essential patents, and
none of the patent claims Microsoft and Apple asserted against
Motorola Mobility involve industry standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, resolving the issue of the standard-essential
patents could alter the dynamics in Google&#8217;s effort to use the
Motorola Mobility patents as a bulwark against Apple&#8217;s claims
that Google&#8217;s Android operating system for wireless devices
copied the iPhone. Apple&#8217;s largest smartphone competitor,
Samsung Electronics Co., uses Android. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gaining Leverage &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These patents are very important and, if they can make
Apple and Microsoft pay them something, it can give them a
lever,&#8221; Tom Scott, a patent lawyer with Goodwin Procter in
Washington, sid of Google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legal wrangling, prompted by the world&#8217;s embrace of
smartphones, has prompted congressional hearings and
investigations by the European Commission and the U.S. Federal
Trade Commission. One in seven people worldwide has a
smartphone, with the number exceeding 1 billion in the third
quarter, according to an Oct. 17 report by researcher Strategy
Analytics. While it took 16 years to reach that milestone, the
research group estimates another billion people will have
smartphones within the next three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard-setting boards, rather than courts or regulators,
may have to resolve the dispute, said Robert Stoll, former
commissioner of patents at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
and now with Drinker Biddle in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There should be a standard-setting body that oversees
standard-setting bodies,&#8221; Stoll said. &#8220;They should also be
able to determine what the values of all these things are, and
that doesn&#8217;t seem to happen. They just say &#8216;fair and reasonable&#8217;
and leave it at that. The devil is in the details.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are: Apple Inc. v. Motorola Mobility Inc.,
11cv178, U.S. District Court for the Western District of
Wisconsin (Madison); and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) v. Motorola Mobility
Inc., 10cv1823, U.S. District Court for the Western District of
Washington. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) lost a bid to
have a U.S. judge dismiss lawsuits filed by the Federal Housing
Finance Agency against 16 U.S. banks over mortgage-backed
securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. (C) were
among the lenders sued last year for allegedly misleading Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac about the soundness of loans underlying
billions of dollars of residential mortgage-backed securities.
JPMorgan served as the lead underwriter for 30 out of the 103
securitizations at issue in this case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan today rejected
a bid to throw out the FHFA&#8217;s complaint, overruling arguments
that the agency lacked factual support that the loans underlying
the securitizations weren&#8217;t underwritten in accordance with the
guidelines set out in the offering documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The agency&#8217;s reliance on this information is not, as the
defendants allege, an effort to argue &#8216;fraud by hindsight&#8217;;
rather the amended complaint suggests that these market events
are telltale signs of defects that were present in the
securitizations all along, albeit, unbeknownst to the public,&#8221;
the judge wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;FHFA may be wrong of course; a jury will decide,&#8221; Cote
said. &#8220;But the claim is not an implausible one.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Total Collapse&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cote said that the plaintiffs&#8217; amended complaints includes
allegations of a &#8220;total collapse in credit ratings&#8221; and claims
the banks had made false statements of material facts in
registration statements, which &#8220;directly caused Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac to suffer billions of dollars in damages.&#8221; The
plaintiffs also claim the loans underlying the securities
experienced defaults and delinquencies at a much higher rate
than they would have if the loan originators had adhered to
underwriting guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cote cited evidence provided by the plaintiffs in the
amended complaint that included statements or two &#8220;confidential
witnesses&#8221; who were personally involved in the origination and
underwriting of JPMorgan&#8217;s EMC unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also said the plaintiffs included testimony from
witnesses who described being pressured by supervisors to
approve loans in disregard of their expressed concerns about
potentially fraudulent documentation and cited other evidence
provided by plaintiffs involving Washington Mutual Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Wild West&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As one appraiser who did business with WaMu during the
relevant period described the bank&#8217;s origination practices: &#8216;It
was the Wild West ... if you were alive, they would give you a
loan, Actually, I think if you were dead, they would still give
you a loan,&#8217;&#8221; Cote said in her ruling, citing the witness&#8217;s
statements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WaMu, based in Seattle, filed for bankruptcy on Sept. 26,
2008, the day after its banking unit was taken over by
regulators and sold to JPMorgan Chase  Co. for $1.9 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defendants argued the plaintiffs had failed to provide
sufficient evidence to support their claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have operated under U.S.
conservatorship since 2008, when they were seized amid subprime
mortgage losses that pushed them toward insolvency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cote did narrow the case, dismissing some claims alleging
violations of the Virginia Securities Act as well as fraud
claims regarding the owner-occupancy and loan-to-value ratio of
the securities for which New York-based JPMorgan served as lead
underwriter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Amended Complaint &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She cited the amended complaint filed by the plaintiffs,
including statements made by JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer
Jamie Dimon criticizing the quality of loans originated by Chase
Home Finance LLC, a unit of the bank. The judge said the amended
complaint also mentioned the $5.3 billion settlement JPMorgan
reached this year with state and local authorities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for JPMorgan, declined to
comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also sued by the FHFA were Barclays Plc (BARC), Nomura Holdings
Inc. (8604), HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA), Societe Generale SA (GLE), Morgan Stanley (MS),
Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY), Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN), Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and First Horizon National
Corp. (FHN) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Federal Housing Finance Agency v. JPMorgan
Chase  Co., 11-CV-6188, U.S. District court, Southern District
of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, expanded its board of directors to
12 members by adding Mark Edward Tucker, the chief executive
officer and president of AIA Group Ltd. (1299) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tucker, 54, will become Goldman Sachs&#8217;s 10th independent
board member and will join all of the board&#8217;s committees, the
New York-based firm said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With his nearly three decades of leadership in the
insurance and banking sectors, Mark has a proven understanding
of effective risk management,&#8221; Lloyd C. Blankfein, 58, Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s chairman and CEO, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tucker was group chief executive at Prudential Plc (PRU) before
becoming CEO and president of Hong Kong-based AIA, the third-
largest Asia-based insurer. From 2009 until this year he was a
non-executive director of the so-called Court of the Bank of
England, which provides the central bank with non-monetary
advice, and a member of its financial stability committee and
audit and risk committee, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs last month named Adebayo &#8220;Bayo&#8221; Ogunlesi,
managing partner and chairman of Global Infrastructure Partners,
as an independent board member. The investment bank said in
September that Chief Financial Officer David A. Viniar will
retire at the end of January and join the board as a non-
independent member. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIA was sold by American International Group Inc. (AIG) in a
$20.5 billion public offering in October 2010 that was the
world&#8217;s third-largest at the time. Goldman Sachs was one of the
banks involved in managing the offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;British-born Tucker, who was a professional soccer player
in his youth, was a mentor to Tidjane Thiam and handed Thiam the
CEO job at Prudential in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spot gasoline in California advanced
to a one-week high against futures after Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) said
the Torrance oil refinery is performing repairs on a unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planned maintenance may cause the 150,000-barrel-a-day
plant, south of Los Angeles, to flare gases through Nov. 12, a
notice to the South Coast Air Quality Management District shows.
Gesuina Paras, an Exxon spokeswoman in Torrance, didn&#8217;t specify
in an e-mailed statement which unit is undergoing work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The refinery continues to operate normally,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;There is no impact to production.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spot California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in Los Angeles
rose 4.5 cents to a premium of 12.5 cents a gallon against
gasoline futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at
1:46 p.m. East Coast time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That&#8217;s the highest level for the fuel since Oct. 29. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbob in San Francisco climbed 4 cents to 0.5 cent a
gallon above futures, also the fuel&#8217;s highest since Oct. 29. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air Products  Chemicals Inc. (APD)&#8217;s hydrogen plant in Carson,
California, is scheduled to flare through tomorrow because of a
breakdown, a notice to the South Coast air district shows. The
plant supplies hydrogen to refineries in the Los Angeles area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Art George, a spokesman at Air Products&#8217; headquarters in
Allentown, Pennsylvania, didn&#8217;t immediately reply to an e-mail
requesting comment on the upset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-grade, or CARB, diesel in Los Angeles declined
1.5 cents to a premium of 6 cents a gallon versus heating oil
futures traded on the Nymex, a two-week low for the fuel. CARB
diesel in San Francisco slipped 1.25 cents to 5.5 cents a gallon
over futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional 84 sub-octane gasoline to be blended with
ethanol in Portland, Oregon, jumped 5.5 cents to 16 cents a
gallon under gasoline futures. Low-sulfur diesel in Portland
dropped 6 cents to 15 cents a gallon above heating oil futures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, is proving the value of an AAA rating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The designer of Windows operating systems with a credit
grade that Standard  Poor&#8217;s deems better than the U.S.
government&#8217;s sold $2.25 billion of bonds last week at tighter
relative yields than a year ago, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Spreads widened in the same period for corporate
bonds globally of all types, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index
data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The supply of top-rated corporate bonds has tumbled 64
percent as firms from General Electric Co. (GE) to billionaire Warren
Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. lost their AAAs after the 2008
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. ignited the worst
financial crisis in eight decades. Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft&#8217;s balance sheet has since strengthened, with a record
$67 billion of cash and short-term investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft carries a certain level of cachet in this
market as a highly defensive and economic resilient borrower,&#8221;
said Thomas Chow, a money manager at Delaware Investments in
Philadelphia with about $170 billion under management. &#8220;It&#8217;s as
strong and well recognized of an issuer as one can expect.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tighter Spreads &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The least-leveraged software maker sold $600 million of
0.875 percent, five-year notes on Nov. 2 that yielded 27 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, $750 million of
2.125 percent, 10-year securities at a 47 basis-point spread and
$900 million of 3.5 percent, 30-year bonds at 67 basis points,
Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new bonds paid less relative to government securities
than when Microsoft issued an equal amount of similar-maturity
notes on Feb. 3, 2011, even after relative corporate yields
worldwide increased 19 basis points to 227 basis points, or 2.27
percentage points. That similarly sized sale included 2.5
percent, five-year notes yielding 38 basis points more than
Treasuries, 4 percent, 10-year bonds at 48 basis points and 5.3
percent, 30-year securities at 68 basis points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six months later, SP cut America&#8217;s credit grade to AA+.
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service ranks the U.S. as Aaa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An average coupon of 2.34 percent on Microsoft&#8217;s new bonds
compares with a 3.2 percent rate that it paid on $12 billion of
outstanding securities before last week&#8217;s sale, $2.25 billion of
which mature next year, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Very Attractive&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not particularly compelling from a spread point of
view, but from the point of view of increasing credit quality,
it&#8217;s very attractive,&#8221; said Bonnie Baha, head of global
developed credit at Los Angeles-based DoubleLine Capital LP,
which oversees more than $45 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three issues rose in secondary trading today. The five-
year notes gained 0.1 cent on the dollar to 99.6 cents for a
yield of 0.96 percent at 11:26 a.m. in New York, the 10-year
debt rose 0.6 cent to 99.86 cents to yield 2.14 percent, and the
30-year bonds rose 0.6 cent to 99.1 cents to pay 3.55 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s debt has never exceeded its earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Its current
leverage of 0.41 times is the least among publicly traded
software firms with at least $1 billion of debt, including
Oracle Corp. (ORCL) and SSC Technologies Holdings Inc. (SSNC), which carry a
median debt load of 1.68 times earnings, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Wootton, a spokesman for Microsoft, declined to
comment on the company&#8217;s finances. Proceeds from the new bonds
may be used to buy stock, fund acquisitions or repay existing
debt, the company said last week in a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Global Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors are seeking bonds of the most-creditworthy
borrowers as the International Monetary Fund lowers its global
growth forecast to the slowest pace since the 2009 recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IMF on Oct. 9 predicted 3.3 percent growth this year
and 3.6 percent in 2013, compared with July predictions of 3.5
percent for 2012 and 3.9 percent next year. The lender now sees
&#8220;alarmingly high&#8221; risks of a steeper slowdown, with a one-in-
six chance of growth slipping below 2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The face value of outstanding corporate debt worldwide
that&#8217;s ranked AAA has plummeted to $158 billion last week from
$445 billion in May 2008, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s not enough AAA paper to go around right now,&#8221;
Jody Lurie, a corporate credit analyst at Janney Montgomery
Scott LLC in Philadelphia, said in a telephone interview. That
helps Microsoft, which is &#8220;the type of name that institutional
investors need in their portfolio,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest holders of Microsoft bonds include Vanguard
Group Inc., the largest U.S. mutual-fund firm, and BlackRock
Inc., which manages more financial assets than any other
company, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Free Cash &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the four non-financial U.S. companies rated AAA by SP
or Aaa by Moody&#8217;s, Microsoft is the most profitable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its gross margin of 74 percent leads Johnson  Johnson (JNJ),
Exxon Mobil Corp. and Automatic Data Processing Inc. It&#8217;s 33
percent operating margin, also the highest, compares with a 22
percent average, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s helped Microsoft generate more free cash than 99
percent of SP 500 stock index members. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company earned $29 billion of funds in its last fiscal
year that it can use to reward shareholders through dividends or
stock buybacks, to reinvest in the company or to pay down debt,
more than any non-financial firm except Apple Inc. (AAPL), which
doesn&#8217;t have debt and isn&#8217;t rated by Moody&#8217;s or SP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Because of how stable their cash flow is, there&#8217;s
generally a lot of demand,&#8221; Greg Tornga, head of fixed income
at Edge Asset Management in Seattle, which manages about $22
billion and owns Microsoft debt, said in a telephone interview.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a very stable investment from a bond standpoint.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mobile Phone &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s bond sale comes with the personal-computer
industry forecast to have its worst year since 2001 as consumers
switch purchases to tablet machines like Apple&#8217;s iPad and
smartphones. Microsoft is responding with the release of its
first computer hardware device, the Surface tablet, and a new
version of Windows overhauled to add touch controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is also making plans for a possible mobile
phone of its own, according to people with knowledge of the
matter who asked not to be identified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the company&#8217;s free cash flow at more than double its
$12 billion of total debt has helped bolster the balance sheet,
about 87 percent of its cash and equivalents were held overseas
and subject to repatriation taxes as of Sept. 30, according to a
quarterly regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Cheap Financing&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That raises the chances that Microsoft, which had about
$7.2 billion remaining in its share buyback program, will use
borrowed money to repurchase stock, according to Alan Shepard of
Madison, Wisconsin-based Madison Investment Holdings Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under current law, American companies can defer federal
income taxes on most overseas earnings indefinitely. When they
do return to the U.S., they&#8217;re taxed at the corporate rate of 35
percent -- with credits for foreign income taxes paid. Companies
paying little overseas face higher U.S. tax bills upon
repatriation and may save money by borrowing instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My feeling is that they&#8217;re using cheap financing to move
funds back to the U.S., which may be used for repurchases,&#8221;
Shepard, whose firm oversees about $16 billion and owns
Microsoft debt, wrote in an e-mail. &#8220;It&#8217;s a shareholder-
friendly move, but it should have no effect on the company&#8217;s

&lt;p&gt;Occasional users of cocaine have higher blood pressure, stiffer arteries, and thicker cardiac muscle walls, all risks for heart attacks, than non-users, according to a study. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The heart abnormalities were found in recreational cocaine users long after the effects of the drug wore off, researchers said in a study presented today at the American Heart Association&#8217;s annual meeting in Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The research was inspired by a wave of cocaine-related heart abnormalities in otherwise healthy adults, according to a statement released by the medical group. There was no evidence of &#8220;silent&#8221; heart attacks, as previous studies have shown. Also unlike in most earlier reports, these cocaine users weren&#8217;t addicts with a daily habit, just social users. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s so sad,&#8221; Gemma Figtree, the lead researcher and a cardiologist at the University of Sydney, said in a statement. &#8220;We are repeatedly seeing young, otherwise fit individuals suffering massive heart attacks related to cocaine use. Despite being well-educated professionals, they have no knowledge of the health consequences of regularly using cocaine.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Study participants, with an average age of 37, reported using cocaine at least once a month in the past year. At least two days after their last use of cocaine, the 17 men and three women had their blood pressure taken and underwent cardiac imaging to assess their heart health. Researchers compared the findings in that group to similar non-drug users. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists found 18 percent greater thickness in the heart&#8217;s wall, 8 mm Hg higher systolic blood pressure and a 30 to 35 percent increase in aortic stiffening among the 20 healthy cocaine users, compared with 20 non-using peers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stiffer vessels elevate blood pressure, making the heart work harder to pump blood through the limbs. That leads to thickened walls in the heart. The increased pressure on the heart leads to higher risks of heart attacks and strokes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists aren&#8217;t sure how social cocaine use may cause the blood vessels to stiffen. The next step is to determine what might be causing the ill effects, Figtree said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Drew Armstrong" date="Nov 06, 2012  5:23 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-06/pfizer-s-arthritis-treatment-wins-approval-from-u-s-fda.html"><headline>Pfizer&#8217;s Arthritis Treatment Wins Approval From U.S. FDA</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s experimental rheumatoid arthritis pill won U.S. regulatory approval and will compete directly with Abbott Laboratories (ABT)&#8217; top-selling injection Humira. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration cleared Pfizer&#8217;s treatment, tofacitinib, to be sold as Xeljanz, for adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis who don&#8217;t respond well to other drugs, the agency said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Xeljanz inhibits part of the immune system that can cause rheumatoid arthritis. It may generate $2.3 billion in annual sales for New York-based Pfizer by 2018, estimated Seamus Fernandez, an analyst with Leerink Swann  Co. in Boston. It would compete with Humira and Johnson  Johnson (JNJ)&#8217;s Remicade. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Xeljanz provides a new treatment option for adults suffering from the debilitating disease of RA who have had a poor response to methotrexate,&#8221; Badrul Chowdhury, the FDA&#8217;s director of the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Rheumatology Products, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rheumatoid arthritis patients typically start therapy on methotrexate, a generic medicine, before moving to the Humira and JJ drugs. The FDA&#8217;s approval would put Xeljanz into direct competition with those drugs, among the top-selling therapies in the U.S., rather than as an option to be used after they fail. Pfizer had said in May that it expected the drug to be used at first mostly in patients who failed the JJ and Abbott products. Humira had $7.9 billion in 2011 sales, Abbott has reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Hurricane Sandy ravaged his
home state of New Jersey last week, rock star Jon Bon Jovi cut
short a London press tour and flew to New York, where he
performed in a live telethon to support the storm&#8217;s victims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rock and pop royalty quickly signed up to participate in
the NBC television benefit &#8220;Hurricane Sandy: Coming Together,&#8221;
including Briton Sting; Staten Island-born Christina Aguilera;
Bruce Springsteen, another New Jersey native; and Long Islander
Billy Joel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show last Friday raised $23 million for the American
Red Cross, adding to about $35 million in donations the
organization has already received, said spokeswoman Karen
Stecher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artists, entertainers, corporations and the financial-
services industry have contributed or pledged talent, work and
money to recovery efforts for Sandy victims, as the death toll
has risen to at least 177, and property damage totals about $50
billion, according to Moody Analytics Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen a time like this,&#8221; said Kathleen
DiChiara, president and founder of the Community FoodBank of New
Jersey which she launched from the trunk of her car in 1975.
&#8220;When I was handing out sandwiches on Sunday, a woman told me
that she and her sister take turns letting their cats sit on
their laps to keep to them warm because they have no
electricity. The food need is huge.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF), the New York-based investment-banking
firm, said it would donate $1 million and all net trading
commissions earned tomorrow to the Hurricane Sandy relief
effort. Its more than 3,800 employees can also donate their
salary for the day to charity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C)&#8217;s Citi Foundation donated $1 million to the
Red Cross. Morgan Stanley (MS) and its employees will contribute $1
million to $2.5 million (depending on employee contributions) to
the recovery effort, according to an internal memo obtained by
Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Robin Hood Foundation, the New York-based poverty-
fighting charity supported largely by Wall Street donors, said
it will hand out about $3 million by today for the purchase of
food and blankets and for emergency cash grants. The nonprofit
has raised more than $9 million since last Friday for its relief
fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Small Gifts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our experience after 9/11 has shown that small cash
disbursements -- as little as $100 or $200 -- can be critical to
needy families in the days following a catastrophic event,&#8221; Lee Ainslie III, Robin Hood&#8217;s board chairman and fund manager at
Maverick Capital Management LP, said in an e-mail to donors last
week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) offered $5 billion in capital for
lending to small and midsize businesses affected by the storm.
The company&#8217;s foundation will also give $5 million to the relief
effort. That figure includes $2 million to the Red Cross
emergency response, $1 million in matching funds for employee
donations to the Red Cross, United Way and World Vision, and as
much as $2 million to local agencies for recovery efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said it would match $5 million in
funding for small business pledged by New York City Mayor
Michael Bloomberg to provide loans. (Bloomberg is the founder
and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Fast Access&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Many small businesses in our communities have been
devastated by this disaster, and fast access to capital will
help them get back on their feet more quickly,&#8221; Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman&#8217;s chairman and chief executive, said in a
release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment bank and its Goldman Sachs Gives, a donor-
advised fund to which the company&#8217;s partners contribute, also
will donate as much as $5 million to Sandy&#8217;s clean-up and
recovery effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Red Cross has provided shelter to about 9,000 people at
113 facilities in nine states, Stecher said. It&#8217;s also deployed
more than 4,000 disaster workers in the region and 240 response
vehicles, or more than two-thirds of its U.S. fleet, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United Way of New York City has received about $2
million from corporations including JPMorgan, Bank of America
Corp., Deloitte LLP, Federal Express Corp. and Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)
More donations will be required to help the needy over the
coming months, said Sheena Wright, United Way&#8217;s chief executive
officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Immediate Support&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is certainly a huge need for immediate support,&#8221;
said Stacey D. Stewart, president of United Way U.S.A., based in
Alexandria, Virginia. &#8220;What we experience time and time again
is that it takes quite a while to recover, and it&#8217;s the United
Way that will be there for the long haul.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Union, New Jersey-based Salvation Army chapter has
spent more than $50,000 to help those without shelter, food or
electricity and needs more donations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When the sun came out and the water went away after
Hurricane Irene last year, a lot of people who weren&#8217;t impacted
went about their daily lives, and you can&#8217;t blame them,&#8221; Brenda
Beavers, the state director of human services for the Salvation
Army New Jersey, said by phone. &#8220;But we still have people in
New Jersey who have yet to recover from that storm.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors in Treasuries were the most
neutral in more than two months as they cut bullish positions
ahead of the closely contested U.S. presidential elections,
according to a survey by JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors raised neutral bets to 70 percent from 68
percent, pushing it to the highest level since Aug. 27, the
survey reported, as President Barack Obama and Republican
challenger Mitt Romney courted voters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proportion of net longs was at four percentage points
in the week ending yesterday, according to JPMorgan, down from
six percentage points the previous week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The percent of outright longs dropped to 17 percent, from
19 percent the previous week, the survey said. The percent of
outright shorts, or bets the securities will fall in value,
remained at 13 percent, according to the survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year note rose two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.7 percent at 8:57 a.m. in
New York. It touched a record low of 1.379 percent on July 25
and reached a 2012 high of 2.4 percent on March 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan doesn&#8217;t disclose the number of clients in the
survey. Srini Ramaswamy, a JPMorgan strategist in New York,
wasn&#8217;t immediately available to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Argentine judge ordered the
seizure of all Chevron Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s assets in the country, according
to Enrique Bruchou, a lawyer representing Ecuadorean plaintiffs
in a lawsuit over pollution in the Amazon rain forest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bruchou, an Argentine attorney at Bruchou, Fernandez,
Madero  Lombardi, made the comments today in a conference call.
Civil Judge Adrian Elcuj Miranda ordered 40 percent of Chevron&#8217;s
Argentine bank accounts to be held in escrow, Bruchou said.
Miranda declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg saying
judges speak through their rulings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ecuadorean plaintiffs said Oct. 31 they were asking an
Argentine court to enforce a $19 billion award against Chevron,
filing an attachment order in a Court of Justice in Buenos Aires
in line with an international treaty signed by Ecuador,
Argentina and Colombia that speeds up attachments. The
Ecuadoreans blame Texaco Inc., which Chevron acquired in 2001,
for destroying the environment in the Lago Agrio region,
damaging living conditions of 30,000 inhabitants. Lago Agrio was
named after Sour Lake in Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron is unaware of either a filing by the plaintiffs or
a court order in Argentina, James Craig, a spokesman for the San
Ramon, California-based company said in an e-mailed response to
questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers have no legal right to embargo
subsidiary assets in Argentina and should not be allowed to
disrupt Argentina&#8217;s pursuit of its important energy resources,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;The Ecuador judgment is a product of bribery, fraud,
and it is illegitimate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shale Investments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the fourth-largest producer of oil in Argentina,
signed a memorandum of understanding on Sept. 14 with YPF SA (YPFD),
Argentina&#8217;s biggest energy company, to analyze a partnership to
jointly develop projects at the shale formation of Vaca Muerta.
Alejandro Di Lazzaro, an spokesman for YPF in Buenos Aires,
declined to comment in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron will face more attachment requests in Europe, Asia
and Oceania, Bruchou said today. Another related lawsuit was
filed by the Ecuadoreans in the Ontario Superior Court of
Justice in Toronto on May 30. Chevron Canada Ltd. will have a
hearing on the lawsuit Nov. 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company on Oct. 9 lost a U.S. Supreme Court bid to
block the judgment imposed by an Ecuadorean court. The highest
U.S. court let stand a federal appeals court ruling against
Chevron that the Ecuadoreans can&#8217;t be barred from seeking to
collect the award anywhere in the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) dropped the most in the last 12 months as Europe&#8217;s debt crisis reignited and investors speculated that President Barack Obama&#8217;s re-election means tighter curbs on banks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The two securities firms led U.S. financial stocks lower after Obama defeated Mitt Romney and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said the region&#8217;s crisis is hurting Germany, its biggest economy. Goldman Sachs fell 6.6 percent to $117.98 at 4:15 p.m. in New York and Morgan Stanley tumbled 8.6 percent to $16.63. Bank of America Corp. (BAC) dropped 7.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Bankers were hoping Romney would win and give them more sympathetic regulators or that Republicans would take the Senate and they could rewrite Dodd-Frank,&#8221; said Edward Mills, a bank policy analyst at FBR Capital Markets and former aide on the House Financial Services Committee. &#8220;The floodgate is going to open for the final rules under Dodd-Frank,&#8221; he said, referring to the 2010 law designed to overhaul banking rules. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S. lender by assets, fell 5.6 percent. That was the most in six months, since the day after disclosing a $2 billion trading loss in a London unit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;More &#8216;Misery&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C), ranked third, declined 6.3 percent. It&#8217;s based in New York along with JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), the biggest U.S. home lender, fell 3.5 percent. Bank of America is ranked second by assets and based in Charlotte, North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obama&#8217;s win and the election of industry critics such as Elizabeth Warren to a Democrat-controlled Senate signal more &#8220;misery&#8221; ahead for financial firms, according to David Trone of JMP Securities LLC. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investors had bought shares in the five biggest U.S. banks amid hope that a Romney White House and a divided Senate would repeal some of the &#8220;burdensome&#8221; costs that Obama championed, Trone wrote to clients. These included bigger capital buffers, more compliance programs and less fee revenue, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the House still under Republican control, lawmakers and the Obama administration may &#8220;fight brutally&#8221; over a solution to the so-called fiscal cliff, and tax increases and spending cuts could trigger a U.S. recession, Trone wrote. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Romney Premium &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Warren, a Harvard University professor, unseated Massachusetts Republican Senator Scott Brown. She will serve with Republicans who previously made clear they would block any attempt by Obama to appoint her to lead the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which she helped establish over objections of bankers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. banks outperformed the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 in six out of the last eight trading sessions leading up to Election Day, and closed near their highest levels for the year yesterday, said Jason Goldberg, senior banking analyst at Barclays Capital. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market was pricing in an increasingly higher chance that Romney would win,&#8221; Goldberg said. Investors thought &#8220;if Romney was elected, the path to interest rates would be higher and that would be good for banks,&#8221; Goldberg said. Romney also would have been &#8220;kinder&#8221; in drafting new rules required by the Dodd-Frank overhaul, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bloomberg&#8217;s Europe Banks and Financial Services Index, which tracks 38 companies in the region, dropped the most in almost three weeks, sliding 1.9 percent. Germany&#8217;s 2013 growth forecast was cut to 0.8 percent from 1.7 percent amid a slowdown in the continent&#8217;s economy, the European Commission said today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Germany has so far been largely insulated from some of the difficulties elsewhere in the euro area,&#8221; Draghi said today at a Frankfurt conference. &#8220;The latest data suggest that these developments are now starting to affect the German economy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Fierce&#8217; Advocate &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Banks spent millions of dollars lobbying to block or dilute new rules that cut into their profit. With Obama&#8217;s election, FBR&#8217;s Mills said, &#8220;the industry has gone from a posture of trying to delay to now where they are going to be pushing for certainty.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Warren isn&#8217;t the first pro-consumer lawmaker in Congress, &#8220;but no other consumer advocate has been able to capture the attention of the nation and take on Wall Street and win, and she&#8217;s likely to sit on the Senate Banking Committee,&#8221; Mills said. &#8220;Not only do Democrats hold the Senate, they now have a fierce defender in the Senate to any potential change to Dodd- Frank.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Dina Bass" date="Nov 07, 2012  4:03 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-07/microsoft-to-invest-100-million-on-research-startups-in-brazil.html"><headline>Microsoft to Invest $100 Million on Research, Startups in Brazil</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s largest

development and entrepreneurial programs in Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will establish its fourth Microsoft Research
Advanced Technology Laboratory in Rio de Janeiro. Microsoft will
also set up a center for work on its Bing search engine and a
business accelerator to support 15 startups over the next 24
months, according to a post on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, is chasing growth
in emerging markets as personal-computer sales increase at a
faster rate in those countries than in the U.S. and Western
Europe. The software maker will incorporate an investment fund,
which will be wholly owned by Microsoft Brazil, to invest in
startups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft declined 2.6 percent to $29.08 at the close in

it was &#8220;more upbeat&#8221; on the company&#8217;s prospects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock rose 0.1 percent to 40,310 forint by the end of
trading in Budapest, with share turnover double the three-month
daily average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Richter
pared gains of as much as 0.8 percent after the European

&lt;p&gt;Goldman increased Richter&#8217;s price estimate to 42,900 forint
from 41,900, keeping its recommendation at neutral. The company
expects a 3 percent increase in sales this year in euro terms,
compared with an earlier estimate for no change, and it sees a
more stable tax environment thanks to a deal with the government
last week, Chief Executive Officer Erik Bogsch said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s traders lost
money on 10 days during the third quarter, down from 28 in the
prior three months when the largest U.S. bank struggled to
unwind a wrong-way bet on credit derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Losses occurred on 39 days in the first nine months of this
year, compared with 18 days during the same period of 2011, New
York-based JPMorgan said today in a regulatory filing. Traders
earned more than $200 million on seven days in the first nine
months, including five in the third quarter, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56, ousted traders and
managers and overhauled senior management amid more than $6.2
billion in losses at the chief investment office in London. The
affair prompted the retirement of Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew, spurred lawsuits from shareholders and drew civil and
criminal probes by at least three U.S. agencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value-at-risk, or VaR, which measures the most the bank
might lose on 95 percent of its trading days, increased to $162
million during the first nine months of this year from an
average of $97 million in the same period last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results aren&#8217;t directly comparable because the firm
used a new formula in the third quarter as it tried to improve
accuracy. Investigators focused attention on VaR because the
model was altered in January before some of the errant trades
were placed and may have obscured the mounting losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the New York-based investment
bank that made 55 percent of its revenue this year from sales
and trading, recorded losses from that business on two days in
the third quarter, down from 21 days in the same period last
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley&#8217;s traders lost money on eight days during
the third quarter, the New York-based company said in a Nov. 7
filing. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America Corp.,
the second-largest U.S. lender, said last week it had one day of
trading losses, which were less than $1 million, and one day of
revenue with more than $100 million. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank, reached a settlement with regulators to resolve
claims tied to its home-loan business and said it would buy back
as much as $3 billion of shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement in principle with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission covers two investigations related to
mortgage-backed bonds handled by JPMorgan and Bear Stearns Cos.,
which the bank acquired in 2008, New York-based JPMorgan said
today in a filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The firm has reached an agreement in principle with the
staff of the SEC to resolve&#8221; some claims, JPMorgan said in the
filing. &#8220;The agreement in principle is subject to approval by
the SEC, as well as court approval.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC has issued notices to banks including JPMorgan in
probes focusing on mortgage securities and whether lenders
failed to disclose underlying credit weaknesses. Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. paid $550 million in 2010 to settle SEC claims that
it misled investors on a mortgage-linked investment in 2007. In
that case, Goldman Sachs said it made a &#8220;mistake&#8221; in omitting
disclosures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One investigation related to delinquency disclosures in a
single mortgage-backed security deal, JPMorgan said in today&#8217;s
filing. The other involved claims against the lender and Bear
Stearns over disclosures of settlements of disputes against
originators of loans included in Bear Stearns securitizations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SEC Warning &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC warned JPMorgan in January that it may bring
complaints related to mortgage securitizations, the company said
in February. Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo  Co. also said they
were facing U.S. scrutiny over mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators are still examining how banks packaged and sold
home loans to investors more than four years after mounting
mortgage defaults prompted unprecedented government bailouts of
the financial system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also won Federal Reserve approval to reinstate a
$3 billion buyback of common shares in next year&#8217;s first
quarter, according to today&#8217;s filing. The Fed notified the bank
Nov. 5 that it reviewed the firm&#8217;s capital plan and wouldn&#8217;t
object, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan announced a $15 billion repurchase program in
March and suspended it in May after uncovering a trading loss at
its chief investment office that eventually swelled to more than
$6.2 billion. The bank was scheduled to spend as much as $12
billion on buybacks this year and up to $3 billion in the first
three months of 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Good News&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We regard this as very good news that will likely lift
all money center banks today as it appears the Fed is still
quite open to allowing stock repurchases,&#8221; Ed Najarian, an
analyst at International Strategy  Investment Group LLC, wrote
in a note to clients today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan rose 1.9 percent to $41.26 at 8:52 a.m. in New
York. The shares have risen 22 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in August that he
intended to resume repurchases in the first quarter. Doing so
depended on the Fed and on the board&#8217;s completion of work on the
CIO&#8217;s wrong-way bets, he said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timing and amount of common stock and warrant
repurchases depends on market conditions, JPMorgan said today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Weiss will return to the
Colorado Rockies as the Major League Baseball&#8217;s team sixth
manager in franchise history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weiss, 48, played shortstop for the Rockies from 1994-98
and was a special assistant to the general manager for seven
seasons from 2002-08, the team said on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weiss, the 1988 American League Rookie of the Year,
replaced Jim Tracy, who quit Oct. 7 after the Rockies finished
in last place in the National League West with a 64-98 record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last season, Weiss was head coach of the Regis Jesuit High
School baseball team in Aurora, Colorado, which went 20-6 and
reached the semifinals of the state championship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weiss, who played parts of 14 seasons with Oakland, Miami,
Colorado and Atlanta, earned a batting average of .258 with 25
home runs and 386 runs batted in. He also recorded 96 stolen
bases, 658 walks and 658 strikeouts in 1,495 games. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said a small number
of covers for its Surface tablet computer are prone to splitting
after two weeks or less in users&#8217; hands and that it&#8217;s replacing
the defective ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is &#8220;aware of a small number of instances of
material separation&#8221; of the cover accessory, Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft said in an e-mailed statement. The
cover serves a protective jacket for the Surface, the tablet
computer released last month. &#8220;Microsoft makes every effort to
ensure our customers receive a high quality product.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surface, which went on sale Oct. 26, represents Microsoft&#8217;s
first foray into the computer-hardware market. The world&#8217;s
largest software company built the device, which runs its new
Windows 8 operating system, to operate as a touch-screen tablet
that doubles as a small notebook computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users can engage a stand to prop Surface on a table, then
fold out the Touch Cover to use it as a notebook. The Surface
starts at $499 for a 32-gigabyte tablet and the Touch Cover
costs an additional $120. Microsoft also sells the two combined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defects with the Touch Cover, which users said had
begun to split apart at the seams, were reported earlier on
technology industry websites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft climbed less than 1 percent at $28.83
at the close in New York. The shares have gained 11 percent this
year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), the U.S. oil producer
considering investing in Argentina&#8217;s shale oil fields, is
seeking to revoke a court embargo on its assets in the country
related to a $19 billion award over pollution in Ecuador. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two units of the San Ramon, California-based company filed
the motion at a Buenos Aires civil court today, Chevron said in
an e-mailed response to questions. Judge Adrian Elcuj Miranda
ordered 40 percent of Chevron&#8217;s Argentina bank accounts to be
held in escrow, Enrique Bruchou, an Argentine attorney
representing the Ecuadoreans, said on Nov. 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs are seeking to enforce a $19 billion award
against Chevron, which they say is responsible for destroying
the environment in the Lago Agrio region, damaging living
conditions of 30,000 inhabitants. Chevron, which signed on Sept.
14 a memorandum of understanding to help develop Argentina&#8217;s
Vaca Muerta shale formation, says the Ecuador judgment is
illegitimate and the embargo is improper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers have no legal right to embargo
subsidiary assets in Argentina and should not be allowed to
disrupt Argentina&#8217;s pursuit of its important energy resources,&#8221;
Kent Robertson, a Chevron spokesman, said by e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ecuadoreans&#8217; attorneys said Oct. 31 that they were
filing an attachment order in Buenos Aires in line with an
international treaty signed by Ecuador, Argentina and Colombia.
Julio Cesar Rivera, an Argentine attorney who represents
Chevron, declined to comment from the tribunal today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More Seizures &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Elcuj Miranda declined to comment on the case today
after receiving eight Chevron attorneys in his Buenos Aires
office. Rivera, who led the group, declined to comment when
asked if a check he was carrying was to pay court fees or to
cover the attachments. Under Argentine law, attachments are
ruled in an inaudita parte basis, meaning the judge orders an
embargo on assets without hearing the other party&#8217;s arguments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron on Oct. 9 lost a U.S. Supreme Court bid to block
the judgment imposed by an Ecuadorean court. The highest U.S.
court let stand a federal appeals court ruling against Chevron
that the Ecuadoreans can&#8217;t be barred from seeking to collect the
award anywhere in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Oct. 31 Bruchou estimated Chevron&#8217;s assets in Argentina
worth $2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron will face more attachment requests in Europe, Asia
and Oceania, Bruchou said Nov. 7 to obtain the total award from
Ecuador. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another related lawsuit was filed by the Ecuadoreans in the
Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Toronto on May 30. Chevron
Canada Ltd. will have a hearing on the lawsuit Nov. 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ecuadoreans&#8217; plaintiffs filed in the Superior Tribunal
of Justice in Brazil&#8217;s capital of Brasilia on June 27, Karen
Hinton, a spokeswoman for the Ecuadoreans, said today in an e-
mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect that Chevron&#8217;s attempt to undo the freeze order
in Argentina will fail,&#8221; Hinton said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swaps traders are capitulating to
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) as bigger-than-forecast declines in
wholesale prices prompts them to push out their bets on when the
central bank will raise interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traders who wagered in October that the bank would boost
rates from a record low 7.25 percent as soon as April now
predict there won&#8217;t be an increase before July. Policy makers
cut the target rate for a 10th straight meeting on Oct. 10 and
said they would keep the borrowing costs stable for a
&#8220;sufficiently prolonged&#8221; period to revive the slowest growth
among the biggest emerging-market economies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the largest rate cuts among Group of 20 nations has
kept inflation above policy makers&#8217; target of 4.5 percent for 26
months, the biggest decline in an index of producer prices in
three years is supporting an Oct. 26 call by Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
Brazil chairman Paulo Leme, who said the central bank won&#8217;t
raise rates before 2014. Barclays Plc (BARC) says lower producer prices
will ease pressure on inflation as speculation increases
President Dilma Rousseff&#8217;s government will turn to the exchange
rate and fiscal policy to keep consumer prices in check. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The new normal is low rates for a long period of time,&#8221;
Marcelo Salomon, the New York-based co-chief of Latin American
economics at Barclays, who like Leme expects stable rates to
2014, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;You do tax exemptions on
the fiscal side instead of stimulating consumption and create an
environment so you don&#8217;t need to hike rates in 2013. There&#8217;s
less inflation pressure.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;L. Brooks Entwistle, Goldman Sachs (GS)
Group Inc.&#8217;s chairman for Southeast Asia, is retiring after two
decades at the New York-based bank, according to an internal
memo obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entwistle, 45, will retire at the end of the year and
become an advisory director, according to the memo. He set up
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s wholly-owned India business in 2006 and remained
country head until early 2011 when he moved to Singapore for the
current role. Entwistle joined the bank in 1989 as an analyst
and was named partner in 2008, the document shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connie Ling, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman at the bank,
confirmed the contents of the memo and declined to elaborate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs ranks second in advising mergers and
acquisitions in Southeast Asia this year, trailing only Morgan
Stanley, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It ranked
fifth during the same period last year, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An increasing number of senior executives are leaving
investment banking as compensation in the industry falls.
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Yusuf Alireza, who was co-president of
operations for the Asia-Pacific region outside Japan, left late
last year. A month later Mark Machin, the bank&#8217;s vice-chairman
for the region also departed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alireza is now chief executive officer of Hong Kong-based
Noble Group Ltd., while Machin heads the Asia-Pacific unit of
Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. Gaby Abdelnour, CEO of
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s Asia-Pacific business left that bank
earlier this year to pursue personal interests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which is scheduled to announce its new class
of partners next week, has 407 members of that group, 31 fewer
than nine months ago, according to a company filing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an army captain in the early
1990s, Ollanta Humala fought the Shining Path guerrillas in the
Peruvian jungle to end one of Latin America&#8217;s bloodiest civil
conflicts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now president of the region&#8217;s fastest-growing economy,
Humala is looking to finish the job, re-equipping the nation&#8217;s
armed forces and police to capture holdout members of the
Maoist-inspired insurgency and deal a blow to the cocaine trade
that funds their activities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government will boost defense and counter-narcotic
spending next year as it taps record tax revenue from copper and
gold exports to halt a boom in the coca crop that the United
Nations says now rivals Colombia&#8217;s as the world&#8217;s largest. In
Humala&#8217;s sights is the valley of the Apurimac, Ene and Mantaro
Rivers, or VRAEM, the last bastion of the Shining Path. The
group has stepped up attacks against companies working on a
natural gas pipeline crossing the country&#8217;s largest coca-growing
area, threatening $1.5 billion in annual gas exports and 40
percent of the country&#8217;s power supply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Shining Path remnants pretty much have a free rein over
the area and want to keep it that way to support their main
interest, drugs,&#8221; said Jaime Garcia, a former deputy interior
minister, in an Oct. 15 phone interview from Lima. &#8220;They&#8217;ve
placed in jeopardy gas exports as well as supplies to the rest
of the country.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At risk is an $850 million plan to double the capacity of
the pipeline that crosses the VRAEM on its way from the Camisea
gas fields to the capital, Lima. The project will help prolong
an economic boom that has seen the economy expand an average 6.4
percent over the past 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Doubts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transportadora de Gas del Peru, owned in part by Italian
billionaire Paulo Rocca through Techint SA, and closely held
Texas-based Hunt Oil Co. and Buenos Aires-based Pluspetrol SA,
built and operate the pipeline under a 33-year concession that
started in 2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conduit runs through the heart of the VRAEM, more than
30,000 square kilometers (11,580 square miles) of mountains and
forests near the cities of Ayacucho and Cuzco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mounting violence in the region means the expansion project
is already a year behind schedule and won&#8217;t start operating
before 2016, Barbara Bruce, country manager for Hunt Oil, said
by phone on Oct. 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If there was ever any doubt about how vital this project
is, that&#8217;s been dissipated,&#8221; by the government&#8217;s determination
to protect the installations, Bruce said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Skanska Attack &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work to expand the pipeline has slowed since April after
guerillas abducted 40 people, mostly employees of Swedish
construction company Skanska AB (SKAB), in the jungle adjacent to the
VRAEM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight police and military officers were killed during an
operation to free the kidnapped workers, who were released
unharmed after five days. The government&#8217;s failure to capture
any rebels led the defense and interior ministers to resign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transportadora temporarily stopped maintenance work on the
pipeline on Oct. 6 after rebels broke into an airfield at Kiteni
in Cuzco and blew up three helicopters used to inspect the
conduit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incidents raise the possibility of an attack on the
pipeline itself and the loss of power in Lima, which accounts
for about half of Peru&#8217;s gross domestic product, said Humberto Speziani, president of the country&#8217;s business confederation, in
an Oct. 22 phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goaded &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mounting threat has goaded Humala into action, Speziani
said. In September, the government budgeted a 68 percent
increase in spending on the VRAEM to 2.75 billion soles ($1.1
billion) next year, including new military bases and night
vision equipment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defense Minister Pedro Cateriano said Oct. 13 the
government is also seeking to purchase 20 helicopters for
operations in the region, while police officers will receive new
firearms for the first time in 25 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shining Path has about 400 fighters in VRAEM and a
smaller faction in the Alto Huallaga valley to the north,
another coca-producing region, according to Ricardo Soberon, a
Lima-based drugs specialist and former adviser on drug issues to
Humala. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are the remnants of a Maoist-inspired movement that
had an estimated 2,700 fighters in 1990, before a series of
arrests and military setbacks in the 1990s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shining Path has survived by collaborating with drug
traffickers, overseeing a 25 percent increase in Peru&#8217;s coca
production in the past six years, according to the United
Nations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Terrible Violence&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shining Path have increased their attacks in the past
five years as drug output booms, with about 84 members of the
security forces killed since 2008, according to Jaime Antezana,
an independent analyst on the drug trade. That compares with a
government-estimated death toll of about 69,000 in the civil war
between 1980 and 2000, including 1,674 police and military
officers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The remnants of the Shining path have become stronger in
the last few years as they&#8217;ve narcoticized,&#8221; Garcia said.
&#8220;They&#8217;ve no real political agenda or ambition for power. They
exist at the moment because of the drug trade.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to calls for the release of those imprisoned
during the years of terror, Humala said on Nov. 6 that the
government won&#8217;t drop its guard. &#8220;Peru has suffered terrible
violence in the past decades and that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re committed to
fight against terrorism.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Driving Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attack in Kiteni was probably a warning to the
authorities after police killed a senior member of the group in
the VRAEM in September, Speziani said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, government measures to boost security along the most
vulnerable parts of the pipeline are reassuring and the attacks
are unlikely to dent private investment, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lima Stock Exchange&#8217;s benchmark index has advanced 8.4
percent this year and the sol has appreciated 3.4 percent
against the U.S. dollar. The extra yield investors demand to own
Peruvian government dollar bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries has
decreased 92 basis points to 124 basis points, according to
JPMorgan Chase  Co. Annual inflation was 3.25 percent last
month, the slowest since June 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombia&#8217;s Cano Limon pipeline, operated by Los Angeles-
based Occidental Petroleum Corp. and state-run Ecopetrol SA, has
been attacked more than 1,000 times since it was built in 1986,
causing oil spills and curbing exports and tax revenue. The pace
of attacks slowed after the U.S. government increased military
aid to Colombia under a 2000 accord. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Foreign Investment &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peru lured $1.6 billion of foreign investment to develop
the Camisea fields in 2000, at the time Peru&#8217;s biggest-ever
investment project. Since 2004, revenue from the Camisea fields
and a mining boom have tripled Peru&#8217;s gross domestic product to
about $200 billion this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About half of Camisea&#8217;s gas is exported to Mexico and the
remainder fuels power plants and factories outside Lima. The
expansion of the pipeline will boost supplies to industry and
the government expects it to spur as much as $16 billion of
investment in petrochemical complexes and power plants over the
next decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s incredible the government&#8217;s not provided the
necessary security to protect such a strategic infrastructure
investment,&#8221; Garcia said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transportadora spokesman Rafael Guarderas, didn&#8217;t respond
to phone calls and an e-mail seeking comment. Alejandro Lujan, a
spokesman for the armed forces, wasn&#8217;t immediately able to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Resting on Its Laurels&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humala, whose family hails from Ayacucho, the region where
the Shining Path began its insurrection, says previous
governments ignored the threat posed by the guerillas in the
VRAEM. Police stations and military bases have fallen into
disrepair and the local population lacks basic public services
and infrastructure, he told reporters Sept. 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The state has been resting on its laurels,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Our troops are in a precarious situation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farms in the VRAEM and the region around Cuzco accounted
for half of the country&#8217;s 62,500 hectares of coca crop last
year, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime said Sept.
26. Peru&#8217;s output has increased for six straight years to meet
demand for crack and cocaine in Europe and Brazil, which is the
largest market in the Americas after the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, until now, the government had focused its drug
eradication efforts on the Alto Huallaga valley, uprooting about
10,000 hectares a year of coca in a campaign partially financed
by the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coca Crop &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government won&#8217;t stop the guerillas or halt the traffic
of drugs through Peru&#8217;s southern borders if it gives priority to
a military solution to pacify the VRAEM, said Soberon in a Sept.
24 interview. More money should be spent on public works and
improving police intelligence, he said. Soberon was replaced as
Humala&#8217;s drugs czar after five months as the government took a
harder line on coca eradication, a practice he had criticized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eradication and programs to provide farmers with
alternatives to growing coca are the most effective ways of
limiting Peru&#8217;s coca production and weakening the guerrilla&#8217;s
grip on the VRAEM, said Carmen Masias, who took over from
Soberon in January. The government has increased the counter-
narcotics budget to $223 million, from 13 million soles ($5
million) a decade ago to boost eradication, aid crop
substitution and tighten the control of chemicals used to
produce cocaine, she said in an Oct. 26 interview in Lima. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This government is putting more money into the drugs
fight than any before it,&#8221; Masias said. &#8220;The Shining Path have
taken it to another level by attacking strategic targets so the
government&#8217;s following a new strategy to deal with the threat.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spot gasoline in California tumbled
to the lowest level against futures in a week as Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM) was expected to finish maintenance on a unit at the
Torrance refinery in Southern California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flaring at the 150,000-barrel-a-day plant, related to
repairs on a unit, was scheduled to end today, a Nov. 2 notice
to the South Coast Air Quality Management District shows.
Daymond Rice, an Exxon spokesman in Torrance, declined by e-mail
to comment on the work, saying the company doesn&#8217;t discuss the
status of units at the plant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spot California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in Los Angeles
declined for the fourth day, losing 3 cents to 13 cents a gallon
above gasoline futures traded on the New York Mercantile
Exchange at 4:34 p.m. East Coast time, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That&#8217;s the lowest premium for the fuel
since Nov. 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbob in San Francisco also slipped by 2 cents, to a
premium of 2.5 cents a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesoro Corp. (TSO)&#8217;s 170,000-barrel-a-day Golden Eagle refinery
in Northern California was operating at &#8220;planned rates&#8221; after
performing unplanned maintenance last week, Tina Barbee, a
spokeswoman at the company&#8217;s headquarters in San Antonio, said
by e-mail today. The plant shut a unit on Nov. 8 after a vapor
leak, a filing with the Contra Costa County hazardous materials
division shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-grade, or CARB, diesel in San Francisco fell 2
cents to 3.75 cents a gallon over Nymex heating oil futures, the
lowest since Oct. 24. CARB diesel in Los Angeles dropped 2.5
cents to a 10-cent-a-gallon premium to futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Portland Market &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional 84 sub-octane gasoline to be blended with
ethanol in Portland, Oregon, weakened 1.5 cents to a discount of
10 cents a gallon against gasoline futures. Low-sulfur diesel in
Portland gained 1 cent to 23.5 cents a gallon over heating oil
futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc (BP/) shut the 315,000-barrel-a-day Olympic pipeline for
work that&#8217;s expected to last for five days, a person with
knowledge of the situation said Nov. 7. The line delivers fuel
from refiners in northwest Washington to customers in Seattle
and other markets along the I-5 corridor and supplies jet fuel
to the Sea-Tac and Portland International Airports, the
company&#8217;s website shows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Halo 4,&#8221; the latest installment
in Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s video-game franchise, took in more than
$220 million in its first 24 hours on sale, setting a record for
the title. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game, a sci-fi shooting adventure, will surpass the
previous &#8220;Halo&#8221; record of $300 million in worldwide sales in
its first week, Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said today
in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Halo,&#8221; exclusive to the company&#8217;s Xbox 360 console,
ranks among the 10 top-grossing video-game franchises of all
time. Various versions have generated more than $3 billion in
revenue, according to Microsoft, and have helped the company
weather an industry drop in sales of games at retail. The Xbox
has been the No. 1 console in the U.S. for almost two years,
according to researcher NPD Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which released the first &#8216;Halo&#8217; title in
November 2001, fell 2.1 percent to $28.22 at the close in New
York. The shares are up 8.7 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Halo 4&#8217; faces competition tomorrow from Activision
Blizzard Inc. (ATVI), which releases the next installment of another
all-time leader, the &#8216;&#8216;Call of Duty&#8217;&#8217; shooter game. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said Chief Executive
Officer Steve Ballmer described the company&#8217;s approach to
supplying and distributing the Surface tablet as &#8220;modest,&#8221;
countering reports that suggested he was referring to sales of
the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ballmer made the comments in an interview with French
publication Le Parisien, according to a statement from
Microsoft. The executive also described the reception to the
device, the first computer built by Microsoft, as &#8220;fantastic,&#8221;
the company said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. publications such as Pocketnow, Cnet and Gizmodo,
using a translation of the Le Parisien article on the French
publication&#8217;s website, reported that Ballmer had said sales were
&#8220;modest.&#8221; The translation has now been altered to remove
references to the executive discussing modest sales, according
to Pocketnow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When asked about Surface, Steve&#8217;s use of the term
&#8216;modest&#8217; was in relation to the company&#8217;s approach in ramping up
supply and distribution of Surface with Windows RT, which has
only been available via our online store and Microsoft retail
and holiday stores in the U.S. and Canada,&#8221; Microsoft said in
the statement. &#8220;While our approach has been modest, Steve notes
the reception to the device has been &#8216;fantastic&#8217; which is why he
also stated that &#8216;soon, it will be available in more countries
and in more stores.&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surface went on sale on Oct. 26, at the same time as the
new version of Windows, called Windows 8. Surface is currently
available only with the Windows RT iteration of Windows 8, which
runs on processors with ARM Holdings Plc (ARM)&#8217;s technology. A Surface
with an Intel Corp. chip is set to go on sale early next year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s Nigerian unit
said it began cleaning up part of the nation&#8217;s southeast coast
after a pipeline from an offshore facility spilled at least 200
barrels of crude at the end of last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil shut the pipeline on Nov. 10 and is
investigating the cause of the spill in the state of Akwa Ibom,
the company said late yesterday in a statement from Lagos, the
commercial capital. Dispersants and booms are now being deployed
in work involving more than 100 personnel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nation&#8217;s authorities don&#8217;t yet have an estimate for the
amount of crude released. An aerial inspection will be carried
out before an estimate on volumes is made, Peter Idabor,
director-general of National Oil Spill Detection and Response
Agency, said today by phone from Abuja, the Nigerian capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is not enough for Mobil to say they are cleaning up;
they have to tell us what dispersants they are using,&#8221; Nnimmo
Bassey, executive director of Environmental Rights Action, an
affiliate of Friends of the Earth, said today by phone from
Benin City, Nigeria. &#8220;Their continuous spilling in the area has
destroyed the fisheries economy and general livelihoods of the
people.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil, the second-largest producer in Nigeria, is the
operator of a joint venture in which it holds a 40 percent
stake, with state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp.
holding the rest. The company was involved in Nigeria&#8217;s worst
offshore spill that dumped an estimated 40,000 barrels into the
sea from its Idoho platform in January 1998. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our teams are being mobilized to clean up the area,&#8221;
Mark Ward, managing director of Exxon&#8217;s Nigerian unit, said in
the statement. The company regrets this incident and apologized
for the inconvenience it has caused, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Borealis AG agreed to buy a
plastomers joint venture that generates annual revenue of about
180 million euros ($229 million) from Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and
Royal DSM NV. (DSM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement to buy DEXPlastomers, jointly owned by the
two partners, is expected to close in the first quarter,
Heerlen, the Netherlands-based DSM said in a statement. Valence
Group helped manage the sale, while HSBC Holdings Plc advised
the buyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction highlights efforts by feedstock-rich
petrochemical and plastics companies in the Middle East to
expand globally. Borealis is 64 percent owned by International
Petroleum Investment Co. of Abu Dhabi, with OMV AG (OMV) of Austria
holding the remainder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For DSM, the sale marks the latest step by Chief Executive
Officer Feike Sijbesma to distance the company from its
commodity past. The Dutch maker is focusing on nutritional
ingredients and high-technology materials, including baby-food
supplements and lightweight plastics used in car airbags. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said Andy Lees was
named head of corporate development and strategy, part of a push
by Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer to step up growth and
fend off competitors led by Apple Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lees, who assumed the new job last month, reports to Chief
Financial Officer Peter Klein and handles a role that&#8217;s been
vacant since Hank Vigil left the company in 2011. Since being
replaced as president of the Windows Phone division last year,
Lees has overseen Microsoft&#8217;s investment in a Barnes  Noble
Inc. (BKS) subsidiary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ballmer moved Lees out of Windows Phone in December after
the product failed to gain mobile market share following a
complete overhaul. Though Lees was allowed to retain his
president title, he was given a vague job description that
Ballmer called &#8220;working for me on a time-critical opportunity
focused on driving maximum impact in 2012 with Windows Phone and
Windows 8.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lees wound up leading a deal with Barnes  Noble that had
Microsoft investing $300 million in a new subsidiary that
combines the bookseller&#8217;s Nook digital reader and college
businesses in order to bolster Microsoft&#8217;s access to book
content it can offer on new Windows tablet devices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) provided
$1.85 billion in new debt for hotels owned by Kyo-Ya Hotels

&lt;p&gt;The debt, provided by Goldman Sachs Mortgage Co., includes
first mortgage and mezzanine loans, the New York-based company
said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cerberus Capital Management LP, which owns Kyo-Ya, in May
was seeking to replace debt amassed in 2006, three people
familiar with the transaction said at the time. A deal struck
with Goldman Sachs failed to close last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five of the Kyo-Ya hotels are in Hawaii, including the
Westin Moana Surfrider and Sheraton Princess Kaiulani in
Honolulu. Oahu has been outperforming other U.S. markets. This
year through September, hotel occupancies on the island climbed
to 86 percent, the highest of 25 U.S. markets tracked by Smith

&lt;p&gt;Not enough buyers for $2.6 billion

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), underwriter for the sale, will
purchase any unsold debt from the state&#8217;s tax-and-revenue
anticipation note deal set to price Nov. 15, according to bond
documents. It&#8217;s New Jersey&#8217;s largest-ever short-term debt sale
and will repay a loan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will price the notes at a yield of 0.35 percent or
less, with the bank buying any remaining debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The underwriter will purchase any unsold Series C notes,
at a yield agreed upon with the state which shall not exceed
thirty-five basis points,&#8221; according to bond documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy Pratt, a spokesman for New Jersey Treasurer Andrew Sidamon-Eristoff, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to voicemail and e-
mail requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Seymour, spokeswoman for JPMorgan, confirmed the
bank&#8217;s obligation to buy any residual notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s commitment to buying any remaining debt was
first reported by Dow Jones Newswires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state originally planned to sell the short-term debt,
which matures June 2013, through competitive bid last month.
Superstorm Sandy changed those plans. The storm slammed into New

&lt;p&gt;Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD), the
second-largest maker of processors for personal computers, rose
the most in two months after Reuters reported that the company
hired JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) to explore options including a sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares advanced 5 percent to $2.09 at the close in New
York. Earlier, they surged as much as 18 percent to $2.35 for
the biggest intraday gain since July 2011. AMD pared its decline
for the year to 61 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD is considering a sale, as well as options for its

immediately available for comment. Tasha Pelio, a spokeswoman
for JPMorgan, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, AMD forecast fourth-quarter sales that fell
short of analysts&#8217;s estimates and said it would cut 15 percent
of its staff, citing weak demand across all product lines in a
challenging economic environment. AMD joined other makers of
computer components suffering fallout from sluggish growth and a

traditional desktop and laptop machines. The forecast revision

Moore and Christine Harper" date="Nov 13, 2012  1:22 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-13/goldman-s-risk-weighted-assets-seen-jumping-67-under-new-rules.html"><headline>Goldman&#8217;s Risk-Weighted Assets Seen Jumping Under New Rules</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, would have $728 billion in risk-
weighted assets under new capital rules, a 67 percent jump from
the amount it had under earlier regulations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment bank plans to cut the figure to $700 billion
by the end of next year, Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 58, said today at an investor conference in New York
sponsored by Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit. About
$18 billion of the reduction will come from cutting credit risk,
and $11 billion from market risk, Blankfein said in his seventh
straight appearance at the annual event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comments mark Goldman Sachs&#8217;s first public estimate of
how new Basel III rules have increased the risks the firm must
assign to its assets, a factor in determining the size of the
company&#8217;s capital buffer. While larger banks such as Citigroup
Inc. and JPMorgan (JPM) Chase  Co. face a smaller jump in RWAs, they
will have to hold more capital against those assets based on
their size and business mix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For more than a decade, larger size and complexity were
viewed entirely as synergistic and virtuous,&#8221; Blankfein said.
&#8220;For the first time it&#8217;s clear that size and complexity come
with a higher cost.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Capital Buffer &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the Financial Stability Board disclosed
capital surcharges for the largest global banks. New York-based
Goldman Sachs is required to hold a 1.5 percent capital
surcharge above the 7 percent minimum. That equals the 8.5
percent ratio the firm estimated it had under the new rules at
the end of the third quarter. The bank probably will maintain a
1-percentage-point buffer above the requirement, Blankfein said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and Citigroup, along with Deutsche Bank AG and
HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA), face surcharges of 2.5 percent as they are
deemed more systemically important. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Many of our investment-banking competitors also have
sizable commercial and consumer businesses,&#8221; Blankfein said.
&#8220;Any synergy from housing multiple businesses together must be
weighed against the requirements for more capital and
liquidity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need to boost the proportion of equity capital has
pressured return on equity, a measure of profitability. Goldman
Sachs generated an 8.8 percent return on common shareholder
equity in the first nine months of this year, down from 19.2
percent in the same period of 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Nature Rules&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks have sought to cut holdings of assets with high risk
weightings to reduce capital needs for trading businesses and
improve returns. Goldman Sachs traders have been adjusting their
positions to the new rules since about June, according to
Blankfein&#8217;s presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve found that risk-weighted assets have started to
drop already,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Nature rules in our firm. If we give
people information and put a charge on something or a cost on
something, that incentive structure will get people going places
much faster than we otherwise would have gotten by fiat or
instruction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes in Basel III rules have a greater impact on Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s holdings than those of competitors. The firm&#8217;s risk-
weighted assets were 67 percent higher than under Basel I rules,
a greater difference than Citigroup (C)&#8217;s 27 percent or JPMorgan&#8217;s
28 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of Goldman&#8217;s $728 billion of risk-weighted assets as of
Sept. 30, $250 billion are related to market risk, according to
Blankfein&#8217;s presentation. Credit risk from derivatives account
for $125 billion. Credit risks from principal investments make
up $121 billion and other credit risks constitute $186 billion.
The firm&#8217;s operational risk contributed $47 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An experimental treatment for HIV
developed by GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK), Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Shionogi  Co. (4507)
reduced the virus in hard-to-treat patients in a late-stage
study, providing further support for a regulatory filing by the
end of this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 24 weeks on dolutegravir, 63 percent of 183
participants who had shown resistance to previous treatments had
undetectable levels of the virus, the drugmakers&#8217; HIV joint
venture ViiV Healthcare Ltd. said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, dubbed Viking-3, is the third of four late-stage
trials to be reported this year that Glaxo plans to use in
filing for regulatory clearance of dolutegravir. If approved,
dolutegravir would be the second, behind Merck  Co.&#8217;s
raltegravir, in a new class of HIV medicines called integrase
inhibitors that work by blocking the virus&#8217;s ability to
replicate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Viking-3 was designed to address a significant medical
need in one of the most difficult populations to treat,&#8221; John
Pottage, chief scientific and medical officer of ViiV, said in
the statement. &#8220;We are encouraged by these results.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first of the four late-stage trials, Glaxo said in
April that dolutegravir suppressed the HIV virus in 88 percent
of study participants, compared with Merck&#8217;s raltegravir, which
quelled the disease in 85 percent of the group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second study, 88 percent of patients receiving a
combination of dolutegravir and two other drugs had undetectable
levels of virus in their blood, compared with 81 percent of

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, grappling with a market
slump that is putting trading earnings under pressure, said
&#8220;sometimes cycles can last a very long time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, history shows that New York-based Goldman Sachs
shouldn&#8217;t go &#8220;overboard&#8221; in reacting to downturns, Blankfein,
58, said today at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch 2012 Banking
and Financial Services Conference in New York. Wall Street has
made past mistakes by cutting too many employees at the bottom
of cycles and over-hiring at the top, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s Blankfein&#8217;s seventh straight appearance at the annual
event sponsored by Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of
America Corp. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) plans to
exit the South Korean asset management business amid sluggish
global stock markets, according to three people with knowledge
of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street firm will probably take steps to protect
customers of its Goldman Sachs Asset Management Korea Co. unit,
said two of the people, who asked not to be named as the matter
is private. They didn&#8217;t specify the timing of an exit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our expectations for the local Korean asset management
business have not been met,&#8221; Niklas Ekholm, a London-based
spokesman for Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said in an e-
mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combined operating income at 82 South Korean asset
management firms fell 21 percent in the quarter ended June from
a year earlier as declining asset values hampered fee income,
Financial Supervisory Service data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MoneyToday, a Korean-language Internet news provider,
reported the planned withdrawal earlier today. Deutsche Bank AG,
Fidelity Investments and ING Groep NV are also considering
selling some of their South Korean asset management businesses,
MoneyToday reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management Korea had 40 employees and
six directors as of June 30, according to data on its website.
It began operations after Goldman Sachs bought Macquarie IMM
Asset Management Co. in September 2007, the website shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit posted a net loss of 7.27 billion won ($6.7
million) for the year ended March, according to the website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) named 70 employees to join its so-called partnership, the fewest in the firm&#8217;s 13 years as a public company, as sluggish revenue growth pressures expenses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The promotions to partner, which take place every two years, are down from 110 in 2010 and 94 in 2008. Partners, known as participating managing directors, typically receive a $900,000 salary, up from $600,000 two years ago, and a cut of a special bonus pool that&#8217;s awarded primarily in stock, according to a person with knowledge of the firm&#8217;s policies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, confers the status on a group of employees to continue a tradition from the firm&#8217;s 130 years as a private partnership, which ended with a 1999 public offering. The designation places an employee among an elite at a company whose alumni include two former U.S. Treasury secretaries and the president of the European Central Bank. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Other than billionaire, partner at Goldman Sachs is probably the most coveted status on Wall Street,&#8221; said Gregory Cresci, an executive recruiter at Odyssey Search Partners in New York. &#8220;It commands respect.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Adding Women &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fourteen percent of the new partners are women, the highest percentage since at least 2006, according to Michael DuVally, a spokesman in New York. About 59 percent are based in the Americas, with 29 percent based in Europe, the Middle East and Africa and 13 percent in Asia, DuVally said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The $23 billion Soros Fund
Management, the family office of billionaire George Soros, added
new positions in American International Group Inc. (AIG), Citigroup
Inc. (C) and JPMorganChase  Co. in the third quarter, according to
a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based firm bought 15.2 million shares of
insurer AIG, valued at $499 million at the end of September,
according to a filing today with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. Other hedge funds including Dan Loeb&#8217;s
Third Point LLC and Louis Bacon&#8217;s Moore Capital Management LP
also bought AIG shares in the quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soros bought 1.5 million shares of New York-based Citigroup
valued at $49.6 million as of Sept. 30, and 979,000 shares of
New York-based JPMorgan valued at $39.6 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm also added 436,000 shares to its stake in SPDR
Gold Trust, bringing its total position in the exchange-traded
product to 1.3 million shares, valued at $227 million at the end
of the quarter, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moore Capital Management LP, the
hedge fund run by billionaire Louis Moore Bacon, boosted its
stakes in financial firms after buying shares of Citigroup Inc. (C)
and JPMorgan Chase  Co. in the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $13.5 billion hedge fund bought 5.3 million shares of
Citigroup, making the New York bank its biggest U.S. publicly-
listed holding, according to a filing today with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. Moore bought 3.8 million
shares of JPMorgan in the period ending Sept. 30, after
divesting its entire stake in the prior quarter following the
bank&#8217;s multibillion-dollar trading loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moore joins Lansdowne Partners LP in adding to shares of
financial companies during the third quarter. Lansdowne, the
biggest European hedge fund focused on stock picking, added a
new position in Morgan Stanley and boosted its stake in
JPMorgan, according to a regulatory filing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick Clifford, a spokesman for New York-based Moore,
declined to comment on the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moore bought 3.4 million shares of American International
Group Inc. (AIG), 3.1 million shares in US Bancorp (USB) and 1.97 million
shares of Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), according to the filing. The hedge
fund also added 5.2 million shares of Bank of America Corp. (BAC) in
the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moore cut as many as 15 investment jobs in September as
part of a restructuring, people with knowledge of the matter
said at the time. Bacon told clients in August that he planned
to return $2 billion, or about 25 percent of his main fund, to
investors, saying it may be too big for him to generate returns
in line with historic profits as &#8220;liquidity and opportunities
have become more constrained.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moore last quarter added to an exchange-traded fund that
tracks emerging markets by buying 2.7 million shares of the
iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index fund, according to the
filing. The ETF is the hedge fund&#8217;s third-largest holding after
JPMorgan. Moore also added 1.8 million shares in Sprott Physical
Gold Trust in the quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moore sold the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund, an EFT
that tracks electrical power providers and natural gas
distributors, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lansdowne Partners LP, the biggest
European hedge fund focused on stock picking, added a new
position in Morgan Stanley (MS) during the third quarter and boosted
its stake in JPMorgan Chase (JPM)  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund purchased 3.8 million shares of New York-based
Morgan Stanley valued at $63 million as of Sept. 30, according
to a filing today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. London-based Lansdowne added 74,598 shares of
JPMorgan Chase, bringing the firm&#8217;s stake to 18.3 million shares
worth $744 million, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lansdowne, founded in 1998 by Paul Ruddock and Steven
Heinz, bought Morgan Stanley after the investment bank slumped
26 percent in the second quarter. Morgan Stanley gained 15
percent in the three months through September, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lansdowne holds the Morgan Stanley stake in its Global
Financials fund. The firm holds JPMorgan shares, its largest
U.S. stock position by market value, in the Developed Markets
fund, the Global Financials fund and the UK Strategic Investment
fund, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hedge fund also purchased 3.1 million shares of Comcast
Corp. (CMCSA) valued at $111 million and doubled its investment in
Colgate-Palmolive Co. (CL) by 1.5 million shares to 3 million shares,
for a stake worth $166 million, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) raised
$1.75 billion in a sale of fixed- and floating-rate notes after
relative yields on bank bonds declined by more than half this
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lender issued $1.25 billion of 1.6 percent debt
maturing in November 2015 that yields 130 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries and $500 million of two-year
floating-rate securities that pay 100 basis points more than the
three-month London interbank offered rate, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The bonds are expected to be rated A3 by
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on Goldman Sachs&#8217;s $2.25 billion of 3.3 percent
securities maturing in May 2015 have declined about 178 basis
points to 1.41 percent yesterday since the New York-based lender
issued the notes six months ago, according to Trace, the bond-
price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. The yields of those debentures traded yesterday at
107.9 basis points more than Treasuries. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to hold debt of Goldman
Sachs instead of government securities has dropped by about half
this year to 213 basis points yesterday, from 421 at year-end,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. The
average spread on bank debt in the U.S. has tightened 207 basis
points to 177 in the same period. The measure reached 164 basis
points on Oct. 17, the tightest since 2007, the index data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission yesterday suspended a JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) unit&#8217;s
electricity-trading authority, saying it had filed false
information to regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The action, part of a more aggressive effort by the
commission to monitor U.S. power markets, prohibits J.P. Morgan
Ventures Energy Corp. from selling electricity at market-based
rates for six months starting April 1, 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FERC said the company made &#8220;factual
misrepresentations&#8221; and omitted material information in
communications with the California Independent System Operator,
or Caiso, and in filings to the commission. Caiso operates the
state&#8217;s power grid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is very significant in the history of that agency,&#8221;
Charles Peabody, a bank analyst with Portales Partners in New
York, said in an interview. &#8220;FERC has really been stepping up
its investigations into power manipulation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its order released late yesterday, FERC said the
JPMorgan unit will essentially be allowed to participate as a
bystander in wholesale power markets, granting it the ability to
offer electricity into the market without a price attached. This
will ensure that utilities have the ability to obtain enough
power to serve the demand from customers. JPMorgan would still
be able to trade derivatives under the order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Reasonable Rates&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The provision of false, misleading or inaccurate
information undermines the integrity of the FERC decision-making
process, the smooth operation of markets and FERC&#8217;s ability to
ensure just and reasonable rates for customers,&#8221; FERC said in
an e-mailed statement. &#8220;The commission continuously has warned
market participants of the consequences associated with failing
to abide by FERC rules and regulations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for the bank said it is reviewing the
decision and its next steps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a novel use of FERC&#8217;s authority over market-based
rates and is unsupported by FERC&#8217;s own regulations,&#8221; Jennifer Zuccarelli said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission is also investigating alleged manipulation
by traders for Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and Barclays Plc. (BARC) Since January
2011, the agency has announced 11 market-manipulation probes,
and in March it reached a $245 million settlement with
Constellation Energy Group Inc. over one of those cases. Last
month, the agency proposed a record $469.9 million in penalties
for Barclays, which says it will contest the finding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan energy unit reported $2.2 billion paid by
customers in New England, the Midwest and California in 2011,
according to FERC filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Regulatory Trouble &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the unit accounted for a small portion of JPMorgan&#8217;s
$97.2 billion in 2011 revenue, yesterday&#8217;s decision adds to
regulatory trouble for the New York-based company. At least 10
federal agencies and a U.S. Senate panel are investigating a
multibillion-dollar trading loss at its chief investment office
in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Once you mess up, every regulator starts to look to make
sure that they are covered with their oversight,&#8221; said Peabody,
who downgraded JPMorgan&#8217;s shares on Oct. 12 to &#8220;underperform.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first time that an entity active in
California&#8217;s power market has been suspended by the FERC, said
Stephanie McCorkle, spokeswoman for the Caiso. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;In Lockstep&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The ISO and FERC are in lockstep on the importance of
protecting the integrity of energy markets,&#8221; Caiso President
Steve Berberich said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We believe the
FERC order is a strong signal to the entire market of the
importance of proper conduct and cooperation during
investigations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FERC said in September it had initiated a proceeding
against the energy trading unit. The case focuses on whether
JPMorgan&#8217;s energy division, a part of the company&#8217;s commodities
unit run by Blythe Masters, met its obligations to provide
documents to Caiso. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan Ventures Energy allegedly made bids that
resulted in at least $73 million in improper payments to the
generators, according to the FERC. The investigation came to
light when the commission went to court seeking internal e-mails
from JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuccarelli said in her statement that the issue in the case
&#8220;was not J.P. Morgan&#8217;s conduct in the market, but rather a
dispute over document productions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Apology &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a filing with the commission last month, the bank
apologized for what it said were inadvertent mistakes and said
that suspending its trading authority would be an &#8220;unjustified
reaction to unintentional, good-faith mistakes,
misunderstandings and miscommunications.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its decision, the FERC said &#8220;no showing of the
respondent&#8217;s intent or mindset is necessary in order to
demonstrate that a violation&#8221; has occurred. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FERC Commissioner Cheryl LaFleur dissented, saying revoking
market-based rate authority should stem from market conduct, not
because of a disagreement over the documents provided. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I dissented based on the facts and the law in this
case,&#8221; she said today in an interview after the agency&#8217;s
monthly meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan Venture Energy&#8217;s explanation that it wasn&#8217;t
required to give California power officials information &#8220;lacks
credibility and cannot be reconciled with a rational reading of
the emails from the Office of Enforcement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FERC said that during the suspension period, JPMorgan
will only be permitted to &#8220;participate in wholesale electricity
markets by either scheduling quantities of energy products
without an associated price or by specifying a zero-price in its
offer as provided in the pertinent tariffs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The delay in the suspension is to permit Caiso to maintain
system reliability and allow J.P. Morgan Ventures Energy to
fulfill contractual obligations, according to the FERC
statement. The company schedules and controls the dispatch of
electricity from 10 power plant units in Southern California,
according to Caiso. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) promoted 266 employees to managing director, up from 261 last year, as the fifth-biggest U.S. bank seeks to reward staff even as it pares expenses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The annual promotions, which take effect Jan. 1, come one day after New York-based Goldman Sachs named 70 people to its so-called partnership, the fewest since the firm became a public company in 1999. Partners, also called participating managing directors, receive a higher salary than managing directors and share in a special bonus pool. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, led by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, has undertaken a $1.9 billion expense-reduction effort since the middle of last year as higher capital requirements and weak revenue growth cut return on equity. The company employed 32,600 people at the end of September, 3,100 fewer than at the end of 2010. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The investment bank expects that 7.2 percent of employees will be managing directors at the start of 2013, unchanged from a year earlier, according to Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman. Managing directors typically receive a base salary of $500,000, lower than the $900,000 granted to partners. Both also get bonuses that can boost their total compensation into the millions of dollars. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Geographical Mix &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The number of employees named managing director is down from a record 321 in 2010. About 58 percent of those just promoted are based in the Americas, 26 percent in Europe, Middle East and Africa, and 17 percent in Asia, DuVally said. Last year, about 46 percent were in the Americas, 30 percent in EMEA and 23 percent in Asia. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Women comprise 23 percent of the incoming class of managing directors, up from 19 percent in 2011 and down from 24 percent in 2010. The firm said yesterday that 10 of the 70 new partners, or 14 percent, are women. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which announced today&#8217;s promotions in a statement, created the non-partner managing director title in 1996 to recognize top employees who weren&#8217;t yet partners. That first class of 87 managing directors included William C. Dudley, now president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; Clifford S. Asness, who left in 1998 to start hedge fund AQR Capital Management LLC; and Richard J. Gnodde, who was named co-head of global investment banking at Goldman Sachs in May 2011. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company names managing directors every year and elects new partners every other year. The following is a list of the new managing directors: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; *Employee of Goldman Sachs Gao Hua Securities Company Limited **Employee of Beijing Gao Hua Securities Company Limited &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Tanya Angerer" date="Nov 15, 2012 10:20 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/goldman-sachs-says-asian-bond-demand-surge-may-cause-bubble.html"><headline>Goldman Says Asian Bond Market May Face Bubble on Inflows</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Asia&#8217;s bond market is facing a
possible bubble after capital inflows surged this year,
according to Goldman Sachs Asset Management Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bond funds in emerging Asia took in a net $11.45 billion
this year as of Oct. 31, an 85 percent increase from $6.2
billion for the whole of 2011, according to EPFR Global. Yield
premiums on Asia&#8217;s BBB rated sovereign bonds have fallen 71
basis points this half to 173 basis points more than Treasuries
as of Nov. 14, compared with a 52 basis point slide to 164 for
similar-rated countries globally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If bond demand continues at these levels and distorts
prices for a long period of time, the likelihood of asset
bubbles increases,&#8221; Owi Ruivivar, a Singapore-based senior
fixed income portfolio manager at Goldman&#8217;s asset management
firm, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;The main issue with this
increased flow of funds chasing emerging market bonds is that
prices do not fully reflect economic fundamentals.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dollar- and local currency-denominated bond offerings in
Asia surged to records this year as low interest rates in the
U.S. and Europe heightened the appeal of the higher-yielding
assets. Investors are demanding less of a premium for dollar
notes in Asia even as the region&#8217;s growth is likely to slow to
5.4 percent this year from 5.8 percent in 2011, according to the
International Monetary Fund. Yields on local currency debt fell
to a record low of 3.56 percent on Nov. 13, according to HSBC
Holdings Plc indexes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spreads Narrow &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Supply and demand have become the dominant drivers of
bond valuations rather than economic fundamentals,&#8221; Ruivivar
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spreads on dollar bonds in Asia have narrowed 128 basis
points this year to 247.2 basis points more than Treasuries on
Oct. 19, the smallest gap since since April 2010, HSBC Indexes
show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Asia&#8217;s resilience during the global financial crisis is a
big factor attracting overseas bond investors,&#8221; according to
Ruivivar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offerings from Asia outside Japan of $113.4 billion this
year have eclipsed the previous annual record of $73.3 billion
in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Local currency
bond sales are at the equivalent of $203.9 billion this year,
surpassing the previous record of $195.7 billion in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Debt Purchases &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debt-buying by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European
Central Bank in September to support the economy have caused
yield premiums to decrease, triggering a surge in issuance. The
U.S. central bank said at the time that it will probably hold
the federal-funds rate near zero until at least mid-2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If an environment where no real interest rates continue,
this will push investors to look for higher yields and yields in
the entire fixed income complex will move even lower,&#8221; said
Ruivivar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The influx into fixed income, particularly in emerging
markets including in Asia, is understandable due to the dearth
of investment opportunities in higher-yielding products,
according to Desmond Soon, Singapore-based senior portfolio
manager at Western Asset Management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global sales of debt backed by commercial loans has fallen
to $121.2 billion from a record $335 billion in 2007, Bloomberg
data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Prior to Lehman Brothers, there were a lot more dollar
spread products to invest in such as mortgage-backed securities
and commercial mortgage-backed securities,&#8221; Soon said. &#8220;These
have all fallen away or have ended up in the balance sheet of
the Federal Reserve. So, while we are seeing record issuances of
Asian and emerging market corporate bonds in 2012, the reality
is that the universe for dollar spread investors has shrunk
dramatically compared to before 2008.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the largest computer-services provider, is loaning $4
billion through business partners to encourage client spending,
with terms including no interest for the first year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To encourage lending, IBM developed an application for
iPads and smartphones that will allow partners to approve their
clients for contracts of as much as $500,000 in minutes, the
company said today in a statement. IBM will administer the loans
over the next 12 months through its global financing unit, which
managed $36 billion in assets as of last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Businesses both large and small are having tough times
with this tight credit market,&#8221; said Mark Hennessy, general
manager of IBM&#8217;s global business partners and midmarket, in an
interview. &#8220;This is an enhanced focus on supporting our
partners taking our solution to market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clients will come to IBM for simpler, more flexible loans
because &#8220;banks don&#8217;t necessarily understand this space as
well,&#8221; Hennessy said. The loans will make it easier for
business partners to sell their own technology combined with IBM
hardware or cloud computing and analytics products, with some
financing offered interest-free for 12 months with no money
down, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cloud computing, companies hire providers such as IBM to
store data and applications remotely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s global financing unit has operated since 1981 and
uses standard industry tools to evaluate default risk, the
company said. Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) Inc. have
similar loan options. IBM issued $1 billion in loans to small
and medium-size businesses through its partners in 2011, the
company said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Executive
Officer Steve Ballmer said the maker of Windows programs must
exploit the opportunity to combine hardware and software as it
challenges Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPad with the Surface tablet computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker, won&#8217;t cede
that market to competitors even as partners build the &#8220;lion&#8217;s
share&#8221; of devices using Windows in the next five years, Ballmer
said yesterday during an address at the Churchill Club speaker
series in Santa Clara, California. The company recognizes
&#8220;there&#8217;s an innovation opportunity&#8221; by collaborating across
hardware and software, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is undertaking an overhaul of its product line
meant to keep it relevant in the post-PC era. The company
dominated the technology landscape during the heyday of the
personal computer in the 1990s and much of the last decade, yet
has been eclipsed in influence by a resurgent Apple and the rise
of mobile devices taking the place of PCs that run Microsoft&#8217;s
flagship Windows operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We really reimagined Windows,&#8221; he said at the on-stage
discussion with Reid Hoffman, the chairman and co-founder of the
online business network LinkedIn Corp. &#8220;The distinction between
a PC and a tablet I think, at least in our ecosystem, completely
goes away.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sinofsky Departure &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft pushed out Windows division chief Steven Sinofsky
this week as Ballmer pushes for more cross-product coordination
to fight back against Apple and other mobile-device makers,
people with knowledge of the matter said. Ballmer is putting in
place a new team to start work on the next generation of
products after the release of Windows 8, the Surface and mobile-
phone software last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sinofsky&#8217;s duties were reassigned to Julie Larson-Green,
who will take charge of all software and hardware for Windows,
and Tami Reller, who adds oversight of the Windows business to
her marketing and finance responsibilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The new team is fantastic,&#8221; Ballmer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Web, Google Inc. (GOOG) has made its pages hubs for many of
Internet users&#8217; activities, and its Android operating system
powers many of the world&#8217;s mobile phones and tablet computers,
markets Microsoft has tried for years to penetrate. Ballmer, 56,
is trying to adapt in a computer industry landscape vastly
changed from when he took over as CEO from co-founder Bill Gates
in 2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;HP, Dell &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to shifting trends, the Redmond, Washington-
based company last month released Windows 8 -- the biggest
change to its flagship product in nearly two decades -- designed
around a revamped home screen featuring colorful tiles that
launch programs and update users with current information from
the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With technology companies, you either move forward or you
die,&#8221; Ballmer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Oct. 26, the same day Windows 8 went on sale, Microsoft
started selling Surface, its first foray into the computer
market. The tablet, featuring attachable keyboards that double
as covers, was designed by Microsoft and runs Windows RT, a
special version for chips from ARM Holdings Plc -- and a break
from the company&#8217;s traditional PC partners Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ),
Dell Inc. (DELL) and Intel Corp. (INTC) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Seminal Moment&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ballmer said in an Oct. 25 interview with Bloomberg TV&#8217;s
Cory Johnson that the release of Windows 8 and Surface is one of
&#8220;three seminal moments&#8221; in his 32-year Microsoft career,
standing alongside releasing Windows 95 and the advent of
International Business Machines Corp.&#8217;s first PC in 1981. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is relying on the new operating system to revive
interest in the personal computer. The PC market will contract
by 1.2 percent to 348.7 million units this year, according to
IHS ISuppli. That would be the first annual decline since 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Surface is a best-in-class product&#8221; and sets a high bar
for PC makers to clear, said Rick Sherlund, an analyst at Nomura
Holdings Inc. in New York. Sherlund, who recommends buying
Microsoft shares, estimates the company can sell 2 million
Surface computers in the fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft have underperformed the broader stock
market the past five years, losing 21 percent of their value
compared with a 6.6 percent drop in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
Index and an 11 percent gain for the SP 500 Information
Technology Index. Fiscal first-quarter sales for the period
ended in September fell 8 percent as sales of Windows and Office
both declined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Wild&#8217; Android &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple&#8217;s Macs, iPads and iPhones are replacing many of the
jobs once done by Windows machines, and Apple has supplanted
Microsoft as the center of gravity for outside software
developers whose products make each platform more compelling.
Apple said Nov. 5 it sold 3 million fourth-generation iPads and
iPad mini models during their debut weekend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphone versions of Windows held just 2 percent of the
market in the third quarter, dwarfed by the 75 percent share of
Google&#8217;s Android and 14.9 percent for Apple&#8217;s iOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is making plans for the possible creation of its
own smartphone, according to people with knowledge of the
company&#8217;s plans. The company on Oct. 29 introduced the latest
version of its Windows Phone software that relies on the same
underlying code as desktop and tablet Windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which has single-digit market share in
smartphones, wants to get 10 percent to 15 percent share as its
next step, Ballmer said. Windows-based smartphones have an
opportunity to stand out because &#8220;all these phones look the
darned same,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ballmer said there&#8217;s an opportunity for Windows on
smartphones and tablets since Android is &#8220;wild&#8221; and the iOS
ecosystem is &#8220;controlled&#8221; and high-priced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC) hired
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Citigroup Inc. (C) to seek buyers for its
Bresnan Broadband Holdings LLC unit acquired in 2010, said two
people familiar with the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process is at a very early stage and no deadline has
been set for the first round of bids, said the people, who asked
not to be named because the process is private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cablevision, the fifth-largest U.S. cable company by
subscribers, bought Bresnan from Providence Equity Partners Inc.
almost two years ago for $1.37 billion, gaining operations in
Colorado, Montana and Wyoming. The company is weighing a sale
after fellow cable operators such as Knology Inc. and
WaveDivision Holdings LLC, agreed to takeovers by buyout firms
this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cablevision shares rose 2.9 percent to $14.02 at the close
in New York, after earlier advancing as much as 18 percent on
the report. They have dropped 7.7 percent in the past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Schueler, a spokesman for Bethpage, New York-based
Cablevision, declined to comment, as did representatives at
Citigroup and JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possible suitors for Bresnan include Charter Communications
Inc. (CHTR), Suddenlink Communications and private-equity firms, said
the same people. Representatives at Suddenlink and Charter
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg reported Bresnan, now known as Optimum West, was
for sale last month. Chief Executive Officer James Dolan said
Cablevision had received &#8220;unsolicited interest in possibly
acquiring Optimum West&#8221; without going into further specifics in
a conference call earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While it has not been our intention to divest this
valuable asset, based on the approaches that we received we have
decided to explore a potential transaction,&#8221; Dolan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no assurance a transaction will take place, Chief
Financial Officer Gregg Seibert said on the same call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Dakin Campbell" date="Nov 16, 2012  5:03 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-16/visa-receives-ftc-letter-tied-to-possible-violations-of-durbin.html"><headline>Visa Receives FTC Letter Over Possible Violations of Durbin</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V), the world&#8217;s largest
payments network, said it will provide documents to the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission after the agency asked for information
on a debit-card service that may have violated the Durbin
amendment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. antitrust regulators asked Visa in a Sept. 21 letter
to voluntarily hand over documents related to its PIN Debit
Gateway Service, the Foster City, California-based company said
today in a filing. Visa said it&#8217;s cooperating with the U.S. and
responding to its requests for information, and that the revenue
in question isn&#8217;t material. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gateway is optional and provided by Visa &#8220;to merchant
acquirers that want to route transactions to other networks, but
do not have connections to those networks,&#8221; Darrin Peller, a
New York-based analyst at Barclays Plc, wrote in a note today.
&#8220;We suspect that the FTC&#8217;s focus is driven by the recent
regulations&#8221; and the increased use of the service &#8220;given that
there are now greater PIN debit routing options,&#8221; he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The request is another in a line of lawsuits and document
requests faced by Visa and newly named Chief Executive Officer
Charles Scharf as the firm seeks to defend its leading market
share in worldwide payments. In May, the company said it was the
subject of a U.S. antitrust probe into its pricing for debit-
card transactions. Visa continues to provide information to the
U.S. in that investigation, according to today&#8217;s filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Merchant Agreement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Durbin amendment, named after U.S. Senator Richard Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, is a provision of the Dodd-Frank
Act that limits the amount of swipe fees, or interchange, Visa
and MasterCard Inc. (MA) can charge on debit-card transactions. The
companies collect the money and remit it to their member banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year Visa, MasterCard and the banks reached a
proposed $6.6 billion settlement with merchants over credit-card
transaction fees after seven years of litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa rose 1.9 percent to close at $142.71 in New York. The
shares have climbed 41 percent this year, the fifth most in the
70-company Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Information Technology Index,
which has gained 7.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Jef Feeley and Margaret Cronin Fisk" date="Nov 16, 2012  4:22 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-16/pfizer-ceo-must-testify-in-chantix-trial-lawyer-says.html"><headline>Pfizer CEO Must Testify in Chantix Trial, Lawyer Says</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s top executive must
testify in court about claims the company&#8217;s anti-smoking drug
Chantix causes depression and other psychiatric disorders, a
lawyer for an Alabama man suing over the medication said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorneys for Billy Bedsole have subpoenaed Ian Read,
Pfizer&#8217;s chief executive officer, and two other officials to
testify live at the trial of Bedsole&#8217;s claims that the anti-
smoking drug caused his breakdown and forced him to be
institutionalized, said Ernest Cory, one of Bedsole&#8217;s lawyers.
U.S. District Judge Inge Johnson has denied Pfizer&#8217;s request to
throw out the subpoenas, Cory added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial, which would be the first patient lawsuit over
Chantix to be heard by a jury, is slated for Jan. 22, 2013, in
federal court in Florence, Alabama, according to court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think the jury will look forward to having Mr. Read
testify in Alabama and he should look forward to defending
Chantix,&#8221; Cory said in an interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, New York-based Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, reached a confidential settlement with the widow of a
Minnesota man who killed himself after taking Chantix. The case
on behalf of the family of Mark Alan Whitely had been slated to
begin Oct. 22 in Florence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Loder, Pfizer&#8217;s spokesman, declined to immediately
comment on the subpoenas for the executives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Erratic Behavior&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read, along with Pfizer executives Diana Hughes and Carl
Wilbanks, had been subpoenaed in the Whitely case before it
settled. The same three executives have been called to testify
in Bedsole&#8217;s case, Cory said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bedsole, an employee with a local power company, took
Chantix in 2007 in hopes of being able to quit smoking, Cory
said. Instead, the drug caused him to develop suicidal thoughts,
&#8220;memory loss, depression, erratic behavior, mood swings,
anxiety and hospitalization,&#8221; according to court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bedsole&#8217;s case and other lawsuits have been combined in a
multidistrict litigation before Johnson in Alabama for pretrial
evidence-gathering and the first trials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suits claim Chantix causes depression and other
psychiatric disorders, some so severe that patients attempt or
commit suicide. The plaintiffs allege that Pfizer knew of a link
between Chantix and suicide and failed to sufficiently warn
patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has denied that Chantix was the cause of Bedsole&#8217;s
ailments or that the company withheld information about the
drug. The company provided warnings on the drug&#8217;s package insert
of reports of suicidal thoughts since 2006, its lawyers have
said in court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consolidated cases are In re Chantix (Varenicline)
Products Liability Litigation MDL 2092, 09-cv-2039 U.S. District
Court, Northern District of Alabama (Florence). Bedsole&#8217;s case
is Billy G. Bedsole Jr. v. Pfizer Inc. (PFE), 09-cv-2051 U.S. District
Court, Northern District of Alabama (Florence). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millions of dollars in penalties
slapped on some of the world&#8217;s biggest banks, including JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM), by U.S. regulators are the result of policing
powers established after the 2001 collapse of Enron Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the past month, the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, acting on recommendations from a 200-person
enforcement unit assembled in the past three years, proposed
fines on Barclays Plc (BARC) and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) for manipulating
energy trades. The agency this week revoked J.P. Morgan Ventures
Energy Corp.&#8217;s right to trade power for six months next year --
the first such sanction for an active market participant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t say that we&#8217;re picking on the banks,&#8221; FERC
Chairman Jon Wellinghoff said in an interview. &#8220;We&#8217;re going
after anybody who&#8217;s involved in manipulative or fraudulent
activity in these markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FERC didn&#8217;t always wield such muscle. Its authority
expanded after the California power crisis of 2000-2001, when
Enron traders&#8217; actions triggered rolling blackouts. In 2005
Congress enacted a sweeping energy law that gave the FERC the
ability to go after fraud and manipulation. It also gave the
agency the authority to impose fines as high as $1 million a day
for those who tamper with electric-grid reliability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Build Up&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FERC enforcement unit is led by Norman Bay, a former
U.S. attorney in New Mexico, and includes a former general
counsel for the Federal Bureau of Investigation as well as about
40 analysts who focus on market-manipulation violations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A lot of people think you put a law in place and you&#8217;re
ready to go the next day,&#8221; Wellinghoff said in a Nov. 7
interview. &#8220;Unfortunately it&#8217;s not quite like that. It takes a
substantial period of time to build up a team and to build up
the expertise and the resources necessary to utilize the tools
that Congress gave us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researching cases also takes time, and much of the office&#8217;s
efforts in recent years are now coming to fruition. Since
January 2011, the FERC announced 11 cases of alleged market
manipulation in the electricity and natural gas markets, and
this year settled with Constellation Energy Group Inc. for $245
million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases have been developed over years. Barclays&#8217; alleged
violations, which drew a proposed record fine on Oct. 31, took
place from 2006 to 2008. Barclays, which said its trading
complied with the law, has vowed to fight the $469.9 million
penalty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deutsche Bank &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank Energy Trading LLC on Nov. 5 said it was
protesting FERC&#8217;s proposed penalties of $1.6 million for alleged
misconduct during early 2010, saying the agency&#8217;s legal position
is &#8220;radical.&#8221; The agency is punishing JPMorgan for producing
incorrect documents in a manipulation investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for JPMorgan, which has apologized for what
it has said was an inadvertent mistakes, said it is reviewing
the decision and its next steps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a novel use of FERC&#8217;s authority over market-based
rates and is unsupported by FERC&#8217;s own regulations,&#8221; Jennifer Zuccarelli said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the violations during the Enron era involved traders
using illegal practices to drive up prices which led to
blackouts, the commission has seen a different type of
manipulation violation in recent years, in which traders try to
&#8220;play one market off the other,&#8221; Wellinghoff said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Without Hedging &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traders might take a loss in the physical energy markets,
where electricity is bought and sold, in order to make money on
financial exchanges &#8220;without any legitimate hedging purpose,&#8221;
he said. FERC alleges that this is what happened in the Barclays
case. Wellinghoff said energy companies also are reporting
misconduct by calling an agency telephone hotline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re getting substantial information from other market
participants&#8221; who may be losing money at a competitor&#8217;s
expense, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though Wellinghoff denied FERC is targeting financial
companies, the investigations are evidence that Wall Street
firms have the savvy to game the system, according to Tyson Slocum, director of the energy program at Public Citizen, a
Washington-based consumer group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It appears as though Wall Street is playing a significant
role in exploiting overly complex market rules,&#8221; Slocum said in
an interview. Regulators should revoke energy-trading privileges
for all companies accused of alleged market manipulation, he
said. &#8220;That&#8217;s the most significant club that FERC can wield.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;California Market &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, the California Independent System Operator
complained to the FERC yesterday that the JPMorgan unit, which
controls electric generators in Huntington Beach, is using its
stake to block changes to plants that will be needed by the
state next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grid operator is seeking the FERC&#8217;s permission to move
ahead with the project, by removing JPMorgan&#8217;s right to object
to the changes. Asked about the filing to FERC, Zuccarelli in an
e-mail today said: &#8220;J.P. Morgan&#8217;s goal is to work cooperatively
to help to find an economic and efficient way to make generation
available in California.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wellinghoff said he expects market-manipulation violations
to decline as traders realize that the agency&#8217;s enforcement
division is operating at &#8220;full speed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The message is going to transfer through the industry
that if you engage in this kind of activity you&#8217;re going to get
caught,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you get caught you&#8217;re going to pay.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wellinghoff said the FERC plans to &#8220;go after&#8221; individual
traders as well as specific companies. And he&#8217;s not concerned
about whether this may spook the financial sector. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Have you ever met any traders?&#8221; he said to reporters
after the commission&#8217;s monthly meeting yesterday. &#8220;Very few of
them are scared or intimidated by anything.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Weber, a former U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission internal investigator fired
for allegedly carrying a firearm while on duty, sued the agency
for wrongful termination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weber, who was chief investigator in the SEC&#8217;s inspector
general&#8217;s office, is asking for $40 million in damages. His
suit, filed yesterday in federal court in Washington, argues
that he was terminated as part of a campaign to &#8220;cover up&#8221; and
&#8220;whitewash&#8221; disclosures of wrongdoing he was investigating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weber was placed on paid leave by the SEC in May, shortly
after he raised allegations that ex-inspector general H. David
Kotz may have had personal relationships that tainted probes on
the SEC&#8217;s handling of the Bernard Madoff and R. Allen Stanford
Ponzi schemes. Weber was fired on Oct. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit called the gun allegations &#8220;baseless&#8221; and
said he kept a legally registered firearm in his car. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman Mary Schapiro was named as a defendant in the
suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Nester, an SEC spokesman, declined to comment
immediately on the case and said the agency would respond in
court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 75-page lawsuit alleges that people involved in firing
Weber had conflicts of interest because they were subjects of
investigations being supervised by Weber. The court filing
contains extensive detail on the probes that Weber was pursuing
in his job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Weber v. U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, 12-cv-01850, U.S. District Court, District of
Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rating Companies Disregard Own Rules, Delay Disclosure, SEC Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-rating companies failed to follow their own
standards, were late to downgrade deals and delayed disclosure
of methodology changes this year, according to the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The watchdog didn&#8217;t name specific companies, separating
them as either &#8220;larger firms,&#8221; including McGraw-Hill Co.&#8217;s
Standard  Poor&#8217;s, Moody&#8217;s Corp.&#8217;s Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and
Fitch Ratings, and six others, such as Kroll Bond Rating Agency
Inc. and DBRS Inc. as &#8220;smaller firms.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three larger firms as well as two smaller companies
failed to follow their own methodologies in determining ratings,
the Office of Credit Ratings said yesterday in its annual report
on Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations or
NRSROs, which is required by the Dodd-Frank financial reform
act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After inflated credit ratings for risky mortgage bonds were
blamed for helping cause the worst financial crisis since the
Great Depression, policy makers have been searching for a way to
ensure the grades are accurate. Dodd-Frank instructed regulators
to stop relying on ratings and increase oversight of the
companies that issue them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;French Trading Tax Misses Mark as Speculators Find Loopholes &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As France begins collecting its financial-transactions tax
this month, it is becoming evident that President Francois
Hollande&#8217;s levy is hitting small investors rather than
speculators, its intended target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hollande, who called finance his &#8220;main adversary&#8221; during
his election campaign, pushed through in August a 0.2 percent
transaction tax on share purchases, making France the first and
only country so far in Europe to have such a levy. Many
investors have been escaping the tax using so-called contracts
for difference, or CFDs, offered by prime brokers that let them
bet on a stock&#8217;s gain or loss without owning the shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Nov. 1, the state started collecting the levy on the
purchase of 109 French stocks with market values of more than 1
billion euros ($1.2 billion), including Sanofi SA (SAN) and Vivendi
SA. (VIV) While the government expects the tax to add 530 million
euros to its budget in 2012 and 1.6 billion euros next year, the
finance ministry says it&#8217;s too early to say if these estimates
are realistic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ministry concurred with traders&#8217; and analysts&#8217;
assessment that market players will use a range of derivatives
to skirt the tax, leaving small investors bearing the burden. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hollande himself this week conceded that the tax was only a
&#8220;modest&#8221; blow to the finance sector. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His other plan to fight &#8220;speculators&#8221; includes splitting
French banks&#8217; retail and investment activities and increasing
taxes on lenders&#8217; salaries and speculative operations. A bank
bill will be unveiled on Dec. 19, Hollande said last week. He
expects 11 other European countries to join France in imposing
the tax. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Power-Trading Authority Suspended 6 Months by Regulator &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Nov. 14
suspended a JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) unit&#8217;s electrical-trading
authority, saying it filed false information to regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The action, part of a more aggressive effort by the
commission to monitor U.S. power markets, prohibits J.P. Morgan
Ventures Energy Corp. from selling electricity at market-based
rates for six months starting April 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FERC said the company made &#8220;factual
misrepresentations&#8221; and omitted material information in
communications with the California Independent System Operator,
or Caiso, and in filings to the commission. Caiso operates the
state&#8217;s power grid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FERC said in the order that the JPMorgan unit will
essentially be allowed to participate as a bystander in
wholesale power markets, granting it the ability to offer
electricity into the market without a price attached. This will
ensure that utilities have the ability to obtain enough power to
serve the demand from customers. JPMorgan would still be able to
trade derivatives under the order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a novel use of FERC&#8217;s authority over market-based
rates and is unsupported by FERC&#8217;s own regulations,&#8221; Jennifer
Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. The bank
is reviewing the decision and its next steps, she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;SEC, CFTC Should Merge, House Panel Investigating MF Global Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commodity Futures Trading Commission didn&#8217;t give the
Securities and Exchange Commission full information about MF
Global (MFGLQ) Holdings Ltd., leaving the agency with incomplete
knowledge of the company&#8217;s liquidity, the House Financial
Services panel said in a report on MF Global&#8217;s collapse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is no record of meaningful communication between
the SEC and the CFTC until the week before the company&#8217;s
bankruptcy. When these regulators finally tried to coordinate,
it was disorganized and haphazard,&#8221; the CFTC said in the
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House panel recommended that the SEC and the CFTC
streamline operations &#8220;or merge into a single financial
regulatory agency that would have oversight of the entire
capital markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel Nov. 14 released results of a yearlong
investigation into the futures brokerage&#8217;s path to bankruptcy.
It found that MF Global collapsed last year because of mistakes
made by the former chairman and chief executive officer Jon S.
Corzine, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Corzine acted in good faith and did what he believed
was necessary to turn around MF Global,&#8221; Steven Goldberg, a
spokesman for Corzine, said in an e-mail statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bachus Says He Has Been Notified That FHA Will Need a Bailout &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Housing Administration is running out of money
for first time in its history, House Financial Services
Committee Chairman Spencer Bachus, a Republican from Alabama,
said in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bachus said he will work with Democrats to address FHA
problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FHA&#8217;s capital reserves have fallen &#8220;deep into negative
territory,&#8221; the New York Times reported earlier, citing
unidentified people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BP Agrees to $4.5 Billion in Penalties Over 2010 Gulf Oil Spill &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc (BP/) reached a settlement with the U.S. government for
$4.5 billion that will end all criminal charges and resolve
securities claims relating to the worst U.S. offshore oil spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two well-site managers were charged with involuntary
manslaughter and a former executive was charged with obstruction
and false statements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The London-based company announced a $4 billion settlement
yesterday with the U.S. Justice Department that includes a
record $1.26 billion criminal fine, which would be paid over
five years. The company agreed to five years&#8217; probation and also
will pay $525 million to settle Securities and Exchange
Commission claims, according to a press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP said it agreed to plead guilty to 11 felony counts of
misconduct or neglect of ships officers related to the 11 deaths
that occurred when their oil drilling rig exploded, one
misdemeanor count under the Clean Water Act, one misdemeanor
count under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and one felony count
of obstruction of justice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All of us at BP deeply regret the tragic loss of life
caused by the Deepwater Horizon accident as well as the impact
of the spill on the Gulf coast region,&#8221; BP Chief Executive
Officer Bob Dudley said in a statement. &#8220;We apologize for our
role in the accident, and as today&#8217;s resolution with the U.S.
government further reflects, we have accepted responsibility for
our actions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government case is U.S. v. BP Exploration  Production
Inc., 2:10-cv-04536, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Louisiana (New Orleans). The lawsuit is part of In Re Oil Spill
by the Oil Rig Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico on April
20, 2010, MDL-2179, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Louisiana (New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the video, click here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, the company still faces claims seeking billions
of dollars more for the catastrophe relating to environmental
violations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s $4.5 billion agreement left the company at risk
for as much as $17.6 billion in potential fines from alleged
violations of the Clean Water Act and demands by the U.S. and
Gulf states for enough money to restore the region&#8217;s coastline
and waters to their condition before the spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe&#8217;s second-biggest oil company will face resistance
from both state and federal authorities in trying to resolve the
remaining pollution violations and natural resource damages
claims, said Garret Graves, chairman of Louisiana&#8217;s Coastal
Protection and Restoration Authority. Both sets of claims will
&#8220;easily be in the tens of billions of dollars,&#8221; Graves said in
a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, BP may escape a federal contracting ban as it tries
to rebuild its reputation. The company, the Pentagon&#8217;s biggest
fuel supplier with awards valued at about $1.35 billion in 2011,
said it hasn&#8217;t been informed about a so-called contracting death
sentence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wal-Mart Starts Corruption Inquiries in Brazil, China, India &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) started inquiries into potential
violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act at operations in
Brazil, India and China, adding to its probe of bribery
allegations in Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board&#8217;s audit committee and the company identified or
became aware of the possible FCPA violations since starting a
global review of its compliance programs, Bentonville, Arkansas-
based Wal-Mart said yesterday in a filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. The new inquiries aren&#8217;t
limited to those countries, Wal-Mart said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new probes come as the U.S. Department of Justice and
the SEC investigate allegations that Wal-Mart systematically
bribed Mexican officials so it could more quickly open stores in
the country. Investigations by Mexican government agencies are
also pending. Wal-Mart said in yesterday&#8217;s filing that it is
cooperating with the probes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart said the costs of responding to investigations by
the DOJ and SEC as well as defending itself from shareholder
lawsuits and conducting its own probe were $99 million in the
nine months ended Oct. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ex-Mizuho Banker&#8217;s Girlfriends Not Guilty of Insider Trading &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two girlfriends of former Mizuho International Plc
investment banker Thomas Ammann were found not guilty of
illegally trading on tips from him about Canon Inc. (7751)&#8217;s
acquisition of OCE NV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The women nearly doubled the amount they invested and then
paid half of their profits to Ammann, the U.K. Financial
Services Authority, which prosecuted the case, had said during
the trial in London. Neither woman knew Ammann was dating the
other simultaneously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jessica Mang, a 30-year-old British chiropractor, and
Christina Weckwerth, 44, were both cleared yesterday by the jury
after a four-week trial. Both cried when the verdicts were
returned and declined to comment afterward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ammann, a German national who worked on the Mizuho mergers
and acquisitions team that advised Canon on the OCE deal,
pleaded guilty earlier this year to insider trading and
encouraging Mang and Weckwerth to commit insider trading. Canon,
the Tokyo-based maker of cameras and photocopiers, agreed to buy
OCE in a 730 million-euro ($931.8 million) deal in November
2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSA said that Ammann tried to avoid being caught by
having his girlfriends make the trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Needham  Co. Ex-Finance Chief Charged in $1 Million Theft &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glen W. Albanese, a former chief financial officer at
brokerage firm Needham  Co., was arrested by the FBI and
charged with stealing $1 million through a false invoicing
scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Albanese, 41, stole from the New York-based company from
2000 to December 2010 by directing certain vendors to submit
phony invoices, according to a Federal Bureau of Investigation
arrest complaint. He told one vendor to give him envelopes of
cash, while others paid his personal expenses, according to the
FBI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Albanese, a resident of Manalapan, New Jersey, used the
proceeds to pay for personal luxuries and travel expenses,
according to the complaint. He was scheduled to appear yesterday
in federal court in Newark, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Needham, Ingrid Thoonen, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a call seeking comment on his arrest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Albanese, 12-cr-7289, U.S. District
Court, District of New Jersey (Newark). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CFTC to Appeal Ruling Rejecting Dodd-Frank Trading Limits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission will appeal a
judge&#8217;s ruling that rejected efforts to curb speculative
derivatives trading after the 2008 financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission filed a notice of appeal yesterday in
federal court in Washington, seeking to ask a three-judge panel
to reverse a ruling by U.S. District Judge Robert Wilkins that
said the CFTC failed to assess whether limiting the number of
contracts a trader can have in oil, natural gas or other
commodities was necessary and appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision, which blocked rules scheduled to take effect
Oct. 12, was a victory for two Wall Street groups that
challenged the constraints imposed under the 2010 Dodd-Frank
Act. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association
and International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc., in one
of the financial industry&#8217;s highest-profile efforts to weaken
Dodd-Frank, sued in two federal courts in Washington in
December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is one of several brought by the financial
industry as it pushes back against tighter regulations passed
after the 2008 credit crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The associations that sued represent JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS) and other banks and
energy-trading firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is International Swaps and Derivatives Association
v. U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 11-02146, U.S.
District Court, District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interviews &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AMF&#8217;s Rameix Says Transaction Tax Needs More Adoption &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gerard Rameix, president of the Autorite des Marches
Financiers, discussed a proposal by French Finance Minister
Pierre Moscovici to force banks to isolate in separate
subsidiaries activities that engage in risky trading. He also
discussed the financial-transaction tax. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slovenia should sell state-owned
companies to attract investors from outside the country, Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s Alexander Dibelius said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As a small country you have the advantage to be
adjustable and quick in adopting changes,&#8221; Dibelius, who runs
the bank&#8217;s operations in Germany, Austria, Russia and central
Europe, said in an e-mailed statement from industry body AmCham
Slovenia today. &#8220;Slovenia has good companies, excellent people,
geostrategically, you have access to all parts of Europe and the
chances to change for the better is in your own hands.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slovenia, the first post-communist nation to introduce the
euro in 2007, is struggling to avoid the need for a bailout from
international lenders as political gridlock grips the nation of
2 million people. The government of Prime Minister Janez Jansa
is pushing ahead with an overhaul of the economy with some
measures threatened by a possible referendum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labor unions and opposition leaders have filed a motion for
a people&#8217;s vote on government plans to recapitalize state-owned
lenders like Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d. and the creation of a
wealth fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dibelius favors the creation of a &#8220;bad bank&#8221; in Slovenia
because such a plan &#8220;frees banks burdened by bad loans so that
they can again give loans to the economy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slovenia wants to accelerate plans to sell state-owned
companies including Nova Kreditna Banka (KBMR) Maribor d.d. and Telekom
Slovenije d.d., Finance Minister Janez Sustersic said in an
interview last month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is expected to
receive an order from regulators to bolster anti-money
laundering systems and examine past transactions, the Wall
Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency will give the
cease-and-desist order amid a wider crackdown on the nation&#8217;s
largest banks, the people said, according to the newspaper.
JPMorgan spokeswoman Kate Haywood in London declined to comment,
as did a spokeswoman in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authorities and lawmakers in the U.S. have been increasing
scrutiny of banks&#8217; money-laundering controls. HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)
said this month that it&#8217;s likely to face criminal charges and
the cost of a settlement may &#8220;significantly&#8221; exceed the $1.5
billion the London-based bank has set aside. U.K. rival Standard
Chartered Plc (STAN) paid $340 million in August to settle a New York
regulator&#8217;s claim it broke Iranian sanctions rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comptroller last week told banks including New York-
based JPMorgan to expect more enforcement actions and fines for
possible violations of money-laundering procedures, the Journal
said, citing banking industry officials it didn&#8217;t identify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan fell 1 percent to $39 by 11:21 a.m. in Germany
from $39.39 at the close of trading on the New York Stock
Exchange yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OCC in April ordered Citigroup Inc. (C) to improve
compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act requiring safeguards
against money laundering. Deficiencies prevented New York-based
Citigroup from identifying risky customers and monitoring client
relationships, the regulator said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) has stopped working at a research center it set up with
the Lithuanian government in 2010 as the European Union refused
to help finance the initiative, Verslo Zinios reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM put participation in the project on hold several months
ago as Lithuania failed to get financing from the EU to match
the company&#8217;s contributions, the newspaper said, citing Vice
Minister of Economy Adomas Audickas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithuania is negotiating with the EU about funding
possibilities and with IBM about reducing the government&#8217;s
commitments, the newspaper cited him as saying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM may cancel its five-year contract with Lithuania by the
end of this year if no agreement is reached, Audickas said,
according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) named Marianne Lake to succeed Chief Financial Officer Doug Braunstein,
extending an overhaul of senior leadership at the largest U.S.
bank by assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lake, 43, will assume the new role in the first quarter as
Braunstein, 51, becomes a vice chairman, the company said
yesterday in a statement. Lake most recently was CFO of the New
York-based firm&#8217;s consumer and community banking business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Braunstein is relinquishing oversight of the bank&#8217;s
finances after Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56, shuffled
other top managers in the wake of more than $6.2 billion of
losses linked to a trader nicknamed the London Whale. Braunstein
had reported to Dimon until July when Matt Zames, 42, the
executive assigned to clean up the bad trades, became his boss
as co-chief operating officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s been a lot of change recently, somewhat driven by
the Whale, but that&#8217;s life, and we tried to do the right thing
there and we&#8217;re doing fine,&#8221; Dimon said in an interview.
JPMorgan is &#8220;basically done&#8221; with the management overhaul that
began in May after the bank disclosed initial losses on a
credit-derivatives portfolio. &#8220;I hope we&#8217;re back to what I call
a steady state,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lake has been CFO of the consumer and community banking
business since 2009. The unit, with 160,000 employees and 50
million customers, offers services including banking, loans,
credit cards, mortgages and wealth management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Accounting Background &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lake, who has a bachelor&#8217;s degree in physics, said it was
&#8220;surreal&#8221; to see her name on television after yesterday&#8217;s
announcement. She started out as an accountant for
PricewaterhouseCoopers in London and Sydney when she was 21
years old and has worked in finance and accounting for more than
two decades. She&#8217;s the first JPMorgan CFO with a background
focused on those areas since Dina Dublon left in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not at the top of my mind to make sweeping changes
right now,&#8221; Lake said in an interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s a well-run
function that I have been a part of. I have huge amounts of
respect for Doug, and the people who worked with him.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appointment comes two months after Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., the fifth-biggest U.S. bank and one of JPMorgan&#8217;s main
investment-banking rivals, named Harvey M. Schwartz to succeed
David A. Viniar as CFO at the end of January. Schwartz will
assume the role after a career spent primarily in sales and
trading, a contrast to Lake&#8217;s credentials and Viniar&#8217;s
experience overseeing treasury and the firm&#8217;s controllers. &lt;/p&gt;

will run on gas generated from wastewater. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 200-kilowatt plant will be installed next year at the
Dry Creek Water Reclamation Facility in Cheyenne, according to a
statement today. FuelCell&#8217;s systems use a chemical reaction to
produce electricity from natural gas, methane or biogas that&#8217;s
emitted from wastewater treatment plants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building a data center alongside the water plant makes a
fuel cell a good fit because they generate &#8220;continuous baseload
power right where the biogas is generated,&#8221; Chief Executive
Officer Chip Bottone said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electricity that&#8217;s not used by the server farm will be
given to the water facility. The project may be partially funded
by a $1.5 million grant on which the Wyoming Business Council
will vote Dec. 6. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. bought
warrants representing about 8.5 percent of the market value of
Drake  Scull International PJSC, (DSI) a Dubai-based supplier of
engineering services to the construction industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The warrants have a notional value equal to 147 million
dirhams ($40 million) with a five-year maturity and can be
exercised after two years, Drake  Scull said today in a
statement to the Dubai stock market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, whose shareholders include HSBC Private Bank,
reported a 93 percent drop in third-quarter profit, missing
analysts&#8217; estimates. Drake  Scull said on Nov. 14 that it
obtained a $120 million loan, coordinated by Goldman Sachs, (GS) to
help it pursue &#8220;growth plans in North Africa, Asia and other
growth markets and provide the liquidity to capitalize on
various private public partnership projects.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third-quarter profit retreated to 3.92 million dirhams,
from 57.5 million dirhams a year earlier as contracting revenue
dropped 26 percent, the company said in a statement yesterday. 
The median estimate of four analysts was for a profit of 37.8
million dirhams, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The 
decline reflected a slowdown in the construction industry, 
according to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Productivity rates dropped across projects in the Gulf
Cooperation Council countries and Africa, while the procurement
cycle dipped because of the summer holiday season, Chief
Financial Officer Osama Hamdan said in the statement. Drake 
Scull has an order backlog of 7.5 billion dirhams, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drake  Scull fell 4.3 percent to 71.8 fils at 1:59 p.m. in
Dubai today. The stock declined 4.3 percent this year compared
with a 17 percent advance for the benchmark DFM General Index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. (GMCR),
the maker of Keurig K-Cups and brewers, named Coca-Cola Co.&#8217;s
Brian Kelley as chief executive officer to succeed Lawrence J. Blanford, who is retiring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blanford, who said in February he planned to retire, helped
the board identify a successor. Kelley, 51, has worked five
years at Coca-Cola, where he led the integration of the
acquisition of Coca-Cola Enterprises assets to create the
refreshments unit, Green Mountain said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green Mountain, based in Waterbury, Vermont, has been
facing increasing competition from private-label capsules made
by Kroger Co. (KR) and Safeway Inc. (SWY) that fit into Keurig brewers.
It&#8217;s also facing pressure from Starbucks Corp. (SBUX), which recently
began selling its own single-serve coffee and latte maker,
called the Verismo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Kelley not only brings experience but also credibility to
the Green Mountain story, which has been on a rocky road over
the past year,&#8221; William Chappell, an analyst at SunTrust
Robinson Humphrey in Atlanta, wrote in a note today. Chappell
upgraded the stock from neutral to buy on the announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares rose 2 percent to $27.87 at the close in New
York. Green Mountain has declined 38 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kelley will be Green Mountain&#8217;s third chief executive.
Blanford has been CEO since assuming the role from the company&#8217;s
founder, Bob Stiller, in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kelley, who will also become Green Mountain&#8217;s president
Dec. 3, joined Coca-Cola in 2007 and was slated to become
president of refreshments in January. He&#8217;s also led Sirva Inc.,
a provider of relocation services, and worked at Ford Motor Co.
and Procter  Gamble Co. (PG) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green Mountain is scheduled to report fourth-quarter
earnings on Nov. 27. Analysts project net income will fall about
4.3 percent from a year earlier, which would be the first
decline in seven quarters, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zipcar Inc. (ZIP), the company that rents
cars by the hour or day, climbed to a six-week high after
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) raised its rating on the stock to buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares gained 7.1 percent to $7.53 in New York for
their highest close since Oct. 8. Zipcar, based in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, has declined 44 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rating change from neutral is &#8220;a high-risk, high-
reward contrarian call,&#8221; Goldman said in a Nov. 19 report.
Zipcar&#8217;s profit may rise more than investors expect because of
&#8220;potentially higher operating margins in new and established
markets&#8221; such as Boston, New York, San Francisco and
Washington, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zipcar, which created the business of hourly car rental in
Cambridge in 2000, has suffered as competition increased.
Enterprise Holdings Inc. and Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (HTZ), the two
largest companies in the U.S. industry, have expanded hourly
rentals this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman raised its 12-month price target on Zipcar&#8217;s shares
to $8.75 from $8. The stock reached a closing peak of $29.27 on
April 19, 2011, six days after Zipcar&#8217;s initial public offering. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nestle SA (NESN)&#8217;s acquisition of Pfizer
Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s infant-nutrition unit in Mexico was blocked by the
nation&#8217;s antitrust agency, which said the deal would hurt
consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction, part of an $11.9 billion deal to buy
Pfizer&#8217;s worldwide nutrition business, would give Vevey,
Switzerland-based Nestle market share of as much as 88 percent,
depending on the type of baby formula, the agency said today in
a statement. That would lead to price increases of as much as
11.5 percent, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The setback for Nestle may force the company to seek a
buyer such as Danone SA (BN) for some assets, said Jon Cox, head of
Swiss research at Kepler Capital Markets in Zurich. Nestle and
New York-based Pfizer can also file an appeal within 30 business
days, the antitrust agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Danone is obviously very interested in those parts that
can&#8217;t be part of the deal for regulatory reasons,&#8221; Cox said in
an e-mail. &#8220;Nestle might be reluctant to sell to Danone as it
is obviously a tough competitor in the segment on a global
basis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico is Nestle&#8217;s fifth-largest market by sales, trailing
the U.S., France, Brazil and Germany, according to its 2011
annual report. Pfizer gets more than 80 percent of its nutrition
revenue from emerging markets, the company&#8217;s 2011 annual report
showed. Chinese authorities approved the infant-nutrition
transaction earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joan Campion, a Pfizer spokeswoman, referred a request for
comment to Nestle. Nestle&#8217;s press office didn&#8217;t immediately
return an e-mailed request for comment. Agnes Berthet-d&#8217;Anthonay, a spokeswoman at Paris-based Danone, also didn&#8217;t
immediately reply to an e-mail message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestle fell 0.3 percent to 59.15 Swiss francs in Zurich.
Pfizer rose 0.6 percent to $24.28 at the close in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett&#8217;s railroad debt is a
better investment for bond buyers than Canadian National Railway
Co. (CNR), JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield that Burlington Northern Santa Fe&#8217;s 10- and
30-year bonds pay over similar-maturity Canadian National debt
makes them attractive, analysts led by Mark Streeter wrote today
in a research note. BNSF is owned by Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNSF&#8217;s profit improved to $937 million in the third quarter
from $766 million a year earlier as shipping volumes increased.
The railroad benefits from strong positions shipping coal and
oil as well as a &#8220;robust&#8221; freight network, JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think the best swap at the quality end of the rail
spectrum is to sell Canadian National credit and buy BNSF,&#8221; the
analysts wrote. &#8220;BNSF credit should trade basically on top of
or slightly through and not behind peers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNSF&#8217;s $650 million of 4.375 percent bonds maturing in 2042
yielded 3.93 percent yesterday, according to Trace, the bond-
price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. That&#8217;s 43 basis points, or 0.43 percentage point,
more than the yield on Montreal-based Canadian National&#8217;s $250
million of 3.5 percent securities maturing the same year, which
traded at 99.9 cents on the dollar today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNSF was Buffett&#8217;s biggest takeover when Omaha, Nebraska-
based Berkshire acquired the railroad in a $26.5 billion deal in
2010. The company is an &#8220;all-in wager&#8221; on the U.S. economy,
the billionaire said at the time. Buffett, 82, is Berkshire&#8217;s
chairman and chief executive officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds from BNSF may be undervalued because some insurers
have limits on how much debt they can own from Berkshire
companies, the JPMorgan analysts wrote. Buffett&#8217;s implicit
backing adds &#8220;significant value&#8221; to the bonds, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canadian National, the nation&#8217;s biggest railroad, said
third-quarter net income rose less than 1 percent to C$664
million ($665 million). It said adjusted full-year profit may
climb as much as 15 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors in Treasuries cut bullish
bets this week after increasing them to the most in almost four
months the week after President Barack Obama won re-election,
according to a survey by JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proportion of net longs was at two percentage points in
the week ending yesterday, according to JPMorgan, down from 11
percentage points the week ending Nov. 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors raised neutral bets to 68 percent from 59
percent, the survey reported. It touched 70 in the week ending
Nov. 5, the highest level since August, as Obama and former
Republican challenger Mitt Romney courted voters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The percent of outright longs dropped to 17 percent, from
26 percent the previous week, the survey said. The percent of
outright shorts, or bets the securities will fall in value,
remained at 15 percent, according to the survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year note rose one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.62 percent at 7:51 a.m. in
New York. It touched a record low of 1.379 percent on July 25
and reached a 2012 high of 2.4 percent on March 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan doesn&#8217;t disclose the number of clients in the
survey. Srini Ramaswamy, a JPMorgan strategist in New York,
wasn&#8217;t available to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Royal Dutch Shell
Plc (RDSA) and their partners in Kazakhstan&#8217;s Kashagan oil field face a
delay of at least two years on a plan to boost output 20
percent, reducing the time they have to recoup costs in the $46
billion project that&#8217;s already running eight years late,
according to two people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kazakhstan has told the partners to put the $5 billion
step-up plan, taking output to as much as 450,000 from 370,000
barrels day, on hold until they study how the start of
production next year affects the deposit, the people said,
asking not to be identified because the information is private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After costing almost double early estimates, Kashagan
output may start in March. The Caspian Sea field, a high-
pressure reservoir with lethal levels of hydrogen sulfide lying
70 kilometers (44 miles) from shore, is one of the world&#8217;s
biggest finds of the past four decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North Caspian Operating Co., Kashagan&#8217;s operator, is
working on the development of the gas re-injection project,
NCOC, as the venture is known, said in an e-mailed response to
questions. Exxon, Shell, Eni SpA (ENI) and ConocoPhillips (COP) referred
questions to NCOC, while shareholders Total SA (FP) and state-owned
KazMunaiGaz National Co. didn&#8217;t reply to e-mailed requests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Force Oil &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon and Shell are seeking operational control as the
venture weighs an even more expensive second phase to take
production to 1 million barrels a day, 54 percent of
Kazakhstan&#8217;s 2011 crude output. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work on the interim project, which involves injecting
natural gas back into the field to help force out more oil, was
due to start this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Nursultan Nazarbayev urged the nation to tap
domestic gas output to &#8220;walk away from dependence&#8221; on imports
in a January speech. In September, he called for a review of
Kashagan&#8217;s further expansion plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partners plan to build a system to pump gas back into
the field, pushing oil output to as much as 450,000 barrels a
day, according to the website of Eni, the operator until
Kazakhstan tightened control over the project in 2008. In
October of last year, Oil and Gas Minister Sauat Mynbayev said
the field may reach that level of production in 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gas Demand &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kazakhstan&#8217;s demand for gas is set to double by 2030 from
12.1 billion cubic meters this year, according to the Oil and
Gas Ministry. KazMunaiGaz National and China National Petroleum
Corp. plan to complete the first part of a pipeline in the
fourth quarter of next year that may carry as much as 10 billion
cubic meters from Kazakhstan&#8217;s oil-rich west to its highly
populated southern region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the step-up program can begin, the reinjection
technology must be tested and the Kashagan partners must
determine &#8220;how much it will accept, how engineering
infrastructure will behave,&#8221; KazMunaiGaz Chief Executive
Officer Lyazzat Kiinov said on Oct. 2. &#8220;All these are big,
complex questions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell and Exxon are negotiating to gain operating control
and boost their shares of Kashagan, to ensure it will be
profitable before embarking on the second phase, people said in
August. The companies have warned they may exit the project
unless Kazakhstan extends the venture&#8217;s production-sharing
agreement, or PSA, by 20 years beyond its 2041 deadline. The
accord allows the investors to recoup costs before the
government takes its share of oil revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Discussions are ongoing with the PSA authority,&#8221; NCOC
said by e-mail. Kazakhstan&#8217;s Oil and Gas Ministry oversees the
Kashagan agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fiscal Environment &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second phase was suspended about 18 months ago because
the &#8220;fiscal environment&#8221; didn&#8217;t support the investment, Shell
Chief Financial Officer Simon Henry said Nov. 1 on a conference
call. Shell urged the partners to agree on terms for the second
phase, according to statement that day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell, Exxon, Eni, Total and KazMunaigaz each hold 16.8
percent of Kashagan, after the international partners agreed in
2008 to cut their stakes in favor of the state. Japan&#8217;s Inpex
Corp. (1605) has 7.56 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ConocoPhillips is considering a sale of its 8.4 percent
stake in Kashagan, Mynbayev, who is also KazMunaiGaz chairman,
said last month. ConocoPhillips declined to comment on a
potential sale, John McLemore, a spokesman for the company, said
by e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The budget for the first phase may almost double to $46
billion by the time oil is exported, a person with knowledge of
the matter said in January. An early cost estimate put the tab
at about $24 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) destroyed documents
about the development of its Celebrex and Bextra arthritis drugs
while denying the existence of electronic databases containing
millions of files about the medicines, lawyers for some of the
company&#8217;s investors said in court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer officials should be sanctioned for denying they had
a centralized filing system for Celebrex and Bextra files and
discarding records after investors filed suit accusing the
company of misleading them about the drugs&#8217; prospects,
shareholders&#8217; attorneys said in a court filing that was unsealed
Nov. 16 in federal court in Manhattan. Pfizer executives later
acknowledged the company maintained more than 2,000 so-called e-
Rooms that stored documents about the drugmaker&#8217;s products, the
lawyers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Defendants destroyed documents in bad faith and
compounded their initial misconduct by making false statements
about the existence of centralized databases,&#8221; Jay Eisenhofer,
a New York-based attorney serving as lead counsel in the
investors&#8217; securities-fraud suit, said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Pfizer officials agreed to pay $164 million to
settle claims by a separate group of investors that the
drugmaker distorted the results of a study about Celebrex&#8217;s
safety profile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer officials said today they are asking the judge in
New York to throw out investors&#8217; claims over statements about
the drugs and called the sanctions request over the company&#8217;s
document handling &#8220;baseless.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sanctions Sought &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer officials also are seeking sanctions against
investors who have sued over the company&#8217;s statements about
Celebrex and Bextra for their failure to &#8220;preserve electronic
documents relevant to this litigation,&#8221; Chris Loder, a company
spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pfizer has complied with its document production
obligations in this case,&#8221; Loder said. The drugmaker is looking
&#8220;forward to an adjudication of this case on the merits.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain in New York, who is
presiding over a series of investor suits filed in 2004, ruled
in March that shareholders could band together to sue Pfizer
over its statements about Celebrex and Bextra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No trial date has been set in the case against New York-
based Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker. The company opposed
shareholders&#8217; requests to have their cases granted class-action
status. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2009 Settlement &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celebrex is Pfizer&#8217;s fifth best-selling medicine, with
almost $2.5 billion in annual sales. Pfizer officials pulled
Bextra off the market in 2005 after it was linked to an
increased risk of heart attacks and a rare skin condition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, Pfizer agreed to pay $2.3 billion to settle a U.S.
investigation into illegal marketing of 10 of its drugs,
including Bextra. Pharmacia  Upjohn Co., a Pfizer unit, pleaded
guilty to a criminal charge related to misbranding drugs,
according to the U.S. Justice Department. The fine was one of
the largest in U.S. legal history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors sued the drugmaker accusing executives of making
misleading statements about &#8220;the safety and marketability of
Pfizer&#8217;s Celebrex and Bextra products&#8221; over a four-year period
starting in 2000, according to a 2004 court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Health Risks&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Defendants knew or recklessly disregarded that the
undisclosed health risks posed by these drugs would limit their
marketability and further knew that the potential financial
liability Pfizer faced from the harms these drugs caused posed a
serious threat to the company&#8217;s finances,&#8221; according to the
investors&#8217; suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eisenhofer and other lawyers for investors contend in the
unsealed court filings that Pfizer failed to properly hand over
documents in pretrial exchanges and destroyed records related to
Celebrex and Bextra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, the company argued the existence of the &#8220;e-
Rooms were a figment of plaintiffs&#8217; imagination,&#8221; the lawyer
said. Pfizer officials later acknowledged the rooms existed and
turned over documents stored there electronically, investors&#8217;
lawyers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawyers also complained that Pfizer&#8217;s technical staff
undertook &#8220;two large-scale e-Room dismantling projects while
this case was pending&#8221; and still are failing to provide &#8220;vital
piece of information,&#8221; including database memberships,
according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;60 Million Documents &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s lawyers counter in their filings that they have
turned over more than 60 million documents related to Bextra and
Celebrex and the company never misled their opponents about
electronically stored material. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At no time did Pfizer ever mislead plaintiffs concerning
the existence of databases,&#8221; the company&#8217;s lawyers said in the
filing unsealed Nov. 16. &#8220;Stating that certain categories of
documents were not maintained in a centralized location is not
the same as representing that no databases exist.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer turned over the equivalent of 220 boxes of files
from the e-Rooms once plaintiffs sought the information and
spent many hours locating &#8220;systems that had long been
integrated or retired&#8221; to produce the requested material, the
lawyers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data Pfizer is accused of failing to turn over about
the drugs&#8217; safety profiles was in the possession of federal
regulators and had been publicly disclosed, the lawyers added. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) said the Spanish court
where Repsol SA filed a lawsuit against it for entering into an
agreement with YPF SA (YPF) to develop shale gas reserves in Argentina
doesn&#8217;t have authority to rule on the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is no basis for this lawsuit and any such suit, if
brought forward, would be unproductive,&#8221; James Craig, a
spokesman for Chevron&#8217;s African and Latin American operations,
said in an e-mailed statement sent to Bloomberg. &#8220;Courts in
Spain do not have jurisdiction in this matter and Chevron stands
by the legitimacy of its memorandum of understanding with YPF.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two months after San Ramon, California-based Chevron signed
a memorandum of understanding with Buenos Aires-based YPF to
study tapping aging wells in the Vaca Muerta shale formation,
Repsol sued Chevron in Mercantile Court in Madrid for allegedly
&#8220;commercial unloyalty,&#8221; a spokesman from the Madrid-based
company said on Nov. 19. The filing of the suit couldn&#8217;t be
verified because phonecalls to the court weren&#8217;t answered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron hasn&#8217;t been served with any legal action, Craig
said. &#8220;Chevron remains hopeful that a needless judicial
proceeding can be averted,&#8221; Craig said. Alejandro Di Lazzaro, a
YPF spokesman, declined to comment on the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaca Muerta, a Connecticut-sized area located in the
western Argentine province of Neuqeun, contains the equivalent
of more than 23 billion barrels of oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YPF is seeking a partner to invest $4.5 billion as part of
a $37.2 billion five-year expansion, according to the document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repsol is also seeking $10.5 billion in compensation from
the Argentine government for the expropriation of a majority
stake of YPF, which the Spanish company says was illegal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov&#8217;s
acquisition of Renaissance Credit is extending the retail
lender&#8217;s borrowing advantage over Goldman Sachs Group Inc.-
backed Tinkoff Credit Systems as yields tumble to records before
a possible bond sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prokhorov&#8217;s Onexim Group, which purchased almost 50 percent
of Renaissance Capital for $500 million four years ago, acquired
the remainder of the investment bank on Nov. 15 and boosted its
stake in Renaissance Credit to 89 percent. The yield on
Renaissance Credit&#8217;s dollar debt due in April 2013 sank 448
basis points this week to 4.15 percent, the lowest since being
sold in March 2010. That widened their discount to Tinkoff&#8217;s
2014 dollar debt to 498 basis points, the most on record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Renaissance Credit is growing fast and needs funds so it
would be timely to sell bonds,&#8221; Roman Luchkovsky, an analyst at
VTB Capital, said by phone Nov. 15. &#8220;The fourth quarter is
usually strong for consumer lenders ahead of the New Year
holidays when people buy presents and go traveling so they will
want to get funding.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Prokhorov has said politics is more important to him
than business, his takeover of the bank is helping lower
borrowing costs as Renaissance Credit seeks funds to finance
double-digit growth. The bank is weighing its first Eurobond in
two years in the first quarter next year, according to a person
familiar with the matter who declined to be identified because
the plans aren&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Debt Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elena Leshchinskaya, a spokeswoman for RenCredit, didn&#8217;t
answer calls after business hours. Andrey Belyak, a spokesman
for Prokhorov&#8217;s Onexim Group, declined to comment. Oleg
Anisimov, a Tinkoff spokesman based in Moscow, didn&#8217;t answer
calls to his office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specialist consumer lenders Renaissance Credit, Home Credit
 Finance and Tinkoff had loan growth of 50 to 100 percent in
2011, and are enjoying a similar pace of expansion this year,
according to a RenCap report. Tinkoff, part-owned by Goldman
Sachs, said in September that it plans 14 billion rubles of
domestic debt, while Home Credit  Finance sold Eurobonds this
quarter along with billionaire Roustam Tariko&#8217;s ZAO Russian
Standard Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Loan Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renaissance Credit&#8217;s loan portfolio grew by 45 percent this
year and the lender will probably boost earnings to $110 million
from $80 million in 2011, Alexei Levchenko, chief executive
officer of Renaissance Credit, said on Nov. 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prokhorov&#8217;s Onexim is likely to try to sell bonds on behalf
of both Renaissance Capital and Credit the company may need to
prove itself to investors, according Dmitry Poliakov, a senior
analyst at Sberbank Investment Research, who cited a
restructuring at RBC when Prokhorov acquired the media company
in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Onexim has been unpredictable,&#8221; Poliakov said by phone
on Nov. 19. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think investors can rely just on the whims
of one particular individual.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onexim&#8217;s 50 percent ownership &#8220;did not have any impact on
operations or credit quality,&#8221; at Renaissance for three years,
according to Maxim Tishin, who helps manage $1 billion of assets
at UFG Asset Management in Moscow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would like them to come forward and explain what their
plan is now that they have control,&#8221; Tishin said in e-mailed
comments. &#8220;If they need liquidity, Onexim can provide bridge
loan. It will be cheaper for them if Onexim comes up with a
credible strategy first, and then go to market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ruble Gains &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruble rose 0.4 percent to 31.1920 per dollar by 6:35
p.m. in Moscow. Non-deliverable forwards, which provide a guide
to expectations of currency movements, showed the ruble at
31.6621 per dollar in three months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gain in Russia&#8217;s dollar bonds due in April 2020 cut the
yield three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 2.583
percent, the third day of declines. The yield on the
government&#8217;s domestic ruble bonds due in June 2017 dropped 12
basis points to a record 6.84 percent. The yield on Russia&#8217;s
international ruble bond due in March 2018 slid three basis
points today to 6.20 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia is rated BBB by Fitch, the second-lowest investment-
grade ranking. The extra yield investors demand to hold Russian
government dollar bonds rather than U.S. Treasuries fell two
basis points to 193, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. indexes.
The difference compares with 168 basis points for debt of
similarly rated Mexico and 150 basis points for Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cost Protection &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of protecting Russian debt against non-payment for
five years using credit-default swaps fell one basis point to
148, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The default swaps
cost four basis points more than Turkey, which is rated one
level lower at BBB- by Fitch. The contracts pay the buyer face
value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a government or company fail to adhere to its
debt agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renaissance will now be more part of &#8220;the system,&#8221;
reducing risk and increasing revenue opportunities, former Chief
Executive Officer Stephen Jennings said in an e-mail to staff on
the day Prokhorov&#8217;s takeover was announced. Onexim is
&#8220;dedicated&#8221; to developing RenCap, it said in a statement on
its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ownership change is &#8220;moderately positive&#8221; because it
reduces risks resulting from the broader Renaissance Group&#8217;s
investments and leverage, James Watson, a managing director at
Fitch Ratings, said by phone Nov. 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It provides the &#8220;two entities with a single and relatively
strong controlling shareholder,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) has five days to
respond to a lawsuit from Repsol SA (REP) for entering into an
agreement with YPF SA (YPF) to develop reserves in Argentina,
documents from the Spanish court where the case is filed show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mercantile court in Madrid gave the U.S. company 20
working days from Oct. 26 to answer the suit or risk being
excluded from the process, court documents obtained by Bloomberg
News show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court agreed to consider the case in the same decision,
saying it has the jurisdiction to do so. A court official, who
declined to be named in line with policy, confirmed the details
of the document, which isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repsol is suing Chevron after it signed a memorandum of
understanding with Buenos Aires-based YPF to study tapping wells
in Vaca Muerta shale formation. The deal was made after
Argentina expropriated Repsol&#8217;s majority stake in YPF, a
decision the Spanish company says is illegal and for which it is
seeking $10.5 billion in compensation from the Argentine
government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, hasn&#8217;t been served
with any legal action, and any case would be &#8220;unproductive&#8221; as
Spanish courts don&#8217;t have the authority to rule on the issue,
James Craig, a spokesman for Chevron&#8217;s African and Latin
American operations, said yesterday. He didn&#8217;t reply to calls
and e-mails seeking comment today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristian Rix, a spokesman for Repsol, confirmed on Nov. 19
that the court had agreed to consider the suit against Chevron. &lt;/p&gt;

people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank is keen to make an exit from the investment and
EcoSecurities executives are open to discussions with potential

&lt;p&gt;Patrick Burton, vice-president of media relations at
JPMorgan in London, declined to comment on the report when

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan acquired EcoSecurities in 2009 for 124 million

&lt;p&gt;EPlus Inc. (PLUS) can pursue a modified
order limiting certain sales of Lawson Software Inc. products
after a U.S. appeals court upheld part of a patent-infringement
ruling over software for supply chain management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawson infringed one of five patent claims asserted by
EPlus, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled
Nov. 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court said two claims were invalid, while the other two
weren&#8217;t infringed. It remanded the case to the trial judge for a
modification of an order to halt further infringement. The court
also upheld the judge&#8217;s decision to preclude EPlus from seeking
damages in the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is EPlus v. Lawshot Software, 11-01396, U.S. Court

&lt;h2&gt;Microsoft Seeks to Patent System to Base Fees on Viewer Numbers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the largest software company in the world,
is seeking a patent on a technology that would enable content-
owners to monitor the number of users consuming content or
playing a game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to application 20120278904, the content owner
would then be able to restrict access if the viewers or players
exceeded the licensed number. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said in the application
that content owners can already place some restrictions on
downloaded content, such as limiting the amount of time it is
available for use, or the number of times it can be viewed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology covered by the patent would expand this, by
enabling content owners to restrict content on a per-user view
basis. This would involve the use of a camera of other capture
device to be used as a consumer detector, Microsoft said in its
application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft filed its patent application in April 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU&#8217;s General Court upheld a decision by the EU&#8217;s

&lt;p&gt;Mexico has joined the Madrid Protocol for the International
Registration of Marks, the World Intellectual Property
Organization said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Madrid Protocol, established in 1989, offers a
trademark owner the possibility to have a trademark protected in
several countries by simply filing one application directly with
the owner&#8217;s national or regional trademark office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An international mark registered under the protocol, is
equivalent to an application or registration in each of the
protocol&#8217;s member countries the applicant designates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to WIPO Director General Francis Gurry, Mexico is
the third Latin American country to join this system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other countries that joined the Madrid system this year are

&lt;h2&gt;Chapel Club Says It&#8217;s OK to Make Money by Remixing Its Song &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapel Club, a U.K. pop band, has invited fans to make a
copy of one of its songs, remix it and sell it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a blog posting, Stephen Taverner, the band&#8217;s manager,
said that after Chapel Club parted ways with Universal Music
Group Inc. the band &#8220;wanted to do something non-traditional in
what is still a very traditional industry.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what Taverner terms &#8220;The Remix Project,&#8221; fans can
download what he called the &#8220;stems&#8221; of Chapel Club&#8217;s &#8220;Good

&#8220;gets to keep all of the master income from sales,
synchronization and any third-party licensing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only restriction the band is placing is that the band
retains approval rights over where the remix is synchronized,
Taverner said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Marylander Pleads Guilty in $4 Million Infringement Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Maryland resident pleaded guilty to criminal copyright
infringement involving commercial software programs, the U.S.
Justice Department said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naveed Sheikh, 32, pleaded guilty to three counts of
infringement and conspiracy committed by reproducing more than
1,000 commercial software programs worth $4 million. These were
sold through multiple websites, the government said, with Sheikh
warning customers the programs weren&#8217;t legal and couldn&#8217;t be
registered with the companies that developed the software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the government statement, Sheikh rented
computer server space in Pennsylvania and hosted websites
through which he sold the software on computers in Pennsylvania
and Maryland. He used a credit-card processing system from a
defunct business previously owned by his family, and used
services such as Western Union to transmit money outside the
U.S., particularly to Pakistan, the government said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Court documents indicate that Sheikh attempted to conceal
his activities by using the names &#8220;Turkish Lamps,&#8221; &#8220;Ruby
Corp.&#8221; and &#8220;Laundryland.&#8221; The latter was at one time a
storefront laundromat in Baltimore operated by Sheik&#8217;s family
members. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the products he infringed were software programs by
Microsoft Corp., Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE) and Apple Inc. (AAPL), the
government said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the investigation stage of the case, Sheikh claimed
that the infringement was done by another person, and, according
to court documents, he created fake recorded conversations with
this person. He also left the U.S. for Pakistan without giving
the government notice, and when he returned, he was found to be
carrying a computer containing evidence of his illegal actions,
the government said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He faces a sentence of as many as five years in prison and
$250,000 fine for each of three counts. As part of the plea
agreement, he must forfeit $4 million. Sentencing is set for
Feb. 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Sheikh, 1:10-cr-00713-RDB, U.S.

&lt;h2&gt;Baker  McKenzie to Conduct Trade Secrets Survey for EU &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Commission has contracted with the international
firm of Baker  McKenzie LLP to conduct a study on the economic
and legal aspects linked with the use, misappropriation and
litigation on confidential business information and trade
secrets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a statement from the commission, the firm will
survey companies about how they manage their know-how and other
information of strategic value for their competitiveness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey will look at companies of all sizes throughout
the European Union. The commission hopes to find whether there
is a need to provide companies with better means of redress
against the economic harm from misappropriation of proprietary
information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any company wishing to participate in the survey can
contact the firm through a special e-mail address:

user ID, a password and a link to the webpage for the survey,
and can chose among a number of languages in which to respond to
the survey queries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s ABC television
network is trying to shut down Dish Network Corp. (DISH)&#8217;s ad-skipping
TV recording feature two weeks after a federal judge denied a
similar bid by a different broadcaster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABC said it will seek a preliminary injunction from U.S.
District Judge Laura Taylor Swain, according to a filing late
yesterday in Manhattan federal court. On Nov. 7, U.S. District
Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles rejected a motion for an
injunction by News Corp. (NWSA)&#8217;s Fox Broadcasting. Fox appealed the
ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute over Dish&#8217;s ad-skipping technology, which
broadcasters warn threatens their very survival, is being played
out in federal courts on both coasts. Dish sued ABC, CBS Corp. (CBS)
and Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)&#8217;s NBC in New York in May seeking a judgment
that its AutoHop feature, which allows viewers to skip ads,
doesn&#8217;t violate network copyrights or contracts. Fox, CBS and
NBC sued Dish in Los Angeles for copyright infringement and
breach of contract on the same day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dish, based in Englewood, Colorado, introduced its new
digital video recorder, the Hopper, in March. Its PrimeTime
Anytime feature can record all the major networks&#8217; primetime
shows and store them for eight days after their initial
broadcast. AutoHop, introduced in May, allows viewers, with the
touch of a button, to skip all the ads automatically, without
having to manually fast-forward through them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) said initial
share sales may account for less than half its China investment
banking revenue in 2012 as more companies opt to raise funds
from the bond market to take advantage of lower interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial share sales had been more than half of investment
banking revenue in &#8220;recent years,&#8221; Fang Fang, chief executive
officer of China investment banking for JPMorgan, told reporters
in Beijing yesterday. &#8220;This is the year that we did not have
many elephant IPOs.&#8221;  By contrast, greater numbers of companies
are selling debt, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese companies have sold fewer shares and more bonds as
policy makers cut rates to bolster economic growth. Yields on
dollar-denominated debt sold by Chinese companies fell to a
record low of 5 percent on Nov. 7, according to JPMorgan Chase
indexes. Chinese companies have raised $15.2 billion from
overseas equity sales so far this year, 38 percent less than a
year ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan helped Haitong Securities Co. (600837), a Chinese brokerage
already listed in Shanghai, raise HK$13 billion in a Hong Kong
stock sale in April, near the bottom of a range marketed to
investors. The New York-based bank this month also helped Baidu
Inc. (BIDU), operator of China&#8217;s most popular search engine, sell $1.5
billion of bonds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais
SA is beating major steelmaker stocks on speculation cost cuts
will make it profitable after four quarters of losses. The rally
will continue, say Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG
analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usiminas, as the Belo Horizonte, Brazil-based company is
known, returned 40 percent in the past three months including
dividends, the most of any steel company with a market value of
$5 billion or more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Marcelo Aguiar, the most accurate
forecaster for Usiminas in a Bloomberg Absolute Return ranking,
this month joined a minority of analysts with a buy
recommendation on the stock. Aguiar and Deutsche Bank AG&#8217;s
Rodrigo Barros, the second-most accurate, expect cost-cutting
efforts since Italian billionaire Paolo Rocca&#8217;s family joined
the controlling group will result in a profit in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a revolution going on&#8221; at Usiminas, said Paolo Di Sora, a Sao Paulo-based fund manager at M. Safra  Co., which
increased its stake in Usiminas almost sevenfold in the third
quarter to 1.38 percent through its Everest Participacoes Ltda.
unit. &#8220;It&#8217;s difficult to find another story like this in the
stock exchange today.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surging returns for Usiminas, Brazil&#8217;s largest steelmaker
after Gerdau SA (GGBR4), compare with a 5 percent loss in the past three
months for Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal, the world&#8217;s No. 1
producer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 24 analysts covering Usiminas, five rate it a buy, six
have a neutral recommendation and nine say sell, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The remainder have it under review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Best Performer &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best performer of 57 stocks in the MSCI Emerging
Markets Metals  Mining Index (MXEF0MM) since June 30, Usiminas fell 0.4
percent to 11.75 reais in Sao Paulo today, reducing a year-to-
date gain to 16 percent. Porto Alegre, Brazil-based Gerdau rose
27 percent this year and Sao Paulo-based Cia. Siderurgica
Nacional SA, the country&#8217;s third-biggest steelmaker, dropped 32
percent. ArcelorMittal fell 18 percent in Amsterdam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usiminas is trading at 38 times earnings estimates for the
next four quarters, more than triple the 11 ratio for the
benchmark Bovespa index, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ternium SA and Tenaris SA, both controlled by the Rocca
family&#8217;s Techint Group, last year agreed to pay about 5 billion
reais ($2.4 billion) for a 27.7 percent voting stake in
Usiminas, joining Tokyo-based Nippon Steel  Sumitomo Metal
Corp. (5401) in the controlling group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217; Aguiar estimates that Usiminas will post net
income of 592 million reais in 2013, the best in three years,
according to a Nov. 12 report. This year&#8217;s net loss will
probably amount to 440.5 million reais, he said, which would be
the biggest in at least two decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Improvements &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usiminas has boosted productivity, cut inventories and
signed accords to reduce costs and improve operations, Chief
Executive Officer Julian Eguren, who took office in January
after running the Rocca family&#8217;s Ternium unit in Mexico, said on
a Nov. 1 conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The measures to improve efficiency, cut costs and improve
volumes will be a strong catalyst for Usiminas,&#8221; Deutsche
Bank&#8217;s Barros said in an e-mailed response to questions.
&#8220;Usiminas&#8217;s stock price already reflects the expected
improvements for the next 12 months, but not that such
improvements are a continuous process that may last for several
years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials at Usiminas&#8217;s press office in Belo Horizonte
declined to comment further or make executives available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stimulus &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Dilma Rousseff&#8217;s measures to stoke growth in the
largest emerging economy after China helped Usiminas raise
prices as much as 7 percent in July. Rousseff boosted tariffs to
curb steel imports and cut taxes on carmakers, Usiminas&#8217;s main
buyers, after slashing Brazil&#8217;s benchmark interest rate by 5.25
percentage points since last August to 7.25 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projects for the 2014 soccer World Cup and 2016 Olympic
Games will help domestic demand rise as much as 6 percent next
year, compared with growth of about 1 percent to 2 percent this
year, Benjamin Baptista, ArcelorMittal&#8217;s Brazil head, said in an
Oct. 30 interview in Santiago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A potential recovery is already incorporated in Usiminas&#8217;s
valuation and profit forecasts could be trimmed next year, HSBC
Holdings Plc equity analyst Jonathan Brandt said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Most of the good news, if not all, is in the price,&#8221; he
said in a Nov. 13 telephone interview from New York. &#8220;All of a
sudden something happens and demand doesn&#8217;t materialize.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217; Aguiar estimates that earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization will triple in
2013 to 2.31 billion reais. The average of 15 analysts&#8217;
estimates compiled by Bloomberg is for 2013 adjusted net income
of 467.6 million reais on Ebitda of 1.96 billion reais. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Industrial efficiency continues being our main focus,&#8221;
Usiminas&#8217;s Eguren said. &#8220;The measures taken by the government
will help improve the situation in the short-term, but the most
effective changes will be those we do internally.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

which has about 100 offices in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private-equity firms are buying insurance-services
companies for their steady cash flow and low capital needs. KKR

&lt;p&gt;Europe&#8217;s answer to the U.S. shale boom may lie beneath the Sahara desert. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While environmental regulation and disappointing drilling tests have held back the development of shale gas reserves in Europe, Algeria is using tax breaks to encourage exploration. Pipelines under the Mediterranean to Spain and Italy already link Africa&#8217;s largest gas exporter into Europe&#8217;s grid. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The North African nation is holding talks with Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) over shale, Ali Hached, an adviser to Energy and Mines Minister Youcef Yousfi, said in an interview. Eni SpA (ENI), Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) and Talisman Energy Inc. (TLM) have already signed shale exploration accords with Algeria, which expects tax breaks for gas exploitation and drilling shale to get parliamentary approval within weeks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Algeria holds 231 trillion cubic feet of recoverable shale gas, the International Energy Agency estimated, enough to supply the entire European Union for a decade and valued at about $2.6 trillion at current month-ahead U.K. prices. Higher North African production, if possible, offers Europe an alternative to Russian gas from OAO Gazprom, which links gas prices to oil and charges its customers about three times the U.S. price. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Algeria&#8217;s oil and gas potential &#8220;remains largely underexploited,&#8221; said Sohbet Karbuz, hydrocarbons director at Observatoire Mediterranee de l&#8217;Energie, or OME, a Paris-based association of Mediterranean region energy companies. &#8220;Improving investor confidence and the investment environment is the key.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Export Earnings &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika wants to import technology for hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, to tap the potential of shale, allowing his country to maximize export earnings while satisfying growing energy demand at home. African nations with greater reserves are Libya, whose war has slowed development, and South Africa, where fracking has only conditional approval. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Europe&#8217;s attempts to develop its own shale reserves have faltered. France&#8217;s parliament banned fracking because of concerns the process pollutes drinking water. The U.K. halted exploration, while scientists investigated links between drilling and earth tremors. In Poland, where the government wants shale developed to gain energy independence from Russia, initial well results have disappointed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the empty wilderness of Algeria&#8217;s desert drilling has fewer risks. Rome-based Eni has already started exploratory fracking, in which sedimentary rock is blasted with a blend of water, sand and chemicals. Talisman and Shell plan to drill exploratory wells soon, Hached said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Double Production &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shale gas could almost double Algeria&#8217;s marketed gas production during the next two decades to 160 billion cubic meters a year, and the country could export 110 billion cubic meters by 2030, Karbuz estimated. As well as pipelines, Algeria uses export terminals to liquefy gas for shipment by tanker. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Using fracking to tease gas out of shale rock has made the U.S. the world&#8217;s largest natural gas producer and cut prices more than 70 percent from their 2009 peak. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Algeria is back on big oil companies&#8217; radar because it has offered &#8220;very attractive fiscal terms&#8221; to partners interested in shale exploration, according to Mark Liebster, general manager of Shell Upstream North Africa. He declined to specify the terms of the tax arrangement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eni and Exxon officials declined to comment on their plans for Algerian shale. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those two companies have performed best in the last 12 months in stock markets among four that have shown interest in Algeria. Exxon and Eni have both risen 17 percent in the period, compared with a 3.1 percent increase by Shell in Amsterdam and a 10 percent decline by Talisman in Canada. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Right Direction&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The amended law modifies certain taxes and fees to attract foreign investors, Energy and Mines Minister Youcef Yousfi said on Sept. 24. Royalty fees will be adjusted for levels of production, and the tax on oil revenue will depend on the level of difficulty and risks of exploration, Algerie Presse Service reported, citing Yousfi. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The law &#8220;is moving in the right direction,&#8221; said Jean- Marie Dauger, executive vice president at GDF Suez (GSZ) SA. &#8220;It could encourage us to look outside our current perimeter at things that are a little more complicated to develop.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tax incentives to speed exploration and production of unconventional gas, which date to the late 20th century in the U.S., were announced by China this year. The country will subsidize production by offering 0.4 yuan (64 cents) a cubic meter for the fuel that&#8217;s developed and consumed from 2012 to 2015, China&#8217;s Ministry of Finance said in a Nov. 5 statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;North African nations need to boost domestic production of natural gas as demand for the fuel in the region may more than double by 2030 to 210 billion cubic meters a year, OME has said. That will constrain the growth of exports, Karbuz said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Geological Potential &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is geological potential in Algeria for a lot of shale gas,&#8221; said Olivier Cleret de Langavant, senior vice president strategy and business development at Total SA. (FP) &#8220;It has a lot of source rock but it still has to be proven that it can flow and be produced profitably.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Algeria needs to drill more than 400 test wells over the next several years to determine whether shale gas will be economically viable, said Djaouid Djelloul Bencherif, the director of deposits at Sonatrach Group. The state-owned energy company, which is party to the accords, has said it plans to invest $80 billion over five years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The country is &#8220;very eager to learn new technology solutions&#8221; from its international partners, he said in an interview in Vienna. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;First Flows &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, given the early stages of the process and many remaining financial and legal obstacles, Algeria couldn&#8217;t hope to produce unconventional gas commercially before 2020, according to the country&#8217;s Energy Ministry. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The country has been more stable than many of its neighbors as regimes were rocked by violent uprisings in what has been called the Arab Spring. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The advantage of Algeria is that it&#8217;s very stable, which is what investors like,&#8221; said Brian O&#8217;Cathain, chief executive officer of Petroceltic International Plc (PCI), which recently merged with Melrose Resources Plc to expand in North Africa and the Mediterranean. &#8220;Everybody wants to know what happens when Bouteflika steps down in 2014, but I don&#8217;t think much will happen.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Elisa Martinuzzi and Charles Penty" date="Nov 26, 2012  5:34 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-26/goldman-sachs-turns-down-southern-europe-banks-as-crisis-lingers.html"><headline>Goldman Turns Down Southern Europe Banks as Crisis Lingers</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the No. 1 stock underwriter in Europe, turned down roles in offerings by banks in Spain and Italy this year, the only top U.S. securities firm not to take part in the fundraisings by southern European lenders as the region&#8217;s debt crisis stretches to a fourth year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The firm declined a role in Banco Popular Espanol SA (POP)&#8217;s 2.5 billion-euro ($3.2 billion) rights offering this month because it wanted greater protection to avoid potential losses on the sale, two people familiar with the talks said. JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Morgan Stanley are helping to guarantee the deal. Goldman also didn&#8217;t underwrite this year&#8217;s share sales by Italy&#8217;s UniCredit SpA and Portugal&#8217;s Banco Espirito Santo SA (BES), which drew Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which got 55 percent of its revenue this year from sales and trading, is passing on underwriting fees that could be at risk should the stock drop, as happened with insurer Fondiaria-SAI SpA (FSA) this year. Goldman Sachs President and Chief Operating Officer Gary D. Cohn said a month ago that he sees only a &#8220;small&#8221; probability that the euro area will stick together, while the firm&#8217;s equity strategists are warning investors to be wary of companies that rely on southern Europe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, has sold 40 million licenses for Windows 8, an
updated version of its flagship operating system that can work
with touch-screen technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newest Windows software has outpaced the previous
version in terms of upgrades, Microsoft said today on a blog
post and a speech by Windows Chief Financial Officer Tami Reller. The executive, who oversees the marketing and financial
part of the Windows unit, didn&#8217;t comment on sales of the Surface
tablet, Microsoft&#8217;s first-ever computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft hasn&#8217;t disclosed Windows 8 sales since Oct. 30,
when Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said the company had
sold 4 million upgrades in the first four days. License sales
include upgrades, copies shipped on new computers and those
given to corporations with multiyear licenses. While it&#8217;s
difficult to gauge demand with the number by itself, the pace of
growth should please shareholders, said Bob O&#8217;Donnell, an
analyst at market research firm IDC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It sounds pretty high, especially since Ballmer initially
said 4 million for first few days,&#8221; O&#8217;Donnell said. &#8220;Four
million to 40 million sounds pretty good.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is overhauling its product line to remain
relevant in the post-PC era. The Redmond, Washington-based
company dominated the technology landscape during the heyday of
the personal computer in the 1990s and much of the last decade,
yet has been eclipsed in influence by a resurgent Apple Inc. (AAPL) and
the rise of mobile devices taking the place of PCs that run
Microsoft&#8217;s flagship Windows operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows 8 represents Microsoft&#8217;s biggest change to its
flagship product in nearly two decades -- designed around a
revamped home screen featuring colorful tiles that launch
programs and update users with current information from the
Internet. On Oct. 26, the same day Windows 8 went on sale,
Microsoft started selling Surface, a tablet computer designed
and built by the company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world&#8217;s largest
entertainment company, raised $3 billion in its first bond
offering in more than nine months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owner of the ABC and ESPN networks sold $500 million of
0.45 percent, three-year securities to yield 35 basis points
more than similar-maturity Treasuries, $1 billion of 1.1
percent, five-year notes at a relative yield of 60 basis points,
$1 billion of 2.35 percent, 10-year securities with a spread of
80 and $500 million of 3.7 percent, 30-year debt at 95,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company last sold bonds in February, issuing $1 billion
of 1.125 percent, five-year debentures and $400 million of 2.55
percent, 10-year notes, Bloomberg data show. The securities due
in February 2022 traded at 102.1 cents on the dollar to yield
2.3 percent yesterday, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new bonds are rated A by Standard  Poor&#8217;s and proceeds
will be used for general corporate purposes, which could include
debt repayment or to finance the company&#8217;s purchase of Lucasfilm

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)&#8217;s &#8220;Doc McStuffins&#8221; has emerged as the top-rated cable TV show for preschoolers, taking viewers from Viacom Inc. (VIA)&#8217;s children&#8217;s networks and its long-running hit &#8220;Dora the Explorer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Doc McStuffins,&#8221; introduced in March, is averaging 774,000 viewers ages 2 to 5 at 10 a.m. weekdays on the Disney Channel, according to Nielsen data. The program drew 1.7 million viewers of all ages, including those who recorded and watched within a week. &#8220;Dora&#8221; averaged 667,000 on Viacom&#8217;s Nickelodeon in that age group and 1.4 million in total. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s largest entertainment company, introduced &#8220;Doc McStuffins&#8221; this year along with Disney Junior, a new cable network aimed at 2-to-7-year-olds. The company is taking on Viacom&#8217;s flagship Nickelodeon kids&#8217; channel and its Nick Jr., which is aimed at preschoolers. Viacom, based in New York, has long been the leader in that demographic with shows such as &#8220;Dora&#8221; and &#8220;Blues Clues.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Disney has executed well and is gaining share overall against Viacom in the preschool and up to 10-year-old kids market,&#8221; said Martin Pyykkonen, an analyst at Wedge Partners in Greenwood Village, Colorado, who follows both companies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s gains translated into toy sales at the outset of the holiday shopping season. &#8220;Doc McStuffins&#8221; items were in short supply last weekend, according to Gerrick Johnson, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets in New York. Johnson said his team visited Toys &#8220;R&#8221; Us Inc. (TOYS), Target Corp. (TGT) and other stores in New York and North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;You won&#8217;t find Doc McStuffins in any store you check,&#8221; Johnson said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Toy Doctor &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cartoon character, a 6-year-old who cares for sick toys, runs on both Disney Channel and Disney Junior. Ratings for Disney Junior aren&#8217;t yet available, according to the Burbank, California-based company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ratings for &#8220;Dora&#8221; and Nickelodeon&#8217;s other shows for younger viewers are improving, said Dan Martinsen, a spokesman for Viacom&#8217;s Nickelodeon networks. The network&#8217;s preschool programming has registered higher ratings than Disney this quarter, as it did in the first half, he said. The company offered fewer preschool shows over the summer when older kids were out of school, according to Martinsen. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This quarter, &#8220;Doc McStuffins&#8221; is averaging 669,000 2- to-5 year-old viewers on the Disney Channel, according to Nielsen. &#8220;Dora&#8221; averaged 659,000 in the same time period on Nickelodeon. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Children&#8217;s TV is lucrative for entertainment companies because it helps sell toys and other merchandise they license, and generates cable subscriber fees. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Merchandise Profit &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Disney Channel accounts for about 25 percent of the parent company&#8217;s income from cable networks, its largest business, Pyykkonen said. In the fiscal year ended Sept. 29, Disney&#8217;s cable networks reported operating income of $5.7 billion, a 9 percent increase from a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sales at Disney&#8217;s consumer products division rose 6.7 percent to $3.25 billion for the fiscal year. Ancillary revenue from Viacom&#8217;s cable networks fell 13 percent to $549 million over the same period. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;If it&#8217;s a battle of consumer products, Disney wins,&#8221; said Todd Juenger, an analyst who follows both companies at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in New York. &#8220;They have an almost insurmountable, supply, distribution, shelf-space advantage.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hot-selling &#8220;Doc McStuffins&#8221; products include the $34.99 &#8220;Time for Your Check Up&#8221; doll and the $14.99 Doctor&#8217;s Bag Play Set, according Nidia Tatalovich, a spokeswoman for the company. New merchandise planned for next year includes bedding, apparel and party supplies, she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Dora&#8221; has produced more than $11 billion in revenue at retail since her 2000 debut, Martinsen said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney fell 0.9 percent to $48.60 at the close in New York. The shares have gained 30 percent this year. Viacom rose 0.5 percent to $50.38 and has gained 11 percent in 2012. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Duane D.

&lt;p&gt; Monster Beverage Corp. (MNST), the largest
U.S. energy drink maker by sales volume, rose the most in more
than a month after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said a Food and Drug
Administration response to questions over the safety of energy
drinks was &#8220;encouraging.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares surged 13 percent to $51.97 at the close in New
York, for the biggest gain since Oct. 24. The stock was little
changed this year through yesterday, after U.S. regulators
confirmed reports last month that the Corona, California-based
company&#8217;s caffeinated energy drinks were cited in the deaths of
five people in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA is employing the help of outside advisers to
determine whether the beverages may cause harm when consumed in
excess or by those with pre-existing cardiac conditions, it
wrote in a letter released today. Any regulatory outcome is
likely to be &#8220;benign,&#8221; Judy Hong, an analyst with Goldman
Sachs, said today in a note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our overall impression of the FDA letter would be that,
at this point, the FDA has little reason to think energy drinks
are unsafe when used in a responsible manner,&#8221; Hong wrote in
response to the FDA letter to Democratic Senator Dick Durbin, of
Illinois. &#8220;To the extent energy drinks are used
&#8216;inappropriately&#8217; the FDA has no jurisdiction to take action
against the manufacturer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tentative approval of Visa Inc. (V)
and MasterCard Inc. (MA)&#8217;s proposed $7.25 billion settlement of a
merchant fee price-fixing case will be challenged in a federal
appeals court, according to a notice filed by objecting
plaintiffs in Brooklyn, New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four retailers and six trade groups today filed the notice
that they are appealing a component of U.S. District Judge John Gleeson&#8217;s approval order barring merchants from suing the
payment firms over the fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 1,200 retailers and trade organizations opposed the
accord, which would end seven years of litigation over
interchange, or swipe, fees that retailers are charged when
customers pay with credit cards. Lawyers for the objectors
argued at a Nov. 10 hearing that the agreement is unfair because
it strips merchants of the right to sue over the fees in the
future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This settlement has fatal legal defects and should not
get preliminary approval,&#8221; Jeffrey Shinder, a lawyer for
objectors, said today in a statement. &#8220;We look forward to
presenting the problems we see in this proposal to the Second
Circuit Court of Appeals.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covering more than 7 million merchants, the accord would be
the largest-ever antitrust settlement, according to lawyers for
plaintiffs. Gleeson granted preliminary approval Nov. 10, saying
some issues still &#8220;require significant scrutiny.&#8221; The
settlement is subject to final approval later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Concern &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This obscure appeal is just a badly underthrown legal
Hail Mary that shouldn&#8217;t give anyone any concern,&#8221; Trish Wexler, a spokeswoman for the Electronic Payments Coalition, a
credit-and-debit-card industry trade group advising defendants
in the case, said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The retailer objectors are focusing on an extremely
limited and technical issue,&#8221; she said. The move &#8220;does nothing
to slow or change the settlement process,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant
Discount Antitrust Litigation, 05-md-01720, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein is among the business leaders invited to the White House tomorrow as President Barack Obama seeks their support for his approach to addressing the fiscal cliff, according to two people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obama&#8217;s meeting with the executives, his second such session this month, is part of an administration campaign to pressure Congress to extend tax cuts for middle-income Americans while letting them rise for top earners, according to the people, who requested anonymity because the list of those at the meeting hasn&#8217;t been officially released. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio and other House Republican leaders are also scheduled to meet with Blankfein tomorrow and other CEOs pressing for an agreement to avoid the $607 billion in automatic tax increases and spending cuts scheduled to take effect in January, according to a House aide. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the Christmas holiday approaching, the Obama administration is mounting a campaign-style push for public support as the newly re-elected president faces off against congressional Republicans over proposals to avert the so-called fiscal cliff. He met with owners of small businesses today and is planning to visit a toy factory in Pennsylvania this week to help build public support for his plan. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tax Rates &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obama is urging Congress to act immediately on his plan to keep existing tax rates for middle-income Americans while letting those for the top earners rise, even as talks continue on spending cuts and changes to entitlement programs such as Medicare. Many Republicans say they are willing to consider higher revenue as along as it&#8217;s accompanied by cuts in entitlement programs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The president is arguing that, without a deal, consumer confidence may suffer, hurting holiday shopping and the economic recovery. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is something that everyone in Washington agrees must be done and it is something that the House of Representatives could do today or tomorrow if they so chose, because the Senate has already passed a bill that extends those tax cuts&#8221; White House press secretary Jay Carney said today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Negotiations have made such little headway that Obama is delaying inviting congressional leaders back to the White House this week as he had originally planned, according to a Democratic congressional aide. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Negotiations &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, told reporters today he&#8217;s &#8220;disappointed&#8221; by the lack of progress in the talks since he and other congressional leaders met with Obama at the White House on Nov. 16. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s been little progress with Republicans,&#8221; Reid said. Lawmakers need to &#8220;get away from the happy talk&#8221; and start discussing specifics, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, Reid said he was &#8220;extremely hopeful&#8221; and didn&#8217;t think Republicans will hold out and allow the tax increases and spending cuts to be triggered. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks extended losses as Reid spoke. The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index (SPX) slipped 0.3 percent to 1,402.03 as of 3:17 p.m. in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5 percent to 12,908.08. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among the executives who will be meeting with members of Congress tomorrow are Thomas Wilson, the president and CEO of Allstate Corp. (ALL), Doug Oberhelman, the CEO of Caterpillar Inc., David Cote, the chairman and CEO of Honeywell International (HON) Inc. and Mark Bertolini, the chairman and CEO of Aetna Inc. (AET), according to the congressional aide. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Obama Meetings &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before tomorrow&#8217;s meeting with Blankfein and the other executives, Obama will have an event with middle-income Americans who would be affected if the tax rates rise. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blankfein was at the White House in July to meet with Jack Lew, Obama&#8217;s chief of staff. He also is on the CEO fiscal leadership council of the Campaign to Fix the Debt, which was founded by the co-chairman of Obama&#8217;s fiscal commission. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The group is backing the framework laid out by 2010 fiscal commission leaders Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson for reducing the nation&#8217;s deficit, which has exceeded $1 trillion throughout Obama&#8217;s first term. Bowles, a Democrat and former White House chief of staff for President Bill Clinton, and Simpson, a Republican and former senator from Wyoming, proposed tax increases and spending cuts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;CEO Council &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CEO councils&#8217; principles call for Congress to overhaul Medicare and Medicaid, &#8220;strengthen&#8221; Social Security and enact &#8220;comprehensive and pro-growth tax reform&#8221; that lowers rates, broadens the tax base, raises revenue and cuts the deficit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blankfein has urged policymakers to reach a compromise to avoid the fiscal cliff, including cutbacks to programs like Social Security and more revenue from the wealthiest Americans. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;Social Security wasn&#8217;t devised to be a system that supported you for a 30-year retirement after a 25-year career,&#8221; he said in an interview with CBS news on Nov. 19.  &#8220;The retirement age has to be changed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the long run, there has to be more revenue,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The burden of that revenue will be disproportionately taken up by wealthier people. That&#8217;s just logical.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Dina Bass" date="Nov 27, 2012  2:44 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-27/microsoft-says-it-sold-more-than-750-000-xbox-consoles-last-week.html"><headline>Microsoft Says It Sold More Than 750,000 Xbox Consoles Last Week</headline><body>

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) was sued by
CIFG Assurance North America Inc., which says it lost more than
$100 million on collateralized debt obligations created by Bear
Stearns, the investment bank JPMorgan acquired in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns stocked the CDOs with toxic mortgage
securities and profited by betting against the portfolios, the
insurer said in a complaint filed yesterday in New York State
Supreme Court. Bear Stearns told CIFG that independent firms had
selected the collateral, New York-based CIFG said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As a result of its fraud, Bear Stearns was able to pass
off huge losses onto CIFG,&#8221; according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CIFG said it was induced to provide financial-guaranty
insurance on credit default swaps guaranteeing payment on notes
issued by ACA ABS CDO 2006-2 Ltd. and Libertas Preferred Funding
II Ltd., according to the complaint. CIFG last week sued Bank of
America Corp. for fraud over guaranty policies tied to mortgage
securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment on CIFG&#8217;s complaint. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s Romanian unit
called for bids from companies interested in providing offshore
drilling services in the Black Sea under a contract estimated to
be worth $250 million to $750 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contract is for the duration of 48 months and includes
drilling one to seven wells in the Black Sea, where Exxon is
looking for natural gas together with Romania&#8217;s biggest oil
company OMV Petrom SA (SNP), according to a European Union procurement
document published today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bidders can submit offers until Jan. 7, 2013 for the
contract, which will be financed by Exxon from its own funds,
according to the document submitted by ExxonMobil Exploration
and Production Romania Limited Nassau. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Austria&#8217;s OMV AG (OMV), the majority-owner of Petrom, said on
Feb. 22 that it discovered what may be its biggest gas find in
the Black Sea well it is exploring together with a unit of
Exxon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Domino-1 well, which is operated by the Exxon unit,
encountered 70.7 meters of net gas pay, resulting in a
preliminary estimate for the accumulation ranging from 1.5 to 3
trillion cubic feet (42 to 84 billion cubic meters), OMV said.
Drilling operations started at the end of 2011 and the total
depth of the well is estimated to be more than 3,000 meters
below sea level. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elisse Walter, who has spent the past four years as Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro&#8217;s closest confidant and behind-the-scenes adviser, will soon step into the spotlight that she has mostly shunned in trying to help her close friend succeed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Designated to become SEC chief by President Barack Obama when Schapiro leaves in December, Walter is little known outside of Washington where she has spent most of her career as a regulator. For the short term, at least, she&#8217;s likely to keep Schapiro&#8217;s priorities intact, securities lawyers and ex-agency officials said, citing her record of almost always voting alongside Schapiro on new rules and enforcement cases. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;She&#8217;s sincere and dedicated, and the administration knows where she stands,&#8221; said Paul Atkins, a former Republican commissioner who is now chief executive of Patomak Global Partners LLC, a consulting firm in Washington. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because Walter, 62, was already confirmed by the Senate as a commissioner, the law allows her to become chairman without going through a second confirmation, and she can stay in the job as long as the end of next year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, by not immediately naming a replacement for Schapiro&#8217;s commission seat, the administration will leave the panel evenly split with two Democrats and two Republicans -- making it harder to enact controversial policies, including the Volcker proprietary trading ban from the 2010 Dodd-Frank law and new strictures for money-market funds. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;New Nomination &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;An administration official said yesterday that Obama will nominate a new commissioner in the near future. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the deliberations were private, didn&#8217;t say how soon a nomination might come, and whether the nominee would also be designated for the chairman position. Other possible nominees for chairman include Treasury Undersecretary Mary Miller and former SEC commissioner Harvey Goldschmid, people familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whoever serves as chairman will face many of the difficulties that plagued Schapiro, including dealing with a politically polarized commission and trying to manage an unwieldy bureaucracy that has been criticized for missing financial frauds. Other pressing issues include grappling with high-frequency trading and a fragmented market structure that has helped spark trading disruptions like the 2010 flash crash. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lawmakers of both parties called on the president to move quickly to specifically nominate a chairman and permit the Senate to vote on his or her confirmation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Bypassing Congress &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Senator David Vitter of Louisiana, a Republican on the subcommittee that oversees the agency, said the selection of Walter represents an &#8220;arrogant bypassing of Congress.&#8221; Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, described Walter as &#8220;an extraordinary talent&#8221; but said she would benefit from formal approval as chairman. &#8220;At some point it would help and provide the kind of support that you need to do some very difficult issues,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Walter didn&#8217;t return a call seeking comment. She issued a statement saying, &#8220;I am deeply honored and humbled to be the SEC&#8217;s next chairman and to continue to serve alongside the talented and dedicated SEC commissioners and staff who work tirelessly on behalf of America&#8217;s investors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Schapiro announced yesterday she would leave the job on Dec. 14. She joined the SEC in January 2009, her tenure buffeted by the 2008 financial crisis and the political firestorm after revelations that the SEC had missed multi-billion dollar Ponzi schemes run by Bernard Madoff and R. Allen Stanford. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Schapiro was credited with rebuilding confidence in the agency after the scandals, she has been criticized for not punishing high-level banking executives in the wake of the credit crisis and acting slowly to enact all the rules from Dodd-Frank. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Financial Regulator &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Much like Schapiro, Walter has spent her career overseeing Wall Street. Before becoming a commissioner in July 2008, Walter worked at the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the self regulator for brokerage firms that Schapiro headed. Walter also was general counsel at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission where she overlapped with Schapiro. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an earlier SEC stint, Walter worked in the Corporation Finance Division and the general counsel&#8217;s office. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Walter, a cancer survivor, has sent mixed signals in recent months about whether she wants to stay at the commission. In February, she gave speech to an annual SEC conference that was widely seen as valedictory, telling the crowd her remarks would be &#8220;somewhat nostalgic&#8221; since the end of her term was near. Walter, according to one person at the SEC, also has confided to her staff that she is looking forward to retirement and spending more time in Maine where she has a house. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there were signs her tenure might be extended. She went through a new FBI background check several months ago, according to two people interviewed by the agents, and her official photo was recently updated. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;One Dissent &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Walter voted with Schapiro most of the time, her dissent on a rule requiring brokerages to build a single system for monitoring trading activity has led some observers to think she may forge a more pro-regulation path than Schapiro. In that rule, passed in July, Schapiro sided with Republican Commissioners Daniel Gallagher and Troy Paredes to support an industry-backed solution that allowed for some trades to be reported the following day. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Walter wanted the information to be recorded in real time. She called the rule &#8220;an overly cautious approach&#8221; that would &#8220;ensure that the industry remains one step or one day ahead of the regulators.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In her February speech, Walter also gave some insight into how she may act as chairman, telling the group that &#8220;for me, it is critical to put the agency first and my personal views second.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That means, she said, &#8220;considering carefully when to compromise and when to hold fast; when to speak and when to hold my tongue; and when to dissent,&#8221; as well as &#8220;working to complete the tasks that Congress and the president assign to us through legislation, regardless of our personal feelings about those tasks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Matthew Leising" date="Nov 28, 2012  2:41 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-28/cftc-said-to-grant-swaps-clearing-delay-to-jpmorgan-barclays.html"><headline>CFTC Said to Give Swaps Dealers 3-Month Clearing Time Delay</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The Commodity Futures Trading
Commission granted JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Barclays Plc (BARC) and six
other lenders a three-month delay to meet swaps-clearing rules,
according to a person with knowledge of the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The delay is intended to help banks comply with time limits
that require them to accept trades in less than two minutes,
said the person, who asked not to be identified because the
discussions are private. Citigroup Inc. (C), Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN),
Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley (MS) and
UBS AG (UBSN) also asked for and received the extension from the
original Oct. 1 deadline, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies in the $639 trillion swaps market have requested
and obtained grace periods to comply with rules that the CFTC is
now implementing under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. Last month,
Commissioner Scott O&#8217;Malia said the agency would issue 18 no-action letters and other guidelines granting temporary relief
from regulations as the industry and the CFTC couldn&#8217;t meet the
target dates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CFTC time limit of two minutes goes down to one minute
90 days after the clearing rule determination is published in
the Federal Register. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Adamske, a CFTC spokesman, said he couldn&#8217;t
immediately comment. Scott Helfman, a spokesman for Citigroup,
and Katherine Herring of Credit Suisse, declined to comment.
Representatives of the other banks said they were unable to
immediately comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Technologically Practicable&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The requested extensions ranged from three banks saying
they could meet the requirement by Dec. 31 to others that said
the median of all trades could be accepted or rejected within 90
seconds by the 90-day deadline after the Federal Register
publication, according to a letter to Citigroup from Ananda Radhakrishnan, director of the CFTC&#8217;s division of clearing and
risk, that was obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;One of the firms stated it currently has over 70 percent
of the market share for customer trades,&#8221; the letter said. The
CFTC &#8220;believes that if the entity with the most volume is able
to comply&#8221; by Dec. 31 &#8220;then acceptance or rejection within the
same timeframe is technologically practicable for firms with
lesser volume.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radhakrishnan gave the banks until Jan. 1, 2013 to accept
trades within two minutes, according to the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LCH.Clearnet Group Ltd., owner of the world&#8217;s largest
interest-rate swap clearinghouse, was granted a six-month delay
to upgrade its systems to accept trades in less than a minute,
Bloomberg News reported earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;60 Seconds &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;LCH has represented that it will use the extension period
to install, and to perform full regression and performance
testing of&#8221; its systems &#8220;to accept or reject trades within 60
seconds after submission,&#8221; the CFTC said in a Nov. 21 letter
granting the extension to London-based LCH.Clearnet. Rules
passed in March required clearinghouses to have the systems in
place by Oct. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nina Truman, a spokeswoman for LCH.Clearnet, confirmed that
the company had been given until March 31 to meet the clearing-time requirement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CFTC is among several agencies writing and implementing
rules mandated by Dodd Frank, which overhauled U.S. financial
regulation in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The act
required U.S. regulators to oversee the over-the-counter swaps
market for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule passed in March for how much time banks and
clearinghouses had to accept or reject swaps said only that
transactions had to be completed as soon as technologically
possible if fully automated systems were used, leaving
regulators confused and market participants struggling to
comply. Radhakrishnan clarified the CFTC&#8217;s requirement in
separate e-mails in August and September to bank and
clearinghouse executives that they had two minutes and one
minute, respectively, to accept or reject trades. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is selling four
times as many Windows phones as this time last year, helped by a
new version of its phone software for more powerful handsets
with faster screens, Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Windows Phone 8 has been on sale for a few weeks and is
off to a great start,&#8221; Ballmer said at a shareholders&#8217; meeting
today. Handsets made by HTC Corp. (2498) and Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) &#8220;are getting
rave reviews and have initially sold out in many countries.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is overhauling its product line to remain
relevant in the post-PC era. The Redmond, Washington-based
company dominated the technology landscape during the heyday of
the personal computer in the 1990s and much of the last decade,
yet has been eclipsed in influence by a resurgent Apple Inc. and
the rise of mobile devices taking the place of PCs that run
Microsoft&#8217;s flagship Windows operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows 8 represents Microsoft&#8217;s biggest change to its
flagship product in nearly two decades -- designed around a
revamped home screen featuring colorful tiles that launch
programs and update users with current information from the
Internet. On Oct. 26, the same day Windows 8 went on sale,
Microsoft started selling Surface, a tablet computer designed
and built by the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ballmer said Microsoft is seeing &#8220;fantastic demand&#8221; for
tablets and touch-screen PCs featuring Windows 8. There are now
1,500 different machines running the software, up from 1,000
when the operating system debuted, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are now 120,000 applications available for the
Windows phone, Ballmer said. He didn&#8217;t specify how many phones
running the new software have been sold. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philippe Altuzarra is returning to
London after running Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s Paris office for
three years to serve as advisory director, a person with
knowledge of the move said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altuzarra will be succeeded in Paris by Pierre Hudry and
Christian De Haaij, investment banking co-heads of France,
Belgium and Luxembourg for Goldman, the person said, asking not
to be identified as an announcement has not been made public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As advisory director, Altuzarra will give strategic
guidance to international advisers in Europe and help cover
clients in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 62-year-old banker joined Goldman in 1993 from Havas,
after earlier posts at France&#8217;s finance ministry and its Japan
embassy. He is a graduate of the Ecole nationale
d&#8217;administration, which produces many of France&#8217;s senior
officials and executives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altuzarra, who is a partner at the bank, was first tapped
to co-run Goldman&#8217;s Paris office in 2000, a role he held until
2006, when he was succeeded by Jean Raby and appointed to the
international advisory group in London. He returned to Paris in
2009 to co-run the office there with Laurent Lellouche, who
remains head of Goldman&#8217;s operations in France. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Goldman declined to comment on
Altuzarra&#8217;s move, which was reported earlier by WanSquare, a
French news service. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OAO Lukoil, Russian&#8217;s biggest non-
state oil producer, is studying documents on Iraq&#8217;s West Qurna-1
oil field, which Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) may exit, as it considers
expanding developments in the Middle Eastern nation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lukoil will make a decision on possible participation in
the project by the end of the year, billionaire Chief Executive
Officer Vagit Alekperov said. The oil company holds 75 percent
of the separate phase 2 project at the field, called a &#8220;super
giant&#8221; by the Iraqi Oil Ministry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are looking at the main issue now, synergy,&#8221;
Alekperov told reporters today in Moscow. &#8220;What economic
synergies the company will get if these two projects work
together.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq is seeking international investment in its energy
industry, while warning companies against signing agreements
with authorities in the northern Kurdish region without the
approval of the central government. The nation this year asked
companies such as Exxon Mobil to abandon oil exploration in the
semi-autonomous area or exit projects in the south. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon sent a letter to Iraq&#8217;s state-owned South Oil asking
for permission to share technical data about West Qurna-1 with
BP Plc (BP/), Eni SpA (ENI) and Lukoil, Dhia Jaafar, South Oil&#8217;s director
general, said Nov. 8. Lukoil said Nov. 9 that it received a
proposal from Exxon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lukoil&#8217;s Qurna &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon has 60 percent of the West Qurna-1 project after
signing an agreement in January 2010 to develop the field,
according to the Irving, Texas-based company&#8217;s website. Oil
Exploration Co. of Iraq holds 25 percent and Royal Dutch Shell
Plc (RDSA) has the remaining 15 percent, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq informed Lukoil and China National Petroleum Corp. it
would favor their bids if they decided to buy Exxon&#8217;s stake in
the project, Reuters reported on Nov. 16, citing unidentified
oil ministry officials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lukoil raised its stake in West Qurna-2 to 75 percent this
year after buying about 19 percent from Statoil ASA. (STL) The Moscow-
based oil producer is searching for a new partner in the
project, Deputy Vice-President Andrei Gaidamaka said on a
conference call yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two ex-brokers accused of running a
$1.2 million insider-trading scheme tied to International
Business Machines Corp. (IBM)&#8217;s $1.2 billion acquisition of SPSS Inc.
were indicted by U.S. prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Conradt, 34, of Denver, and David Weishaus, 32, of
Baltimore, were arrested today by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation on securities fraud charges, said Peter Donald, a
spokesman for the FBI&#8217;s New York office. They were scheduled to
make court appearances today in Colorado and Maryland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two longtime friends learned in May 2009 that IBM, the
largest computer-services provider, was planning to acquire
software company SPSS, prosecutors in the office of Manhattan
U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara alleged in the indictment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The defendants knew their behavior was illegal, even
messaging before the announcement, &#8216;I dont want to go to
jail,&#8217;&#8221; Mary Galligan, acting head of the FBI&#8217;s New York
office, said in a statement. &#8220;Time and again, FBI agents arrest
those who trade on inside information.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information originated from an attorney who was part of
the legal team that was advising IBM in the transaction,
prosecutors said. That lawyer told a broker-analyst details
about the deal, including the names of the parties and the fact
that IBM was going to acquire SPSS for a &#8220;significant premium&#8221;
over its market price, according to the indictment. Neither the
lawyer nor the broker-analyst were identified by prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SEC Lawsuit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a related
lawsuit against Conradt and Weishaus today in federal court in
Manhattan. The SEC said its investigation is continuing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both regulators and prosecutors said that the men discussed
their insider-trading in instant messages in the weeks before
the acquisition was announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We need spss to run up i need that lexus,&#8221; Weishaus
wrote to Conradt in a July 1, 2009, message cited by federal
authorities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another exchange that same day, Conradt wrote, &#8220;don&#8217;t
tell anyone else..we gotta keep this in the family.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weishaus replied, &#8220;Dude, no way. I don&#8217;t want to go to
jail&#8230;that Martha Stewart spent 5 months in the slammer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Moral Support&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC alleged that the attorney with the inside
information confided in the broker-analyst because he sought
&#8220;moral support, reassurance and advice&#8221; related to his new
assignment working on the SPSS acquisition, according to the
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawyer &#8220;expected the research analyst to maintain this
information in confidence and refrain from trading,&#8221; the SEC
said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broker-analyst, described in court papers as &#8220;Co-
Conspirator 3,&#8221; purchased SPSS stock, then shared the tip about
the acquisition with Conradt, who was his roommate, according to
the indictment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conradt then allegedly shared the tip with Weishaus, who
passed the information to two unidentified brokers they worked
with. The two defendants and their friends all purchased SPSS,
eventually earning a total of $1.2 million in illicit profit,
the U.S. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Press Release &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the companies issued a press release on July 27, 2009,
on IBM&#8217;s plan to buy SPSS for about $1.2 billion, or almost $50
a share, SPSS&#8217;s share price rose by 41 percent in one day, the
U.S. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Thomas Conradt, David Weishaus and their co-conspirators
engaged in a chain of illegal tipping simply because they wanted
to get rich quick,&#8221; Bharara said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conradt and Weishaus were charged with one count of
conspiracy and three separate counts of securities fraud.
Securities fraud carries a maximum term of 20 years in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharon Feldman, a lawyer for Conradt, and Michael Grudberg,
a lawyer for Weishaus, didn&#8217;t immediately return phone calls
seeking comment about the charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contradt was arrested at his office in Louisville,
Colorado, and was scheduled to appear today before U.S.
Magistrate Judge Kristin Mix in Denver, Donald said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weishaus was arrested at his home in Baltimore, and was
scheduled to appear before a federal judge today in Maryland,
Donald said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are U.S. v. Conradt, 12-cr-887, and SEC v.
Conradt, 12-cv-8676, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) gained after
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) upgraded the stock to buy, saying the
new BlackBerry 10 phones could help it return to profitability
in fiscal 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIM advanced 4 percent to $11.54 in New York. The Waterloo,
Ontario-based company&#8217;s shares have gained 46 percent since the
end of October and advanced on 10 of the last 11 trading days,
though the stock is down 20 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s upgrade is the latest in a wave of higher analyst
ratings amid fresh optimism for the new BlackBerry 10 phones,
which are set to go on sale in February. While RIM&#8217;s current
BlackBerry lineup continues to lose market share to Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s
iOS and devices that run Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Android software, the new
phones may change that, said Simona Jankowski, a Goldman
analyst. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We now assess a 30 percent chance of success for BB10
given positive early reviews, broad-based carrier support,
attractive features, and interest by carriers and consumers in
broadening the field beyond Android/iOS,&#8221; she wrote in a
research report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher demand for the new, pricier phones should also drive
up RIM&#8217;s average smartphone selling price and deliver improved
profitability, Jankowski wrote. That should help RIM return to
profit in the fiscal year ending February 2014, with earnings of
20 cents a share, she said today. Her previous forecast was for
a loss of 52 cents a share in fiscal 2014. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said its Surface
tablet computer running the new Windows 8 Pro software will go
on sale in January, the first versions of the machine that run
on Intel (INTC) Corp. chips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surface tablets with Windows 8 Pro will cost $899 for a
version with 64 gigabytes of memory, and $999 for a 128-gigabyte
model. They run on Intel&#8217;s Core i5 processor, giving the
machines a graphics boost, Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft
said today in a blog post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft hasn&#8217;t disclosed how many units it has sold of
the Surface that runs on a chip with ARM Holdings Plc (ARM)
technology, which went on sale last month for $499 to $699. The
price for the Intel-based iteration, which doesn&#8217;t include the
tablet cover with a built-in keyboard that is one of Surface&#8217;s
key features, may be too high for many users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At that price, by the time you add the keyboard you&#8217;re at
the price of an 11-inch MacBook,&#8221; said Wes Miller, an analyst
at Kirkland, Washington-based Directions on Microsoft, referring
to Apple Inc.&#8217;s laptop computer. &#8220;Everyone always says, &#8216;well,
Apple is so expensive,&#8217; but here we are in that same
neighborhood looking at houses.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Miller said the price for the Surface with Windows 8
Pro is more reasonable if a user is planning to have the machine
double as a tablet and a full personal computer. For example,
customers could put the machine in a dock and use it alongside a
larger screen to replace desktop computers, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;But if you&#8217;re looking at it as just a tablet, it is
pricey,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Joe Carroll, Rebecca Penty and Katia Dmitrieva" date="Nov 29, 2012  1:26 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-29/chevron-s-19-billion-disaster-gets-hearing-corporate-canada.html"><headline>Chevron&#8217;s $19 Billion &#8216;Disaster&#8217; Gets Hearing</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;A judge hearing Chevron Corp.&#8217;s (CVX)
first test of whether Amazon rainforest-dwellers will collect
$19 billion in environmental damages from the world&#8217;s fourth-
largest oil company said the case should be tried in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You should all be in New York,&#8221; Ontario Superior Court
Justice David Brown said several times during the first day of
hearings today in Toronto. &#8220;On the issue of jurisdiction, the
law is not clear on this at all. Why should the Ontario court
stick their nose&#8221; into the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of 47 Ecuadoreans have asked the Ontario court to
seize Chevron assets in Canada, ranging from an oil sands
project to offshore wells, to satisfy a 2011 court ruling in the
Latin American nation that ordered the company to pay for oil
pollution dating to the 1960s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s hearing in Toronto marks the Ecuadoreans&#8217; inaugural
step in a global collection effort that includes seizure
attempts in Argentina and Brazil. The Ecuadoreans estimated
Chevron has $12 billion in Canadian assets, a figure that
equates to almost half of the company&#8217;s 2011 profit. An adverse
Ontario ruling for Chevron would put at risk fuel-manufacturing
and oil-production operations across Canada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Long Time&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a cause for concern and it probably means this isn&#8217;t
going to go away,&#8221; Robert Sweet, who helps manage $150 million
at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana, said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;As with all ecological disasters, this is
going to take a long, long time to resolve.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s presence in Canada dates back to the 1930s
and includes an oil-refining complex in British Columbia, an
Alberta oil-sands venture, offshore wells in the Atlantic Ocean,
and cash held in Canadian bank accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Ramon, California-based Chevron was on the losing side
of last year&#8217;s ruling by a provincial Ecuadorean court that
blamed decades of toxic soil and water contamination on Texaco
Inc., which Chevron acquired in 2001. Texaco was found to have
discharged into the environment saltwater and other byproducts
of oil drilling. Texaco quit the country and its equipment was
taken over by the Ecuadorean state oil company in 1992. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $19 billion ruling handed down last year by a court in
Lago Agrio, a town near Ecuador&#8217;s border with Colombia, held
Chevron accountable for health and environmental damages
resulting from chemical-laden wastewater dumped from 1964 to
1992. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Corporate Veil &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ecuadorean plaintiffs, from the remote northern Amazon
River basin, are seeking enforcement of the judgment outside
their home country because Chevron has no refineries, oil wells,
storage terminals or other properties in the nation. Pablo
Fajardo, their lead lawyer in Ecuador, said during a February
2011 conference call with reporters he would &#8220;use every
strategy and manner at our disposal&#8221; to collect the award. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During today&#8217;s hearing, Brown leaned in favor of Chevron&#8217;s
argument that the Ontario court has no jurisdiction to grant the
Ecuadorean judgment because the company&#8217;s Canadian units are
indirect subsidiaries with independent boards separated from the
U.S. parent by several levels of ownership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorneys for the Ecuadoreans are scheduled to present
their arguments to Brown tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ecuadoreans face an &#8220;uphill battle&#8221; because they must
convince the court that Chevron and its Canadian operations
should be treated as one entity rather than separate companies,
Barry Leon, a partner and head of the international arbitration
group at Perley-Robertson, Hill  McDougall LLP in Ottawa, said
during an interview before the hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The expression that gets used legally is &#8216;lifting the
corporate veil&#8217; and disregarding the separate personalities,&#8221;
Leon said. &#8220;The courts generally, in Canada and elsewhere, have
been reluctant to do that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pending Arbitration &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron rose 16 cents to $105.74 at 1:08 p.m. in New York
today. The shares have increased 8.6 percent in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron has refused to pay the $19 billion judgment or
entertain the notion of settlement talks because it maintains
the ruling resulted from bribery and fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ecuadoreans&#8217; lawyers &#8220;have blackmailed judges, bribed
judges, falsified evidence, falsified expert witnesses,
ghostwritten expert opinions and ghostwritten court judgments,&#8221;
Chevron Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Watson said in
comments at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York today.
If the plaintiffs were confident in the &#8220;integrity&#8221; of the
ruling, they would seek enforcement in U.S. courts with
jurisdiction over the parent company, Kent Robertson, a company
spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hard-Fought &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Now that the Ecuador courts have ruled against the
company, it is manufacturing fraud charges in a desperate effort
to escape justice,&#8221; Karen Hinton, a spokeswoman for the
Ecuadorean plaintiffs, said in an e-mailed statement today.
Chevron is engaging in &#8220;legal theater,&#8221; Hinton wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Lenczner, the Toronto attorney from the firm Lenczner
Slaght Royce Smith Griffin LP representing the Ecuadoreans,
declined to comment on the case when reached by phone before the
hearings began. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Whatever the outcome, it&#8217;s likely that the initial
decisions will be appealed,&#8221; Leon said. &#8220;It&#8217;s been extremely
hard-fought by both sides having many lawyers and having spent
what&#8217;s been a phenomenal amount of money because there&#8217;s so much
at stake.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron doesn&#8217;t disclose how much it spends on legal fees,
Robertson said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron is awaiting a ruling in a related case before the
Permanent Court of Arbitration, the 113-year-old panel based in
The Hague that handles trade disputes between corporations and
nations. Chevron filed the arbitration claim in 2009, accusing
the government of Ecuador of reneging on a 1998 contract that
absolved Texaco of Amazonian pollution claims. Three days of
hearings in the case concluded yesterday, Robertson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unfair Influence &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s campaign to avoid payment suffered a setback last
month when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a lower-court decision
that rejected the company&#8217;s request for a pre-emptive block on
collection efforts in Chevron&#8217;s home country. The lower court
had ruled that it didn&#8217;t have authority to thwart payment when
the Ecuadoreans hadn&#8217;t yet filed such a claim in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the filing of their Canadian seizure request in
May, the Ecuadoreans sought similar forfeitures in a Brazilian
tribunal in June and in Argentina earlier this month. A judge in
Buenos Aires ordered some Chevron bank deposits held in escrow
while the case is pending, Enrique Bruchou, a lawyer for the
Ecuadoreans, said in an interview on Nov. 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, in paid statements published in two Argentine
newspapers, Chevron urged the local court to release its money
from escrow and indicated the company intends to pursue a legal
defense identical to that employed in Canada. &#8220;Chevron
Argentina has never had operations in Ecuador and has no
relation with the fraudulent trial in Ecuador,&#8221; the company
said in the newspapers Clarin and La Nacion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m more concerned now than I was a couple of months ago
now that the Ecuadoreans have found other governments that
appear to be at least moderately friendly to their case,&#8221; Sweet
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Transparency International &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron has accused the Ecuadorean government of unfairly
influencing court proceedings that led to the $19 billion ruling
and alleged that a damage assessment provided by a court-
appointed expert was ghostwritten by consultants and lawyers
hired by the plaintiffs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the Ecuadoreans including Stephen Donzinger
have accused Chevron of engaging in a campaign to discredit
them, entrap an Ecuadorean judge that presided over the case and
set up dummy corporations in Ecuador to hide Chevron&#8217;s alleged
role in testing soil samples from the pollution sites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecuador ranked 120th out of 183 nations in Transparency
International&#8217;s 2011 corruption-perception index, where No. 1
New Zealand is perceived to be the most honest. Albania, Liberia
and Lesotho were perceived as less corrupt than Ecuador,
according to the index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February 2011, Chevron filed a racketeering lawsuit
that&#8217;s ongoing against the Ecuadoreans and their lawyers in New
York for &#8220;leading a fraudulent litigation and PR campaign
against the company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) is the world&#8217;s biggest oil company by
market value, followed by PetroChina Company Ltd. and Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, won a New York appeals court ruling
upholding the dismissal of a lawsuit by the defunct commodities
fund Amaranth Advisors LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amaranth collapsed in 2006 after losing $6.6 billion on
natural gas trades. The fund sued New York-based JPMorgan in
2007 in state court in Manhattan, alleging bank executives
helped cause its demise by sabotaging a bailout by Citadel
Investment Group LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice O. Peter Sherwood of New York&#8217;s trial-level Supreme
court threw out the suit in August 2011, saying Amaranth
officials can&#8217;t prove the executives&#8217; statements were the reason
Citadel officials decided to cancel the bailout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An appeals panel in Manhattan upheld the dismissal today,
saying Amaranth&#8217;s case relies on a statement indicating that
JPMorgan had concerns about the impact of any potential bridge
loan to the fund, instead of the defamatory statement alleged in
its complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement Amaranth now relies on &#8220;is not defamatory,
as it simply expresses an opinion based on information available
to all potential parties to the potential fund transaction,&#8221;
the appeals court said in its ruling. &#8220;Furthermore, the
statement is substantially true.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court said it found &#8220;uncontroverted evidence&#8221;
that JPMorgan &#8220;did consider, if only briefly, making a bridge
loan to the fund and concluded that it was &#8216;less than
creditworthy&#8217; and a &#8216;potential preference risk.&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Amaranth LLC v. JPMorgan Chase  Co.,

(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Argentine unit of Chevron Corp. (CVX)
asked local courts to revoke an embargo of its assets in the
country related to a $19 billion award over pollution in
Ecuador, saying the ruling affects local operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron Argentina is victim of a fraud,&#8221; the company
said in a paid statement published in newspapers Clarin and La
Nacion today. &#8220;Chevron Argentina has never had operations in
Ecuador and has no relation with the fraudulent trial in
Ecuador.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Adrian Elcuj Miranda ordered 40 percent of Chevron&#8217;s
Argentine bank accounts to be held in escrow, Enrique Bruchou,
an Argentine attorney representing Ecuadorean plaintiffs, said
on Nov. 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs are seeking to enforce a $19 billion award
against Chevron, which they say is responsible for destroying
the environment in the Lago Agrio region, damaging living
conditions of 30,000 inhabitants. Chevron, which on Sept. 14
signed a memorandum of understanding to help develop Argentina&#8217;s
Vaca Muerta shale formation, says the Ecuador judgment is
illegitimate and the embargo is improper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The embargo endangers &#8220;Chevron Argentina&#8217;s capacity to
operate and reinvest as the order affects more than 90 percent
of the income from crude sales,&#8221; according to today&#8217;s
statement. Those funds are used to pay salaries, royalties,
taxes and capital investments, Chevron said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which employs 1,500 people in Argentina, said
the funds should be applied to invest in Argentina to recover
the country&#8217;s capacity to supply itself with energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Heather Perlberg and Jody Shenn" date="Nov 30, 2012  5:28 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-30/goldman-pushes-subprime-abx-index-as-housing-rebounds-mortgages.html"><headline>Goldman Pushes Subprime ABX Index as Housing Rebounds: Mortgages</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc., which
survived the U.S. real estate collapse five years ago with the
help of derivative bets against subprime mortgages, is promoting
the opposite trade to clients as housing recovers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm, which teamed with four other dealers to create
the ABX indexes, benchmark contracts that offered investors a
way to protect against the risks of a crash, said in a Nov. 28
report on its top 10 market themes for 2013 that clients should
buy some of the derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home prices are recovering from a six-year slump, helped by
Federal Reserve efforts to push mortgage rates to record lows
and buyers competing for a shrinking supply of properties. The
bank&#8217;s analysts said after &#8220;the positive surprise&#8221; from
housing this year, versions of the ABX that have already rallied
are still attractive compared with real estate investments such
as homebuilder shares, which have almost doubled over the past
12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;re going to get a further lift because of the steady
improvement in the indexes&#8217; underlying assets and the housing
market,&#8221; said Adrian Miller, a fixed-income strategist at GMP
Securities LLC in New York. &#8220;Yes, there&#8217;s room to go, but how
much juice is left in the trade is another question.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman in New York,
declined to comment on the recommendation beyond the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New ABX indexes were created every six months by securities
firms from early 2006 through early 2008. The contracts offer
protection if the securities aren&#8217;t repaid as expected, in
return for upfront and regular insurance-like premiums. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More Bullish &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The credit-default swaps enabled speculators to bet against
housing, and helped meet demand from investors for the high
yields of loans to homeowners with poor credit. As the credit
crisis grew, investors followed the price of the contracts as a
gauge of losses at banks and hedge funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has taken a more bullish view on housing
since at least March, when it was raising money for a new fund
to buy home-loan bonds to benefit from an improving real-estate
market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investments such as homebuilders have already priced in the
recovery, the bank said in the report. PulteGroup Inc. (PHM) leads the
11-member homebuilding index with a gain of 166 percent this
year followed by M/I Homes Inc. (MHO), which rose 129 percent, and KB
Home (KBH) with a 114 percent increase. The index, which had gained 83
percent for the first 10 months of the year, fell 0.8 percent
today in New York, extending the decline in November to 3.1
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Ripple Effects&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors need to look beyond these stocks for the &#8220;ripple
effects of housing stabilization,&#8221; the analysts said in the
report. Potential beneficiaries include certain versions of the
ABX and U.S. domestic banks, which may be helped by more
homeowner refinancing as credit conditions improve, they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ABX index tied to bonds created in the second half of
2006 that were issued with AAA ratings rose 39 percent to 47.05
cents on the dollar this year, according to London-based
administrator Markit Group Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The higher-rated tranches have already repriced
significantly, but still price in severe future mortgage default
assumptions that are more likely than not to surprise on the low
side,&#8221; the Goldman Sachs analysts wrote. &#8220;They are clearly
sensitive to further home price strength.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The index has tumbled from about 100 when it was created in
early 2007, just after the bank&#8217;s mortgage holdings started
dropping in value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2006, David Viniar, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s chief
financial officer at the time, told the firm&#8217;s traders to shift
to a neutral risk position and get &#8220;closer to home,&#8221; according
to a report from the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations led by Michigan Democrat Carl Levin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Big Short&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group sold their stockpile of subprime bonds and
collateralized debt obligations, and bought credit-default swaps
protecting against losses, according to the panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They &#8220;quickly shot past &#8216;home,&#8217;&#8221; leading to their first
large net short position in February 2007, the report said. By
June, the net short position reached a peak of about $13.9
billion, including $9 billion in ABX bets against top-rated
bonds that Goldman Sachs had earlier acquired as &#8220;disaster
protection,&#8221; in case the subprime market as a whole lost value,
the subcommittee calculated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting position was referred to by Viniar as the
&#8220;big short,&#8221; a term later used as the title of a Michael Lewis
book about the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the worst housing slump since the 1930s deepened and
millions of Americans failed to meet mortgage payments, the ABX
index linked to the 2006 mortgages fell to as low as 23.3. While
banks, including Bear Stearns Cos., struggled, Goldman Sachs
posted record earnings in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Levin Questioned &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2010, Levin questioned Goldman Sachs executives
including former trader Josh Birnbaum and Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein about whether the bank had bet
against clients even as it sold mortgage-linked securities to
customers. The firm has denied wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs paid a record $550 million fine that year to
settle a fraud lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, which accused it of misleading investors who bought
debt tied to mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors that reaped some of the biggest profits from the
2007 bust such as hedge fund manager John Paulson, who made $15
billion, have since reversed their bets. Birnbaum and Greg Lippmann, who helped pioneer the ABX contracts at Deutsche Bank
AG (DBK), are profiting this year from a rally in subprime and other
bonds not backed by the U.S. government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Birnbaum Gains &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lippmann&#8217;s $2.3 billion LibreMax Capital LLC was up 19
percent this year through October. Birnbaum, who now manages
$1.2 billion at Tilden Park Capital Management LP, has gained 34
percent in the firm&#8217;s main hedge fund through October this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returns on senior-ranked subprime securities from 2005
through 2007, the years that produced the most defaults, average
almost 33 percent this year, according to Barclays Plc index
data. The debt lost 5.5 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyle Bass, who made $500 million shorting subprime, said
this month that the securities offer a &#8220;very safe place&#8221; to
make double-digit returns and that he&#8217;s betting more than half
the money from his firm -- Hayman Capital Management LP -- on
the bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debt is virtually &#8220;bulletproof,&#8221; because even if the
housing market declines by 10 percent, investors won&#8217;t take a
principal hit on their bonds, Bass said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Home Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home prices rose 3 percent in the 12 months through
September, according to an SP/Case-Shiller (SPCS20) index, paring the
decline to 29 percent from the 2006 peak. The median existing-home price may rise 5 percent in 2013, with comparable gains in
2014, according to the National Association of Realtors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Axonic Capital LLC sees value in some subprime debt,
there&#8217;s &#8220;significant risks&#8221; in the market. These include loan
servicers forgiving principal for delinquent homeowners, said
Clayton DeGiacinto, a former Goldman Sachs mortgage trader and
its chief investment officer. The servicers--which collect
payments from borrowers on behalf of bond investors--can also
decide to disrupt cash flowing to investors by invoking their
right to stop advancing missed payments until foreclosure
proceeds are collected, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Price Views &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a heavy analytical process to weigh the benefits of
home appreciation versus the cons,&#8221; said DeGiacinto of New
York-based Axonic. The firm, which manages $1.4 billion, has
gained more than 22 percent in its credit-opportunities hedge
fund this year. &#8220;The decision to buy or sell isn&#8217;t completely
predicated on home price views.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABX investments also carry different risks than owning the
actual bonds. Trading in the market has fallen since before the
housing crash, making the swaps less liquid than others used to
bet on debt. Reduced liquidity can make it more expensive to
enter and exit positions at quoted prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most active ABX index, tied to securities created in the
second half of 2005, had $2.5 billion of net outstanding
contacts as of Nov. 23, according to the Depository Trust 
Clearing Corp. data. That compares with almost $110 billion for
the largest swaps index tied to corporate bonds and $8.1 billion
for commercial-mortgage securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outstanding ABX contracts total a net $16.7 billion,
compared with more than $310 billion of subprime securities,
according to DTCC and Amherst Securities Group LP data. As much
as $200 billion of ABX contracts tied to bonds with just the
lowest investment grades were outstanding in mid-2007, according
to an estimate from a Paulson  Co. presentation that year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABX values also often don&#8217;t track the returns on actual
securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;By Yourself&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indexes can reflect individual funds making &#8220;macro&#8221;
economic wagers or dealers and investors adjusting their hedges,
said Marina Tukhin, a managing director of subprime and home
equity bond trading at Brean Capital LLC in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They don&#8217;t really reflect much of anything at this
point,&#8221; she said. Their illiquidity means you can &#8220;end up
driving up the market all by yourself,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the 10 three-month periods over the past two years
in which subprime values gained more than 10 percent, the
correlation between the debt and an ABX index tied to the same
20 securities was negative 0.08, according to a Nov. 21 report
from JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see better value in subprime cash bonds,&#8221; New York-based analysts at the bank led by John Sim wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Broader Unemployment &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The housing recovery may also be &#8220;hitting speed bumps,&#8221;
according to a Nov. 29 report from Raymond James  Associates,
which cited new-home sales falling in October. Headwinds include
new financial regulation that is likely to emerge next year,
said analysts including Buck Horne. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to see where the sustained demand for
residential real estate lending is going to occur absent a
sustained tick up in the employment situation in this country,&#8221;
Bonnie Baha, head of global developed credit at Los Angeles
based DoubleLine Capital LP, which oversees more than $50
billion, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;There&#8217;s still a lot of
inventory and while the headline unemployment number has
declined,&#8221; a broader labor market metric, the U-6 jobless rate
is still elevated, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors looking to bet on a &#8220;housing recovery&#8221; should
make sure they&#8217;re clear about what they mean and be careful
about their approach, said John Dolan, an independent market
maker for futures on the SP/Case-Shiller indexes that trade on
the CME Group Inc. New-home construction and property values may
not move at the same pace or in the same direction, and
mortgage-bond prices can be linked to unrelated issues such as
benchmark rates and how individual loan servicers deal with bad
debt, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, &#8220;ABX contracts are probably a good viable way of
expressing a view on home prices,&#8221; said Dolan, who traded
mortgage bonds as chief investment officer at Hyperion
Brookfield Asset Management and Bankers Trust. &#8220;Not the purest
theoretical way, but a good pragmatic way.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) plans to overhaul how it develops the flagship Windows operating system in a strategic shift aimed at keeping pace with nimbler rivals Apple (AAPL) Inc. and Google Inc. (GOOG), people familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft aims to upgrade the software more frequently, about once a year, rather than every two or three years as it&#8217;s done in the past, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the product plans are private. The company plans to unveil the first of these updates in 2013, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest software maker has floundered as personal computers, where it has long dominated, have lost ground to the smartphones and tablets championed by Apple and Google. The new approach could help Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft respond to industry changes and integrate new technologies more quickly. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. retail sales of PCs running Windows have declined 21 percent since the company released the latest version of the operating system, Windows 8, according to a report by NPD Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The decrease has been fueled by a 24 percent drop in sales of notebook computers as many customers opt for Apple&#8217;s iPad or tablets powered by Google&#8217;s software instead of Windows, NPD said. The report compared sales from Oct. 21 to Nov. 17 of this year to the same period of 2011. It was based on a sampling of retailers and excluded Microsoft&#8217;s own stores, where the company&#8217;s Surface tablet is sold. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A judge will decide in February
whether a trial can proceed in Ontario over a claim by
Ecuadorean villagers trying to seize $12 billion of Chevron
Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s Canadian assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Superior Court Justice David Brown concluded two days of
hearings today on the asset-seizure request filed in Toronto by
lawyers for 47 Ecuadoreans. A court in the Latin American
country last year found Chevron liable for 28 years of soil and
water pollution near oil wells that ruined the health and
livelihoods of Amazon rainforest dwellers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecuadorean farmers and fishermen have been trying to
collect $19 billion in environmental damages from San Ramon,
California-based Chevron, the world&#8217;s fourth-largest oil
company. The plaintiffs are seeking enforcement outside their
home country because Chevron has no refineries, oil wells,
storage terminals or other properties in the nation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron has refused to pay the judgment or entertain the
notion of settlement talks because it maintains the ruling
resulted from bribery and fraud, charges that lawyers and a
spokeswoman for the plaintiffs have rejected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Brazil, Argentina &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the filing of their Canadian seizure request in
May, the Ecuadoreans sought similar forfeitures in a Brazilian
tribunal in June and in Argentina earlier this month. A judge in
Buenos Aires ordered some Chevron bank deposits held in escrow
while the case is pending, Enrique Bruchou, a lawyer for the
Ecuadoreans, said in a Nov. 7 interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the Amazon River basin residents have estimated
the value of Chevron&#8217;s Canadian assets at $12 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Lenczner, an attorney representing the Ecuadoreans,
disputed Chevron&#8217;s contention that its Canadian assets should be
shielded from seizure because he said its units in the country
are not separate entities from the parent corporation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron Canada are the assets of Chevron Corp.,&#8221;
Lenczner said during a hearing in Toronto today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the only path to a constructive resolution of
this matter requires the participation of the government of
Ecuador,&#8221; Justin Higgs, a Chevron spokesman, said in an e-mail
today. &#8220;Unfortunately, the Republic has rebuffed all attempts
at a constructive dialogue.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Judgment&#8217;s &#8216;Integrity&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers believed in the integrity of
their judgment, they would be seeking enforcement in the United
States -- where Chevron Corporation resides,&#8221; Higgs said,
pointing to the judge&#8217;s statements that the case should be tried
in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling last year by a provincial Ecuadorean court
blamed decades of toxic soil and water contamination on Texaco
Inc., which Chevron acquired in 2001. Texaco was found to have
discharged into the environment saltwater and other byproducts
of oil drilling. Texaco quit the country and its equipment was
taken over by the Ecuadorean state oil company in 1992. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We look forward to continuing to work towards collecting
the full amount of our judgment,&#8221; Graham Erion, spokesman for
the plaintiffs, said today in an e-mail. The funds would be used
&#8220;to force Chevron to clean up its mess&#8221; and provide health
care and resources after &#8220;this company&#8217;s willful
contamination&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron fell 0.1 percent to $105.69 at the close in New
York. The shares have increased 2.8 percent in the past 12
months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) is the world&#8217;s biggest oil company by

&lt;p&gt;House Republicans, under pressure to
improve their standing among Hispanic voters, passed legislation
that would make it easier for foreigners with advanced degrees
to obtain green cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chamber today voted 245-139 to increase the number of
permanent-residence visas for those graduating from U.S.
universities with doctoral or master&#8217;s degrees in science,
technology, engineering and mathematics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republicans said the measure, backed by many prominent
technology companies, would help the economy by capturing a
bigger share of the world&#8217;s most economically productive
citizens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We can only gain by asking as many people who are smart
and who create opportunities far beyond just their own to be
part of our society,&#8221; said Representative Darrell Issa, a
California Republican. &#8220;The benefit to our economy is
undeniable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was opposed by most Democrats, with many complaining
that the measure would simultaneously eliminate a similar number
of visas for people from countries that send relatively few
immigrants to the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You can&#8217;t pretend to be pro-immigrant and then eliminate
immigration for one group to allow immigration for another,&#8221;
said Representative Luis Gutierrez, an Illinois Democrat. &#8220;If
you support this bill, you&#8217;re saying that one group of
immigrants is better than another.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Senate Prospects &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill now heads to the Democratic-controlled Senate,
where it is doomed. The Obama administration opposes the plan,
though it said in a statement of administration policy that it
was pleased to see immigration on lawmakers&#8217; agenda. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The administration is encouraged that the Congress
appears to be ready to begin serious debate on the need to fix
our broken immigration system and looks forward to working with
both Democrats and Republicans,&#8221; the Office of Management and
Budget said in the Nov. 28 statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vote, coming just weeks after the 2012 elections, will
give Republicans a chance to say they are acting on warnings
from party strategists they must improve their standing among
the quickly growing Hispanic population. Republican presidential
candidate Mitt Romney took just 27 percent of the Hispanic vote,
compared with President Barack Obama&#8217;s 71 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legislation is supported by Apple Inc., Microsoft
Corp., Oracle Corp. (ORCL) and Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE), among other
companies, according to Representative Kevin McCarthy of
California, the chamber&#8217;s No. 3 Republican. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Doctorate Holders &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At issue is how many, and what sort of, immigrants the U.S.
ought to be admitting. The legislation passed today would
reserve 55,000 visas for those with doctorates in the designated
fields, though graduates with master&#8217;s degrees could benefit if
not all of those green cards are taken. The bill would also make
it easier for recipients&#8217; spouses and under-age children to join
them by allowing them to wait in the U.S. after spending one
year on the green card wait list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill wouldn&#8217;t result in an increase in total
immigration because it would eliminate a similar number of visas
offered through a program designed to encourage diversity among
immigrants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That program -- which sets aside green cards for countries
with low rates of immigration to the U.S., such as Ethiopia,
Nigeria, Uzbekistan, Albania, Ghana and Morocco -- was created
in 1990 as a counterweight to immigration policies biased toward
applications of people who either already have family in the
U.S. or fill certain employment needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fraud Possible &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics say that program is more vulnerable to fraud
because it&#8217;s more difficult to conduct background checks in many
of those countries. Supporters say without the program,
immigration to the U.S. would be dominated by people from a few
countries, such as Mexico, China, India and the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers shouldn&#8217;t have to choose between the programs,
said Representative Jared Polis, a Colorado Democrat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In many cases, this is the only way that people from
Nepal or Albania or Ethiopia have a shot at coming to this
country,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&#8217;s added value in having people from
all corners of the world.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We also need people in this country across all different
skill levels in our labor market,&#8221; said Polis, regardless of
whether that includes &#8220;toiling in the field or toiling in
downtown buildings at night or programming computers or
designing aircraft.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill is H.R. 6429. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) isn&#8217;t required
to turn over portions of e-mails sought by U.S. regulators in a
probe of potential energy-market manipulation after a judge said
they are protected by attorney-client privilege. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Magistrate Judge Deborah Robinson in Washington
yesterday denied a request by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission to force JPMorgan to provide unredacted copies of 25
e-mails. Robinson said she reviewed the documents and agreed
that the redacted portions are confidential communications with
JPMorgan&#8217;s lawyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FERC sued New York-based JPMorgan on July 2 to release the
e-mails in an investigation of possible manipulation of power
markets in California and the Midwest by J.P. Morgan Ventures
Energy Corp. The agency opened the probe last year after
complaints from California and Midwest grid operators that
JPMorgan&#8217;s bidding practices were abusive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary O&#8217;Driscoll, a spokeswoman for FERC, didn&#8217;t immediately
return a call yesterday after regular business hours seeking
comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Federal Energy Regulatory Commission v. J.P.
Morgan Ventures Energy Corp., 12-mc-352, U.S. District Court,
District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 10 pounds of benzene was
released by a pipeline leak at Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s Baton Rouge
Refinery in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, according to a report made
to the National Response Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atmospheric monitoring is being conducted at the site and
absorbent pads have been placed under the leak, according to the
report, which was taken at 2:08 p.m. yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. refineries must notify the National Response Center if
they release hazardous substance in excess of reportable
quantities, according to the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as
Superfund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News couldn&#8217;t immediately verify the information
in the filing was accurate. &lt;/p&gt;
