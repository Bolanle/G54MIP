<p>Banks struggling to find buyers for
$131 billion of unsold loans that financed last year''s leveraged
buyouts are starting to break ranks and hold individual
negotiations with investors. </p>
<p>Instead of sticking together in a lending group, or
syndicate, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Morgan Stanley (MS) and
Credit Suisse Group have each sought buyers for their portion of
Clear Channel Communications Inc. (CCU)''s $22 billion buyout
financing, said people with knowledge of the situation. They
declined to be identified because the talks are private. </p>
<p>Banks are under pressure to sell the loans after prices for
debt that paid for last year''s record $438 billion of buyouts
fell 12 percent in the past seven months, according to Standard
 Poor''s. Banks and securities firms have taken about $188
billion in writedowns and credit losses since the beginning of
2007, including reserves for bad loans, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>''''It''s reached a new stage of every man for himself,''''
Martin Fridson, chief executive officer of high-yield research
firm FridsonVision LLC in New York, said in an interview.
''''Banks worked hard until now to hold the line and keep the
gentlemen''s agreement together.'''' </p>
<p>Jennifer Sala, a spokeswoman for New York-based Morgan
Stanley, declined comment. Peter Ward, a spokesman for RBS,
based in Edinburgh, didn''t return calls seeking comment. Zurich-based Credit Suisse hasn''t sold any of the Clear Channel debt
and plans to work with the syndicate, Tom Newberry, the bank''s
global head of syndicated loans in New York, said in a telephone
interview. </p>
<p>`Circled the Wagons'' </p>
<p>New York-based Citigroup Inc. (C) is leading the group. The
other banks include Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) of Frankfurt and Wachovia
Corp. (WB) in Charlotte, North Carolina. </p>
<p>Credit Suisse, Switzerland''s second-biggest bank, sold its
share of $7.25 billion of loans to Las Vegas-based casino
operator Harrah''s Entertainment Inc. in December, before the
other banks, which then struggled to sell the debt, people with
knowledge of the situation said. </p>
<p>''''Up through recently, the banking community kind of
circled wagons and everybody was protecting their positions
because they were involved in the same'''' loans, said Matthew Eagan, a money manager at Boston-based Loomis Sayles  Co.,
which oversees $130 billion of assets. ''''What you didn''t want
was somebody under-pricing you and hurting you.'''' </p>
<p>In syndicated loans, banks form a financing group. One or
two institutions typically take charge in finding buyers for
chunks of the loans, such as other banks, money managers and
hedge funds, at an agreed upon price. </p>
<h2>Buyout Frenzy </h2>
<p>Investor demand for riskier assets including high-yield
loans used to finance buyouts began to dry up in the second half
of last year as losses related to the collapse of the subprime
mortgage market spread. Banks were stuck with $163 billion of
the loans at the beginning of 2008, according to a Bank of
America Corp. report last week. </p>
<p>Financial firms will likely see their credit-related losses
reach at least $600 billion, UBS AG analysts wrote in a report
dated Feb. 29. </p>
<p>Loans trade at an average price of 89.02 cents on the
dollar, down from 100 cents in July, according to SP data.
High-yield, or leveraged, loans are rated below BBB- by SP and
Baa3 by Moody''s Investors Service. </p>
<p>`Steady Decline'' </p>
<p>''''It''s been a reasonably steady decline in market
conditions,'''' Blackstone President Hamilton James said on a
conference call today. The publicly traded buyout firm raised a
$1.4 billion fund to invest in loans stuck on bank balance sheets
last November. The firm still has ''''100 percent dry powder'''' and
expects conditions to get worse before improving, James said. </p>
<p>''''Temptation is growing. Some time in the next 90 days
might be the time to do something significant,'''' he said on a
separate call with investors today. </p>
<p>San Antonio-based Clear Channel, the largest U.S. radio
broadcaster, is being bought for $19.5 billion by private-equity
firms Bain Capital LLC and Thomas H. Lee Partners LP, both
located in Boston. </p>
<p>The banks financing the deal agreed in April to provide $22
billion in debt. Banks will extend about $19.5 billion in bank
loans at the London interbank offered rate plus as much as 3.25
percentage points. The premium over Libor (US0003M) has since widened to
about 6.65 percentage points, according to SP, meaning the
banks must sell the Clear Channel loans at a discount to reflect
the wider spreads and current prices. Three-month Libor was 2.94
percent last week. </p>
<h2>Betrayal </h2>
<p>Clear Channel fell 18 cents to $33.96 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading today. The shares have climbed 18
percent over the past month as more investors bet the deal would
be completed. The buyout firms agreed to pay $39.20 a share. </p>
<p>The decision by the banks to approach investors separately
probably means they will be able to buy the loans cheaper. </p>
<p>''''From an investor viewpoint, they are unlikely to be upset
about banks betraying one another, because investors feel they
were treated shabbily by the banks all through the bull
period,'''' Fridson said. </p>

<p>U.S. banks from Goldman Sachs (GS) Group
Inc. to Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. have whittled their
holdings of leveraged buyout loans to $129 billion from $163
billion at the beginning of the year by offering the debt at
discounts, according to analysts at Bank of America Corp. (BAC) </p>
<p>The decline is a ''''ray of hope'''' for banks amid a slump in
credit markets and a slowing economy, said analysts led by
Jeffrey Rosenberg. The firms also have $73.6 billion of high-yield bonds they need to sell, they said. </p>
<p>Banks have been breaking ranks from their lending groups and
offering their own pieces of the LBO loans at as little as 80
cents on the dollar to get the debt off their books. New York-based Lehman yesterday said it has reduced its LBO backlog by
$6.1 billion to $17.8 billion since the beginning of the year.
Goldman Sachs halved its holdings to $20 billion and Morgan
Stanley (MS) reduced its pipeline by 20 percent. </p>
<p>The buyout industry, including Blackstone Group (BX), Apollo
Management LP and Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts  Co. (KKR), all based in
New York, negotiated more than $370 billion in financing to back
acquisitions such as the $32 billion purchase of Texas power
producer TXU Corp. and the $46.8 billion sale of Canadian
telecommunications company BCE Inc. (BCE) to an investor group led by
the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan, the largest buyout ever. </p>
<h2>Plunging Demand </h2>
<p>Investor demand for the debt plummeted in July as losses on
U.S. subprime securities spread to other asset classes. The
average price of a leveraged loan fell from par to a record low
of 86.28 last month, according to Standard  Poor''s data. Prices
have since climbed to 87.32 cents on the dollar. </p>
<p>Banks began tackling the backlog in September, when lenders
for KKR sold $9.4 billion of loans at a discount of up to 4
percent for its takeover of Greenwood Village, Colorado-based
First Data Corp., the biggest processor of credit card payments. </p>
<p>Goldman, the world''s biggest securities firm by market
value, is selling its portion of Chrysler LLC''s $7 billion in
loans for as little as 72 cents on the dollar, said investors,
who declined to be identified because the terms are private.
Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally declined to comment on
individual sales. </p>
<p>Cerberus Capital Management LP bought Chrysler Group LLC
last August. Bankers for the Auburn Hills, Michigan-based
automaker twice failed to sell the Chrysler loans. JPMorgan Chase
 Co. (JPM), Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Bear Stearns Cos. and Goldman,
all of New York, tried in November to sell $4 billion of the
loans at 97.5 cents on the dollar. </p>
<p>The loan is priced at 400 basis points more than the three-month London interbank offered rate, or Libor (US0003M), a borrowing
benchmark. Three-month Libor is 2.6 percent. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point. </p>
<h2>Backlogs Reduced </h2>
<p>Goldman reduced its backlog of loans by $20 billion in the
past quarter from $43 billion, chief financial officer David Viniar said on an investor call yesterday. The New York-based
firm, which booked a loss of $1 billion on the loans, also added
$4 billion of new commitments during the period. </p>
<p>Lehman, the fourth-biggest U.S. securities firm, booked
losses of $500 million on leveraged loans last quarter, CFO Erin Callan said on a conference call with investors yesterday. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, the second-biggest U.S. securities firm,
reduced its leveraged finance pipeline to $16 billion from $20
billion during the first quarter, CFO Colm Kelleher said in an
interview today after the company reported first-quarter profit
fell 42 percent. </p>
<p>Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Morgan Stanley and Credit
Suisse Group have each sought buyers for their portion of Clear
Channel Communications Inc.''s $22 billion buyout financing, said
people with knowledge of the situation. </p>
<h2>LBO Buyers </h2>
<p>Some of the same LBO firms that generated the debt in the
first place are raising funds to buy it back at reduced prices.
Blackstone raised a $1.4 billion fund last November to buy bank
loans, and Leon Black''s Apollo  has bought $1 billion of
distressed loans and bonds. </p>
<p>''''The leveraged loan forward calendar continues to
decline,'''' Rosenberg wrote in the report on March 17. ''''The
ongoing raising of distressed debt funds,'''' including Apollo''s,
''''appears to support these efforts.'''' </p>
<p>In addition to the buyout firms, traditional loan investors
and hedge funds are also buying the debt. </p>
<p>Dallas-based Highland Capital Management LP has raised $1
billion in the past four months from pension funds and sovereign
wealth funds, to invest in debt, including bank loans, according
to Mark Okada, co-founder and chief investment officer. </p>
<p>''''We are more willing to participate in new issues at these
distressed prices,'''' said Scott D''Orsi, a partner at Boston-based
Feingold O''Keeffe Capital, which has $1.25 billion in assets.
''''It''s been a waiting game between the buy side and the banks
over the past several months, with pricing moving in favor of
investors.'''' </p>

<p>New York paid 10 securities firms
more than $600,000 since mid-February to handle bids for
auction-bonds even though the sales failed, saddling the state
with penalty interest rates. </p>
<p>Citigroup Inc. (C), Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and eight more
firms receive $10 million a year to oversee periodic bidding
that sets rates on about $4 billion of auction bonds. When there
aren''t enough buyers, the yields rise. A total of 188 of the
state''s 201 auctions since Feb. 12 have failed, according to
data supplied by the state. </p>
<p>''''We are contractually obligated to pay these fees
regardless of whether the auction fails, and we will fulfill our
commitment,'''' Matt Anderson, a spokesman for New York''s Division
of Budget said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>State and local governments pay almost $8 million a week in
fees to banks for auctions-rate bonds, based on standard fees.
About two-thirds of auctions in the $330 billion market have
failed since mid-February, including periodic sales of preferred
stock for closed-end bond funds, Bloomberg data show. Securities
firms are receiving the same fee even when investors who wanted
to sell are unable to do so because bankers haven''t found enough
bidders. </p>
<p>`Systemic Problems'' </p>
<p>Banks covered shortfalls in demand at auctions in the $330
billion market buy purchasing bonds for their own account, even
though they weren''t obliged to. They didn''t tell investors or
issuers about the extent of the activity, which was one of the
practices cited by the Securities and Exchange Commission in
2006 when it fined 15 banks a total of $13 million for bid-rigging. </p>
<p>New York isn''t trying to renegotiate the contracts with the
10 broker-dealers it uses for auction bonds, Anderson said. The
firms also include Bank of America Corp., Wachovia Corp., UBS
AG, JPMorgan Chase  Co., Merrill Lynch  Co., Bear Stearns Cos.
Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. </p>
<p>''''These failed auctions were not caused by these banks, but
by systemic problems within this market beyond their control,''''
he said. </p>
<p>A spokeswoman for New York-based Citigroup, Danielle Romero-Apsilos, declined to comment, as did Michael DuVally, a
spokesman for New York-based Goldman. Citigroup was the biggest
underwriter of auction-rate debt from 2000 to 2007, according to
Thomson Financial. Goldman is the most profitable investment
bank. </p>
<h2>Higher Rates </h2>
<p>When there aren''t enough bidders in auctions that typically
take place every seven, 28 or 35 days, rates get set by formulas
spelled out when the debt is issued. In New York, the penalty
rates ranged from 3.59 percent to 5.64 percent in the week ended
March 14. That compares with yields on the variable-rate demand
bonds, an alternative to auction-rate notes, that were less than
3 percent for 27 of 43 issues, according to state data. </p>
<p>Seven-day auction rates averaged 4.36 percent on March 19
for borrowers in New York, New Jersey, California and
Massachusetts, up from 3.47 percent on Feb. 6, the last week
before New York auctions began failing, according to index data
published by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets
Association. The rate peaked at 5.98 percent March 5. </p>
<p>Before the failures, auction-rate bonds were a way to sell
long-term bonds at money market rates. They were the least
expensive kind of borrowing for New York until demand began to
weaken in September, according to a state report. </p>
<h2>Bank Contracts </h2>
<p>Anderson said copies of the contracts with banks handling
the auction bonds weren''t available. Anderson and Ronald
Greenberg, a first deputy director of the budget, said state
officials are in daily contact with bankers about auction bonds.
He declined to respond to questions about the shortage of
bidders since Feb. 12. </p>
<p>''''Contracts for handling auctions are written by broker
dealers and presented to issuers as part of a negotiated
transaction,'''' said Joseph Fichera, chief executive officer of
Saber Partners, a New York based adviser to companies and
governments. ''''They can be terminated or renegotiated, like any
contract.'''' </p>
<p>Fichera, a financial adviser to the New York State
Dormitory Authority, declined to comment on the state''s bonds. </p>
<p>There is precedent for broker-dealer agreements that don''t
pay banks a fee when auctions fail. </p>
<p>After auctions failed to attract enough bidders in 1990 for
bonds of Tucson Electric Power Co., now a unit of Unisource
Energy Corp. (UNS), Fichera arranged a new contract that rewarded
bankers with a higher fee for selling bonds that resulted in a
lower auction rate, and no fee if bonds sold at the highest
permitted rate. </p>

<p>Credit-default swaps tied to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS),
Merrill Lynch  Co. and Lehman Brothers reached the highest

''''market disruptions.'''' Goldman, the most profitable securities
firm, late yesterday reported a 39 percent increase in hard-to-value assets, and some analysts have scrapped their earnings
estimates for Merrill Lynch and are now predicting a first-quarter loss. </p>
<p>''''When the banks report in the next couple of weeks, there''s
going to be a reminder to a lot of investors that there''s more
damage to balance sheets beyond structured finance, beyond
leveraged finance,'''' said Ricardo Kleinbaum, a credit analyst at
BNP Paribas in New York. ''''It''s extending to a broader range of
credit classes.'''' </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps on Goldman climbed 8 basis points to
133 basis points, Phoenix prices show. They earlier reached
140 basis points, the highest since March 31. Lehman contracts
climbed 17 basis points to 212 and traded as high as 217, Phoenix
prices show. New York-based Merrill, which is scheduled to report
earnings April 17, rose 15 basis points to 200. </p>
<h2>$245 Billion </h2>
<p>Credit-default swaps, financial instruments based on bonds
or loans, were conceived to protect bondholders by paying the
buyer face value in exchange for the underlying securities should
the borrower default. A decrease in the price indicates improving
perceptions of credit quality, an increase shows deterioration. </p>
<p>The world''s largest banks and securities firms have reported
$245 billion of asset writedowns and credit losses amid record
home foreclosures and a loss of investor confidence in so-called
structured securities linked to home loans. The housing turmoil
triggered a collapse of the subprime mortgage market and spread
to debt once considered among the safest, including commercial
paper backed by assets such as mortgage securities. </p>
<p>Goldman Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein told
investors today that the credit crisis is nearing an end. </p>
<p>''''We''re closer to the end than the beginning,'''' Blankfein,
53, said today at the company''s annual shareholder meeting in New
York. ''''We''re maybe at the end of the third quarter, or the
beginning of the fourth.'''' </p>
<h2>Money-Market Funds </h2>
<p>New York-based Lehman, the fourth-biggest securities firm,
recorded a $300 million loss from the bailout of five short-term
debt funds, according to a person familiar with the writedown.
Lehman''s actions followed a $780 million charge by Credit Suisse
Group in February after the Zurich-based firm bought assets from
its money-market funds that had fallen in value because of a
freeze in some commercial paper markets. </p>
<p>Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Legg Mason Inc. also have propped
up money-market funds and General Electric Co.''s GE Asset
Management liquidated a short-term bond fund in November after it
lost about $225 million. </p>
<p>Most of the funds held commercial paper and medium-term
notes issued by structured investment vehicles, which were shut
out of debt markets last year amid concern that some of them
bought securities linked to subprime mortgages. </p>
<p>Goldman, also based in New York, disclosed in a regulatory
filing yesterday that its so-called Level 3 assets, those hardest
to value, jumped to $96.4 billion at the end of February, with
the ratio to total assets rising to 8.1 percent from 6.2 percent. </p>
<h2>Asian Markets </h2>
<p>''''Investors don''t like the uncertainty that it brings to
balance sheets,'''' said Mark Bayley, director of credit and
structuring at ABN Amro Holding NV in Sydney. ''''It indicates a
deterioration of liquidity and transparency in the markets.'''' </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps on the Markit CDX North America
Investment Grade Index, linked to the debt of 125 companies in
the U.S. and Canada, fell 2 basis point to 122 basis points as of
2:59 p.m. in New York, according to Phoenix Partners. The index
earlier reached 130 basis points, the widest since April 1. The
Markit iTraxx Europe index fell 0.5 basis point to 104.5 basis
points in London, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) </p>
<p>In Asia, the Markit iTraxx Japan index rose 16 basis points
to 120 basis points, according to Morgan Stanley. The benchmark
gauge of credit risk has erased almost half its decline this
month. </p>
<h2>Bear Stearns </h2>
<p>The iTraxx and CDX indexes reached record highs last month
after a cash squeeze at Bear Stearns Cos., the fifth-biggest U.S.
securities firm, prompted the Federal Reserve to back an
emergency sale of the firm to JPMorgan Chase  Co. </p>
<p>The Fed''s intervention in the Bear Stearns crisis on March
14, and its creation of a new lending facility designed to
prevent other banks from collapsing, eased investor concern and
sent credit-default swaps plunging from their record highs. The
North American investment-grade index reached a record 198.5
basis points on March 14, according to CMA Datavision in London. </p>
<p>''''I think we''re going to settle into a range here for a
little bit; the market needs to figure out what it wants to do
next,'''' said Ashish Shah, head of credit strategy at Lehman
Brothers in New York. ''''The good news is that you are going
through the de-levering process as banks and brokers try to shed
assets they don''t want and continue to raise capital.'''' </p>

<p>''''Wall-E,'''' the movie about a trash-compacting robot, may end a slide in U.S. box-office sales for
Walt Disney Co. (DIS) and its Pixar animation studio. </p>
<p>The film, opening in about 4,000 theaters today, probably
will exceed Pixar''s 2007 release ''''Ratatouille,'''' which garnered
$47 million in its first weekend, according to Steve Mason, an
analyst in Los Angeles at FantasyMoguls.com, a box-office Web
site. He estimated weekend sales of $55 million. </p>
<p>Disney, which bought Pixar in 2006, needs a hit to climb
from last place among the largest studios in 2008 U.S. sales.
''''The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian'''' missed Box Office
Mojo LLC''s $86.9 million estimate last month, taking in $55
million in its opening weekend. Through June 22, Disney''s
domestic ticket sales dropped 36 percent to $457.4 million,
according to the Burbank, California-based film tracker. </p>
<p>''''`Wall-E'' translates well around the world because of the
physical comedy and emotional aspects,'''' Mark Zoradi, president
of Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures Group, said in an
interview. ''''Nothing binds it to the United States. It''s a
creative project that will work in 100 countries around the
world.'''' </p>
<p>The movie from ''''Finding Nemo'''' creator Andrew Stanton
follows Wall-E, short for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class, who clears garbage left by humans who fled the planet to
live on space ships. He falls in love with another robot, Eve,
the Extra-terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator sent to Earth to look
for signs of life. </p>
<p>`Love Story'' </p>
<p>The film may take in as much as $210 million in ticket
sales during its U.S. run, said David Joyce, an analyst at
Miller Tabak  Co. in New York, who recommends shares of
Burbank, California-based Disney and doesn''t own them. That
would pass the $206 million of ''''Ratatouille,'''' according to
Internet Movie Database Inc., a unit of Amazon.com Inc. that
provides film data. </p>
<p>''''`Wall-E'' boasts the best love story I''ve seen in 2008,''''
said Gitesh Pandya, editor of industry newsletter
BoxOfficeGuru.com in New York. ''''Word of mouth will be terrific
with all ages and this will last a long time.'''' </p>
<p>Disney, the second-largest U.S. media company, rose 4 cents
to $31.57 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares have slipped 2.2 percent this year, compared
with a 13 percent drop in the SP 500 Index. </p>
<h2>2003 Peak </h2>
<p>Since 2003''s ''''Finding Nemo,'''' the No. 2 animated film of
all time according to Box Office Mojo, each Pixar release has
produced lower U.S. box-office sales, a benchmark for subsequent
sales of DVDs and television revenue. </p>
<p>''''U.S. box office is the most important factor in
anticipating all the other ancillary revenue streams,'''' said
David Davis, founder of Arpeggio Partners LLC, a Santa Monica,
California-based consultant to Hollywood studios. ''''It''s not the
only factor, but it''s the best indicator.'''' </p>
<p>U.S. box-office sales for Pixar, which Disney bought for
$8.06 billion, peaked in 2003 with ''''Finding Nemo,'''' which was
produced for $94 million and took in $340 million, according to
Internet Movie Database. ''''Ratatouille'''' cost $150 million,
while ''''Wall-E'''' cost $120 million, IMDB said. </p>
<p>''''The jury is still out'''' on the Pixar purchase, said Tuna Amobi, an analyst at Standard  Poor''s in New York who
recommends Disney shares and doesn''t own them. ''''It was a hefty
price, no doubt about it. Disney is looking at it as a marathon,
not a sprint.'''' </p>
<h2>Fewer Films </h2>
<p>Since buying Pixar, Disney has cut film production overall,
betting it could boost profit by making fewer, more popular
movies. Last year, filmed entertainment generated profit of $1.2
billion, a sixfold increase over two years, on slightly lower
sales of $7.49 billion. </p>
<p>The company produced 13 films last year, down from 17 in
2005, and will release 11 in 2008. </p>
<p>This year is proving tougher. Through the first half of
fiscal 2008, studio profit rose 6.5 percent to $891 million,
while sales gained 6.7 percent to $4.46 billion. For the year
ending in September, the unit''s profit is likely to fall 1
percent to $1.19 billion, as sales dip 1.8 percent to $7.36
billion, according to Michael Nathanson, an analyst with Sanford
C. Bernstein  Co. in New York. </p>
<p>Robert Iger, Disney''s chief executive officer, said last
month at an investor conference that Hollywood makes too many
movies. </p>
<p>''''It shouldn''t surprise anybody in the business why there
is so much failure and why the returns on investment are so
modest,'''' Iger said. </p>
<p>The following table ranks Pixar movies by their worldwide
box-office sales. Figures are in millions of dollars. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world''s largest
software maker, is being probed by Taiwan''s Fair Trade Commission
after an activist group filed a complaint saying consumers are
being forced to buy its Windows Vista operating system. </p>
<p>''''We have received the complaint and are now conducting our
own investigation, which may last around six months,'''' Chou Ya-shu, the antitrust regulator''s spokeswoman, said in a telephone
interview today. Microsoft can face fines of as much as NT$25
million ($796,000) and be ordered to halt illicit practices if
found guilty of fair-trade breaches, she said. </p>
<p>Sophia Chang, a spokeswoman for Microsoft in Taipei, denied
the company forces people to buy Vista and declined to comment
further on the case. </p>
<p>Microsoft should be fined for using its monopoly to force
consumers to adopt Vista after the company ended sales of Windows
XP in June, Taiwan''s Consumer Foundation, a non-profit group,
said in its complaint posted on its Web site on Aug. 15. </p>
<p>Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, stopped selling XP
individually and pre-installing the operating system in most
computers in June to spur Vista sales. Vista, which was released
for consumers in January last year, requires more memory capacity
and greater processing power than XP. </p>
<p>''''It would be a very unusual and creative interpretation of
antitrust law to say that a company is obliged to keep selling a
product,'''' said Brendon Carr, an attorney who advises
multinational companies on antitrust issues at the law firm Hwang
Mok Park in Seoul. </p>
<h2>Demand For XP </h2>
<p>The Consumer Foundation said its research showed 56 percent
of consumers buying a computer with Vista would reinstall XP,
while 67 percent oppose Microsoft ending the sale of the earlier
operating system. Windows XP remains available preinstalled in
some low-cost computers such as Acer Inc. (2353)''s Aspire One laptop. </p>
<p>Under Taiwan''s Fair Trade Act, a company may not ''''use
incentives or other devious means to induce a business to alter a
consumer''s shopping choices,'''' the foundation said in the
statement. </p>
<p>''''The Fair Trade Commission should fine Microsoft a large
enough amount that would strip away its profits from selling
Vista,'''' the foundation said. </p>

<p>Maguire Properties Inc., down 37 percent since Sept. 12;
Glimcher Realty Trust (GRT), down 22 percent; and Education Realty Trust
Inc. (EDR), down 9.8 percent, are among the real estate investment
trusts that, like General Growth, face debt repayment deadlines
through 2009. General Growth has dropped 65 percent since Sept.
12, the last trading day before New York-based securities firm
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection. </p>
<p>''''There is a general fear of real estate,'''' said Raphael Bostic, a real estate finance professor at the University of
Southern California and former Federal Reserve senior economist.
''''The business strategy very much relies on a liquid financing
market, and that just doesn''t exist right now. So when you rely on
that kind of strategy, you''re at risk of that excess volatility.'''' </p>
<p>General Growth shares tumbled on investors'' concern that the
Chicago-based company wouldn''t be able to refinance about $1.2
billion of debt it has coming due this year, said Rich Moore, an
analyst at RBC Capital Markets in Cleveland. Then they fell
further after company executives reported they had sold 5.67
million of their own shares for $112.5 million since Aug. 1. </p>
<p>`Poster Child'' </p>
<p>General Growth shares today rose $2.08, or 27 percent, to
$9.67 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading after the
company announced it had fired Chief Financial Officer Bernard Freibaum and suspended dividends. Freibaum was replaced by Chief
Accounting Officer Edmund Hoyt until a permanent successor is
found, the company said. General Growth will stop paying dividends
because of ''''uncertainty and volatility in the capital markets.'''' </p>
<p>If credit markets stay frozen, a similar fate may await other
REITs whose cash flow hasn''t yet caught up with expensive loans
financing acquisitions made as prices peaked, Moore said. </p>
<p>General Growth, whose troubles stem from the $11.3 billion
purchase of Rouse Co. in 2004, is the ''''poster child'''' for REITs
that are highly leveraged and have loans reaching maturity soon,
said Moore and Mathew Kirschner, an investment analyst at New
York-based REIT investor Cohen  Steers (CNS) Inc. No other U.S. REIT
has close to as much debt reaching maturity as soon as General
Growth, Kirschner said. </p>
<p>General Growth Chief Executive Officer John Bucksbaum called
the company''s share drop a ''''tremendous overreaction'''' by
investors and said in an interview last month that he has ''''every
confidence'''' debt coming due this year will be refinanced. </p>
<h2>Short Selling </h2>
<p>Proxy adviser Glass, Lewis  Co. this week criticized the
company for asking the New York Stock Exchange to ban short
selling of its shares even as executives, not including Bucksbaum,
sold 2.44 million of their own shares. </p>
<p>''''You''re going to have a lot of companies that had prudent
approaches that are going to be caught in this wave,'''' Bostic
said. ''''It really affects how investors view these companies.'''' </p>
<p>Like General Growth, companies such as Maguire, the largest
landlord in downtown Los Angeles, and shopping-mall owner Glimcher
are leveraged enough to worry investors who expect the troubles
afflicting lenders to continue, Moore said. </p>
<p>''''You really have to look at it on a case-by-case basis,''''
said Scott Black, founder and president of Delphi Management Inc.
in Boston, which has about $1.4 billion under management and is
considering buying shares of apartment and medical REITs. </p>
<p>REITs are ''''definitely affected by the lack of credit
availability in the banking system,'''' Black said. ''''But you better
look at when the debts are coming due.'''' </p>
<h2>Maguire Properties </h2>
<p>Glimcher shares are down 41 percent this year and Maguire''s
are down 78 percent. The drops are greater than the 15 percent
decline in the Bloomberg REIT Index and the 25 percent drop in the
Standard  Poor''s 500 Index. </p>
<p>In addition to General Growth, Los Angeles-based Maguire is
most at risk, Moore said. The company, which owns 30 office
properties in Southern California and one in Denver, plunged as it
reported losses, replaced the chief executive officer, and was
criticized by investors who wanted Maguire to put itself up for
sale. </p>
<p>Maguire has an 89 percent implied leverage, making it the
most highly leveraged of the 15 office REITs tracked by Green
Street Advisors Inc., the Newport Beach, California-based research
company said in a report last month. </p>
<p>The debts are the result of Maguire''s $2.88 billion purchase
last year of 24 office properties and 11 development sites from
Blackstone Group LP. (BX) The purchase encompassed all of the real
estate in downtown Los Angeles and Orange County that Blackstone
acquired in its takeover of Equity Office Properties Trust, and
came shortly before the collapse of the subprime mortgage industry
boosted office vacancies in Orange County. </p>
<h2>Debt Coming Due </h2>
<p>''''That was financed all with debt, and it was a big
percentage expansion to their portfolio, so it was definitely the
thing that put them in the position they''re in today,'''' said
Michael Knott, a senior analyst at Green Street, which has a
''''sell'''' rating on Maguire''s stock. </p>
<p>Maguire, as of June 30, had 11 percent of its total debt
coming due by the end of 2009, including $244.2 million in
construction loans and other debt maturing this year and $301.8
million in floating-rate debt, construction loans and other debt
coming due next year, according to the company. </p>
<p>The company said this week it extended maturities until 2010
on two construction loans totaling $49.1 million, completed a $100
million financing secured by a hotel, office and retail complex in
Pasadena, California, and extended until Sept. 28, 2009, the
maturity on an Orange County office construction loan. </p>
<h2>Shopping Malls </h2>
<p>''''We are mindful of the near-term maturities and are working
to extend those accordingly,'''' Maguire spokeswoman Peggy Moretti
said in an interview. The company is ''''in ongoing discussions''''
with its lenders and the ''''recent meltdown does not affect those
discussions,'''' she said. </p>
<p>Green Street calculates leverage using the current market
value of a company''s assets. Columbus, Ohio-based Glimcher is 65
percent leveraged, more than any other shopping-mall REIT the
research company tracks except Chattanooga, Tennessee-based CBL 
Associates Properties Inc. (CBL), which also has debt equaling 65
percent of its net asset value. CBL shares have declined 39
percent this year. Green Street has a ''''sell'''' rating on the
shares of both CBL and Glimcher. </p>
<h2>Loan Financings </h2>
<p>Glimcher has two loans totaling $92 million maturing this
year, and is working on restructuring one loan and refinancing the
other, said Lisa Indest, the company''s vice president for finance
and accounting, in an e-mail. In 2009, Glimcher has a $30 million
loan maturing on a mall it''s selling, a $46 million loan that''s
under discussion with lenders, and a line of credit with a June 30
balance of $297 million that can be extended one year, she said. </p>
<p>''''We feel the 2008 and 2009 maturities are manageable,''''
Indest said. </p>
<p>CBL said last week it refinanced $288.1 million of debt and
secured an $85 million term loan, satisfying all of its remaining
debt maturities for 2008. </p>
<p>''''It''s a tough environment, but this year we''ve been able to
work through it, and we expect that to continue,'''' CBL President
Stephen Lebovitz said in an interview. Refinancing the $400
million in mortgages maturing in 2009 probably will give CBL
additional cash because its malls have risen in value, he said.
''''Most of these loans have been in place for seven to 10 years, so
the cash flow has increased considerably over that time.'''' </p>
<h2>Resistant to Recession </h2>
<p>Among REITs that own apartment buildings, the company with
the highest 2008 and 2009 funding requirements as a percentage of
total assets is Memphis, Tennessee-based Education Realty Trust,
which develops and manages college student housing in 21 states.
The company has loans equivalent to more than 30 percent of its
total assets coming due in 2009, and ''''stands out as the most at
risk to a continued freeze-up in the credit markets,'''' Green
Street said in an August report. </p>
<p>Education Realty executives wouldn''t comment on the company''s
debt, outside spokesman Brad Cohen of ICR Inc. said. </p>
<p>While student housing is more resistant to recession than
other parts of the real estate industry, Education Realty''s
properties tend to be farther from campus than rival American
Campus Communities Inc. (ACC)''s housing, making them less attractive to
both renters and lenders, said Green Street analyst Andy McCulloch. He has a ''''hold'''' rating on the shares of both
companies. American Campus''s shares are up 20 percent this year,
compared with the 11 percent drop in Education Realty. </p>
<h2>Freddie and Fannie </h2>
<p>Education Realty is in a better position than some REITs
seeking financing because the loans it will need are relatively
small, and Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae have given indications that
they will continue to finance the development of apartment
buildings, giving the company a potential source of funds,
McCulloch said. </p>
<p>''''The fact that Fannie and Freddie are out there puts them in
a little better situation than some of these companies, that''s for
sure,'''' he said. </p>
<p>The only U.S. REITs with debt-to-asset-value ratios that
alarm Kirschner of Cohen  Steers, which has about $27 billion
under management, are Maguire and General Growth. General Growth
not only has ''''high leverage, but they have short-term
maturities,'''' he said. </p>
<p>''''Generally speaking, REITs operate at conservative leverage
levels,'''' Kirschner said. ''''Absent the General Growths of the
world, the REITs are in pretty good shape.'''' </p>

<p>Two top executives from Goldman Sachs
Group Inc.''s (GS) special situations group, which invests in
distressed businesses, have left the company, according to a
person familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>Nick Weber, 36, who was co-head of the European special
situations group in London, and Alan Waxman, 34, who helped run
the Americas team from New York, both left the company recently,
the person said. They reported to Rich Ruzika, the New York-based
global head of the group. The three didn''t respond to calls
seeking comment. </p>
<p>The special situations group is contained within Goldman''s
fixed-income, currencies and commodities division, the company''s
largest by revenue. SSG, as it''s known, became a major
contributor to revenue over the last 10 years by reaping gains on
investments ranging from a Korean liquor maker, Japanese golf
courses and a Texas wind-power company. While SSG''s overall
performance isn''t made public, some of its one-time gains and
losses are included in company disclosures. </p>
<p>Some analysts and investors expect that Goldman''s ability to
make large, illiquid investments will be limited after the firm''s
September conversion into a bank holding company and the U.S.
government''s $10 billion investment under its financial-rescue
program. While the special situations group''s sale of Horizon
Wind Energy LLC last year helped generate a $900 million profit,
falling asset values this year are expected to cause a loss from
investments in the fourth quarter that ended in November. </p>
